lois mcmaster bujold the curse of chalion acknowledgments the author would like to thank professor william d phillips jr for history the most useful four hundred dollars and ten weeks i ever spent in school pat oh cmon itll be fun wrede for the letter game that first drew the protocazaril blinking and stumbling from my backbrain into the light of day and i suppose the utility companies of minneapolis for that hot shower one cold february where the first two items collided unexpectedly in my head to create a new world and all the people in it chapter cazaril heard the mounted horsemen on the road before he saw them he glanced over his shoulder the wellworn track behind him curled up around a rolling rise what passed for a hill on these high windy plains before dipping again into the latewinter muck of baocias bony soil at his feet a little rill too small and intermittent to rate a culvert or a bridge trickled greenly across the track from the sheepcropped pastures above the thump of hooves jangle of harness clink of bells creak of gear and careless echo of voices came on at too quick a rhythm to be some careful farmer with a team or parsimonious packmen driving their mules the cavalcade trotted around the side of the rise riding two by two in full panoply of their order some dozen men not banditscazaril let out his breath and swallowed his unsettled stomach back down not that he had anything to offer bandits but sport he trudged a little way off the track and turned to watch them pass the horsemens chain shirts were silvered glinting in the watery morning sunlight for show not for use their tabards of blue dyes almost matching one with another were worked with white in the sigil of the lady of spring their gray cloaks were thrown back like banners in the breeze of their passing pinned at their shoulders with silver badges that had all the tarnish polished off today soldierbrothers of ceremony not of war they would have no desire to get cazarils stubborn bloodstains on those clothes to cazarils surprise their captain held up a hand as they came near the column crashed raggedly to a halt the squelch and suck of the hooves trailing off in a way that would have had cazarils fathers old horsemaster bellowing grievous and entertaining insults at such a band of boys as this well no matter you there old fellow the leader called across the saddlebow of his bannercarrier at cazaril cazaril alone on the road barely kept his head from swiveling around to see who was being so addressed they took him for some local farm lout trundling to market or on some errand and he supposed he looked the part worn boots mudweighted a thick jumble of mismatched charity clothes keeping the chill southeast wind from freezing his bones he was grateful to all the gods of the years turning for every grubby stitch of that fabric eh two weeks of beard itching his chin fellow indeed the captain might with justice have chosen more scornful appellations but old the captain pointed down the road to where another track crossed it is that the road to valenda it had been cazaril had to stop and count it in his head and the sum dismayed him seventeen years since he had ridden last down this road going off not to ceremony but to real war in the provincar of baocias train although bitter to be riding a gelding and not a finer warhorse hed been just as glossyhaired and young and arrogant and vain of his dress as the fine young animals up there staring down at him today i should be happy for a donkey though i had to bend my knees to keep from trailing my toes in the mud cazaril smiled back up at the soldierbrothers fully aware of what hollowedout purses lay gaping and disemboweled behind most of those rich facades they stared down their noses at him as though they could smell him from there he was not a person they wished to impress no lord or lady who might hand down largesse to them as they might to him still he would do for them to practice their aristocratic airs upon they mistook his returning stare for admiration perhaps or maybe just for halfwittedness he bit back the temptation to steer them wrong up into some sheep byre or wherever that deceptively broadlooking crossroad petered out no trick to pull on the daughters own guardsmen on the eve of the daughters day and besides the men who joined the holy military orders were not especially noted for their senses of humor and he might pass them again being bound for the same town himself cazaril cleared his throat which hadnt spoken to a man since yesterday no captain the road to valenda has a royas milestone or it had once a mile or three farther on you cant mistake it he pulled a hand out of the warmth of the folds of his coat and waved onward his fingers didnt really straighten right and he found himself waving a claw the chill air bit his swollen joints and he tucked his hand hastily back into its burrow of cloth the captain nodded at his bannercarrier a thickshouldered fellow who cradled his banner pole in the crook of his elbow and fumbled out his purse he fished in it looking no doubt for a coin of sufficiently small denomination he had a couple brought up to the light between his fingers when his horse jinked a coina gold royal not a copper vaidaspurted out of his grip and spun down into the mud he stared after it aghast but then controlled his features he would not dismount in front of his fellows to grub in the muck and retrieve it not like the peasant he expected cazaril to be for consolation he raised his chin and smiled sourly waiting for cazaril to dive frantically and amusingly after this unexpected windfall instead cazaril bowed and intoned may the blessings of the lady of spring fall upon your head young sir in the same spirit as your bounty to a roadside vagabond and as little begrudged if the young soldierbrother had had more wits about him he might well have unraveled this mockery and cazaril the seemingpeasant drawn a wellearned horsewhip across his face little enough chance of that judging by the brothers bulllike stare though the captains lips twisted in exasperation but the captain just shook his head and gestured his column onward if the bannerbearer was too proud to scramble in the mud cazaril was much too tired to he waited till the baggage train a gaggle of servants and mules bringing up the rear had passed before crouching painfully down and retrieving the little spark from the cold water seeping into a horses print the adhesions in his back pulled cruelly gods i do move like an old man he caught his breath and heaved to his feet feeling a century old feeling like road dung stuck to the boot heel of the father of winter as he made his way out of the world he polished the mud off the coinlittle enough even if goldand pulled out his own purse now there was an empty bladder he dropped the thin disk of metal into the leather mouth and stared down at its lonely glint he sighed and tucked the pouch away now he had a hope for bandits to steal again now he had a reason to fear he reflected on his new burden so great for its weight as he stumped up the road in the wake of the soldierbrothers almost not worth it almost gold temptation to the weak weariness to the wise what was it to a dulleyed bull of a soldier embarrassed by his accidental largesse cazaril gazed around the barren landscape not much in the way of trees or coverts except in that distant watercourse over there the bare branches and brambles lining it charcoalgray in the hazy light the only shelter anywhere in sight was an abandoned windmill on the height to his left its roof fallen in and its vanes broken down and rotting still just in case cazaril swung off the road and began trudging up the hill hillock compared to the mountain passes hed traversed a week ago the climb still stole his wind almost he turned back the gusts up here were stronger flowing over the ground riffling the silvergold tufts of winters dry grasses he nipped out of the raw air into the mills shadowed darkness and mounted a dubious and shaking staircase winding partway up the inner wall he peered out the shutterless window on the road below a man belabored a brown horse back along the track no soldierbrother one of the servants with his reins in one hand and a stout cudgel in the other sent back by his master to secretly shake the accidental coin back out of the hide of the roadside vagabond he rode up around the curve then in a few minutes back again he paused at the muddy rill turned back and forth in his saddle to peer around the empty slopes shook his head in disgust and spurred on to join his fellows again cazaril realized he was laughing it felt odd unfamiliar a shudder through his shoulders that wasnt cold or shock or gutwringing fear and the strange hollow absence of what corrosive envy ardent desire he didnt want to follow the soldierbrothers didnt even want to lead them anymore didnt want to be them hed watched their parade as idly as a man watching a dumbshow in the marketplace gods i must be tired hungry too it was still a quarterdays walk to valenda where he might find a moneylender who could change his royal for more useful copper vaidas tonight by the blessing of the lady he might sleep in an inn and not a cow byre he could buy a hot meal he could buy a shave a bath he turned his eyes adjusted now to the half shadows in the mill then he saw the body splayed out on the rubblestrewn floor he froze in panic but then breathed again when he saw the body didnt no live man could lie unmoving in that strange backbent position cazaril felt no fear of dead men whatever had made them dead now despite the corpses stillness cazaril scooped up a loose cobble from the floor before approaching it a man plump middleaged judging from the gray in his neatly trimmed beard the face under the beard was swollen and empurpled strangled there were no marks showing on his throat his clothing was sober but very fine yet ill fitting tight and pulled about the brown wool gown and black sleeveless vestcloak edged with silverembroidered cord might be the garb of a rich merchant or minor lord with austere tastes or of a scholar with ambition not a farmer or artisan in any case nor soldier the hands mottled purpleyellow and swollen also lacked calluses lackedcazaril glanced at his own left hand where the two missing finger ends testified to the illadvisedness of arguing with a grappling ropelacked damage the man bore no ornaments at all no chains or rings or seals to match his rich dress had some scavenger been here before cazaril cazaril gritted his teeth bending for a closer look a motion punished by the pulls and aches in his own body not ill fitted and not fatthe body was unnaturally swollen too like the face and hands but anyone that far gone in decay ought to have filled this dreary shelter with his stench enough to have choked cazaril when hed first ducked through the broken door no scents here but some musky perfume or incense tallow smoke and claycold sweat cazaril discarded his first thought that the poor fellow had been robbed and murdered on the road and dragged up here out of sight as he looked over the cleared patch of hardpacked dirt floor around the man five candle stumps burned to puddles blue red green black white little piles of herbs and ash all kicked about now a dark and broken pile of feathers that resolved itself in the shadows as a dead crow its neck twisted a moments further search turned up the dead rat that went with it its little throat cut rat and crow sacred to the bastard god of all disasters out of season tornadoes earthquakes droughts floods miscarriages and murders wanted to compel the gods did you the fool had tried to work death magic by the look of it and paid death magics customary price alone touching nothing cazaril levered himself to his feet and took a turn around both the inside and the outside of the sagging mill no packs no cloaks or possessions dumped in a corner a horse or horses had been tied up on the side opposite the road recently by dampness of their droppings but they were gone now cazaril sighed this was no business of his but it was impious to leave a man dead and abandoned to rot without ceremony the gods alone knew how long it would be till someone else found him he was clearly a welltodo man thoughsomeone would be looking not the sort to disappear tracelessly and unmissed like a ragged vagabond cazaril set aside the temptation to slide back down to the road and go off pretending hed never seen the man cazaril set off down the track leading from the back side of the mill there ought to be a farmhouse at the end of it people something but hed not walked more than a few minutes before he met a man leading a donkey loaded high with brush and wood climbing up around the curve the man stopped and eyed him suspiciously the lady of spring give you good morning sir said cazaril politely what harm was in it for cazaril to sir a farmer hed kissed the scaly feet of lesser men by far in the abject terrified slavery of the galleys the man after an appraising look gave him a half salute and a mumbled byerlady do you live hereabouts aye the man said he was middleaged well fed his hooded coat like cazarils shabbier one plain but serviceable he walked as though he owned the land he stood on though probably not much more i ah cazaril pointed back up the track id stepped off the road a moment to take shelter in that mill up thereno need to go into details of what hed been sheltering fromand i found a dead man aye the man said cazaril hesitated wishing he hadnt dropped his cobble you know about him saw his horse tied up there this morning oh he might have gone on down the road after all with no harm done have you any idea who the poor fellow was the farmer shrugged and spat hes not from around here is all i can say i had our divine of the temple up soon as i realized what sort of bad doings had been going on there last night she took away all the fellows goods that would come loose to hold till called for his horse is in my barn a fair trade aye for the wood and oil to speed him out the divine said he darent be left till nightfall he gestured to the highpiled load of burnables hitched to the donkeys back gave the halter rope a tug and started up the track again cazaril fell into step beside him do you have any idea what the fellow was doing asked cazaril plain enough what he was doing the farmer snorted and got what he deserved for it um or who he was doing it to no idea ill leave it to the temple i do wish he hadnt done it on my land dropping his bad luck all over like to haunt the place hereafter ill purge him with fire and burn down that cursed wreck of a mill at the same time aye no good to leave it standing its too close to the road attractshe eyed cazariltrouble cazaril paced along for another moment finally he asked you plan to burn him with his clothes on the farmer studied him sideways summing up the poverty of his garb im not touching anything of his i wouldnt have taken the horse except its no charity to turn the poor beast loose to starve cazaril said more hesitantly would you mind if i took the clothes then im not the one as you need to ask aye deal with him if you dare i wont stop you ill help you lay him out the farmer blinked now that would be welcome cazaril judged the farmer was secretly more than pleased to leave the corpse handling to him perforce cazaril had to leave the farmer to pile up the bigger logs for the pyre built inside the mill though he offered a few mild suggestions how to place them to gain the best draft and be most sure of taking down what remained of the building he helped carry in the lighter brush the farmer watched from a safe distance as cazaril undressed the corpse tugging the layered garments off over the stiffened limbs the man was swollen further even than hed appeared at first his abdomen puffing out obscenely when cazaril finally pulled his fine embroidered cotton undershirt from him it was rather frightening but it couldnt be contagion after all not with this uncanny lack of smell cazaril wondered if the body werent burned by nightfall if it was likely to explode or rupture and if it did what would come out of it or enter into it he bundled up the clothing only a little stained as quickly as he could the shoes were too small and he left them he and the farmer together heaved the corpse onto the pyre when all was readied cazaril fell to his knees shut his eyes and chanted out the prayer for the dead not knowing which god had taken up the mans soul though he could make a shrewd guess he addressed all five of the holy family in turn speaking clearly and plainly all offerings must be ones best even if all one had to offer was words mercy from the father and the mother mercy from the sister and the brother mercy from the bastard five times mercy high ones we beseech you whatever sins the stranger had committed he had surely paid mercy high ones not justice please not justice we would all be fools to pray for justice when hed finished he climbed stiffly back to his feet and looked around thoughtfully he collected the rat and the crow and added their little corpses to the mans at his head and feet it was cazarils day for the gods own luck it seemed he wondered which kind it would prove to be this time a column of oily smoke rose from the burning mill as cazaril started up the road to valenda once more the dead mans clothes tied into a tight bundle on his back though they were less filthy than the clothes he wore he would he thought find a laundress and have them thoroughly cleaned before donning them his copper vaidas were dwindling sadly in his minds accounting but the services of a laundress would be worth them hed slept last night in a barn shivering in the straw his meal a half a loaf of stale bread the remaining half had been his breakfast it was nearly three hundred miles from the port city of zagosur on ibras mild coast to the middle of baocia centralmost province of chalion he hadnt been able to walk the distance nearly as quickly as hed calculated in zagosur the temple hospital of the mothers mercy was dedicated to the succor of men cast up in all the various ways they could be cast up by the sea the charity purse the acolytes there had given him had run thin then out altogether before hed reached his goal but only just before one more day hed figured less than a day if he could just put one foot in front of the other for one more day he might reach his refuge and crawl into it when hed started from ibra his head had been full of plans for how to ask the dowager provincara for a place for old times sake in her household at the foot of her table something anything at all so long as it was not too hard his ambition had dwindled as hed slogged east over the mountain passes into the cooler heights of the central plateau maybe her castle warder or her horsemaster would grant him a place in her stables or a place in her kitchen and he need not intrude upon the great lady at all if he could beg a place as a scullion he wouldnt even have to give his real name he doubted anyone was left in her household by now whod know him from the charmed days when hed served the late provincar dy baocia as a page the dream of a silent abashed place by the kitchen fire nameless not bellowed at by any creature more alarming than a cook for any task more dreadful than drawing water or carrying firewood had drawn him onward into the last of the winter winds the vision of rest drove him as an obsession that and the knowledge that every stride put another yard between himself and the nightmare of the sea hed bemused himself for hours on the lonely road revolving suitable new servile names for his new anonymous self but now it seemed he need not appear before the shocked eyes of her court dressed in poor mens castoffs after all instead cazaril begs a peasant for the clothes off a corpse and is grateful for both their favors is is most humbly grateful most humbly the town of valenda tumbled down over its low hill like a rich quilt worked in red and gold red for the tile roofs gold for the native stone both glowing in the sun cazaril blinked at the dazzle of color in his blurring eyes the familiar hues of his homeland the houses of ibra were all whitewashed too bright in their hot northern noons bleached and blinding this ochre sandstone was the perfect shade for a house a town a countrya caress upon the eyes at the top of the hill like a golden crown in truth the provincaras castle sprawled its curtain walls seeming to waver in his vision he stared at it daunted for a little then slogged onward his steps somehow going faster than hed been able to push them all this long journey despite the shaking aching weariness of his legs it was past the hour for the markets so the streets were quiet and serene as he threaded through them to the main square at the temple gate he approached an elderly woman who looked unlikely to try to follow and rob him and asked his way to a moneylender the moneylender filled his hand with a satisfying weight of copper vaidas in exchange for his tiny royal and directed him to the laundress and the public bath he paused on the way only long enough to buy an oil cake from a lone street vendor and devour it he poured out vaidas on the laundresss counter and negotiated the loan of a pair of linen drawstring trousers and a tunic together with a pair of straw sandals in which he might trot down the street through the nowmild afternoon to the baths in competently red hands she carried off all his vile clothing and his filthy boots the baths barber trimmed his hair and beard while he sat still in a real chair oh wonderful the bath boy served him tea and then it was back to the bath courtyard itself to stand on the flagstones and scrub himself all over with scented soap and wait for the bath boy to sluice him down with a bucket of warm water in joyous anticipation cazaril eyed the huge copperbottomed wooden tank that was sized for six men or women every other day but which by the happy chance of the hour he looked to have all to himself the brazier underneath kept the water steaming he could soak there all afternoon while the laundress boiled his clothing the bath boy climbed the stool and poured the water over his head while cazaril turned and sputtered under the stream he opened his eyes to find the boy staring at him mouth agape were you were you a deserter the boy choked out oh his back the ropy red mess of scars piled one across another so thickly as to leave no untouched skin between legacy of the last flogging the roknari galleymasters had given him here in the royacy of chalion army deserters were among the few criminals punished so savagely by that particular means no said cazaril firmly im not a deserter castoff certainly betrayed perhaps but hed never deserted a post not even his most disastrous ones the boy snapped his mouth shut dropped his wooden bucket with a clunk and scampered out cazaril sighed and made for the tank hed just lowered his aching body to the chin in the heavenly heat when the bath owner stomped into the tiny tiled courtyard out the owner roared out of there you cazaril recoiled in terror as the bath man seized him by the hair and dragged him bodily up out of the water what the man shoved his tunic and trousers and sandals at him all in a wad and dragged him fiercely by the arm out of the courtyard and into the front of the shop here wait what are you doing i cant go naked into the street the bath man wheeled him around and released him momentarily get dressed and get out i run a respectable place here not for the likes of you go down to the whorehouse or better still drown yourself in the river dazed and dripping cazaril fumbled the tunic over his head yanked up the trousers and tried to cram his feet back into the straw sandals while holding up the pants drawstring and being shoved again toward the door it slammed in his face as he turned realization dawning upon him the other crime punished by flogging near to death in the royacy of chalion was the rape of a virgin or a boy his face flushed hot but it wasntbut i didnti was sold to the corsairs of roknar he stood trembling he considered beating on the door and insisting those within listen to his explanations oh my poor honor the bath man was the bath boys father cazaril rather guessed he was laughing and crying teetering on the ragged edge of something that frightened him more than the outraged bath man he gulped for breath he had not the stamina for an argument and even if he could get them to listen why should they believe him he rubbed his eyes with the soft linen of his sleeve it had that sharp pleasant scent left only by the track of a good hot iron it tumbled him back to memories of life in houses not in ditches it seemed a thousand years ago defeated he turned and shuffled back up the street to the laundresss greenpainted door again its bell rang as he pushed timidly back inside have you a corner where i might sit maam he asked her when she popped back out at the bells summons i finished earlier than his voice died in muffled shame she shrugged sturdy shoulders ah aye come back with me wait she dived below her counter and came up with a small book the span of cazarils hand and bound in plain undyed leather heres your book youre lucky i checked your pockets or it would be a mucky mess by now believe you me startled cazaril picked it up it must have lain concealed in the thick cloth of the dead mans outer cloak he hadnt felt it when hed bundled the garment up so hastily back in the mill this ought to go to that divine of the temple with the rest of the dead mans possessions well im not walking it back there tonight thats certain he would return it as soon as he was able for now he merely said thank you maam to the laundress and followed her into a central court with a deep well similar to her neighbors of the bathhouse where a fire kept a cauldron on the boil and a quartet of young women scrubbed and splashed at the laundry tubs she gestured him to a bench by the wall and he sat down out of range of the splashes staring a while in a kind of disembodied bliss at the peaceful busy scene time was he would have scorned to eye a troupe of redfaced peasant girls saving his glances for the fine ladies how had he never realized how beautiful laundresses were strong and laughing moving like a dance and kind so kind so kind finally his hand moved in reawakened curiosity to look in the book it might bear the dead mans name solving a mystery he flipped it open to discover its pages covered in a thicket of handwriting with occasional little scratchy diagrams entirely in a cipher he blinked and bent more closely his eye beginning to take the cipher apart almost despite his own volition it was mirrorwriting and with a substitutionofletters systemthose could be tedious to break down but the chance of a short word three times repeated on the page handed him his key the merchant had chosen the most childish of ciphers merely shifting each letter one position and not troubling to shuffle his pattern thereafter except that this wasnt in the ibran language spoken in its various dialects in the royacies of ibra chalion and brajar it was in darthacan spoken in the southernmost provinces of ibra and great darthaca beyond the mountains and the mans handwriting was dreadful his spelling worse and his command of darthacan grammar apparently almost nonexistent this was going to be harder than cazaril had thought he would need paper and pen a quiet place time and a good light if he was to make head or tail of this mess well it might have been worse it might have been ciphered in bad roknari it was almost certainly the mans notes on his magic experiments however that much cazaril could tell enough to convict and hang him if he hadnt been dead already the punishments for practicingno for attemptingdeath magic were ferocious punishment for succeeding was generally considered redundant as there was no case cazaril knew of a magical assassination that had not cost the life of its caster whatever the link was by which the practitioner forced the bastard to let one of his demons into the world it always returned with two souls or none that being so there should have been another corpse made somewhere in baocia last night by its nature death magic wasnt very popular it did not allow substitutions or proxies in its doubleedged scything to kill was to be killed knife sword poison cudgel almost any other means was a better choice if one wanted to survive ones own murderous effort but in delusion or desperation men still attempted it from time to time this book must definitely be taken back to that rural divine for her to pass along to whatever superior of the gods temple ended up investigating the case for the royacy cazarils brow wrinkled and he sat up closing the frustrating volume the warm steam the rhythm of the womens work and voices and cazarils exhaustion tempted him to lie on his side curled up on the bench with the book pillowed under his cheek he would just close his eyes for a moment he woke with a start and a crick in his neck his fingers closing around an unexpected weight of wool one of the laundresses had thrown a blanket over him an involuntary sigh of gratitude escaped his throat at this careless grace he scrambled upright checking the lay of the light the courtyard was nearly all in shadow now he must have slept for most of the afternoon the sound waking him had been the thump of his cleaned and to the limit they would take it polished boots dropped from the laundresss hand she set the pile of cazarils folded clothing fine and disreputable both on the bench next to him remembering the bath boys reaction cazaril asked timorously have you a room where i might dress maam privately she nodded cordially and led him to a modest bedroom at the back of the house and left him western light poured through the little window cazaril sorted his clean laundry and eyed with aversion the shabby clothes hed been wearing for weeks an oval mirror on a stand in the corner the rooms richest ornament decided him tentatively with another prayer of thanks to the spirit of the departed man whose unexpected heir he had become he donned clean cotton trews the fine embroidered shirt the brown wool robewarm from the iron though the seams were still a trifle dampand finally the black vestcloak that fell in a rich profusion of cloth and glint of silver to his ankles the dead mans clothes were long enough if loose on cazarils gaunt frame he sat on the bed and pulled on his boots their heels lopsided and their soles worn to scarcely more than the thickness of parchment he had not seen himself in any mirror larger or better than a piece of polished steel for three years this one was glass and tilted to show himself quite half at a time from head to foot a stranger stared back at him five gods when did my beard go partgray he touched its shorttrimmed neatness with a trembling hand at least his newly scissored hair had not begun to retreat from his forehead much if cazaril had to guess himself merchant lord or scholar in this dress he would have to say scholar one of the more fanatic sort holloweyed and a little crazed the garments wanted chains of gold or silver seals a fine belt with studs or jewels thick rings with gleaming stones to proclaim him any rank higher and yet the flowing lines suited him he fancied he stood a little straighter in any case the roadside vagabond had vanished in any case here was not a man to beg a scullions place from a castle cook hed planned to buy a nights bed in an inn with the last of his vaidas and present himself to the provincara in the morning uneasily he wondered if gossip from the bath man had gotten round town very far yet and if he would be denied entry to any safe and respectable house now tonight go he would climb to the castle and find out if he might claim refuge or not i cannot bear another night of not knowing before the light failed before my heart fails he tucked the notebook back into the inside pocket of the black vestcloak that had apparently concealed it before leaving the vagabonds clothing in a pile on the bed he turned and strode from the room as he climbed the last slope to the main castle gate cazaril regretted hed had no way to provision himself with a sword the two guards in the greenandblack livery of the provincar of baocia watched his unarmed approach without alarm but also without any of the alert interest that might presage respect cazaril saluted the one wearing the sergeants badge in his hat with only an austere calculated nod the servility hed practiced in his mind was for some back gate not this one not if he expected to get any farther at least by the courtesy of his laundress hed been able to provision himself with the right names good evening sergeant i am here to see the castle warder the ser dy ferrej i am lupe dy cazaril leaving the sergeant to guess preferably wrongly if hed been summoned on what business sir the sergeant asked polite but unimpressed cazarils shoulders straightened he didnt know from what unused lumber room in the back of his soul the voice came but it came out clipped and commanding nonetheless on his business sergeant automatically the sergeant saluted yes sir his nod told off his fellow to stay sharp and he gestured cazaril to follow him through the open gate this way sir ill ask if the warder will see you cazarils heart wrung as he stared around the broad cobbled courtyard inside the castle gates hed worn out how much shoe leather scampering across these stones on errands for the high household the master of the pages had complained of bankruptcy in buskins till the provincara laughing had inquired if he would truly prefer a lazy page who would wear out the seat of his trousers instead for if so she could find a few to plague him with she still ran her household with a keen eye and a firm hand it appeared the liveries of the guards were in excellent condition the cobbles of this yard were swept clean and the small bare trees in tubs flanking the major doorways had flowers forced from bulbs gracing their feet blooming bright and fair and perfectly timed for the daughters day celebration tomorrow the guard gestured cazaril to wait upon a bench against a wall still blessedly warm from the days sun while he went to the side door leading to the office quarters and spoke to a house servant there who might or might not turn out the warder for this stranger hed not paced halfway back to his post before his comrade stuck his head around the gate to call the royse returns the sergeant turned his head toward the servants quarters to take up the bellow the royse returns look sharp there and quickened his march grooms and servants tumbled from various doors around the courtyard as a clatter of hooves and halloing voices sounded from outside the gates first through the stone arches with a selfsupplied fanfare of unladylike but triumphant whoops rode a pair of young women on blowing horses bellysplashed with mud we win teidez the first called over her shoulder she was dressed in a riding jacket of blue velvet with a matching blue wool split skirt her hair escaped from under a girls lace cap somewhat askew in ringlets neither blond nor red but a sort of glowing amber in the shaft of setting sunlight she had a generous mouth pale skin and curiously heavylidded eyes squeezed now with laughter her taller companion a panting brunette in red grinned and twisted in her saddle as the rest of the cavalcade followed an even younger gentleman in a short scarlet jacket worked with beasts in silver thread followed on an even more impressive horse glossy black with silken tail bannering he was flanked by two woodenfaced grooms and followed by a frowning gentleman he shared hissisters yes surelycurly hair a shade redder and wide mouth more pouting the race was over at the bottom of the hill iselle you cheated she made an oh pooh face at her royal brother before the scrambling servant could position the ladies mounting bench he was trying to bring to her she slid from her saddle bouncing on her booted toes her darkhaired companion also preceded her groom to the dismount and handed off her reins to him saying give these poor beasts an extra walk till they are quite cool deni we have misused them terribly somewhat belying her words she gave her horse a kiss on the middle of its white blaze and as it nudged her with practiced assurance slipped it some treat from her pocket last through the gate a couple of minutes behind came a redfaced older woman iselle betriz slow down mother and daughter you girls cannot gallop over half the hinterland of valenda like a pair of lunatics we are slowed down indeed were stopped the darkhaired girl pointed out logically we cannot outrun your tongue good heart no matter how we try it is too fast for the speediest horse in baocia the older woman made a moue of exasperation and waited for her groom to position her mounting bench your grandmother bought you that lovely white mule royesse why dont you ever ride him it would be so much more suitable and so much more sloooow the amberhaired girl laughing shot back and anyway poor snowflake is all washed and braided for the procession tomorrow the grooms would have been heartbroken if id taken him out and run him through the mud they plan to keep him wrapped in sheets all night wheezing the older woman allowed her groom to help her dismount afoot again she shook out her skirted legs and stretched her apparently aching back the boy departed in a cluster of anxious servants and the two young women uncrushed by their waiting womans continuing murmur of complaint raced each other to the door to the main keep she followed shaking her head as they approached the door a stoutish middleaged man in severe black wool exited and remarked to them in passing in a voice without rancor but perfectly firm betriz if ever you gallop your horse home uphill like that again i will take him from you and you can use up your excessive energy running after the royesse on foot she dropped him a swift curtsey and a daunted murmur of yes papa the amberhaired girl came instantly to attention please excuse betriz ser dy ferrej the fault was mine where i led she had no choice but to follow his brow twitched and he gave her a little bow then you might meditate royesse on what honor a captain can claim who drags his followers into an error when he knows he will himself escape the punishment the amberhaired girls wide lips twisted at this after a long glance up under her lashes she too dropped him a fraction of a curtsey before both girls escaped further chastisement by dodging indoors the man in black heaved a sigh the waiting woman laboring after them cast him a nod of thanks even without these cues cazaril could have identified the man as the castle warder by the clink of keys at his silverstudded belt and the chain of office around his neck he rose at once as the man approached him and essayed a cursedly awkward bow pulled short by his adhesions ser dy ferrej my name is lupe dy cazaril i beg an audience of the dowager provincara if if it is her pleasure his voice faltered under the warders frown i do not know you sir said the warder by the gods grace the provincara may remember me i was once a page herehe gestured around rather blindlyin this household when the old provincar was alive the closest thing to a home he had left he supposed cazaril was unutterably weary of being a stranger everywhere the gray brows rose i will inquire if the provincara will see you thats all i ask all he dared ask he sank back to his bench and wound his fingers together as the warder stumped back into the main keep after several miserable minutes of suspense stared at sidelong by passing servants cazaril looked up at the warders return dy ferrej eyed him with bemusement her grace the provincara grants you an interview follow me his body had stiffened sitting in the gathering chill cazaril stumbled a little and cursed his stumble as he followed the warder indoors he scarcely needed a guide the plan of the place came back to him tumbling through his memory with every turning through this hall across those blueandyellowpatterned tiles up this stair and that one through a whitewashed inner chamber and then the room on the western wall shed always favored for sitting in this time of day with the best light for her seamstresses or for reading he had to duck his head a little through its low door as hed never had to before it seemed the only change but not a change in the door here is the man as you bade your grace the warder announced cazaril neutrally declining to either endorse or deny his claimed identity the dowager provincara was seated in a wide wooden chair made soft for her aging bones with cushions she wore a sober dark green gown suitable to her highranked widowhood but declined a widows cap choosing instead to have her graying hair braided up around her head in two knots and twined with green ribbons locked with jeweled clasps she had a lady companion almost as old as herself seated by her side a widow also judging by the garb of a lay dedicat of the temple that she wore the companion clutched her needlework and regarded cazaril with an untrusting frown praying his body would not betray him now with some twitch or stumble cazaril levered himself down onto one knee before her chair and bowed his head in respectful greeting her clothes were scented with lavender and a dry oldwoman smell he looked up searching her face for some sign of recognition if she did not know him now then no one he would become in truth and swiftly she gazed back and bit her lip in wonder five gods she murmured softly it really is you my lord dy cazaril i bid you welcome to my house she held out her hand for him to kiss he swallowed almost gasping and bent his head over it once it had been fine and white the nails perfect and pearlrubbed now the knuckles stood out and the thin skin was brownspotted though the nails were still as well kept as when shed been a matron in her prime she did not by the smallest jerk react to the couple of tears he dropped helplessly upon its back but her lips curved up a little her hand drifted from his light grasp to touch his beard and trace one of the gray streaks dear me cazaril have i grown that old he blinked rapidly up at her he would not he would not break down weeping like an overwrought child it has been a long time your grace tsk her hand turned and the dry fingers tapped him on the cheek that was your cue to say i havent changed a bit didnt i teach you how to lie to a lady better than that i had no idea i was so remiss with perfect composure she retrieved her hand and nodded to her companion may i make you known to my cousin the lady dy hueltar tessa may i present my lord the castillar dy cazaril from the corner of his eye cazaril saw the warder with a breath of relief relax his guard folding his arms and leaning against the doorframe still on his knee cazaril made a clumsy bow in the dedicats direction you are all kindness your grace but as i no longer hold cazaril nor its keep nor any of my fathers lands i do not claim his title either dont be foolish castillar beneath her bantering tone her voice sharpened my dear provincar is dead these ten years but ill see the bastards demons eat the first man who dares to call me anything less than provincara we have what we can hold dear boy and never let them see you flinch or falter beside her the dedicat stiffened in disapproval of these blunt words if not perhaps of the sentiment behind them cazaril judged it imprudent to point out that the title by right now belonged to the provincaras daughterinlaw her son the present provincar and his wife likely judged it imprudent too you will always be the great lady to me your grace whom we worshipped from afar cazaril offered better she approved judiciously much better i do like a man who can pull his wits about him she waved at her warder dy ferrej fetch the castillar a chair one for yourself too you loom like a crow there the warder apparently accustomed to such addresses smiled and murmured certainly your grace he pulled up a carved chair for cazaril with a gratifying murmur of will my lord be seated and retrieved another for himself from the next chamber placing it a little apart from his lady and her guest cazaril scrambled up and sank down again in blessed comfort he ventured tentatively was that the royse and royesse i saw come in from riding as i arrived your grace i should not have troubled you with my intrusion had i known you had such visitors he would not have dared not visiting castillar they are living here with me for now valenda is a quiet clean town and my daughter is not entirely well it suits her to retire here after the toohectic court a weary look flickered in her eyes five gods the lady ista was here as well the dowager royina ista cazaril hastily corrected this thought when he had first come to serve baocia as unformed a larva as any boy of like degree the provincaras youngest daughter ista had seemed already a grown woman though only a few years older than himself fortunately even at that foolish age hed not been so foolish as to confide his hopeless infatuation of her to anyone else her high marriage soon after to roya ias himselfher first his secondhad seemed her beautys proper destiny despite the royal couples disparity of age cazaril supposed istas early widowhood might have been expected though not as early as it had proved the provincara brushed aside her fatigue with an impatient flash of her fingers and followed with a and what of yourself the last i heard of you you were riding courier for the provincar of guarida that was some years ago your grace how did you come here she looked him over her brows drawing down where is your sword oh that his hand vaguely touched his side where neither belt nor sword hung i lost it at when the march dy jironal led roya oricos forces up to the north coast for the winter campaign these three yes three years ago he made me castle warder of the fortress at gotorget then dy jironal had that unfortunate reversal we held the keep nine months against the roknari forces the usual you know i swear there was not a rat left unroasted in gotorget when the word came through that dy jironal had made treaty again and we were ordered to lay down our arms and march out and turn the fortress over to our foes he offered up a brief unfelt smile his left hand curled in his lap for my consolation i was informed our fortress cost the roknari prince an extra three hundred thousand royals in the treaty tent plus considerably more in the field that ninemonth i calculate poor consolation for the lives we spent the roknari general claimed my fathers sword he said he was going to hang it in his tent to remember me by so that was the last i saw of my blade after that cazarils voice growing stronger through this reminiscence faltered he cleared his throat and began again there was an error some mixup when the list of men to be ransomed arrived together with the chests of royals my name had been left off it somehow the roknari quartermaster swore there was no mistake because the amounts counted out evenly with the names but there was some mistake all my officers were rescued i was put in with the unransomed men and we were all marched to visping to be sold to the roknari corsair masters as galley slaves the provincara drew in her breath the warder who had been leaning farther and farther forward in his seat during this recital burst out you protested surely oh five gods yes i protested all the way to visping i was still protesting as they dragged me up the gangplank and chained me to my oar i kept protesting till we put to sea and then i learned not to he smiled again it felt like a clowns mask happily no one seized on that weak error i was on one ship or another for for a long time nineteen months eight days he had counted it out later at the time he could not have told one day from the next and then i had the greatest piece of good fortune for my corsair ran afoul of a fleet of the roya of ibra out on maneuvers i assure you ibras volunteers rowed better than we did and they soon ran us down two men had been beheaded in their chains by the increasingly desperate roknari for deliberatelyor accidentallyfouling their oars one of them had been sitting near cazaril his benchmate for months some of the spurting blood had got in his mouth he could still half taste it when he made the mistake of thinking of it he could taste it now when the corsair was taken the ibrans had trailed the roknari some still halfalive behind the ship on ropes made of their own guts till the great fishes had eaten them some of the freed galley slaves had helped row with a will cazaril could not that last flaying had brought him within hours of being cast overboard by the roknari galley master as broken and useless hed sat on the deck muscles twitching uncontrollably and wept the good ibrans put me ashore in zagosur where i fell ill for a few months you know how it is with men when a long strain is removed of a sudden they can grow rather childish he smiled apologetically around the room for him it had been collapse and fever till his back half healed then dysentery then an ague and throughout it all the bouts of inconsolable weeping hed wept when an acolyte offered him dinner when the sun came out when the sun went in when a cat startled him when he was led to bed or at any time for no cause the temple hospital of the mothers mercy took me in when i felt a little betterwhen the weeping had tailed mostly off and the acolytes had decided he was not mad merely nervousthey gave me a little money and i walked here i was three weeks on the road the room was dead silent he looked up to see that the provincaras lips had gone tight with anger terror wrenched his empty stomach it was the only place i could think of he excused himself hastily im sorry im sorry the warder blew out his breath and sat back staring at cazaril the lady companions eyes were wide in a vibrating voice the provincara declared you are the castillar dy cazaril they should have given you a horse they should have given you an escort cazarils hands flapped in frightened denial no no my lady it was it was enough well almost he realized after an unsteady blink that her anger wasnt at him oh his throat tightened and the room blurred no not again not here he hurried on i wished to place myself in your service lady if you can find any use for me i admit i cant do much just now the provincara sat back her chin resting lightly on her hand and studied him after a moment she said you used to play the lute very pleasantly when you were a page uh cazarils crooked callused hands tried to hide themselves in each other for a spasmodic instant he smiled in renewed apology and displayed them briefly on his knees i think not now my lady she leaned forward her gaze rested for a moment on his halfmangled left i see she sat back again pursing her lips i remember you read all the books in my husbands library the master of the pages was always complaining of you for that i told him to leave you alone you aspired to be a poet as i recall cazaril was not sure his right hand could close around a pen at present i believe chalion was saved from a deal of bad poetry when i went off to war she shrugged her shoulders come come castillar you quite daunt me with your offer of service im not sure poor valenda has posts enough to occupy you youve been a courtiera captaina castle wardera courier i havent been a courtier since before roya ias died my lady as a captain i helped lose the battle of dalus and rotted for nearly a year in the dungeons of the royacy of brajar thereafter as a castle warder well we lost the siege as a courier i was nearly hanged as a spy twice he brooded and three times put to the torture in violation of parley now now well i know how to row boats and five ways of preparing a dish of rats i could relish a mighty dish of rat right now in fact he did not know what she read in his face for all that her sharp old eyes probed him perhaps it was exhaustion but he hoped it was hunger he was fairly sure it was hunger for she at last smiled crookedly then come to supper with us castillar though im afraid my cook cannot offer you rat they are not in season in peaceful valenda i shall think on your petition he nodded mute thanks not trusting his voice to not break it being still winter the main meal of the households day had been taken at noon formally in the great hall the evening supper was a lighter repast featuring by the provincaras economy the leftover breads and meats from noon but by her pride the very best of them supplemented by a generous libation of her excellent wines in the shimmering heat of the high plains summer the procedure would be reversed nuncheon would be light fare and the main meal taken after nightfall when baocians of all degrees took to their cooler courtyards to eat by lantern light they sat down only eight in an intimate chamber in a new building quite near the kitchens the provincara took the center of the table and placed cazaril on her honored right cazaril was daunted to find the royesse iselle on his other side and the royse teidez across from her he took heart again when the royse chose to while away the wait for all to be seated by flicking breadballs at his older sister a maneuver sternly suppressed by his grandmother a retaliatory gleam in the royesses eye was only sidetracked cazaril judged by some timely distraction from her companion betriz seated across and a little down from him lady betriz smiled across the board at cazaril in friendly curiosity revealing an elusive dimple and seemed about to speak but then the servant passed among them with a basin for handwashing the warm water was scented with verbena cazarils hands shook as he dipped and wiped them on the fine linen towel a weakness he concealed as soon as he might by hiding them in his lap the chair directly across from him remained empty cazaril nodded to it and asked the provincara diffidently will the dowager royina be joining us your grace her lips pressed closed ista is not well enough tonight unfortunately she takes most of her meals in her chamber cazaril quelled a moment of unease and resolved to ask someone else later exactly what troubled the royse and royesses mother that brief compression suggested something chronic or lingering or too painful to be discussed her long widowhood had spared ista the further dangers of childbirth that were the bane of young women but then there were all those frightening female disorders that overtook matrons as roya iass second wife ista had been wed in his middle age when his son and heir orico was already fullgrown in the little time cazaril had been at the court of chalion years ago he had watched her only from a discreet distance shed seemed happy the light of the royas eye when the marriage was new ias had doted upon toddler iselle and upon teidez a babe in the nurses arms their happiness had been darkened during the unfortunate tragedy of lord dy lutezs treason which most observers agreed had hastened the aging royas death by grief cazaril couldnt help wondering if the illness that had evidently driven royina ista from her stepsons court had any unfortunate political elements but the new roya orico had been respectful of his stepmother and kind to his half siblings by all reports cazaril cleared his throat to cover the growling of his stomach and gave attention to the royses superior gentlemantutor on the far end of the table beyond lady betriz the provincara with a regal nod of her head desired him to lead the prayer to the holy family blessing the approaching meal cazaril hoped it was approaching rapidly the mystery of the empty chair was solved when the castle warder ser dy ferrej hurried in late and made brief apologies all round before seating himself i was caught by the divine of the order of the bastard he explained as bread meat and dried fruit were passed cazaril hardpressed not to fall on his food like a starving dog made a politely inquiring noise and took his first bite the most earnestly longwinded young man dy ferraj expanded what does he want now asked the provincara more donations for the foundling hospital we sent down a load last week the castle servants are refusing to give up any more of their old clothes wet nurses said dy ferrej chewing the provincara snorted not from my household no but he wanted me to pass the word that the temple was looking he was hoping someone might have a female relative who would be moved to pious charity they had another babe left at the postern last week and hes expecting more its the time of year apparently the order of the bastard by the logic of its theology classified unwanted births among the thingsoutofseason that were the gods mandate including bastardsnaturallyand children bereft of parents untimely young the temples foundling hospitals and orphanages were one of the orders main concerns in all cazaril thought that a god who was supposed to command a legion of demons ought to have an easier time shaking out donations for his good works cautiously cazaril watered his wine a crime to treat this vintage so but on his empty stomach it was sure to go straight to his head the provincara nodded approvingly at him but then entered into an argument with her lady cousin on the same subject emerging partially triumphant with half a glass of wine undiluted ser dy ferrej continued the divine had a good story though guess who died last night who papa said lady betriz helpfully ser dy naoza the celebrated duelist it was not a name cazaril recognized but the provincara sniffed about time ghastly man i did not receive him though i suppose there were fools enough who did did he finally underestimate a victimi mean opponent thats where the story gets interesting he was apparently assassinated by death magic no bad raconteur dy ferrej quaffed wine while the shocked murmur ran around the table cazaril froze in midchew is the temple going to try to solve the mystery asked royesse iselle no mystery to it though i gather it was rather a tragedy about a year ago dy naoza was jostled in the street by the only son of a provincial wool merchant with the usual result well dy naoza claimed it for a duel of course but there were those on the scene who said it was bloody murder somehow none of them could be found to testify when the boys father tried to take dy naoza to justice there was some question about the probity of the judge too it was rumored the provincara tsked cazaril dared to swallow and say do go on encouraged the castle warder continued the merchant was a widower and the boy not just an only son but an only child just about to be married too to turn the knife death magic is an ugly business true but i cant help having a spot of sympathy for the poor merchant well rich merchant i suppose but in any case far too old to train up to the degree of swordsmanship required to remove someone like dy naoza so he fell back on what he thought was his only recourse spent the next year studying the black artswhere he found all his lore is a good puzzle for the temple mind youletting his business go i was toldand then last night took himself off to an abandoned mill about seven miles from valenda and tried to call up a demon and by the bastard succeeded his body was found there this morning the father of winter was the god of all deaths in good season and of justice but in addition to all the other disasters in his gift the bastard was the god of executioners and indeed god of a whole purseful of other dirty jobs it seems the merchant went to the right store for his miracle the notebook in cazarils vest suddenly seemed to weigh ten pounds but it was only in his imagination that it felt as though it might scorch through the cloth and burst into flame well i dont have any sympathy for him said royse teidez that was cowardly yes but what can you expect of a merchant observed his tutor from down the table men of that class are not trained up in the kind of code of honor a true gentleman learns but its so sad protested iselle i mean about the son about to be wed teidez snorted girls all you can think about is getting married but which is the greater loss to the royacy some moneygrubbing woolman or a swordsman any duelist that skilled must be a good soldier for the roya not in my experience cazaril said dryly what do you mean teidez promptly challenged him abashed cazaril mumbled excuse me i spoke out of turn whats the difference teidez pressed the provincara tapped a finger on the tablecloth and shot him an indecipherable look do expand castillar cazaril shrugged and offered a slight apologetic bow in the boys direction the difference royse is that a skilled soldier kills your enemies but a skilled duelist kills your allies i leave you to guess which a wise commander prefers to have in his camp oh said teidez he fell silent looking thoughtful there was apparently no rush to return the merchants notebook to the proper authorities and also no difficulty cazaril might search out the divine at the temple of the holy family here in valenda tomorrow at his leisure and turn it over to be passed along it would have to be decoded some men found that sort of puzzle difficult or tedious but cazaril had always found it restful he wondered if he ought as a courtesy to offer to decipher it he touched his soft wool robe and was glad hed prayed for the man at his hurried burning betriz her dark brows crimping asked who was the judge papa dy ferrej hesitated a moment then shrugged the honorable vrese ah said the provincara him her nose twitched as though shed sniffed a bad smell did the duelist threaten him then asked royesse iselle shouldnt hecouldnt he have called for help or had dy naoza arrested i doubt that even dy naoza was foolish enough to threaten a justiciar of the province said dy ferrej though it was probable he intimidated the witnesses vrese was hm likely handled by more peaceful means he popped a fragment of bread into his mouth and rubbed his thumb and forefinger together miming a man warming a coin if the judge had done his job honestly and bravely the merchant would never have been driven to use death magic said iselle slowly two men are dead and damned where it might have only been one and even if hed been executed dy naoza might have had time to clean his soul before facing the gods if this is known why is the man still a judge grandmama cant you do something about it the provincara pressed her lips together the appointment of provincial justiciars is not within my gift dear one nor their removal or their department would be rather more orderly run i assure you she took a sip of her wine and added to her granddaughters frowning look i have great privilege in baocia child i do not have great powers iselle glanced at teidez and at cazaril before echoing her brothers question in a voice gone serious whats the difference one is the right to ruleand the duty to protect t other is the right to receive protection replied the provincara there is alas more difference between a provincar and a provincara than just the one letter teidez smirked oh like the difference between a royse and a royesse iselle turned on him and raised her brows oh and how do you propose to remove the corrupt judgeprivileged boy thats enough you two said the provincara sternly in a voice that was pure grandmother cazaril hid a smile within these walls she ruled right enough by an older code than chalions hers was a sufficient little state the conversation turned to less lurid matters as the servants brought cakes cheese and a wine from brajar cazaril had surreptitiously he hoped stuffed himself if he didnt stop soon he would make himself sick but the golden dessert wine almost sent him into tears at the table that one he drank unwatered though he managed to limit himself to one glass at the end of the meal prayers were offered again and royse teidez was dragged off by his tutor for studies iselle and betriz were sent to do needlework they departed at a gallop followed at a more sedate pace by dy ferrej will they actually sit still for needlework cazaril asked the provincara watching the departing flurry of skirts they gossip and giggle till i cant bear it but yes theyre very handy said the provincara the disapproving purse of her lips belied by the warmth of her eyes your granddaughter is a delightful young lady to a man of a certain age cazaril all young ladies start to look delightful its the first symptom of senility true my lady his lips twitched up shes worn out two governesses and looks to be bent on destroying a third by the way the woman complains of her and yet the provincaras tart voice grew slower she needs to be strong someday inevitably she will be sent far from me and i will no longer be able to help her protect her an attractive fresh young royesse was a pawn not a player in the politics of chalion her brideprice would come high but a politically and financially favorable marriage might not necessarily prove a good one in more intimate senses the dowager provincara had been fortunate in her personal life but in her long years had doubtless had opportunity to observe the whole range of marital fates awaiting highborn women would iselle be sent to far darthaca married off to some cousin in the toocloserelated royacy of brajar gods forbid she should be bartered away to the roknari to seal some temporary peace exiled to the archipelago she studied him sidelong in the light from the lavish branches of candles she had always favored how old are you now castillar i thought you were about thirteen when your father sent you to serve my dear provincar about that yes your grace im thirtyfive ha you should shave off that nasty mess growing out of your face then it makes you look fifteen years older than you are cazaril considered some quip about a turn in the roknari galleys being very aging to a man but he wasnt quite up to it instead he said i hope i did not annoy the royse with my maunderings my lady i believe you actually made young teidez stop and think a rare event i wish his tutor could manage it more often she drummed her thin fingers briefly on the cloth and drained the last of her tiny glass of wine she set it down and added i dont know what flearidden inn youve put up at down in town castillar but ill dispatch a page for your things youll lodge here tonight thank you your grace i accept with gratitude and alacrity thank the gods oh five times five he was gathered in at least temporarily he hesitated embarrassed but ah it wont be necessary to trouble your page she raised a brow at him thats what they exist for as you may recall yes buthe smiled briefly and gestured down himselfthese are my things at her pained look he added weakly i had less when i fell off the ibran galley in zagosur hed been dressed in a breechclout of surpassing filthiness and scabs the acolytes had burned the rag at their first opportunity then my page said the provincara in a precise voice still regarding him levelly will escort you to your chamber my lord castillar she added as she made to rise and her cousincompanion hastened to assist her well speak again tomorrow the chamber was one in the old keep reserved for honored guests more on account of having been slept in by several historical royas than for its absolute comfort cazaril had served its guests himself a hundred times the bed had three mattresses straw feather and down and was dressed in the softest washed linen and a coverlet worked by ladies of the household before the page had left him two maids arrived bearing wash water drinking water towels soap a toothstick and an embroidered nightgown cap and slippers cazaril had been planning to sleep in the dead mans shirt it was abruptly all too much cazaril sat down on the edge of the bed with the nightgown in his hands and burst into wracking sobs gulping he gestured the unnervedlooking servitors to leave him whats the matter with him he heard the maids voice as their footsteps trailed off down the corridor and the tears trailed down the inside of his nose the page answered disgustedly a madman i suppose after a short pause the maids voice floated back faintly well hell fit right in here then wont he chapter the sounds of the household stirringcalls from the courtyard the distant clank of potswoke cazaril in the predawn gray he opened his eyes to a moment of panicked disorientation but the reassuring embrace of the feather bed drew him down again into drowsy repose not a hard bench not moving up and down not moving at all oh five gods that was very heaven so warm on his knotted back the daughters day celebrations would run from dawn till dark perhaps he would lie slugabed till the household had departed for the procession then get up late creep around unobtrusively lie in the sun with the castle cats when he grew hungry dredge up old memories from his days as a pagehed used to know how to charm the cook for an extra tidbit a crisp knock on the door interrupted these pleasant meditations cazaril jerked then relaxed again as lady betrizs voice followed my lord dy cazaril are you awake castillar a moment my lady cazaril called back he wallowed to the beds edge and tore himself from the loving clutch of the mattress a woven rush mat on the floor kept the morning cold of the stone from nipping his bare feet he shook the generous linen of the nightgown down over his legs shuffled to the door and opened it a crack yes she stood in the corridor with a candle shielded by a blownglass lantern in one hand and a pile of cloth leather straps and something that clanked wedged awkwardly under her other arm she was fully dressed for the day in a blue gown with a white vestcloak that fell from shoulder to ankle her dark hair was braided up on her head with flowers and leaves her velvet brown eyes were merry glinting in the candles glow cazaril could not help but smile back her grace the provincara bids you a blessed daughters day she announced and startled cazaril into jumping backward by firmly kicking the door open she rocked her loaded hips through handed off the candle holder to him with a here take this and dumped her burden on the edge of the bed piles of blue and white cloth and a sword with a belt cazaril set the candle down on the chest at the foot of the bed she sends you these to wear and if it please you bids you join the household in the ancestors hall for the dawn prayers after which we will break our fast which she says you know well where to find indeed my lady actually i asked papa for the sword its his secondbest one he said it would be an honor to loan it to you she turned a highly interested gaze upon him is it true you were in the late war uh which one youve been in more than one her eyes widened then narrowed all of them for the last seventeen years i think well no hed sat out the most recent abortive campaign against ibra in the dungeons of brajar and missed that foolish expedition the roya had sent in support of darthaca because hed been busy being inventively tormented by the roknari general with whom the provincar of guarida was bargaining so ineptly besides those two he didnt think there had been a defeat in the last decade hed missed here and there over the years he answered vaguely he was suddenly horridly conscious that there was nothing between his nakedness and her maiden eyes but a thin layer of linen he twitched inward clutching his arms across his belly and smiled weakly oh she said following his gesture have i embarrassed you but papa says soldiers have no modesty on account of having to live all together in the field she returned her eyes to his face which was heating cazaril got out i was thinking of your modesty my lady thats all right she said cheerfully she didnt go away he nodded toward the pile of clothes i didnt wish to intrude upon the family during celebration are you sure she clasped her hands together earnestly and intensified her gaze but you must come to the procession and you must you must you must come to the daughters day quartergifting at the temple the royesse iselle is going to play the part of the lady of spring this year she bounced on her toes in her importunity cazaril smiled sheepishly very well if it please you how could he resist all this urgent delight royesse iselle must be rising sixteen he wondered how old lady betriz was too young for you old fellow but surely he might watch her with a purely aesthetic appreciation and thank the goddesses for her gifts of youth beauty and verve howsoever they were scattered brightening the world like flowers and besides lady betriz cinched it the provincara bids you cazaril seized the opportunity to light his candle from hers and by way of a hint that it was time for her to go away and let him dress handed the glassglobed flame back to her the doubled light that made her more lovely doubtless made him less so shed just turned to go when he bethought him of his prudent question unanswered last night wait lady she turned back with a look of bright inquiry i didnt want to trouble the provincara or ask in front of the royse or royesse but what grieves the royina ista i dont want to say or do something wrong out of ignorance the light in her eyes died a little she shrugged shes weary and nervous nothing more we hope she will feel better with the coming of the sun she always seems to do better in the summertime how long has she been living here with her mother these six years sir she gave him a little half curtsey now i have to go to royesse iselle dont be late castillar her smile dimpled at him again and she darted out he could not imagine that young lady being late anywhere her energy was appalling shaking his head though the smile shed left him still lingered on his lips he turned to examine the new largesse he was certainly moving up to a better grade of castoffs the tunic was blue silk brocade the trousers heavy dark blue linen and the kneelength vestcloak white wool all clean the little mends and stains quite unobtrusive dy ferrejs festival gear outgrown perhaps or possibly even something packed away from the late provincar the loose fit was forgiving of this change in ownership with the sword hung at his left hip familiarunfamiliar weight cazaril hurried down out of the keep and across the gray courtyard to the households ancestors hall the air of the courtyard was chill and damp the cobbles slippery under his thin boot soles overhead a few stars still lingered cazaril eased open the big plank door to the hall and peered inside candles figures was he late he slipped within his eyes adjusting not late but early the tiers of little family memori boards at the front of the room had half a dozen old candle stubs burning before them two women huddled into shawls sat on the front bench watching over a third the dowager royina ista lay before the altar in the attitude of deepest supplication prone upon the floor her arms outflung her fingers curled and uncurled the nails were bitten down to the red a muddle of nightgowns and shawls puddled around her her masses of crinkly hair once gold now darkened by age to a dull dun spread out around her head like a fan for a moment cazaril wondered if she had fallen asleep so still did she lie but in her pale face turned sideways with her soft cheek resting directly on the floor her eyes were open gray and unblinking filled with unshed tears it was a face of the most profound grief cazaril was put in mind of mens looks that he had seen broken in not just body but soul by the dungeon or the horrors of the galleys or of his own seen dimly in a polished steel mirror in the mothers house in ibra when the acolytes had shaved his nerveless face and encouraged him to look see wasnt that better yet he was quite certain the royina had never been within smelling distance of a dungeon in her life never felt the bite of the lash never perhaps even felt a mans hand raised against her in anger what then he stood still lips parted afraid to speak at a creak and a bustle behind him he glanced round to see the dowager provincara attended by her cousin slip inside she flicked an eyebrow at him in passing he jerked a little bow the waiting women attending upon the royina started and rose offering ghostly curtseys the provincara strode up the aisle between the benches and studied her daughter expressionlessly oh dear how long has she been here one of the waiting women half curtseyed again she rose in the night your grace we thought it better to let her come down than to fight her as you instructed yes yes the provincara waved away this nervous excuse did she get any sleep at all one or two hours i think my lady the provincara sighed and knelt by her daughter her voice went gentle all the tartness drained out for the first time cazaril heard the age in it ista heart rise and go back to bed others will take over the praying today the prone womans lips moved twice before words whispered out if the gods hear if they hear they do not speak their faces are turned from me mother almost awkwardly the old woman stroked her hair others will pray today well light all the candles new and try again let your ladies put you back to bed up now the royina sniffed blinked and reluctantly rose at a jerk of the provincaras head the waiting ladies hurried forward to guide the royina out of the hall gathering up her dropping shawls behind her cazaril searched her face anxiously as she passed but found no signs of wasting illness no yellow tinge to her skin or eyes no emaciation she scarcely seemed to see cazaril no recognition flickered in her eyes for the bearded stranger well there was no reason she should remember him merely one of dozens of pages in and out of dy baocias household over the years the provincaras head turned back as the door closed behind her daughter cazaril was close enough to see her quiet sigh he made her a deeper bow i thank you for these festival garments your grace if he hesitated if theres anything i can do to ease your burdens lady or those of the royina just ask she smiled and took his hand and patted it rather absently but didnt answer she went to open the window shutters on the rooms east side to let in the peachcolored dawn glow around the altar lady dy hueltar blew out the candles and gathered up all the stubby ends in a basket brought for that purpose the provincara and cazaril went to help her replace the sad lumps in each holder with a fresh new beeswax candle when the dozens of candles were standing up like young soldiers each in front of their respective tablets the provincara stepped back and gave a satisfied nod the rest of the household began arriving then and cazaril took a seat out of the way on a back bench cooks servants stableboys pages the huntsman and the falconer the upper housekeeper the castle warder all in their best clothes with as much blue and white as could be managed filed in and sat then lady betriz led in royesse iselle fully dressed and a trifle stiff in the elaborate multilayered and brilliantly embroidered robes of the lady of spring whose part she was selected to play today they took an attentive seat on a front bench and managed not to giggle together they were followed by a divine of the holy family from the temple in town his vestments too changed from yesterdays blackandgray robes of the father to the blueandwhite of the daughter the divine led the assembly in a short service for the succession of the season and the peace of the dead here represented and as the first rays of sun fingered through the east window ceremonially extinguished the last candle left burning the last flame anywhere in the household all then adjourned for a cold breakfast set up on trestles in the courtyard cold but not sparing cazaril reminded himself that he neednt try to make up for three years of privation in a day and that he had some up and downhill walking coming up soon still he was happily replete when the royesses white mule was led in it too was decorated with ribbons of blue and fresh early flowers braided into its mane and tail its hangings were gloriously elaborated with all the symbols of the lady of spring iselle in her temple garments her hair arranged to ripple down like an amber waterfall over her shoulders from under her crown of leaves and flowers was loaded carefully into her saddle and her drapes and panels arranged this time she used a mounting block and the assistance of a couple of hefty young pages the divine took the mules blue silk rope to lead her out the gate the provincara was hoisted aboard a sedate chestnut mare with showy white socks also braided with ribbons and flowers led by her castle warder cazaril muffled a belch and at dy ferrejs beckoning hastened to position himself after the mounted ladies courteously offering his arm to the lady dy hueltar the rest of the household those who were going also fell in behind on foot the whole merry mob wound down through the streets of town to the old east gate where the procession was to formally begin some couple of hundred people waited there including fifty or so mounted horsemen from the daughters guardsmens associations drawn from all around the hinterlands of valenda cazaril walked right under the nose of the burly soldier whod dropped him that mistaken coin in the mud yesterday but the man gazed back at him without recognition merely a courteous nod for his silks and his sword and his trim and his bath cazaril supposed how strangely we are blinded by the surfaces of things the gods presumably saw straight through he wondered if the gods found this as uncomfortable as he sometimes did these days he put his odd thoughts aside as the procession formed up the divine turned iselles lead line over to the elderly gentleman whod been selected to play the part of the father of winter in the winter procession a young new father would have taken the gods place his dark garb neat as a judges and hed have ridden a fine black horse that the outgoing and ragged son of autumn led todays grandfather wore a collection of gray rags that made cazarils late wear look positively like a burghers his beard and hair and bare calves streaked with ashes he smiled and made some joke up at iselle she laughed the guardsmen formed up behind the pair and the whole parade began its circuit of the old town walls or as nearly as it could come to them with the new building all around some temple acolytes followed between the guardsmen and the rest to lead the singing and encourage everyone to use the proper words and not the rude versions any townspeople not in the procession played the audience and threw mostly flowers and herbs in the van cazaril could see the usual few young unmarried women dart in to touch the daughters garments for luck in finding a husband this season and flurry off again giggling after a goodly morning walkthank heavens for the mild lovely weather one memorable spring theyd done this in a sleet stormthe whole straggling train snaked round to the east gate once more and filed through to the temple in the towns heart the temple stood on the one side of the town square surrounded by a bit of garden and a low stone wall it was built in the usual fourlobed pattern like a fourleafed clover around its central court its walls were the golden native stone that so eased cazarils heart capped with the local red tile one domed lobe held the altar for the god of each season the bastards separate round tower directly back of his mothers gate held his the lady dy hueltar ruthlessly dragged cazaril to the front as the royesse was unloaded from her mule and led beneath the portico he found lady betriz had taken up station on his other side she craned her neck to follow iselle beneath cazarils nose the fresh odor from the flowers and foliage twined around her head mingled with the warm scent of her hair surely springs own exhalation the crowd pressed them onward through the wideflung doors inside with the slanted shadows of morning still dimming the paved main courtyard the father of winter cleaned the last of the ash from the raised hearth of the central holy fire and sprinkled it about his person the acolytes hurried forward to lay the new tinder and wood which the divine blessed the ashy graybeard was then driven from the chamber with hoots catcalls little sticks with bells and missiles of soft wool representing snowballs it was considered an unlucky year at least by the gods avatar when the crowd could use real snowballs the lady of spring in the person of iselle was then led forward to light the new fire from flint and steel she knelt on the cushions provided and bit her lip charmingly in her concentration as she mounded up the dry shavings and sacred herbs all held their breaths a dozen superstitions surrounded the matter of how many tries it took the ascending gods avatar to light the new fire each season three quick strikes a shower of sparks a puff of young breath the tiny flame caught quickly the divine bent to light the new taper before any unfortunate failure could occur none did a murmur of relieved approval rose all round the little flame was transferred to the holy hearth and iselle looking smug and a trifle relieved was helped to her feet her gray eyes seemed to burn as brightly and cheerfully as the new flame she was then led to the throne of the reigning god and the real business of the morning began collecting the quarterly gifts to the temple that would keep it running for the next three months each head of a household stepped forward to lay their little purse of coins or other offering in the ladys hands be blessed and have the amount recorded by the temples secretary at the table to iselles right they were then led off to receive in return their taper with the new fire to return to their house the provincaras household was the first by order of rank the purse that the castle warder laid in iselles hands was heavy with gold other men of worth stepped forward iselle smiled and received and blessed the chief divine smiled and transferred and thanked the secretary smiled and recorded and piled beside cazaril betriz stiffened with excitement she gripped cazarils left arm briefly the next one is that vile judge vrese she hissed in his ear watch a dourlooking fellow of middle years richly dressed in dark blue velvets and gold chains stepped up to the ladys throne with his purse in his hand with a tight smile he held it out the house of vrese presents its offering to the goddess he intoned nasally bless us in the coming season my lady iselle folded her hands in her lap she raised her chin looked across at vrese with an absolutely level unsmiling stare and said in a clear carrying voice the daughter of spring receives honest hearts offerings she does not accept bribes honorable vrese your gold means more to you than anything you may keep it vrese stepped back a half pace his mouth opened in shock and hung there the stunned silence spread out in waves to the back of the crowd to return in a rising mutter of what what did she say i didnt hear what the chief divines face drained the recording secretary looked up with an expression of jolted horror a wellattired man waiting toward the front of the line vented a sharp crack of gleeful laughter his lips drew back in an expression that had little to do with humor but much with appreciation of cosmic justice beside cazaril lady betriz bounced on her toes and hissed through her teeth a trail of choked snickers followed the whispers of explanation trickling back through the mob of townspeople like a small spring freshet the judge switched his glare to the chief divine and made an odd little abortive jerk of his hand the bagged offering in it toward him instead the divines hands opened and clenched again at his sides he stared across beseechingly at the enthroned avatar of the goddess lady iselle he whispered out of the corner of his mouth not quite lowly enough you cant we cant does the goddess speak to you in this iselle returned not nearly so lowly she speaks in my heart doesnt she in yours and besides i asked her to sign me approval by giving me the first flame and she did perfectly composed she leaned around the frozen judge smiled brightly at the next townsman in line and invited you sir perforce the judge stepped aside especially as the next man in line grinning had no hesitation at all in stepping up and shouldering past an acolyte jerked into motion by a glare from his superior hurried forward to invite the judge to step out somewhere and discuss this contretemps his slight reach toward the offering purse was knifed right through by an icy frown tossed at him by the royesse he clapped his hands behind his back and bowed the fuming judge away across the courtyard the provincara seated pinched the bridge of her nose between thumb and forefinger wiped her hand over her mouth and stared in exasperation at her granddaughter iselle merely raised her chin and continued blandly exchanging the goddesss blessings for the gifts of the quarterday with a line of suddenly no longer bored nor perfunctory townsmen as she worked her way down through the towns households such gifts in kind as chickens eggs and a bullcalf were collected outside their bearers alone entering the sacred precincts to collect their blessing and their new fire lady dy hueltar and betriz went to join the provincara on her courtesy bench and cazaril took up station behind it with the castle warder who favored his demure daughter with a suspicious parental frown most of the crowd drifted away the royesse continued cheerfully in her sacred duty down to the last and least thanking a woodgatherer a charcoal burner and a beggarwho for his gift sang a hymnin the same even tones as shed blessed the first men of valenda the storm in the provincaras face didnt break till the whole family party had returned to the castle for the afternoon feast cazaril found himself leading her horse as her castle warder dy ferrej had taken a firm and prudent grip on the lead line of iselles white mule cazarils plan to quietly absent himself was thwarted when helped down off her chestnut mare by her servants the provincara demanded shortly castillar give me your arm her grip around it was tight and trembling through thinned lips she added iselle betriz dy ferrej in here she jerked her head toward the plank doors of the ancestors hall just off the castle courtyard iselle had left her festal garments at the temple when the ceremonies had concluded and was merely a young woman in pretty blue and white once more no cazaril decided watching her decided chin come up again merely a royesse once more beneath that apprehensive surface glowed an alarming determination cazaril held the door as they all filed past including lady dy hueltar when hed been a young page cazaril thought ruefully his instinct for danger spilling down from on high would have sped him off at this point but dy ferrej stopped and waited for him and he followed the hall was quiet empty now though warmly lit by the ranks of candles on the altar that would be allowed to burn all day today until entirely consumed the wooden benches were polished to a subdued gleam in the candlelight by many piousor restiveprior occupants the provincara stepped to the front of the room and turned on the two girls who drew together under her stern eye all right which of you had that idea iselle took a half step forward and gave a tiny curtsey it was mine grandmama she said in almost but not quite as clear a voice as in the temple courtyard she offered after another moment under that dour gaze though betriz thought of asking the first flame for confirmation dy ferrej wheeled on his daughter you knew this was coming up and you didnt tell me betriz gave him a curtsey that was an echo of iselles right down to the unbent backbone i had understood i was assigned to be the royesses handmaiden papa not anybodys spy if my first loyalty was to be to anyone but iselle no one ever told me guard her honor with your life you said after a moment she added more cautiously undercutting this fine speech a trifle besides i couldnt know it was going to happen till after she had struck the first flame dy ferrej abandoned the young sophist and made a helpless gesture to the provincara you are older betriz said the provincara to her we thought youd be a calming influence teach iselle the duties of a pious maiden her lips twisted as when beetim the huntsman couples the young hounds to the older ones alas that i did not give your upbringing over to him instead of to these useless governesses betriz blinked and offered another curtsey yes my lady the provincara eyed her suspicious of concealed humor cazaril bit his lip iselle took a deep breath if tolerating injustice and turning a blind eye to mens tragic and unnecessary damnations are among the first duties of a pious maiden then the divines never taught it to me no of course not the provincara snapped for the first time her harsh voice softened with a shade of persuasion but justice is not your task heart the men whose task it was appear to have neglected it i am not a milkmaid if i have a greater privilege in chalion surely i have a greater duty to chalion as well the divine and the good dedicat have both told me so she shot a defying look at the hovering lady dy hueltar i was talking about you attending to your studies iselle lady dy hueltar protested when the divines talked of your pious duties iselle dy ferrej added they didnt mean they didnt mean they didnt mean me to take them seriously she inquired sweetly dy ferrej sputtered cazaril sympathized an innocent with the moral advantage and as feckless and ignorant of her dangers as the new pup the provincara had compared her tocazaril was profoundly thankful that he had no part in this the provincaras nostrils flared for now you may both go to your chambers and stay there id set you both to read scriptures for a penance but i will decide later if you will be permitted to come to the feast good dedicat follow after and make sure they arrive go she gestured imperiously as cazaril made to follow her sweeping arm stopped in midair and she pointed firmly downward castillar dy ferrej attend a moment lady betriz shot a curious glance over her shoulder as she was ushered out iselle marched head high and didnt look back well said dy ferrej wearily after a moment we did hope they would become friends her young audience removed the provincara permitted herself a rueful smile alas yes how old is the lady betriz cazaril asked curiously staring after the closing door nineteen answered her father with a sigh well her age was not quite so disparate from his as cazaril had thought though her experience surely was i really did think betriz would be a good influence dy ferrej added it seems to have worked the other way around are you accusing my granddaughter of corrupting your daughter the provincara inquired wryly say inspiring rather dy ferrej said with a glum shrug terrifying that i wonder i wonder if we should part them there would follow much howling wearily the provincara seated herself on a bench gesturing the men to do likewise dont want a crick in my neck cazaril clasped his hands between his knees and waited her pleasure whatever it was to be she must have dragged him along in here for something she stared thoughtfully at him for a long moment you have a fresh eye cazaril she said at last do you have any suggestions cazarils brows climbed ive had the training of young soldiers lady never of young maidens im quite out of my depth here he hesitated then spoke almost despite himself it looks to me to be a trifle too late to teach iselle to be a coward but you might draw her attention to how little firsthand evidence she jumped from how could she be so sure the judge was as guilty as rumor would have him hearsay gossip even some apparent evidence can lie cazaril thought ruefully of the bath mans assumptions about the witness of his back it wont help for todays incident but it might slow her down in future he added in a drier voice and you might look to be more careful what gossip you discuss in front of her dy ferrej winced in front of either one of them said the provincara four ears one mindor one conspiracy she pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes at him cazaril you speak and write darthacan do you not cazaril blinked at this sidewise jink in the conversation yes my lady and roknari my ah court roknari is a little rusty at present granted my vile roknari is quite fluent and geography you know the geography of chalion of ibra of the roknari princedoms five gods that i do my lady what i havent ridden over ive walked what i havent walked ive been dragged across or through ive had geography ground into my skin and ive rowed round half the archipelago at least and you write you cipher you keep booksyouve done letters reports treaties logistical orders my hand may be a trifle shaky at present but yes ive done all that he admitted with belatedly rising wariness where was she going with this interrogation yes yes she clapped her hands together cazaril flinched at the sharp noise the gods have surely landed you upon my wrist bastards demons take me if i havent the wit to jess you cazaril smiled bewildered inquiry cazaril you said you sought a post i have one for you she sat back triumphantly secretarytutor to the royesse iselle cazaril felt his jaw unhinge he blinked stupidly at her what teidez already has his own secretary who keeps the books of his chambers writes his letters such as they are its time iselle possessed her own warder at the gate between her womens world and the greater one shell have to deal with and besides none of those stupid governesses have ever been able to handle her she needs a mans authority thats what you have the rank you have the experience the provincara grinned was all one could call that horrifying gleeful expression what do you think my lord castillar cazaril swallowed i think i think if you lent me a razor now for me to cut my throat with it would save ever so many steps please your grace the provincara snorted good cazaril good i do so like a man who doesnt underestimate his situation dy ferrej whod at first looked startled and alarmed eyed cazaril with new interest ill wager you could direct her mind to her darthacan declensions youve been there after all which none of these fool women have the provincara went on gaining enthusiasm roknari too though we all pray shell never need that read brajaran poetry to her you used to like that i remember deportmentyouve served at the royas court the gods know come come cazaril dont look at me like a lost calf it would be easy work for you in your convalescence eh dont imagine i cant see how sick youve been she added at his little negating gesture you wouldnt have to answer but two letters a week at most less and youve ridden courierwhen you rode out with the girls i wouldnt have to listen to a lot of wheezing and whining afterward about saddle galls from those women with thighs like dough as for keeping the books of her chamberwhy after running a fortress it should be childs play for you what say you dear cazaril the vision was at once enticing and appalling couldnt you give me a fortress under siege instead the humor faded in her face she leaned forward and tapped him on the knee her voice dropped and she breathed she will be soon enough she paused and studied him you asked if there was anything you could do to ease my burdens for the most part the answer is no you cant make me young you cant make many things better cazaril wondered anew how the strange fragile health of her daughter weighed upon her but cant you give me this one little yes she begged him she begged him that was all wrong i am yours to command of course lady of course its just its just that are you sure you are not a stranger here cazaril and i am in the most desperate need of a man i can trust his heart melted or maybe it was his wits he bowed his head then i am yours iselles cazaril his elbows on his knees glanced up and across at her at the thoughtfully frowning dy ferrej and back at the old womans intent face i see i believe you do and that cazaril is why i shall have you for her so it was cazaril found himself the next morning introduced into the young ladies schoolroom by the provincara herself this sunny little chamber was on the east side of the keep on the top floor occupied by royesse iselle lady betriz their waiting woman and a maid royse teidez had chambers for his similar subhousehold in the new building across the courtyard rather more generously proportioned cazaril suspected and with better fireplaces iselles schoolroom was simply furnished with a pair of small tables chairs a single bookcase halfempty and a couple of chests with the addition of cazaril feeling overtall and awkward under the lowbeamed ceiling and the two young women it was as full as it would hold the perpetual waiting woman had to take her sewing into the next chamber though the doors were left propped open between them it seemed cazaril was to have a class not just a pupil a maiden of iselles rank would almost never be left alone and certainly not with a man even a prematurely aged and convalescent one of her own household cazaril didnt know how the two ladies felt about this tacit arrangement but he was secretly relieved never had he felt more repulsively maleuncouth clumsy and degraded in all this cheerful peaceful feminine atmosphere was about as far from a roknari galley rowers bench as it was possible for cazaril to imagine and he had to swallow a lump of delirious joy at the contrast as he ducked his head under the lintel and stepped inside the provincara announced him briskly as iselles new secretarytutor just as your brother has a clearly unexpected gift that iselle after a blink of surprise accepted without the least demur by her calculating look the novelty and increased status of being instructed by a man was quite pleasing to her lady betriz too cazaril was heartened to note looked alert and interested rather than wary or hostile cazaril trusted he appeared scholarly enough to fool the young ladies the wool merchants neat brown gown secured today by the castle warders silverstudded belt without the sword hed had the forethought to supply himself with all the books in darthacan that a fast rummage through the remains of the late provincars library could supply some half dozen random volumes he dropped them with an impressive thump upon one of the little tables and favored both new pupils with a deliberately sinister smile if this was to be anything like training young soldiers young horses or young hawks the key was to take the initiative from the first moment and keep it thereafter he could be as hollow as a drum so long as he was as loud the provincara departed as briskly as shed arrived in the interest of pretending he had a plan while devising one cazaril started right in by testing the royesses command of darthacan he had her read a random page from one of the volumes as it chanced on a topic that cazaril knew well mining and sapping fortified lines during sieges with much help and prompting iselle stumbled through three laborious paragraphs two or three questions cazaril put to her in darthacan challenging her to explicate the contents of what shed just read left her sputtering and floundering your accent is terrible he told her frankly a darthacan would find you nearly unintelligible her head came up and she glared at him my governess said i was quite good she said that i had a very melodic intonation yes you speak like a south ibran fishwoman hawking her wares they are very melodic too but any darthacan lordling and they are all arrogant as wasps about their dreadful tongue would laugh in your face at least they had in cazarils once your governess flattered you royesse she frowned across at him i take it you do not fancy yourself a flatterer castillar her tone and terms were a bit more doubleleveled than hed expected his ironic return bow from his seat on a chest drawn up to her tables other side was pulled shorter and a little less apologetic than hed intended by the yank of his adhesions i trust i am not a complete lout but if you desire a man to tell you comfortable lies about your prowess and so fetter any hope of true excellence im sure you may find one anywhere not all prisons are made of iron bars some are made of feather beds royesse her nostrils flared her lips thinned belatedly it occurred to cazaril that perhaps this was the wrong approach she was a tender young thing barely more than a girlperhaps he ought to softenand if she complained of him to the provincara he might lose she turned the page let us she said in an icy voice go on five gods hed seen exactly that same look of frustrated fury in the eyes of the young men whod picked themselves up spat the dirt from their mouths and gone on to become his best lieutenants maybe this wasnt going to be so difficult after all with great effort he cranked a broad grin downward into a grave frown and nodded august tutorly permission continue an hour flew by in this pleasant easy employment well easy for him when he noticed the royesse rubbing her temples and lines deepening between her brows that had nothing to do with mere offense he desisted and took the book back from her lady betriz had followed along at iselles side her lips moving silently cazaril had her repeat the exercise with iselles example before her she was quicker but alas she suffered from the same broad south ibran accent probably from the same south ibran prior instructress as iselle iselle listened intently as they waded through corrections they had all earned their noon dinner by that time cazaril felt but he had one more displeasing task to accomplish strictly charged to him by the provincara he leaned back as the girls stirred and made to rise and cleared his throat that was quite a spectacular gesture you brought off yesterday at the temple royesse her wide mouth curved up her curiously thick eyelids narrowed in pleasure thank you castillar he let his own smile grow astringent a most showy insult to put upon a man constrained to stand and not answer back at least the idlers were vastly amused judging by their laughter her lips constricted into an uneasy purse there is much ill done in chalion that i can do nothing about it was little enough if it was well it was welldone he conceded with a deceptively cordial nod tell me royesse what steps did you take beforehand to assure yourself of the mans guilt her chin stopped in midrise ser dy ferrej said it of him and i know him to be honest ser dy ferrej said and i recall his words precisely for he uses his words so that hed heard it said the judge had taken the duelists bribe he did not claim firsthand knowledge of the deed did you check with him after dinner to find out how he came by his belief no if id told anyone what i was planning they would have forbidden me you ah told lady betriz though cazaril favored the darkeyed woman with a nod stiffening betriz replied warily its why i suggested asking the first flame cazaril shrugged the first flame ah but your hand is young and strong and steady lady iselle are you sure that first flame wasnt all your doing her frown deepened the townsmen applauded indeed on average onehalf of all supplicants to come before a judges bench must depart angry and disappointed but not by that necessarily wronged that one hit the target by the change in her face the shift from defiant to stricken was not especially pleasurable to watch but but cazaril sighed im not saying you were wrong royesse this time im saying you were running blindfolded and if it wasnt headlong into a tree it was only by the mercy of the gods and not by any care of yours oh you may have slandered an honest man or you may have struck a blow for justice i dont know the point is neither do you her oh this time was so repressed as to be unvoiced the horribly practical part of cazarils mind that had eased him through so many scrapes couldnt help adding and right or wrong what i also saw was that you made an enemy and left him alive behind you great charity bad tactics damn but that was no remark to make to a gentle maiden with an effort he kept from clapping his hands over his mouth a gesture that would do nothing to prop up his pose as a highminded and earnest corrector iselles brows went up and stayed up for a moment this time so did lady betrizs after an unnervingly long and thoughtful silence iselle said quietly i thank you for your good counsel castillar he returned her an approving nod good if hed got through that sticky one all right he was halfway home with her and now thank the gods on to the provincaras generous table iselle sat back and folded her hands in her lap you are to be my secretary as well as my tutor cazaril yes cazaril sank back yes my lady you wish some assistance with a letter he almost added suggestively after dinner assistance yes but not with a letter ser dy ferrej said you were once a courier is that right i once rode for the provincar of guarida my lady when i was younger a courier is a spy her regard had grown disquietingly calculating not necessarily though it was sometimes hard to convince people otherwise we were trusted messengers first and foremost not that we werent supposed to keep our eyes open and report our observations good enough the chin came up then my first task for you as my secretary is one of observation i want you to find out if i made a mistake or not i cant very well go down into town or ask aroundi have to stay up on top of this hill in myshe grimacedfeather bed but youyou can do it she gazed across at him with an expression of the most disturbing faith his stomach felt suddenly as hollow as a drum and it had nothing to do with the lack of food apparently he had just put on slightly too good a show i i immediately she shifted uncomfortably discreetly as opportunity presents cazaril swallowed ill try what i can do my lady on his way down the stairs to his own chamber one floor below a vision surfaced in cazarils thoughts from his days as a page in this very castle hed fancied himself a bit of a swordsman on account of being a shade better than the half dozen other young highborn louts whod shared his duties and his training in the provincars household one day a new young page had arrived a short surly fellow the provincars swordmaster had invited cazaril to step up against him at the next training session cazaril had developed himself a pretty thrust or two including a flourish that with a real blade would have neatly nipped the ears off most of his comrades hed tried his special pass on the new fellow coming to a happy halt with the dulled edge flat against the newcomers headonly to look down and see his opponents light practice blade bent nearly double against his gut padding that page had gone on cazaril had heard to become the swordmaster for the roya of brajar in time cazaril had to own himself an indifferent swordsmanhis interests had always been too broadscattered for him to maintain the necessary obsession but hed never forgotten that moment looking down in surprise at his mockdeath it bemused him that his first lesson with the delicate iselle had churned up that old memory odd little flickers of intensity to burn in such disparate eyes what had that short pages name been cazaril found that a couple more tunics and trousers had arrived on his bed while he was out relics of the castle warders younger and thinner days unless he missed his guess he went to put them away in the chest at the foot of his bed and was reminded of the dead wool merchants book folded inside the black vestcloak there he picked it up thinking to walk it down to the temple this afternoon but then set it back possibly within its ciphered pages might lurk some of that moral certainty the royesse sought of himthat he had pricked her to seek of himsome clearer evidence for or against the shamed judge he would examine it himself first perhaps it would provide some guidance to the secrets of valendas local scene after dinner cazaril lay down for a marvelous little nap he was just coming to luxuriant wakefulness again when ser dy ferrej knocked on his door and delivered to him the books and records of the royesses chambers betriz followed shortly with a box of letters for him to put in order cazaril spent the remainder of the afternoon starting to organize the randomly piled lot and familiarize himself with the matters therein the financial records were fairly simplethe purchase of this or that trivial toy or bit of trumpery jewelry lists of presents given and received a somewhat more meticulous listing of jewels of genuine value inheritances or gifts clothing iselles riding horse the mule snowflake and their assorted trappings items such as linens or furniture were subsumed presumably in the provincaras accounts but would in future be cazarils charge a lady of rank was normally sent off to marriage with cartloadscazaril hoped not boatloadsof fine goods and iselle was surely due to begin the years of accumulation against that future journey should he list himself as item one in that bridal inventory he pictured the entry sectytutor one ea gift from grandmama aged thirtyfive badly damaged in shipping value the bridal procession was a oneway journey normally although iselles mother the dowager royina had returned broken cazaril tried not to think the lady ista puzzled and disturbed him it was said that madness ran in some noble families not cazarilshis family had run to financial fecklessness and unlucky political alliances instead just as devastating in the long run was iselle at risk surely not iselles correspondence was scant but interesting some early kindly little letters from her grandmother from before the widowed royina had moved her family back home from court full of advice on the general order of be good obey your mother say your prayers help take care of your little brother one or two notes from uncles or aunts the provincaras other childreniselle had no other relatives on her father the late roya iass side ias having been the only surviving child of his own illfated father a regular series of birthday and holy day letters from her much older half brother the present roya orico those were in the royas own hand cazaril noted with approval or at least he trusted the roya did not employ any secretary with such a crabbed and difficult fist they were for the most part stiff little missives the effort of a man fullgrown attempting to be kindly to a child except when they broke into descriptions of oricos beloved menagerie then they became spontaneous and flowing for the space of a paragraph or two in enthusiasm and perhaps trust that here at least was an interest the two half siblings might share on the same level this pleasant task was interrupted in turn late in the afternoon with the word brought by a page that cazarils presence was now required to ride out with the royesse and lady betriz he hastily donned the borrowed sword and found the horses saddled and waiting in the courtyard cazaril hadnt had a leg across a horse for nearly three years the page eyed him with surprise and disfavor when cazaril asked for a mounting block to ease himself gingerly aboard they gave him a nice mildmannered beast the same bay gelding hed seen the royesses waiting woman riding that first afternoon as they formed up the waiting woman leaned from a window in the keep and waved them out with a piece of linen and evident goodwill but the ride proved much milder and more placid than hed anticipated a mere jaunt down to the river and back since he declared at the outset of the excursion that all conversation by the party must be conducted in darthacan it was also largely silent adding to the general restfulness and then supper and then to his chamber where he pottered about trying on his new old clothing and folding it away and attempting the first few pages of deciphering the poor dead fool of a wool merchants book but cazarils eyes grew heavy over this task and he slept like a block till morning as it had begun so it went on in the morning lessons with the two lovely young ladies in darthacan or roknari or geography or arithmetic or geometry for geography he filched away the good maps from teidezs tutor and entertained the royesse with suitably edited accounts of some of his more exotic past journeys around chalion ibra brajar great darthaca or the five perpetually quarreling roknari princedoms along the north coast his more recent slaveseye views of the roknar archipelago he edited much more severely iselles and betrizs open boredom with court roknari he discovered was susceptible to exactly the same cure as hed used on the couple of young pages from the provincar of guaridas household hed once been detailed to teach the language he traded the ladies one word of rude roknari albeit not the most rude for every twenty of court roknari they demonstrated themselves to have memorized not that they would ever get to use that vocabulary but it might be well for them to be able to recognize things said in their hearing and they giggled charmingly cazaril approached his first assigned duty quietly investigating the probity of the provincial justiciar with trepidation oblique inquiries of the provincara and dy ferrej filled in background without supplying certainty as neither had crossed the man in his professional capacity merely in unexceptionable social contacts a few excursions down into town to try to find anyone whod known cazaril seventeen years ago and would speak to him frankly proved a little disheartening the only man who recognized him with certainty at sight was an elderly baker whod maintained a long and lucrative career selling sweets to all the castles parade of pages but he was an amiable fellow not inclined to lawsuits cazaril started working through the wool merchants notebook leaf by leaf as quickly as his other duties permitted him some truly disgusting early experiments in calling down the bastards demons had been entirely ineffective cazaril was relieved to observe the dead duelists name never appeared but with some excoriating adjectives attached or sometimes just the adjectives alone the live judges name did not turn up explicitly but before cazaril had the tangle even halfunraveled the question was taken out of his inexpert hands an officer of inquiry from the provincar of baocias court arrived from the busy town of taryoon to which the dowagers son had moved his capital upon inheriting his fathers gift it had taken cazaril counted off in his head later just about as many days as one could expect for a letter from the provincara to her son to be written dispatched and read for orders to be passed down to baocias chancellery of justice and for the inquirer to ready himself and his staff for travel privilege indeed cazaril was unsure of the provincaras allegiance to the processes of law but he wagered the business of leaving loose enemies untidily about had plucked some ah housewifely nerve of hers the next day the judge vrese was discovered to have ridden off in the night with two servants and some hastily packed bags and chests leaving a disrupted household and a fireplace full of ashes from burned papers cazaril tried to discourage iselle from taking this as proof either but that was a bit of a stretch even for his slow judgment the alternativethat iselle had been touched by the goddess that daydisturbed him to contemplate the gods the learned theologians of the holy family assured men worked in ways subtle secret and above all parsimonious through the world not in it even for the bright exceptional miracles of healingor dark miracles of disaster or deathmens free will must open a channel for good or evil to enter waking life cazaril had met in his time some two or three persons who he suspected might be truly godtouched and a few more whod plainly thought they were they had not any of them been comfortable to be around cazaril trusted devoutly that the daughter of spring had gone away satisfied with her avatars action or just gone away iselle had little contact with her brothers household across the courtyard except to meet at meals or when they made up a party for a ride out into the countryside cazaril gathered the two children had been closer before the onset of puberty had begun to drive them into the separate worlds of men and women the royses stern secretarytutor ser dy sanda seemed unnecessarily unnerved by cazarils empty rank of castillar he laid claim to a higher place at table or in procession above the mere ladies tutor with an insincerely apologetic smile that servedevery mealto draw more attention than it purported to soothe cazaril considered trying to explain to the man just how much he didnt care but doubted hed get through so contented himself with merely smiling back a response which confused dy sanda terribly as he kept trying to place it as some sort of subtle tactic when dy sanda showed up in iselles schoolroom one day to demand his maps be returned he seemed to expect cazaril to defend them as though they were secret state papers cazaril produced them promptly with gentle thanks dy sanda was forced to depart with his huff barely halfvented lady betrizs teeth were set that fellow he acts like like like one of the castle cats iselle supplied when a strange cat comes around what have you done to make him hiss at you so cazaril i promise you i havent pissed outside his window cazaril offered earnestly a remark that made betriz choke on a giggleah that was betterand look around guiltily to be sure the waiting woman was too far off to hear had that been too crude he was sure he didnt quite have the hang of young ladies yet but they had not complained of him despite the darthacan i suppose he imagines i would prefer his job he cant have thought it through or perhaps he had cazaril realized abruptly when teidez had been born his heirship to his newwed half brother orico had been much less apparent but as year had followed year and oricos royina still failed to conceive a child interestpossibly unhealthy interestin teidez must surely have begun to grow in the court of chalion perhaps that was why ista had left the capital taking her children out of that fervid atmosphere to this quiet clean country town a wise move withal oh no cazaril said iselle stay up here with us its much nicer indeed yes he assured her its not just youve twice ser dy sandas wits and ten times his travels why do you endure him so so betriz seemed at a loss for words quietly she finally finished she stared away for a moment as if afraid he would construe shed swallowed a term less flattering cazaril smiled crookedly at his unexpected partisan do you think it would make him happier if i presented myself as a target for his foolishness clearly yes well then your question answers itself she opened her mouth and closed it iselle nearly choked on a short laugh cazarils sympathy for dy sanda increased however one morning when he turned up his face so drained of blood as to be almost green with the alarming news that his royal charge had vanished away not to be found in house or kitchen kennel or stable cazaril buckled on his sword and readied himself to ride out with the searchers his mind already quartering the countryside and the town weighing the options of injuries bandits the river taverns was teidez old enough yet to attempt a whore reason enough to scrape off his clinging attendants before cazaril was moved to point out the range of possibilities to dy sanda whose mind was utterly fixated on bandits teidez himself rode in to the courtyard muddy and damp a crossbow slung over his shoulder a boy groom following behind and a dead fox hung over his saddlebow teidez stared at the halfassembled cavalcade with surly horror cazaril abandoned his attempt to climb on his horse without pulling something that hurt lowered himself to a seat on his mounting block with the bay geldings reins in his hand and watched in fascination as four grown men began to belabor the boy and the obvious where have you been scarcely needed asked why did you do that likewise why didnt you tell anyone grew more apparent by the minute teidez endured it with his teeth closed for the most part when dy sanda paused for breath teidez thrust his limp and ruddy prey at beetim the huntsman here skin this for me i want the pelt pelts no good at this season young lord said beetim severely the hairs all thin and falls out he shook his finger at the vixens dark dugs heavy with milk and its bad luck to take a mother animal in the daughters season ill have to burn its whiskers or its ghostll be back stirring up my dogs all night long and where are the cubs eh you shouldve slain them as well while you were at it its right cruel to leave them to starve or have you two gone and hidden them somewhere eh his glower took in the shrinking boy groom teidez threw his crossbow to the cobbles and snarled in exasperation we looked for the den we couldnt find it yes and you dy sanda turned on the unlucky groom you know you should have come to me he abused the groom in much blunter terms than hed dared to vent upon the royse ending with the command beetim go beat the boy for his stupidity and insolence with a will mlord said beetim grimly and stalked away toward the stables the foxs scruff in one hand and the cowering grooms in the other the two senior grooms led the horses back to their stalls cazaril gave up his mount gladly and considered his breakfastnow it appeared not to be indefinitely delayed dy sanda anger succeeding his terror confiscated the crossbow and drove the sullen teidez indoors teidezs voice floated back in a last counterargument before the door banged closed upon the pair but im so bored cazaril puffed a laugh five gods but what a horrible age that was to be for any boy all full of impulses and energy plagued with incomprehensible arbitrary adults with stupid ideas that did not involve skipping morning prayers to go fox hunting on a fair spring morninghe glanced up at the sky overhead brightening to a washed cerulean as the dawn mists burned away the quietude of the provincaras household balm to cazarils soul was doubtless acid to poor constricted teidez any word of advice from the newly employed cazaril was not likely to be well received by dy sanda as matters stood between them at present but it seemed to cazaril that if dy sanda was looking to guard his future influence over the royse when he came to a mans estate with its full power and privilege of a high lordat the very leastof chalion he was going about it exactly backward teidez was more likely to shed him at the first opportunity still dy sanda was a conscientious man cazaril had to grant a viler man of like ambition might well be pandering to teidezs appetites instead of attempting to control them winning not loyalty but addiction cazaril had met a noble scion or two so corrupted by his attendants but not in dy baocias household while the provincara was in charge teidez was unlikely to encounter such parasites on that comforting reflection cazaril pushed off the block and climbed to his feet the royesse iselles sixteenth birthday fell at the midpoint of spring some six weeks after cazaril had come to valenda the birthday present sent down this year from the capital at cardegoss by her brother orico was a fine dappled gray mare an inspiration either well calculated or very lucky for iselle flew into transports over the shimmering beast cazaril had to concede it was a royal gift and he was able to avoid the problem of his damaged handwriting a little longer as it was no trouble at all to persuade iselle to make her thankyou in her own hand to send with the royal couriers return but cazaril found himself subjected in the days following to the most minute and careful not to say embarrassing inquiries from iselle and betriz after his health little gifts of the best fruit or viands were sent down the table to tempt his appetite he was encouraged to go early to bed and drink a little wine but not too much both ladies persuaded him out to frequent short walks in the garden it wasnt till dy ferrej let fall a casual joke to the provincara in his hearing that cazaril caught on that iselle and her handmaiden had been constrained to temper their gallops out of consideration for the new secretarys supposedly frail health cazarils wits overtook his indignation just barely in time to confirm this canard with a straight face and a convincingly stiff gait their feminine attentions however blatantly selfinterested were too lovely to scorn and it wasnt that much of an act both the improving weather and truth to tell his improving condition baited him into relenting after all soon enough the summer heat would be upon them and slow life down again after watching both girls stick to their horses over logs and down the twisting trails by the river flashing along in ripples of gold and green from the half shade of the new leaves overhead his concern for their safety eased it was his horse shying sideways after startling a doe out of a thicket that dumped him violently into a mess of rocks and tree roots knocking his wind out and popping an adhesion in his back he lay wheezing the woods blurred with tears of pain till two frightened female faces wavered into his view against the lace of leaves and sky it took the pair of them and the help of a fallen tree to get him loaded back up on his recaptured horse the return trip up the hill to the castle was as demure and ladylike not to mention guilty a walk as ever the governesses could have wished the world had stopped twisting around his head in odd little jerks by the time they rode through the arched gate but the torn adhesion was a burning agony marked by a lump the size of an egg beneath his tunic it would likely darken to black and take weeks to subside arriving safe at last in the courtyard he had no attention for anything but the mounting block the groom and again getting off the damned horse alive secure on the ground he stood for a moment head bent against the saddlebow grimacing with pain caz the familiar voice smote his ears out of nowhere his head came up he blinked around striding toward him his arms held out was a tall athletic man with dark hair dressed in an elegant red brocade tunic and high riding boots five gods whispered cazaril and then palli caz caz i kiss your hands i kiss your feet the tall man seized him nearly knocking him over made the first half of his greeting literal but traded the second for an embrace instead caz man id thought you were dead no no palli his pain threefourths forgotten he grabbed the darkhaired mans hands in turn and turned to iselle and betriz whod abandoned their horses to the grooms and drifted up in open curiosity royesse iselle lady betriz permit me to introduce the ser dy palliarhe was my good right arm at gotorgetfive gods palli what are you doing here i could ask you the same with more reason palli replied and made his bow to the ladies who eyed him with increasing approval the two years and more since gotorget had done much to improve his alreadypleasant looks not that they hadnt all looked like depraved scarecrows at the end of the siege royesse my lady an honorbut its the march dy palliar now caz oh said cazaril and gave him an immediate apologetic nod my condolences is it a recent loss palli returned an understanding duck of his chin almost two years gone now the old man had suffered an apoplectic stroke while we were still closed up in gotorget but he hung on till just after i made it home thanks be to the father of winter he knew me i was able to see him at the last tell him of the campaignhe offered up a blessing for you you know on his last day though we both thought we were praying for the lost dead caz man where did you go i wasnt ransomed not ransomed how not ransomed how could you not be ransomed it was an error my name was left off the list dy jironal said the roknari reported you died of a sudden fever cazarils smile grew tight no i was sold to the galleys pallis head jerked back some error no wait that makes no sense cazarils grimace and his hand pressed palm down before his chest stopped pallis protest on his lips though it didnt quench the startled look in his eyes palli always could take a hint if you clouted him with it hard enough the twist of his mouth said very well but i will have this out of you later by the time he turned to ser dy ferrej coming up to observe this reunion with an interested expression his cheerful smile was back in place my lord dy palliar is taking wine with the provincara in the garden the castle warder explained do join us cazaril thank you palli took his arm and they turned to follow dy ferrej out of the courtyard and halfaround the keep to the little plot where the provincaras gardener grew flowers in good weather she made it her favorite bower for sitting outdoors three strides and cazaril was trailing palli shortened his step abruptly at cazarils stumble and eyed him sidelong the provincara waited their return with a patient smile enthroned under an arching trellis of climbing roses not yet in bloom she waved them to the chairs the servants had brought out cazaril lowered himself onto a cushion with a wince and an awkward grunt bastards demons said palli under his breath did the roknari cripple you only half lady iselleoofseems bent on completing the task gingerly he eased himself back and that fool horse the provincara frowned at the two young ladies who had tagged along uninvited iselle were you galloping she inquired dangerously cazaril waved a diverting hand it was all the fault of my noble steed my ladyattacked it thought by a horseeating deer it went sidewise i didnt thank you he accepted a glass of wine from the servant with deep appreciation and sipped quickly trying not to let it slosh the unpleasant shaky feeling in his gut was passing off now iselle cast him a grateful glance which her grandmother did not miss the provincara sniffed faint disbelief by way of punishment she said iselle betriz go and change out of those riding clothes and into something suitable for supper we may be country folk here we need not be savages they dragged off with a couple of backward glances at the fascinating visitor but how came you here palli cazaril asked when the double distraction had passed around the corner of the keep palli too stared after them and seemed to have to shake himself back awake close your mouth man cazaril thought in amusement i have to oh im riding up to cardegoss to dance attendance at court mfather always used to break his journeys here being thick with the old provincarwhen we passed near valenda i made to presume and sent a messenger and mladyhe nodded to the provincarawas kind enough to bid me bide id have cuffed you if youd failed to make your duty to me said the provincara amiably with admirable illogic id not seen your father nor you for far too many years i was sorry to hear of his passing palli nodded he continued to cazaril we plan to rest the horses overnight and go on tomorrow at a leisurely pacethe weathers too fine to be in a rush there are pilgrims on the roads to every shrine and templeand those who prey on em alasthere were bandits reported in the hill passes but we didnt find em you looked said cazaril bemused not finding bandits had been all his desire on the road hey i am the lord dedicat of the daughters order at palliar now ill have you knowin my fathers shoes i have duties you ride with the soldierbrothers more like with the baggage train its all keeping the books and collecting rents and chasing the damned equipment and logistics the joys of commandwell you know you taught them to me one part glory to ten parts shoveling manure cazaril grinned that good a ratio youre blessed palli grinned back and accepted cheese and cakes from the servant i lodged my troop down in town but you caz as soon as i said gotorget they asked me if wed metyou could have knocked me over with a straw when mlady said youd turned up here having walkedwalkedfrom ibra and looking like something the cat hawked up the provincara gave a small unrepentant shrug at cazarils faintly reproachful glance her way ive been telling them war stories for the past half hour palli went on hows your hand cazaril curled it in his lap much recovered he hastened to change the subject whats forward at court for you well id not had the chance to make formal oath to orico since mfather died and also im to represent the daughters order of palliar at the investiture investiture said cazaril blankly ah has orico finally given out the generalship of the daughters order asked dy ferrej since the old general died i hear every high family in chalion has been badgering him for the gift i should imagine said the provincara lucrative and powerful enough even if it is smaller than the sons oh aye said palli its not been announced yet but its knownits to be dondo dy jironal the younger brother of the chancellor cazaril stiffened and sipped wine to hide his dismay after a rather long pause the provincara said what an odd choice one usually expects the general of a holy military order to be more personally austere but but said dy ferrej chancellor martou dy jironal holds the generalship of the order of the son two in one family its a dangerous concentration of power the provincara murmured martou is also to become the provincar dy jironal if rumor is true as soon as old dy ildar stops lingering i hadnt heard that said palli sounding startled yes said the provincara dryly the ildar family is not too happy i believe theyd been counting on the provincarship for one of the nephews palli shrugged the brothers jironal certainly ride high in chalion by oricos favor i suppose if i were clever i would find some way of grabbing on to their cloakhems and riding along cazaril frowned into his wine and groped for a way to divert the topic what other news do you hear well these two weeks gone the heir of ibra has raised his banner in south ibraagainagainst the old fox his father everyone had thought last summers treaty would hold but it seems they had some secret fallingout last autumn and the roya repudiated it again the heir said the provincara presumes ibra does have another son after all orico supported the heir the last time observed palli to chalions cost murmured cazaril it seemed to me orico was taking the long view in the end said palli surely the heir must win one way or another it will be a joyless victory for the old man if his son loses said dy ferrej in a tone of slow consideration no i wager theyll spend more mens lives and then make it up again between them over the bodies a sad business said the provincara tightening her lips no good can come of it eh dy palliar tell me some good news tell me oricos royina is with child palli shook his head ruefully not as ive heard lady well then let us go to our supper and talk no more politics it makes my old head ache his muscles had seized up while he was sitting despite the wine cazaril almost fell over trying to rise from his chair palli caught him by the elbow and steadied him and frowned deeply cazaril gave him a tiny shake of his head and went off to wash and change and examine his bruises in private supper was a cheerful meal attended by most of the household dy palliar no slouch at table when it came to either food or talk held the attention of everyone from the lord teidez and lady iselle down to the youngest page with his tales despite the wine he kept his head in the high company and told only the merry stories with himself more as butt than hero the account of how hed followed cazaril on a night sortie against the roknari sappers and so discouraged them for a month thereafter drew wideeyed stares upon cazaril as well as himself they clearly had a hard time picturing the royesses timid softspoken secretary grinning in the dirt and the soot scrambling through the burning rubble with a dirk in his hand cazaril realized he disliked the stares he wanted to be invisible here twice palli tried to toss the conversational ball to him to take a turn at the entertaining and twice he fielded it back to palli or to dy ferrej after the second attempt fell flat palli desisted from trying to draw him out the meal ran very late but at last came the hour cazaril had been both longing for and dreading when all parted for the night and palli knocked on his chamber door cazaril bade him enter pushed the trunk to the wall tossed a cushion upon it for his guest and settled himself upon his bed both he and it creaked audibly palli sat and stared across at him in the dim double candlelight and began with a directness that revealed the trend of his mind all too clearly error caz have you thought about that cazaril sighed i had nineteen months to think of it palli i rubbed every possibility as thin as an old coin in my brain i thought of it till i was sick to death of the thinking and called it done its done this time palli brushed the hint firmly aside do you think it was the roknari taking revenge upon you by hiding you from us and saying you died thats one except that i saw the list or did someone leave you off the list on purpose palli persisted the list was in martou dy jironals own hand that was my final conclusion pallis breath blew out vile a vile betrayal after what we suffereddammit caz when i get up to court i am going to tell march dy jironal of this hes the most powerful lord in chalion the gods know together i wager we can get to the bottom of no cazaril lurched upright from his cushions terrified dont palli dont even tell dy jironal i exist dont discuss it dont mention meif the world thinks im dead so much the better if id realized that was so i would have stayed in ibra just drop it palli stared but valenda is hardly the end of the world of course people will learn youre alive its a quiet peaceful place im not bothering anyone here other men were as brave some were stronger it was pallis wits that had made him cazarils favorite lieutenant at gotorget it only needed the one thread to start him unraveling his eyes narrowed glinting in the soft candlelight dy jironal himself five gods what did you ever do to him cazaril shifted uncomfortably i think it was not personal i think it was just a little favor for someone a little easy favor then two men must know the truth gods caz which two palli would go nosing incazaril must either tell him nothingtoo late alreadyor else enough to stop him nothing halfway pallis brain would keep plucking at the puzzleit was doing so even now who would hate you so you were always the most agreeable manyou were downright famous for refusing duels and leaving the bullroarers to look like the fools they werefor making peace for wheedling out the most amazing treaty terms for avoiding factionbastards hell you didnt even make bets on games little easy favor what could possibly drive such an implacable cruel hatred of you cazaril rubbed his brow which was beginning to ache and not from tonights wine fear i think pallis lips screwed up in astonishment and if it becomes known you know theyll fear you too its not something i wish to see fall on you palli i want you to steer clear if its that degree of fear the fact that weve even talked together will make me suspect their fear plus my ignorancegods caz dont send me blindfolded into battle i want never to send any man into battle again the fierceness in his own voice took even cazaril by surprise pallis eyes widened but the solution the way to use pallis own ravenous curiosity against him came to cazaril in that moment if i tell you what i know and how i know it will you give me your wordyour wordto drop it dont pursue it dont mention it dont mention meno dark hints no dancing about the issue what as you are doing now said palli dryly cazaril grunted half in amusement half in pain just so palli sat back against the wall and rubbed his lips merchant he said amiably to make me buy a pig in a bag without ever seeing the animal oink murmured cazaril i only want to buy the squeal yknowdamn all right i never knew you to lead us over wet ground unknowing nor into ambush ill trust your judgmentto the exact extent you trust my discretion my word on that a neat counterthrust cazaril could not but admire it he sighed very well he sat silent for a moment after thiswelcomedual surrender marshaling his thoughts where to begin well it wasnt as though he hadnt gone over it and over it and over it in his mind a most polished tale for all it had never crossed his lips before its quickly enough told i first met dondo dy jironal to speak to four no its five now five years ago i was in guaridas train in that little border war against the mad roknari prince olusyou know the fellow who made a habit of burying his enemies up to the waist in excrement and burning them alivethe one who was murdered about a year later by his own bodyguards oh yes id heard of him ended head down in the excrement they say there are several versions but he was still in control at that time lord dy guarida had cornered oluss armywell rabbleup in the hills at the edge of his princedom lord dondo and i were sent as the envoys under the flag of parley to deliver an ultimatum to olus and arrange the terms and ransoms things went badly in the conference and olus decided he only required one messenger to return his defiance to the assembled lords of chalion so he stood us up dondo and me in his tent surrounded by four of his monster guards with swords and gave us a choice whichever of us would cut off the others head would be permitted to ride with it back to our lines if we both refused we both would die and hed return both our heads by catapult palli opened his mouth but the only comment he managed was ah cazaril took a breath i was given the first chance i refused the sword olus whispered to me in this weird oily voice you cannot win this game lord cazaril i said i know mhendi but i can make you lose it he was quiet for a little but then he just laughed then he turned round and gave the chance to dondo who was green as a corpse by then palli stirred but didnt interrupt he signaled cazaril mutely to go on one of the guards knocked me to my knees and stretched my head by the hair over a footstool dondotook his cut on the guards arm said palli eagerly cazaril hesitated no he said at last but olus at the last moment thrust his sword between us and dondos sword came down on its flat and slid cazaril could still hear the sharp scraping skree of metal on metal in his memorys ear i ended up with a bruise across the back of my neck that was black for a month two of the other guards wrestled the sword back from dondo and then we were both mounted up on our horses and sent back to dy guaridas camp as my hands were being tied to my saddle olus came up to me again and whispered now we shall see who loses it was a very silent ride back until we were in sight of camp and dondo turned and looked at me for the first time and said if you ever tell this tale i will kill you and i said dont worry lord dondo i only tell amusing tales at table i should have just sworn silence i know better now and yet maybe even that would not have been enough he owes you his life cazaril shook his head and looked away ive seen his soul stripped naked i doubt he can ever forgive me for that well i didnt speak of it of course and he let it lie i thought that was the end of it but then came gotorget and then came well what came after gotorget and now i am doubly damned if dondo ever learns if he ever realizes that i know exactly how i came to be sold to the galleys what do you think my life will be worth then but if i say nothing do nothing nothing to remind him perhaps he has forgotten by now i just want to be left alone in this quiet place he surely has more pressing enemies these days he turned his face back to palli and said tensely dont you ever mention me to either of the jironals ever you never heard this story you scarcely know me if you ever loved me palli leave it be pallis lips were pressed together his oath would hold him cazaril thought but he made a little unhappy gesture nonetheless as you will but but damn damn he stared for long across the dim chamber at cazaril as if searching for whoknewwhat in his face its not just that dreadful excuse for a beard you are much changed am i well so how palli looked away looked back how bad was it really in the galleys cazaril shrugged i was fortunate in my misfortunes i survived some did not one hears all sorts of horrific stories how the slaves are terrorized or misused cazaril scratched his slandered beard it was too filling in a bit he fancied the stories are not so much untrue as twisted exaggeratedexceptional events mistaken as daily bread the best captains treated us as a good farmer treats his animals with a sort of impersonal kindness food waterhehexerciseenough cleanliness to keep us free of disease and in good condition beating a man senseless makes him unfit to pull his oar you know anyway that sort of physical discipline was only required in port once at sea the sea supplied all i dont understand cazarils brows flicked up why break a mans skin or his head when you can break his heart simply by putting him overboard in the water with his legs dangling down like worms for the great fishes the roknari only had to wait a very little to have us swim after and beg and plead and weep for our slavery again you were always a strong swimmer surely that helped you bear it better than most pallis voice was hopeful the opposite im afraid the men who sank like stones went mercifully quickly think about it palli i did he still did sitting up bolt upright in the dark in this bed from some nightmare of the water closing over his head or worse not once the wind had come up unexpectedly while the oarmaster had been playing this little game with a certain recalcitrant ibran and the captain anxious for port before the storm had refused to circle back the ibrans fading screams had echoed over the water as the ship drew away growing fainter and fainter the captain had docked the oarmaster the cost of the slaves replacement as punishment for his misjudgment which had made him surly for weeks after a moment palli said oh oh indeed grant you my prideand my mouthdid win me one beating when i first went aboard but i still fancied myself a lord of chalion then i was broken of that later but you werent they didnt make you an object of i mean use you after a degrading um the light was too dim to tell if palli reddened but it finally dawned on cazaril that he was trying to inquire in this worried and tonguetumbled fashion if cazaril had been raped cazarils lips twisted in sympathy you are confusing the roknari fleets with those of darthaca i think im afraid those legends represent wishful thinking on someones part the roknari heresy of the four gods makes a crime of the sort of odd loves the bastard rules here the roknari theologians say the bastard is a demon like his father and not a god after his holy mother and so call us all devil worshipperswhich is a deep offense to the lady of summer i think as well as to the poor bastard himself for did he ask to be born they torture and hang men caught in sodomy and the better roknari shipmasters do not tolerate it aboard in either men or slaves ah palli settled in relief but then being palli thought to ask and the worse roknari shipmasters their discretion could become deadly it didnt happen to mei fancy i was too bonybut a few of the young men the softer boys we slaves knew they were our sacrifice and we tried to be kind to them when they were returned to the benches some cried some learned to use the mischance for favors few of us begrudged them the extra rations or trivial treats so dearly bought it was a dangerous game for the roknari inclined to them in secret were like to turn on them at any moment and slay them as if they could so slay their own sin you make my hair stand on end i thought i knew my way around the world but eh but at least you were spared the worst i dont know what is the worst said cazaril thoughtfully i was once used after a vile humor for the space of one hellish afternoon that made what happened to some of the boys look like a friendly gesture but no roknari risked hanging for it cazaril realized hed never told anyone of the incident not the kind acolytes of the temple hospital not certainly anyone in the provincaras household hed had no one he could talk to till now he continued almost eagerly my corsair made the mistake of tackling a lumbering brajaran merchanter and spotted its escorting galleys too late as we were being chased off i failed at my oar fainted in the heat to make some use of me despite all the oarmaster hauled me out of my chains stripped me and hung me over the stern rail with my hands tied to my ankles to mock our pursuers i couldnt tell if the crossbow bolts that thumped into the rail or the stern around me were good or bad aim on the brajaran archers parts nor by what gods mercy i didnt end my life with a few in my ass maybe they thought i was roknari maybe they were trying to end my misery for the sake of pallis widening eyes cazaril skipped certain of the more grotesque details you know we lived with fear for months on end at gotorget till we were used to it a sort of nagging ache in the gut that we learned to ignore but that never quite went away palli nodded but i found out that this is odd i dont quite know how to say it hed never had a chance to try to put it into words out where he could see it till now i found there is a place beyond fear when the body and the mind just cant sustain it anymore the world time reorder themselves my heartbeat slowed down i stopped sweating and salivating it was almost like some holy trance when the roknari hung me up id been weeping in fear and shame in agony for the disgust of it all when the brajarans finally veered off and the oarmaster took me down all blistered from the sun i was laughing the roknari thought i had gone mad and so withal did my poor benchmates but i didnt think so the whole world was all new of course the whole world was only a few dozen paces long and made of wood and rocked on the water all time was the turning of a glass i planned my life by the hour as closely as one plans a year and no further than an hour all men were kind and beautiful each in his way roknari and slave alike lordly or vile blood and i was a friend to all and smiled i wasnt afraid anymore i did take care never to faint at my oar again though his voice slowed thoughtfully so whenever fear comes back into my heart i am more pleased than anything for i take it as a sign that i am not mad after all or maybe at least getting better fear is my friend he looked up with a quick apologetic smile palli was sitting plastered back against the wall his legs tense his dark eyes round as saucers smiling fixedly cazaril laughed out loud five gods palli forgive me i did not mean to make you a donkey for my confidences to carry them safely away or perhaps he had for palli would be going away tomorrow after all they make a motley menagerie to burden you with im sorry palli waved away his apology as if batting a stinging fly his lips moved he swallowed and managed are you sure it wasnt just sunstroke cazaril chuckled oh i had the sunstroke too of course but if it doesnt kill you sunstroke passes off in a day or two this lasted months until the last incident with that terrified defiant ibran boy and cazarils resultant final flogging we slaves stop that cried palli running his hands through his hair stop what asked cazaril in puzzlement stop saying that we slaves you are a lord of chalion cazarils smile twisted he said gently we lords at our oars then we sweating pissing swearing grunting gentlemen i think not palli on the galleys we were not lords or men we were men or animals and which proved which had no relation i ever saw to birth or blood the greatest soul i ever met there had been a tanner and i would kiss his feet right now with joy to learn he yet lived we slaves we lords we fools we men and women we mortals we toys of the godsall the same thing palli they are all the same to me now after a long indrawn breath palli changed the subject abruptly to the little matters of managing his escort from the daughters military order cazaril found himself comparing useful tricks for treating leather rot and thrush infections in horses hooves soon thereafter palli retiredor fledfor the night an orderly retreat but cazaril recognized its nature all the same cazaril lay down with his pains and his memories despite the feast and the wine sleep was a long time coming fear might be his friend if that wasnt just bluff and bluster for pallis sake but it was clear the dy jironal brothers were not the roknari reported youd died of a fever was a lie outright and cleverly quite uncheckable by now well he was surely sheltered here in quiet valenda he hoped hed cautioned palli sufficiently to walk warily at the court in cardegoss and not put a foot in a pile of old manure unawares cazaril rolled over in the darkness and sent up a whispered prayer to the lady of spring for pallis safety and to all the gods and the bastard too for the deliverance of all upon the sea tonight at the temple pageant celebrating the advent of summer iselle was not invited to reprise her role of the lady of spring because that part was traditionally taken by a woman newwed a very shy and demure young bride handed off the throne of the reigning gods avatar to an equally wellbehaved matron heavy with child cazaril saw out of the corner of his eye the divine of the holy family heave a sigh of relief as the ceremony concluded this time without any spiritual surprises life slowed cazarils pupils sighed and yawned in the stuffy schoolroom as the afternoon sun baked the stones of the keep and so did their teacher one sweaty hour he abruptly surrendered and canceled for the season all classes after the noon nuncheon as betriz had said the royina ista did seem to do better as the days lengthened and softened she came more often to the familys meals and sat almost every afternoon with her lady attendants in the shade of the gnarled fruit trees at the end of the provincaras flower garden she was not however permitted by her guardians to climb to the dizzy breezy perches upon the battlements favored by iselle and betriz to escape both the heat and the disapproval of various aging persons disinclined to mount stairs driven from his own bedchamber by its dogbreath closeness on a hazy hot day following an unusually heavy nights rain cazaril ventured into the garden seeking a more comfortable perch himself the book under his arm was one of the few in the castles meager library he had not previously read not that ordols the fivefold pathway of the soul on the true methods of quintarian theology was exactly one of his passions perhaps its leaves fluttering loosely in his lap would make his probable nap look more scholarly to passersby he rounded the rose arbor and halted as he discovered the royina accompanied by one of her ladies with an embroidery frame occupying his intended bench as the women looked up he dodged a couple of delirious bees and made an apologetic bow to them for his unintended intrusion stay castillar dy cazaril is it murmured ista as he turned to withdraw how does my daughter go on in her new studies very well my lady said cazaril turning back and ducking his head she is very quick at her arithmetic and geometry and very um persistent in her darthacan good said ista thats good she stared away briefly across the sunbleached garden the companion bent over her frame to tie off a thread lady ista did not embroider cazaril had heard it whispered by a maidservant that she and her ladies had worked for half a year upon an elaborate altar cloth for the temple just as the last stitches were set the royina had suddenly seized it and burned it in the fireplace of her chamber when her women had left her alone for a moment true tale or not her hands held no needle today but only a rose cazaril searched her face for deeper recognition i wondered i have meant to ask you my lady if you remembered me from the days i served your noble father as a page here a score of years ago now so it would be no wonder if you had forgotten me he ventured a smile i had no beard then helpfully he pressed his hand over the lower half of his face ista smiled back but her brows drew down in an effort of recognition that was clearly futile im sorry my late father had many pages over the years indeed he was a great lord well no matter cazaril shifted his book from hand to hand to hide his disappointment and smiled more apologetically he feared her nonrecall had nothing to do with her nervous state he had more likely simply never registered upon her in the first place an eager young woman looking forward and upward not down or back the royinas companion hunting in her color box murmured drat and glanced up in appraisal at cazaril my lord dy cazaril she said smiling invitingly if it would be no trouble to you might you stay and keep my lady good company while i run up to my room and find my dark green silk no trouble at all lady said cazaril automatically that is um he glanced at ista who gazed back at him levelly with an unsettling tinge of irony well it wasnt as though ista were given to shrieking and raving even the tears he had sometimes seen in her eyes welled silently he gave the companion a little half bow as she rose she seized him by the arm and took him a little way around the arbor she stood on tiptoe to whisper in his ear all will be well just dont mention lord dy lutez and stay by her till i return if she starts going on again about old dy lutez just dont leave her she darted off cazaril considered this hazard the brilliant lord dy lutez had been for thirty years the late roya iass closest advisor boyhood friend brother in arms boon companion over time ias had loaded him with every honor that was his to command making him provincar of two districts chancellor of chalion marshal of his household troops and master of the rich military order of the sonall the better to control and compel the rest men murmured it had been whispered by enemies and admirers alike that dy lutez was roya in chalion in all but name and ias his royina cazaril sometimes wondered if it had been weakness or cleverness on iass part to let dy lutez do the dirty work and take the heat of the high lords grumbling leaving his master with the name only of ias the good though not cazaril conceded ias the strong nor ias the wise nor the gods knew ever ias the lucky it was dy lutez who had arranged iass second marriage to the lady ista surely giving lie to the persistent rumor among the highborn of cardegoss of an unnatural love between the roya and his lifelong friend and yet five years after the marriage dy lutez had fallen from the royas grace and all his honors abruptly and lethally accused of treason hed died under torture in the dungeons of the zangre the great royal keep at cardegoss outside of the court of chalion it was whispered that his real treason had been to love the young royina ista in more intimate circles a considerably more hushed whisper had it that ista had at last persuaded her husband to destroy her hated rival for his love however the triangle was arranged in the shrinking geometry of death it had collapsed from three points to two and then as ias turned his face to the wall and died not a year after dy lutez one alone and ista had taken her children and fled the zangre or was exiled therefrom dy lutez dont mention dy lutez dont mention therefore most of the history of chalion for the past generation and a half right cazaril returned to ista and somewhat warily sat in the departed companions chair ista had taken to shredding her rose not wildly but very gently and systematically plucking the petals and laying them upon the bench beside her in a pattern mimicking their original form circle within circle in an inward spiral the lost dead visited me in my dreams last night ista continued conversationally though they were only false dreams do yours ever visit you so cazaril cazaril blinked and decided she was too aware for this to be dementia even if she was a trifle elliptical and besides he had no trouble catching her meaning which would surely not be the case if she were mad sometimes i dream of my father and mother for a little time they walk and talk as in life so i regret to wake again and lose them anew ista nodded false dreams are sad that way but true dreams are cruel the gods spare you from ever dreaming their true dreams cazaril cazaril frowned and cocked his head all my dreams are but confused throngs and disperse like smoke and vapors upon my waking ista bent her head to her denuded rose she now was spreading the golden powdery stamens fine as snips of silk thread in a tiny fan within the circle of petals true dreams sit like lead upon the heart and stomach weight enough to drown our souls in sorrow true dreams walk in the waking day and yet betray us still as certainly as any man of flesh might swallow back his vomited promises like a dog its castup dinner dont put your trust in dreams castillar or in the promises of men she raised her face from her array of petals her eyes suddenly intent cazaril cleared his throat uncomfortably nay lady that would be foolish but its pleasant to see my father from time to time for i shall not meet him any other way again she gave him an odd tilted smile you dont fear your dead no my lady not in dreams perhaps your dead are not very fearsome folk for the most part no maam he agreed high in the wall of the keep a casement window swung wide and istas companion leaned out and stared down into the garden apparently reassured by the sight of her lady in gentle conversation with her shabby courtier she waved and disappeared again cazaril wondered how ista passed the time she did not sew apparently nor did she seem much of a reader nor did she keep musicians of her own cazaril had seen her sporadically at prayers some weeks spending hours in the ancestors hall or at the little portable altar kept in her chambers or far more rarely escorted by her ladies and dy ferrej down to the temple in town though never at its crowded moments other times weeks would pass when she seemed to keep no observances to the gods at all have you much consolation in prayers lady he asked curiously she glanced up and her smile flattened a trifle i i have not much consolation anywhere the gods have surely made a mock of me i would return the favor but they hold my heart and my breath hostage to their whims my children are prisoners of fortune and fortune is gone mad in chalion he offered hesitantly i think there are worse prisons than this sunny keep lady her brows rose and she sat back oh aye were you ever to the zangre in cardegoss yes when i was a younger man not lately it was a vast warren i spent half my time lost in it strange i was lost in it too it is haunted you know cazaril considered this matteroffact comment i shouldnt be surprised it is the nature of a great fortress that as many die in it as build it win it lose it men of chalion the renowned roknari masons before us the first kings and men before them im sure who crept into its caves on back into the mists of time it is that sort of prominence high home of royas and nobles for generationsrank on rank of men and women had ended their lives in the zangre some quite spectacularly some quite secretly the zangre is older than chalion itself it surely accumulates ista began gently pressing the thorns from her rose stem and lining them up in a row like the teeth of a saw yes it accumulates thats the word precisely it collects calamity like a cistern as its slates and gutters collect rainwater you will do well to avoid the zangre cazaril ive no desire to attend court my lady i desired to once with all my heart the gods most savage curses come upon us as answers to our own prayers you know prayer is a dangerous business i think it should be outlawed she began to peel her rose stem thin green strips pulling away to reveal fine white lines of pith cazaril had no idea what to say to this so merely smiled hesitantly ista began to pull the whip of pith apart lengthwise a prophecy was told of the lord dy lutez that he should not drown except upon a mountaintop and that he never feared to swim thereafter no matter how violent the waves for everyone knows there is no water upon a mountaintop it all runs away to the valleys cazaril swallowed panic and looked around surreptitiously for the returning attendant she was not yet in sight lord dy lutez it was said had died under the water torture in the dungeons of the zangre beneath the castle stones but still high enough above the town of cardegoss he licked slightly numb lips and tried you know i never heard that while the man was alive it is my opinion that some talespinner made it up later to sound shivery justifications tend to accrue posthumously to so spectacular a fall as his was her lips parted in the strangest smile yet she drew the last threads of the stem pith apart aligned them upon her knee and stroked them flat poor cazaril how did you grow so wise cazaril was saved from trying to think of an answer for this by istas attendant who emerged again from the door of the keep with a hank of colored silk in her hands cazaril leapt to his feet and nodded to the royina your good lady returns he gave a little bow in passing to the attendant who whispered urgently to him was she sensible my lord yes perfectly in her way nothing of dy lutez nothing remarkable nothing he cared to remark upon certainly the attendant breathed relief and passed on fixing a smile on her face ista regarded her with bored tolerance as she began chattering about all the items that shed had to overturn and hunt through to find her strayed thread it crossed cazarils mind that no daughter of the provincaras nor mother of iselles could possibly be short of wit if ista spoke to very many of her duller company with the cryptic leaps of thought shed sprung on him it was little wonder rumors circulated of madness and yet her occasional opacity of discourse felt more like cipher than babble to him of an elusive internal consistency if only one held the key to it which granted he did not not that that wasnt also true of some sorts of madness he had seen cazaril clutched his book and went off to seek some less disturbing shade summer advanced at a lazy pace that eased cazarils mind and body both only poor teidez chafed at the inactivity hunting being curtailed by the heat the season and his tutor he did pot rabbits with a crossbow in the dawn mists around the castle to the earnest applause and approval of all the castles gardeners the boy was so outofseasonhot and restless and plumpif ever there was a born dedicat to the son of autumn god of the hunt war and cooler weather cazaril judged it was surely teidez cazaril was a little surprised to be accosted on the way to nuncheon one warm noon by teidez and his tutor judging by both their reddened faces they were in the middle of another of their tearing arguments lord caz teidez hailed him breathlessly didnt the old provincars swordmaster too take the pages to the abattoir to slay the young bullsto teach them courage in a real fight not this this dancing about in the dueling ring well yes see what did i tell you teidez cried to dy sanda we practiced in the ring too cazaril added immediately for the sake of solidarity should dy sanda need it the tutor grimaced bullbaiting is an old country practice royse not befitting training for the highborn you are destined to be a gentlemanat the leastnot a butchers apprentice the provincara kept no swordmaster in her household these days so shed made sure the royses tutor was a trained man cazaril who had occasionally watched his practice sessions with teidez respected dy sandas precision dy sandas swordsmanship was pretty enough if not quite brilliant sporting honorable but if dy sanda also knew the desperate brutal tricks that kept men alive on the field he had not shown them to teidez cazaril grinned wryly the swordmaster wasnt training us to be gentlemen he was training us to be soldiers ill give his old method this creditany battlefield i was ever on was a lot more like a butchers yard than it was like a dueling ring it was ugly but it taught us our business and there was no waste to it i cant think it mattered at the end of the day to the bulls whether they died after being chased around for an hour by a fool with a sword or were simply stalled and thwacked on the head with a mallet though cazaril had not cared to stretch the business out as some of the young men had making macabre and dangerous play with the maddened animals with a little practice he had learned to dispatch his beast with a sword thrust nearly as quickly as the butcher might grant you on the battlefield we didnt eat what we killed except sometimes the horses dy sanda sniffed disapproval at his wit he offered placatingly to teidez we might take the hawks out tomorrow morning my lord if the weather holds fine and if you finish your cartography problems a ladies sportwith hawks and pigeonspigeons what do i care for pigeons in a voice of longing teidez added at the royas court at cardegoss they hunt wild boar in the oak forests in the fall thats a real sport a mans sport they say those pigs are dangerous very true said cazaril the big tuskers can disembowel a dogor a horse or a man theyre much faster than you expect did you ever hunt at cardegoss teidez asked him eagerly i followed my lord dy guarida a few times there valenda has no boars teidez sighed but we do have bulls at least its something better than pigeonsor rabbits oh potting rabbits is a useful soldiers training too cazaril offered consolingly in case you ever have to hunt rats for table its much the same skill dy sanda glared at him cazaril smiled and bowed out of the argument leaving teidez to his badgering over nuncheon iselle took up a descant version of a similar song though the authority she assailed was her grandmother and not her tutor grandmama its so hot cant we go swimming in the river as teidez does as the summer simmered on the royses afternoon rides with his gentlemantutor and his grooms and the pages had been exchanged for afternoon swims at a sheltered pool in the river upstream of valendathe same spot overheated denizens of the castle had frequented when cazaril had been a page the ladies were of course excluded from these excursions cazaril had politely declined invitations to join the party pleading his duties to iselle the true reason was that stripping naked to swim would display all the old disasters written in his flesh a history he did not care to expound upon the misunderstanding with the bath man still mortified him in memory certainly not said the provincara that would be entirely immodest not with him said iselle make up our own party a ladies party she turned to cazaril you said the ladies of the castle swam when you were a page servants iselle said her grandmother wearily lesser folk its not a pastime for you iselle slumped hot and red and pouting betriz spared the unbecoming flush drooped at her place looking pale and wilted instead soup was served everyone sat eyeing their steaming bowls with revulsion maintaining the standardsas alwaysthe provincara picked up her spoon and took a determined sip cazaril said suddenly but the lady iselle can swim can she not your grace i mean she presumably was taught when she was younger certainly not said the provincara oh said cazaril oh dear he glanced around the table royina ista was not with them this meal relieved of concern for a certain obsessive subject he decided that he dared that puts me in mind of a most horrible tragedy the provincaras eyes narrowed she did not take the bait betriz however did oh what it was when i was riding for the provincar of guarida during a skirmish with the roknari prince olus oluss troops came raiding over the border under the cover of night and a storm i was told off to evacuate the ladies of dy guaridas household before the town was encircled near dawn after riding half the night we crossed a high freshet one of his provincaras ladiesinwaiting was swept off when her horse fell and was carried away by the force of the waters together with the page who went after her by the time id got my horse turned around they were out of sight we found the bodies downstream next morning the river was not that deep but she panicked not having any idea how to swim a little training might have turned a fatal accident into merely a frightening one and three lives saved three lives said iselle the lady the page she had been with child oh a very daunted silence fell the provincara rubbed her chin and eyed cazaril a true story castillar yes cazaril sighed her flesh had been bruised and battered cold bluetinged inert as clay beneath his clutching fingers her sodden clothes heavy but not as heavy as his heart i had to tell her husband huh grunted dy ferrej the tables most reliable raconteur he did not try to top this tale its not an experience i ever wish to repeat added cazaril the provincara snorted and looked away after a moment she said my granddaughter cannot go sporting about naked in the river like an eel iselle sat up but suppose we wore oh linen shifts its true if one needed to swim in an emergency one would most likely have clothes still on cazaril said helpfully betriz added wistfully under her breath and we could cool off twice once when we swam and once when we sat about drying out cannot some lady of the household instruct her cazaril coaxed they do not swim either said the provincara firmly betriz nodded confirmation they just wade she glanced up could you teach us how to swim lord caz iselle clapped her hands oh yes i uh cazaril stammered on the other hand in that company he might keep his shirt on without comment i suppose so if your ladies went along he glanced across at the provincara and if your grandmother would permit me after a long silence the provincara growled grudgingly mind you dont all catch chills iselle and betriz prudently suppressed hoots of triumph but they cast cazaril sparkling glances of gratitude he wondered if they thought he had made up the story of the nightride drowning the lessons began that afternoon with cazaril standing in the middle of the river trying to persuade two rather stiff young women that they would not drown instantly if they got their hair wet his fear that he had overdone the dire safety warnings gradually passed as the women at length relaxed and learned to let the waters buoy them up they were naturally more buoyant than cazaril though his months at the provincaras table had driven a deal of the wolfgauntness from his bearded face his patience proved justified by the end of the summer they were splashing and diving like otters in the droughtshrunken stream cazaril had merely to sit in the shallows in water up to his waist and call occasional suggestions his choice of vantage had only partly to do with staying cool the provincara was right he had to allowswimming was lewd and loose linen shifts thoroughly wetted down and clinging to lithe young bodies made fair mockery of the modesty they attempted to preserve a stunning effect he carefully did not point out to his two blithe charges worse the effect cut two ways wet linen trews clinging to his loins revealed a state of mindum bodyum recovering healththat he earnestly prayed they would not notice iselle didnt seem to anyway he was not entirely sure about betriz their middleaged ladyinwaiting nan dy vrit who declined the lessons but waded about in the shallows fully dressed with her skirts hoisted to her calves missed nothing in the play and was clearly hardpressed to control her snickers charitably she seemed to grant him his good faith and did not laugh at him out loud nor tattle on him to the provincara at least he didnt think she did cazaril was uncomfortably conscious that his awareness of betriz was increasing day by day not yet to the point of slipping anonymous bad poetry under her door thank the gods for the shreds of his sanity playing the lute under her window was perhaps fortunately no longer within his gift and yet in the long summer quiet of valenda he had begun to dare to think of a life beyond the turning of an hourglass betriz did smile at himthat was true he did not delude himself and she was kind but she smiled at and was kind to her horse too her honest friendly courtesy was hardly ground enough to build a dream mansion upon let alone bring bed and linens and try to move in still she did smile at him he stifled the idea repeatedly but it kept popping upalong with other things alas especially during swimming lessons but hed sworn off ambitionhe didnt have to make a fool of himself anymore dammit his embarrassing arousal might be a sign of returning strength but what good did it do him he was as landless and penniless as in his days here as a page and with far fewer hopes he was mad to entertain fantasies of either lust or love and yet betrizs father was a landless man of good blood living a life of service surely he could not despise a like sojourner not despise cazaril nody ferrej was too wise for that but he was also wise enough to know his daughters beauty and connection with the royesse was a dowry that could bring her something rather better in the way of a husband than fortuneless cazaril or even the local petty gentrys sons who served the provincaras household as pages now betriz clearly considered the boys to be annoying puppies anyway but some of them had elder brothers heirs of their modest estates today he sank down in the water to his chin and pretended not to watch through his eyelashes as betriz scrambled up onto a rock translucent linen dripping black hair streaming down over her trembling curves she stretched her arms to the sun before bellyflopping forward to splash iselle who ducked and shrieked and splashed her back the days were shortening now the nights were cooling and likewise the afternoons the festival of the ascent of the son of autumn was at hand it had been too cool to swim all last weekonly a few days were likely left warm enough to make these private wet river excursions tolerable fast gallops and the hunt would soon entice his ladies to drier delights and his good sense would return to him like a strayed dog wouldnt it the slanting light and chilling air drove the lingering swimming party from the water to dry a while on the stony banks cazaril was so drenched in mellow ease that he didnt even make them conduct their idle chitchat in darthacan or roknari at last he pulled on his heavy riding trousers and bootsgood new boots a gift from the provincaraand his sword belt he tightened the browsing horses girths and removed their hobbles and helped the ladies mount reluctantly with many backward glances at the sylvan river glade falling behind the little cavalcade wound up the hill to the castle in a spurt of recklessness cazaril pressed his horse forward to match pace with betrizs she glanced across at him quick fugitive dimple winking was it want of courage or want of wits that turned his tongue to wood in his mouth both he decided he and the lady betriz attended iselle together daily if some ponderous attempt of his at dalliance should prove unwelcome might it damage the precious ease that had grown between them in the royesses service nohe must he would say somethingbut her horse broke into a trot at the sight of the castle gate and the moment was lost as they entered the courtyard the scrape of their horses hooves echoing hollowly on the cobbles teidez burst from a side door crying iselle iselle cazarils hand leapt to his sword hilt in shockthe boys tunic and trousers were bespattered with bloodthen fell away again at the sight of the dusty and grimy dy sanda trudging along behind his charge teidezs gory appearance was merely the result of an afternoon training session at valendas butchers yard it wasnt horror that drove his excited cries but rapture the round face he turned up to his sister was shining with joy iselle the most wonderful thing has happened guess guess how am i to guess she began laughing impatiently he waved this away his news tumbled from his lips a courier from roya orico just arrived you and i are ordered to attend upon him this fall at court in cardegoss and mother and grandmama are not invited iselle were going to escape from valenda were going to the zangre iselle whooped and slid from her saddle to grab her brothers reeking hands and whirl with him around the courtyard betriz leaned on her saddlebow and watched her lips parted in thrilled delight their ladyinwaiting pursed her lips in much less delight cazaril caught ser dy sandas eye the royses tutors mouth was set in a grim frown cazarils stomach lurched as the coins of conclusion dropped the royesse iselle was ordered to court therefore her little household would accompany her to cardegoss including her handmaiden lady betriz and her secretary the royse and royesses caravan approached cardegoss from the south road they struggled up a rise to find the whole of the plain between the cradling mountains rolling out below their feet cazarils nostrils flared as he drew in the sharp wind cold rain last night had scoured the air clean tumbling banks of slateblue clouds shredded away to the east echoing the lines of the wrinkled bluegray ranges hugging the horizon light from the west thrust across the plains like a sword stroke rising up on its great rock jutting out above the angle where two streams met dominating the rivers the plains the mountain passes and the eyes of all beholders the zangre caught the light and blazed like molten gold against the dark retreating cloud banks its ochre stone towers were crowned and capped with slate roofs the color of the scudding clouds like an array of iron helmets upon a valiant band of soldiers favored seat of the royas of chalion for generations the zangre appeared from this vantage all fortress no palace as dedicated to the business of war as any soldierbrother sworn to the holy orders of the gods royse teidez urged his black horse forward next to cazarils bay and stared eagerly at their goal his face lit with a kind of awed avarice hunger for the promise of a larger life free of the careful constraints of mothers and grandmothers cazaril supposed certainly but teidez would have to be much duller than he appeared not to be wondering right now if this luminous miracle of stone could be his someday why indeed had the boy been called to court if orico despairing at last of ever getting heirs of his own body was not meaning to groom him as his successor iselle halted her dappled gray and stared nearly as eagerly as teidez strange i remembered it as larger somehow wait till we get closer cazaril advised dryly ser dy sanda in the van motioned them forward and the whole train of riders and pack mules started down the muddy road once more the two royal youths their secretaryguardians lady betriz servants grooms armed outriders in the greenandblack livery of baocia extra horses snowflakewho might at this point more aptly be named mudpotand all their very considerable baggage cazaril veteran of a number of hairtearingly aggravating noble ladies processions regarded the progress of the convoy as a wonder of dispatch it had taken only five days to ride from valenda four and a half really royesse iselle ably backed by betriz had driven her subhousehold with verve and efficiency not one of the journeys inevitable delays could be laid to her feminine caprice in fact both teidez and iselle had pushed their entourage to its best speed from the moment theyd ridden out of valenda and galloped ahead to outdistance istas heartwrenching wails audible even over the battlements iselle had clapped her hands over her ears and steered her horse with her knees till shed escaped the echo of her mothers extravagant grief the news that her children were ordered from her had thrown the dowager royina if not into madness outright into deep distraction and despair she had wept and prayed and argued and at length gone silent a relief of sorts dy sanda had confided to cazaril how shed cornered him and tried to bribe him into flying with teidez where and how being unclear he described her as gibbering clutching barely short of foamflecked she had cornered cazaril too in his chamber packing his saddlebags the night before the departure their conversation went rather differently or at least whatever it had been it wasnt gibbering she had regarded him for a long silent and unnerving moment before saying abruptly are you afraid cazaril cazaril considered his reply and finally answered simply and truthfully yes my lady dy sanda is a fool you at least are not not knowing what to say to this cazaril inclined his head politely she inhaled her eyes gone huge and said protect iselle if ever you loved me or your honor protect iselle swear it cazaril i swear her eyes searched him but rather to his surprise she did not demand more elaborate protestations or reassuring repetitions from what shall i protect her cazaril asked cautiously what do you fear lady ista she stood silent in the candlelight cazaril recalled pallis effective entreaty lady please do not send me blindfolded into battle her lips puffed as from a blow to the stomach but then she shook her head in despair whirled away and rushed from the room her attendant obviously worried to the point of exasperation had blown out her breath and followed her despite the memory of istas infectious agitation cazaril found his spirits lifted from their mire of dread by the young peoples excitement as their goal neared the road met the river that flowed out of cardegoss and ran alongside it as they descended into a wooded area at length cardegosss second stream joined the main a chill draft coursed through the shaded valley on the side of the river opposite the road three hundred feet of cliff face erupted from the ground and soared aloft here and there little trees clung desperately to crevices and ferns spilled down over the rocks iselle paused to stare up and up cazaril reined his horse in beside hers from here one could not even see the beginnings of the human masons puny defensive additions decorating the top of this natural fortress wall oh said iselle my added betriz joining them craning in their necks the zangre said cazaril has never in its history been taken by assault i see breathed betriz a few floating yellow leaves promise of autumn to come whirled away down the dark stream the party pressed their horses forward climbing up out of the valley to where a great stone arch leading to one of the seven gates of the city spanned the stream cardegoss shared the streamcarved plateau with the fortress the town ramparts flared back along the tops of the ravines like the shape of a boat with the zangre at its prow then turned inward in a long wall forming the stern in the clear light of this crisp afternoon the city failed signally to look sinister markets glimpsed down side streets were bright with food and flowers thronged with men and women bakers and bankers weavers and tailors and jewelers and saddlers together with such trades and crafts that were not required by their need for running water to be down by the riversides offered their wares the royal company rode through the misnamed temple square which had five sides one for each of the big regional motherhouses of the gods holy orders divines acolytes and dedicats strode along looking more harried and bureaucratic than ascetic in the squares vast paved center the familiar cloverleafandtower shape of cardegosss temple of the holy family bulked impressively more extensive than the homey little version in valenda to teidezs illconcealed impatience iselle demanded a stop here and sent cazaril scurrying into the temples echoing inner courtyard to lay an offering of coins upon the altar of the lady of spring in gratitude for their safe journey an acolyte took charge of it with thanks and stared curiously at cazaril cazaril mumbled a brief distracted prayer and hurried back out to mount again climbing the long shallow slope toward the zangre they passed through streets where houses of the nobility built of dressed stone and with elaborate iron grilles protecting windows and gates loomed shoulder to shoulder high and square the dowager royina had lived in one such for a time in her early widowhood iselle excitedly identified three possible candidates for her childhood home until overcome with confusion she made cazaril promise to determine later which had been hers at last they rode up to the great gate of the zangre itself a natural cleft across the plateau opened just before it into a sharp shadowed crevice more daunting than any moat on the far side huge boulders formed the lowest course of stones in the walls irregular but fitting so tightly a knife blade could not have slid between them atop them fine roknari work its delicate traceries of geometric decoration seeming sugar rather than stone atop that yet more crispcut stone towering higher and higher as if men competed with the gods who had thrown up the great rock the whole edifice stood upon the zangre was the only castle cazaril had ever been in where he suffered whirling vertigo standing at the bottom looking up a horn sounded from above and soldiers in the livery of roya orico saluted as they rode across the drawbridge and through the narrow archway into the courtyard lady betriz clutched her reins and stared around with her lips parted the courtyard was dominated by a huge high rectangular tower newest and crispest the addition of the reign of roya ias and lord dy lutez cazaril had always wondered if its great size was a measure of the mens strength or their fears a little beyond it almost as high a round tower loomed at one corner of the main block its slate roof was tumbled in and its tall top ragged and broken dear gods said betriz staring at the half ruin what happened there why dont they repair it ah said cazaril thrown into tutorial mode considerably more for his own reassurance than betrizs thats the tower of roya fonsa the wise known more commonly after his death as fonsa the fairlywise they say he used to walk upon it all night trying to read the will of the gods and the fate of chalion in the stars on the night he worked his miracle of death magic upon the golden general a great storm and gouts of lightning threw down the roof and set a fire that didnt burn out until morning despite the torrents of rain when the roknari had first invaded from the sea they had overrun most of chalion ibra and brajar in their first violent burst even past cardegoss to the very feet of the southern mountain ranges darthaca itself had been threatened by their advance parties but from the ashes of the weak old kingdoms and the harsh cradle of the hills new men had emerged fighting for generations to regain what had been lost in those first few years warriorthieves they made an economy of raiding noble fortunes were not made but stolen turnabout for the roknari idea of tax collection was a column of soldiers taking all in their winding path at swords point like locusts in arms bribe and counterbribe turned the columns back until chalion was become an odd interlocking dance of counting armies and armed accountants but over time the roknari were pushed back north toward the sea again leaving behind as legacy a residue of castles and brutality at length the invaders were reduced to the five squabbling princedoms hugging the north coast the golden general the lion of roknar had looked to reverse the ebb of his history by war guile and marriage he had in ten blazing years united all five princedoms for almost the first time since the roknari had landed barely thirty hed gathered a great tide of men into his hands preparing to sweep south once more declaring he would wipe the quintarian heretics and the worship of the bastard from the face of the land with fire and sword desperate and disunited chalion ibra and brajar were losing against him on every front more ordinary forms of assassination failing death magic was tried upon the golden genius a dozen times and more without result fonsa the wise from deep study reasoned that the golden general must be the chosen of one of the gods no sacrifice less than that of a king could balance his thundering destiny fonsa had lost five sons and heirs one after another in the wars to the north ias his last and youngest was locked in bitter struggle with the roknari for the final mountain passes blocking their invasion routes one stormy night taking only a divine of the bastard who was in his confidence and a loyal young page fonsa had mounted his tower locking its door behind him the courtiers of chalion had pulled three charred bodies from the rubble the following morning only the differing heights allowed them to tell divine from page from roya shocked and terrified the trembling court had awaited its fate the courier from cardegoss galloping north with the news of loss and woe met the courier galloping south from ias with news of victory funeral and coronation were celebrated simultaneously within the zangres walls cazaril stared around at those walls now when roysenow royaias returned from the war he went on to betriz he ordered the lower windows and doors of his dead fathers tower bricked up and proclaimed that no one should enter it again a dark flapping shape launched itself from the towers top and betriz squeaked and ducked crows have nested in it ever since cazaril noted tilting his head back to watch the black silhouette wheel against the intense blue sky i believe its the same flock of sacred crows the divines of the bastard feed in the temple yard intelligent birds the acolytes make pets of them and teach them to speak iselle who had drawn closer as cazaril had discoursed upon her royal grandfathers fate asked what do they say not much cazaril admitted with a quick grin at her i never saw one that had a vocabulary of more than three squawks although some of the acolytes insisted they were saying more warned by the outrider dy sanda had sent on ahead a swarm of grooms and servants rushed out to assist the arriving guests the zangres castle warder with his own hands positioned a mounting bench for royesse iselle perhaps thrown into consciousness of her dignity by this gentlemans bending gray head she used the step for a change parting from her horse with ladylike grace teidez tossed his reins to a bowing groom and stared about with shining eyes the warder made rapid conference with dy sanda and cazaril of a dozen practical details from stabling the horses and grooms tocazaril grinned brieflystabling the royse and royesse the warder escorted the royal children to their rooms in the left wing of the main block followed by a parade of servants lugging the baggage teidez and his entourage were given half a floor iselle and her ladies the floor above them cazaril was assigned a small room on the gentlemens floor but at the very end he wondered if he was expected to guard the staircase rest and refresh yourselves the warder said the roya and royina will receive you at a celebratory banquet this evening attended by all the court a rush of servants bringing wash water clean linens bread fruit pastries cheese and wine assured the visitors from valenda that they were not abandoned to starve between now and then where are my royal brother and sisterinlaw iselle asked the warder the warder made her a little bow the royina is resting the roya is visiting his menagerie which is a great consolation to him id like to see it she said a little wistfully he has often written me of it tell him so hell like to show it to you the warder assured her with a smile the ladies party was soon deeply involved in a frantic turning out of luggage to select garments for the banquet an exercise that quite clearly did not require cazarils inexpert assistance he directed the servant to place his trunk in his narrow room and depart dropped his saddlebags on his bed and rooted through them to find the letter to orico the provincara had strictly charged him to deliver into the royas hand and no other at his earliest possible moment upon arrival he paused only to wash the road dirt from his hands and spare a quick glance out his window the deep ravine on this side of the castle seemed to plunge straight down below his sill a dizzying glint of water from the stream was just visible through the treetops far below cazaril only lost his way once on the way to the menagerie which was outside the walls and across the gardens an adjunct of the stables if nothing else he could identify it by the sharp acrid smell of strange manures neither human nor equine cazaril stared into an arched aisle of the stone building his eyes adjusting to its cool shade and diffidently entered a couple of former stalls were converted to cages for a pair of wonderfully glossy black bears one was asleep on a pile of clean golden straw the other stared up at him lifting its muzzle and sniffing hopefully as cazaril passed on the other side of the aisle stalls housed some very strange beasts that cazaril could not even put a name to like tall leggy goats but with long curving necks mild and liquid eyes and thick soft fur in a room to one side a dozen large brilliantly colored birds on perches preened and muttered and other tiny equally bright ones twittered and flitted in cages lining the wall across from the aviary in an open bay he found human occupants at last a neat groom in the royas livery and a fat man sitting crosslegged on a table holding a leopard by its jeweled collar cazaril gasped and froze as the man ducked his head right next to the great cats open jaws the man was currying the beast vigorously a cloud of yellow and black hairs rose from the pair as the leopard writhed on the table in what cazaril recognized after a blink as feline ecstasy cazarils eye was so locked by the leopard it took him another moment to recognize the man as roya orico the dozen years since cazaril had last glimpsed him had not been kind orico had never been a handsome man even in the vigor of his youth he was a little below average in height with a short nose unfortunately broken in a riding accident in his teens and now looking rather like a squashed mushroom in the middle of his face his hair had been auburn and curly it was now roan still curly but much thinner his hair was the only thing about him that was thinner his body was grossly broadened his face was pale and puffy with baggy eyelids he chirped at his spotted cat who rubbed its head against the royas tunic shedding more hairs then licked the brocade vigorously with a tongue the size of a washcloth evidently pursuing a large gravy stain that had trailed down over the royas impressive paunch the royas sleeves were rolled up and half a dozen scabbed scratches scored his arms the great cat caught a bare arm and held it in its yellow teeth briefly but did not close its jaws cazaril unwound his clutching fingers from his sword hilt and cleared his throat as the roya turned his head cazaril fell to one knee sire i bear you respectful greetings from the dowager provincara of baocia and this her letter he held out the paper and added just in case no one had mentioned it to him yet royse teidez and royesse iselle are arrived safely sire oh yes the roya jerked his head at the elderly groom who went to relieve cazaril of the letter with a graceful bow her grace the dowager instructed me to deliver it into your hand cazaril added uncertainly yes yesjust a moment with some effort orico bent over his belly to give the cat one quick hug then clipped a silver chain to its collar chirping some more he urged it to leap lightly from the table he dismounted more heavily and said here umegat this was evidently the grooms name not the cats for the man stepped forward and took the silver leash in exchange for the letter he led the beast to its cage a little way down the aisle unceremoniously shoving it in with a knee to its rump when it paused to rub on the bars cazaril breathed a little easier when the groom locked the cage orico broke the seal scattering wax on the swept tiled floor absently he motioned cazaril to his feet and read slowly down the provincaras spidery handwriting pausing to move the paper closer or farther and squinting now and then cazaril falling easily back into his old courier mode folded his hands behind his back and waited patiently to be questioned or dismissed at oricos will cazaril eyed the groomhead groomas he waited even without the clue of the name the man was obviously of roknari descent umegat had been tallish but was now a little stooped his skin which must have been burnished gold in his youth was leathery its color faded to ivory fine wrinkles wreathed his eyes and mouth his curly bronze hair going gray was tightly bound to his head in two braids that ran from his temples over his crown to meet in the back in a neat queue an old roknari style it made him look pure roknari though halfbreeds abounded in chalion roya orico himself had a couple of roknari princesses up his family tree on both the chalionese and brajaran sides the source of the family hair the groom wore the service livery of the zangre tunic and leggings and a kneelength tabard with the symbol of chalion a royal leopard rampant upon a stylized castle stitched upon it he looked considerably tidier and more fastidious than his master orico finished the letter and sighed royina ista upset was she he said to cazaril she was naturally disturbed to be parted from her children said cazaril cautiously i was afraid of that cant be helped as long as she is disturbed in valenda and not in cardegoss ill not have her here shes too difficult he rubbed his nose on the back of his hand and sniffed tell her grace the provincara she has all my esteem and assure her that i have concerned myself with her grandchildrens good fates they have their brothers protection i plan to write to her tonight sire to assure her of our safe arrival i will convey your words orico nodded shortly rubbed his nose again and squinted at cazaril do i know you i shouldnt think so sire i am lately appointed by the dowager provincara to be secretary to the royesse iselle i had served the late provincar of baocia as a page in my youth he added by way of recommendation he did not mention his service in dy guaridas train which might well trigger the royas more recent memory not that he had ever been more than one of the crowd of dy guaridas men a little unplanned disguise was surely lent him by his recent beard his grayflecked hair his general debilitationif orico didnt recognize him was there a chance that others also might not he wondered how long he could go here at cardegoss without giving his own name too late to change it alas he could remain anonymous a little while longer it appeared for orico nodded in apparent satisfaction and waved his hand in dismissal youll be at the banquet then tell my fair sister i look forward to seeing her there cazaril bowed obediently and withdrew he chewed worriedly upon his lower lip as he made his way back to the gate of the zangre if all the court was to attend tonights welcoming banquet chancellor the march dy jironal oricos chief staff and support would not be absent and where the march went his brother lord dondo usually attended upon him maybe they wont remember me either it had been well over two years since the fallshameful saleof gotorget and longer than that since the unpleasant incident in mad prince oluss tent cazarils existence could never have been more than a petty irritation to these powerful lords they could not know that he had realized his sale to the galleys had been calculated betrayal and not mischance if he did nothing to draw attention to himself they would not be reminded of what they had forgotten and he would be safe a fools hope cazarils shoulders hunched and his stride lengthened back in his high chamber cazaril fingered his sober brown wool robe and black vestcloak longingly but obedient to the orders sent down from the floor above via a breathless maidservant he donned much gaudier garb an eggshellblue tunic with turquoise brocade vestments and dark blue trousers from the old provincars store still smelling faintly of the spices theyd been packed with as proof against moths boots and sword completed a courtiers attire even if it lacked the wealth of rings and chains at teidezs urgent behest cazaril stumped upstairs to check if his ladies were ready yet there to discover that he was part of an ensemble iselle was arrayed in her finest favored blueandwhite gown and robes and betriz and the ladyinwaiting wore layers featuring turquoise and nightblue respectively someone in the party had come down on the side of restraint and iselle was decked in jewels befitting a maiden mere diamond sparks in her ears a brooch at her cleavage one enameled belt and only two rings betriz displayed some of the rest of the inventory on loan cazaril stood straighter and regretted his resplendency less determined to hold up his part for iselle after only some seven or eight delays for lastminute exchanges and adjustments of clothing or decoration cazaril herded them all downstairs to join teidez and his little entourage of rank consisting of dy sanda the baocian captain who had guarded their journey and his chief sergeant at arms the latter pair in their best livery all with jewelhilted swords swishing and clinking they followed the royal page who was sent to guide them to oricos throne room they paused briefly in the antechamber where they formed up in proper order under the whispered instructions from the castle warder doors swung wide sweet horns sounded and the warder announced in stentorian breaths the royse teidez dy chalion the royesse iselle dy chalion ser dy sanda and on down the pack in strict order of rank ending with lady betriz dy ferrej castillar lupe dy cazaril sera nan dy vrit betriz glanced up sideways at cazaril her brown eyes suddenly merry and murmured under her breath lupe your first name is lupe cazaril considered himself excused from attempting to reply by their situationjust as well as it would doubtless have come out thoroughly garbled the room was thronged with courtiers and ladies glittering and rustling the air thick with perfume incense and excitement in this crowd he realized his garments were modest and unobtrusivein his austere brown and black hed have looked a crow among peacocks even the walls were dressed in red brocade on a raised dais at the end of the room sheltered by a red brocade canopy fringed with gold braid roya orico and his royina were seated on gilded chairs side by side orico was looking much better this evening washed up and in clean clothes even with a dash of color in his puffy cheeks very nearly kingly beneath his gold circlet crown after a stodgy middleaged fashion royina sara was elegantly dressed in matching scarlet robes and sat very upright almost prim in her seat now in her midthirties her earlier prettiness was fading and worn her expression was a little wooden and cazaril wondered how mixed her feelings must be at this royal reception in her long infertility she had failed her chief duty to the royacy of chalionif the failure was hers even when cazaril had been on the fringes of court years ago it was whispered that orico had never got a bastard though at the time this lack was attributed to an excessive loyalty to his marriage bed teidezs elevation was also the royal couples public acknowledgment of a most private despair teidez and iselle advanced to the dais in turn they exchanged fraternal kisses of welcome upon the hands with the roya and royina though the full formal kisses of submission upon forehead hands and feet were not required of them tonight each member of their entourage was also granted the boon of kneeling and kissing the royal hands saras was chill as wax beneath cazarils respectful lips cazaril stood behind iselle and braced his back to endure as the royal siblings prepared to receive a long line of courtiers none of whom could be insulted by being left out or denied a personal introduction or touch cazarils breath stopped in his throat as he recognized the first and foremost pair of men to advance the march dy jironal was dressed in the full court robes of the general of the holy military order of the son in layers of brown orange and yellow dy jironal was not much changed from when cazaril had last seen him three years ago when cazaril had accepted the keys of gotorget and the trust of its command from his hand in his field tent he was still spare graying cool of eye tense with energy likely to forget to smile the broad sword belt that crossed his chest was thick with enamel and jewels in the symbols of the son weapons and animals and wine casks the heavy gold chain of the office of the chancellor of chalion circled his neck three large sealrings decorated his hands that of his own rich house of chalion and of the sons order no others cluttered his fingersa wealth of jewels could not possibly have added more impact to that casual display of power lord dondo dy jironal also wore the robes of a holy general in the blue and white of the daughters order stockier than his brother with an unfortunate tendency to profuse sweat at forty he still radiated the family dynamism except for his new honors he appeared unchanged unaged from when cazaril had last seen him in his brothers camp cazaril realized hed been hoping dondo would at least have run to fat like orico given his infamous indulgences at table in bed and in every other possible pleasure but he was only a little paunchy the glitter on his hands not to mention his ears neck arms and goldspurred boot heels made up for whatever display of family wealth his brother disdained dy jironals gaze passed over cazaril without pause or recognition but dondos black eyebrows drew down as he waited his turn and he frowned at cazarils blankly affable features his frown deepened abruptly but dondos searching look was torn from cazaril as his brother motioned a servant to bring forward the gifts he was presenting to royse teidez a silvermounted saddle and bridle a fine hunting crossbow and an ash boar spear with a wickedly gleaming chased steel point teidezs excited thanks were entirely genuine lord dondo after his formal introductions snapped his fingers and a servant holding a small casket stepped forward and opened it with a gesture worthy of theater he drew from it an enormously long string of pearls which he held high for all to see royesse i welcome you to cardegoss in the name of my holy order my glorious family and my noble person may i present you with double your length in pearls he brandished the string which was indeed as long as the surprised iselle was high and give thanks to the gods that you are not a taller lady or i should be bankrupted a chuckle ran through the courtiers at his joke he smiled engagingly at her and murmured may i without waiting for reply he bent forward and laid the rope over her head she flinched a little as his hand briefly touched her cheek but fingered the gleaming spheres and smiled back in astonishment she stammered out pretty thanks and dondo bowedtoo low cazaril thought sourly the gesture seemed tinged with subtle mockery to his eye only then did dondo take a moment to murmur in his brothers ear cazaril could not make out the low words but he thought he saw dondos bearded lips shape the word gotorget dy jironals glance at cazaril grew startled and sharp for an instant but then both men had to make way for the next noble lord in line a daunting number of rich or clever welcoming gifts were pressed upon the royse and royesse cazaril found himself taking charge of iselles lot and with betrizs help making detailed notes as to their givers to add to the household inventory later courtiers swarmed around the youths cazaril thought dryly like flies around spilled honey teidez was elated to the point of giggling dy sanda was a little stiff both gratified and strained iselle though also clearly elated conducted herself with fair dignity she took alarm only once when a roknari envoy from one of the northern princedoms tall and goldenskinned with his tawny hair dressed in elaborate braids was introduced to her his fine embroidered linen robes fluttered like banners with his sweeping bow she curtseyed back with unsmiling but controlled courtesy and thanked him for a beautiful belt of carved corals jade and gold links teidezs gifts were more varied though running heavily to weapons iselles were mostly jewelry although they included no less than three fine music boxes at length all the gifts not immediately worn were placed on a table for display under the guard of a couple of pagesdisplay of the givers wealth wit or generosity after all being better than half their purposeand the crowd of cardegosss elite filed into the banqueting hall the royse and royesse were conducted to the high table and seated on either side of orico and his royina they were flanked in turn by the jironal brothers chancellor dy jironal smiling a bit tightly at the fourteenyearold teidez dondo evidently trying to make himself pleasant to iselle though it could be seen that he laughed louder at his wit than she did cazaril was seated at one of the long tables perpendicular to the rooms front above the salt and not too far from his charge he discovered the middleaged man on his right to be an ibran envoy the ibrans treated me well during my last sojourn in your country cazaril ventured politely after their mutual introductions deciding to avoid mentioning the details how came you to cardegoss my lord the ibran smiled in a friendly manner you are the royesse iselles man eh well besides the undoubted attractions of the hunting in cardegoss in the fall the roya of ibra dispatched me to persuade roya orico not to support the heirs new rebellion in south ibra the heir accepts aid from darthaca i believe he will find it a gift that turns to bite him in time his heirs rebellion is a painful contretemps for the roya of ibra cazaril said truthfully but with studied neutrality the old fox of ibra had doubledealt with chalion enough times in the last thirty years to be considered a dubious friend and a dangerous enemythough if this ghastly stopandstart war with his son was the retribution of the gods for his slyness the gods were surely to be feared i do not know roya oricos mind but it seems to me that to back youth against age is to bet on a surety they must make up again or time will decide for the old man to defeat his son is like to defeating himself not this time ibra has another son the envoy glanced around and leaned closer to cazaril lowering his voice a fact that did not escape the attention of the heir to secure himself he struck last fall at his younger brother a foul and secret attackalthough he claims now it was not ordered by him but was the wild work of minions who misunderstood some careless words understood them all too well id say the attempt to make away with young royse bergon was thwarted thank the gods and bergon rescued but the heir has finally pushed his fathers mercy over the line there will be no peace between them this time short of south ibras abject surrender a sad business cazaril said i hope they may all come to their senses aye agreed the envoy he smiled in dry appreciation perhaps of cazarils neat avoidance of declaring a preference and let his patent persuasion rest the zangres food was wondrous and left cazaril close to crosseyed with repletion the court removed to the chamber where the dancing was to be held where roya orico promptly fell asleep in his chair to cazarils envy the court musicians were excellent as ever royina sara didnt dance either but her cold face softened in apparent enjoyment of the music and her hand kept time on her chair arm cazaril took his burdened digestion to a side wall propped his shoulders comfortably and watched younger and more vigorous or lessstuffedfull folk promenade turn and sway gracefully to the delicate strains neither iselle nor betriz nor even nan dy vrit lacked for partners cazaril frowned as betriz took her place in the figure with her third no fifth young lord royina ista hadnt been the only concerned parent to corner him before hed left valenda so had ser dy ferrej watch out for my betriz he had pleaded she ought to have her mother or some older lady who knows the way of the world but alas dy ferrej had been torn between fear of disaster and hope for opportunity help her beware of unworthy men roisterers landless hangerson you know the type like himself cazaril couldnt help wondering on the other hand should she meet someone solid honorable id not be averse to her choosing with her heart you know a nice fellow like oh say your friend the march dy palliar that airy example did not sound quite random enough to cazarils ear had betriz already formed a secret fondness palli alas was not present here tonight having returned to his district after the installment of lord dondo in his holy generalship cazaril could have welcomed a friendly and familiar face in all this crowd he glanced aside at a movement to find a face familiar and coolly smiling but not one he welcomed chancellor dy jironal gave him a slight bow of greeting he pushed off the wall and returned it his wits fought their way through a fog of food and wine to full alertness dy cazaril it is you we had thought you were dead id wager so no my lord i escaped some of your friends feared you had deserted none of my friends would fear any such thing but the roknari reported you had died a foul lie sir cazaril didnt say whose lie his only daring they sold me to the galleys with the unransomed men vile i thought so its a miracle you survived the ordeal yes it was cazaril blinked and smiled sweetly did you at least recover your ransom money as the price of that lie or did some thief pocket it id like to think that someone paid for the deception i dont recall it would have been the quartermasters business well it was all a dreadful mischance but it has come right in the end indeed i shall have to hear more of your adventures sometime when you will my lord dy jironal nodded austerely smiling and moved on evidently reassured cazaril smiled back pleased with his selfcontrolif it wasnt just his sick fear he could it seemed smile and smile and not launch himself at the lying villains throatill make a courtier yet eh his worst fears assuaged cazaril abandoned his futile attempt at invisibility and nerved himself to ask lady betriz for one roundel he knew himself tall and gangling and not graceful but at least he was not fallingdown drunk which put him ahead of half the young men here by now not to mention lord dondo dy jironal who after monopolizing iselle in the dance for a time had moved off with his roistering hangerson to find either rougher pleasures or a quiet corridor to vomit in cazaril hoped the latter betrizs eyes sparkled with exhilaration as she swung with him into the figures at length orico woke up the musicians flagged and the evening drew to a close cazaril mobilized pages lady betriz and sera dy vrit to help carry off iselles booty and store it safe away teidez scorning the dancing had indulged in the spectacular array of sweets more than in drink though dy sanda might still have to deal with a bout of violent illness before dawn as a result but it was clear the boy was more drunk on attention than on wine lord dondo told me that anyone would have taken me for eighteen he told iselle triumphantly his growth spurt this past summer that had shot him up above his older sister had been occasion for much crowing on his part and snorting on iselles he trod off toward his bedchamber with feet barely touching the floor betriz her hands full of jewelry asked cazaril as they placed the gauds into iselles lockable boxes in her antechamber so why dont you use your name lord caz whats so wrong with lupe its really quite a a strong mans name withal early aversion he sighed my older brother and his friends used to torment me by yipping and howling until theyd driven me to tears of rage which made me madder stillalas by the time id grown tall enough to beat him hed outgrown the game i thought that was most unfair of him betriz laughed i see cazaril reeled off to the quiet of his own bedchamber to realize he had failed to pen his faithfully promised note of reassurance to the provincara torn between bed and duty he sighed and pulled out his pens and paper and wax but his account was much shorter than the entertaining report he had planned a few terse lines ending all is well in cardegoss he sealed it found a sleepy page to deliver it to whatever morning courier rode out of the zangre and fell into bed the first nights welcoming banquet was followed all too soon by the next days breakfast dinner and an evening fête that included a masque more sumptuous meals cascaded down the ensuing days till cazaril instead of thinking roya orico sadly run to fat began to marvel that the man could still walk at least the initial bombardment of gifts upon the royal siblings slowed cazaril caught up on his inventory and began to think about where and upon what occasions some of this largesse should eventually be rebestowed a royesse was expected to be openhanded he woke on the fourth morning from a confused dream of running about the zangre with his hands full of jewelry that he could not get delivered to the right persons at the right times and which had somehow included a large talking rat that gave him impossible directions he rubbed away the sand of sleep from his eyes and considered swearing off either oricos fortified wines or sweets that included too much almond paste he wasnt sure which he wondered what meals hed have to face today and then laughed out loud at himself remembering siege rations still grinning he rolled out of bed he shook out the tunic hed worn yesterday afternoon and unlaced the cuff to rescue the drying half loaf of bread that betriz had bade him tuck in its wide sleeve when the royal picnic down by the river had been cut short by seasonable but unwelcome afternoon rain showers he wondered bemusedly if harboring provisions was what these courtiers sleeves had been designed for back when this garment was new he peeled off his nightshirt pulled on his trousers and tied their strings and went to wash at his basin a confused flapping sounded at his open window cazaril glanced aside startled by the noise to see one of the castle crows land upon the wide stone sill and cock its head at him it cawed twice then made some odd little muttering noises amused he wiped his face on his towel and picking up the bread advanced slowly upon the bird to see if it was one of the tame ones that might take food from his hand it seemed to spy the bread for it didnt launch itself again as he approached he held out a fragment the glossy bird regarded him intently for a moment then pecked the crumb rapidly from between his fingers cazaril controlled his flinch as the sharp black beak poked but did not pierce his hand the bird shifted and shook its wings spreading a tail that was missing two feathers it muttered some more then cawed again a shrill harsh noise echoing in the little chamber you shouldnt say caw caw cazaril told it you should say caz caz he entertained himself and apparently the bird for several minutes attempting to instruct it in its new language even meeting it halfway by trilling cazaril cazaril in what he fancied a birdish accent but despite lavish bribes of bread it seemed even more resistant than iselle to darthacan a knock at his chamber door interrupted the lesson and he called absently yes the door popped open the crow flapped backward and fell away through the window cazaril leaned out a moment to watch its flight it plummeted then spread its wings with a snap and soared again wheeling away upon some morning updraft rising along the ravines steep face my lord dy cazaril th the voice froze abruptly cazaril pushed up from the windowsill and turned to find a shockedlooking page standing in his doorway cazaril realized with a cold flush of embarrassment that he had not yet donned his shirt yes boy without appearing to hurry he reached casually for the tunic shook it out again and pulled it on what is it his drawl did not invite comment or query upon the yearold mess on his back the page swallowed and found his voice again my lord dy cazaril the royesse iselle bids you attend upon her in the green chamber immediately following breakfast thank you said cazaril coolly he nodded in sober dismissal the page scampered off the morning excursion for which iselle demanded cazarils escort turned out to be nothing farther afield than the promised tour of oricos menagerie the roya himself was to conduct his sister entering the green chamber cazaril found him dozing in a chair in his postbreakfast nap orico snorted awake and rubbed his forehead as if it ached he brushed sticky crumbs from his broad tunic gathered up a square of linen wrapping some packet and led his sister betriz and cazaril out the castle gate and off across the gardens in the stable yard they encountered teidezs morning hunting party forming up teidez had been begging for this treat practically since hed arrived at the zangre lord dondo it appeared had organized the boys wish and now led the group which included half a dozen other courtiers grooms and beaters three braces of dogs and ser dy sanda teidez atop his black horse saluted his sister and royal brother cheerfully lord dondo says its likely too early to spot boar he told them as the leaves are not yet fallen down but we might get lucky teidezs groom following on his own horse was loaded down with a veritable arsenal of weaponry just in case including the new crossbow and boar spear iselle who evidently hadnt been invited looked on with some envy dy sanda smiled in contentment as much as he ever smiled with this noble sport as lord dondo whooped and guided the cavalcade out of the yard at a smart trot cazaril watched them ride off and tried to figure out what about the fine autumn picture they presented made him uneasy it came to him that not one of the men surrounding teidez was under thirty none followed the boy for friendship or even anticipated friendship all were there for selfinterest if any of these courtiers had their wits about them cazaril decided they ought to bring their sons to court now and turn them loose and let nature take its course a vision not without its own perils but orico lumbered on around the stable block the ladies and cazaril following they found the head groom umegat evidently forewarned waiting decorously by the menagerie doors open wide to the morning sun and breeze he bowed his neatly braided head to his master and his guests s umegat said orico to his sister by way of introduction runs this place for me roknari but a good man anyway iselle controlled a visible twinge of alarm and inclined her head graciously in passable court roknari albeit improperly in the grammatical mode of master to warrior rather than master to servant she said blessings of the holy ones be upon you this day umegat umegats eyes widened and his bow deepened he returned a blessings of the high ones upon you too mhendi in the purest accent of the archipelago in the polite grammatical form of slave to master cazarils brows rose umegat was no chalionese halfbreed after all it seemed cazaril wondered by what convoluted lifes chances hed ended up here interest roused he ventured you are a long way from home umegat in the mode of servant to lesser servant a little smile turned the grooms lips you have an ear mhendi that is rare in chalion lord dy cazaril instructs me iselle supplied then you are well served lady but turning to cazaril he shifted modes now to that of slave to scholar even more exquisitely polite than that of slave to master chalion is my home now wisdom let us show my sister my creatures put in orico evidently growing bored with the bilingual amenities he held up his linen napkin and grinned conspiratorially i stole a honeycomb for my bears from the breakfast table and it will soak through soon if i dont rid myself of it umegat smiled back and conducted them into the cool stone building the place was even more immaculate this morning than the other day tidier by far than oricos banqueting halls orico excused himself and dodged aside at once into one of his bears cages the bear woke up and sat up on his haunches orico lowered himself to his haunches on the gleaming straw and the two regarded one another orico was very nearly the same shape as the bear withal he unwrapped his napkin and broke off a chunk of honeycomb and the bear snuffled over and began licking his fingers with a long pink tongue iselle and betriz exclaimed at the bears thick and beautiful fur but made no move to join the roya in the cage umegat directed them to the more obviously herbivorous goatcreatures and this time the ladies did go into the stalls to stroke the beasts and compliment them enviously on their big brown eyes and sweeping eyelashes umegat explained that they were called vellas imported from somewhere beyond the archipelago and supplied carrots which the ladies fed to the vellas with much giggling and mutual satisfaction iselle wiped the last carrot bits mixed with vella slime on her skirt and they all followed umegat toward the aviary orico lingering with his bear languidly waved them on without him a dark shape swooped from the sunlight into the stonearched aisle and fetched up with a flap and a grumble on cazarils shoulder he nearly jumped out of his boots he craned his neck to find it was his crow from his window this morning judging by the ragged slot in its tail feathers it flexed its clawed feet in his shoulder and cried caz caz cazaril burst into laughter about time you foolish bird but it will do you no good nowim all out of bread he shrugged his shoulder but the bird clung stubbornly and cried caz caz again right in his ear painfully loudly betriz laughed lips parted in amazement whos your friend lord caz it came to my window this morning and i attempted to teach it um a few words i didnt think id succeeded caz caz the crow insisted you should be so attentive to your darthacan my lady cazaril finished come ser dy bird away with you i have no more bread go find yourself a stunned fish below the falls or a nice smelly dead sheep or something shoo he dipped his shoulder but the bird clung stubbornly they are most greedy birds these castle crows country crows have to fly about and find their own dinners these lazy creatures expect you to put it in their mouths indeed said umegat with a sly smile the birds of the zangre are veritable courtiers among crows cazaril swallowed a bark of laughter slightly too late and sneaked another look at the impeccable roknariexroknarigroom well if umegat had worked here long hed had plenty of time to study courtiers this worship would be more flattering if you were a more savory bird shoo he pushed the crow from his shoulder but it only flapped to the top of his head and dug its claws into his scalp ow cazaril the crow cried shrilly from this new perch you must be a master teacher of tongues indeed my lord dy cazaril umegat smiled more broadly i hear you he assured the crow if you will duck your head my lord i will endeavor to remove your passenger cazaril did so murmuring something in roknari umegat persuaded the bird onto his arm carried it to the doors and flung it into the air it flapped away cawing to cazarils relief more ordinary caws they proceeded to the aviary where iselle found herself as popular among the brilliant little birds from the cages as cazaril was with the ragged crow they hopped upon her sleeve and umegat showed her how to coax them to take grains from between her teeth they turned next to the perch birds betriz admired a large bright green one with yellow breast feathers and a ruby throat it clicked its thick yellow beak wobbled from side to side and stuck out a narrow black tongue this is a fairly recent arrival umegat told them i believe it has had a difficult and wandering life tame enough but its taken time and patience to calm it down does it speak asked betriz yes said umegat but only rude words in roknari perhaps fortunately i think it must have once been a sailors bird march dy jironal brought it back from the north this spring as war booty reports and rumors of that inconclusive campaign had come to valenda cazaril wondered if umegat had ever been war bootyas he had beenand if that was how hed first been brought to chalion he said dryly pretty bird but it seems a poor trade for three towns and control of a pass i believe lord dy jironal gained rather more movables than that umegat said his baggage train returning to cardegoss took an hour to file through the gates ive had to deal with slow mules like that too murmured cazaril unimpressed chalion lost more than dy jironal gained on that illconceived venture iselles eyebrows bent was it not a victory by what definition we and the roknari princedoms have been pushing and shoving over that border area for decades it used to be good landits now a waste orchards and olive groves and vineyards burned farms abandoned animals turned loose to go wild or starveits peace not war that makes wealth for a country war just transfers possession of the residue from the weaker to the stronger worse what is bought with blood is sold for coin and then stolen back again he brooded and added bitterly your grandfather roya fonsa bought gotorget with the lives of his sons it was sold by march dy jironal for three hundred thousand royals its a wondrous transmutation where the blood of one man is turned into the money of another lead into gold is nothing to it can there never be peace in the north asked betriz startled by his unusual vehemence cazaril shrugged not while there is so much profit in war the roknari princes play the same game it is a universal corruption winning the war would end it said iselle thoughtfully now theres a dream sighed cazaril if the roya could sneak it past his nobles without their noticing they were losing their future livelihoods but no its just not possible chalion alone could not defeat all five princedoms and even if by some miracle it did it has no naval expertise to hold the coasts thereafter if all the quintarian royacies were to combine and fight hard for a generation some immensely strong and determined roya might push it through and unite the whole land but the cost in men and nerve and money would be vast iselle said slowly greater than the cost of this endless sucking drain of blood and virtue to the north done oncedone right oncewould be done for all time but there is none to do it no man with the nerve and vision and will the roya of brajar is an aging drunkard who sports with his court ladies the fox of ibra is tied down with civil strife chalion cazaril hesitated realizing his stirred emotions were luring him into impolitic frankness teidez iselle began and took a breath maybe it will be teidezs gift when he comes to full manhood not a gift cazaril would wish on any man and yet the boy did seem to have some nascent talents in that direction if only his education in the next few years could bring them into sharp and directed focus conquest isnt the only way to unite peoples betriz pointed out theres marriage yes but no one can marry three royacies and five princedoms iselle said wrinkling her nose not all at once anyway the green bird perhaps irritated at losing the attention of its audience chose this moment to vent a remarkably lewd phrase in rude roknari sailors bird indeeda galleymans bird cazaril judged umegat smiled dryly at cazarils involuntary snort but raised his brows slightly as betriz and iselle clamped their lips shut and turned a suffused pink caught each others gazes and nearly lost their gravity smoothly he reached for a hood and popped it over the birds head good night my green friend he told it i think you are not quite ready for polite society here perhaps lord dy cazaril should stop in and teach you court roknari too eh cazarils thought that umegat seemed perfectly capable of teaching court roknari all by himself was interrupted when a surprisingly brisk step at the door of the aviary proved to be orico wiping bear spittle on his trousers and smiling cazaril decided the castle warders comment that first day was right his menagerie did seem to be a consolation to the roya his eye was clear and color brightened his face again visibly improved from the soggy exhaustion hed evidenced immediately after breakfast you must come see my cats he told the ladies they all followed him into the stone aisle where he proudly showed off cages containing a pair of fine golden cats with tufted ears from the mountains of south chalion and a rare blueeyed albino mountain cat of the same breed with striking black ear tufts this end of the aisle also held a cage containing a pair of what umegat named archipelago sand foxes looking like skinny halfsized wolves but with enormous triangular ears and cynical expressions with a flourish orico turned finally to his obvious favorite the leopard let out on its silver chain it rubbed itself around the royas legs and made odd little growly noises cazaril held his breath as encouraged by her brother iselle knelt to pet it her face right next to those powerful jaws those round pellucid amber eyes looked anything but friendly to him but their lids did half close in evident enjoyment and the broad brickcolored nose quivered as iselle scratched the beast vigorously under the chin and ran her spread fingers through its fabulous spotted coat when cazaril knelt however its growl took what seemed to his ear a decidedly hostile edge and its distant amber stare encouraged no such liberties cazaril prudently kept his hands to himself the roya choosing to linger to consult with his head groom cazaril walked his ladies back to the zangre as they argued amiably over which had been the most interesting beast in the menagerie what did you think the most curious creature there betriz charged him cazaril took a moment before replying but in the end decided on the truth umegat her mouth opened to object to this supposed levity but then closed again as iselle cast him a sharp look a thoughtful silence descended which reigned all the way to the castle doors the shortening of the daylight running on into autumn was felt to be no loss by the inhabitants of the zangre for the lengthening nights continued to be made brilliant by candlelight feasting and fêtes the courtiers took turns outdoing one another providing the entertainments freely spending money and wit teidez and iselle were dazzled iselle fortunately not totally with the aid of cazarils undervoiced running commentary she began to look for hidden meanings and messages watch for intents calculate expenditures and expectations teidez as nearly as cazaril could tell swallowed it all down whole signs of indigestion showed themselves teidez and dy sanda began to clash more and more openly as dy sanda fought a losing battle to maintain the disciplines hed imposed on the boy in the provincaras careful household even iselle began to worry about the heightening tensions between her brother and his tutor as cazaril quickly deduced when betriz cornered him one morning apparently casually in a window nook overlooking the confluence of the rivers and half the hinterland of cardegoss after a few remarks upon the weather which was seasonable and the hunting which was too she swerved abruptly to the matter that brought her to him lowering her voice and asking what was that dreadful row between teidez and poor dy sanda in your corridor last night we could hear the uproar through the windows and through the floor um five gods how was he to handle this one maidens he half wished iselle had sent nan dy vrit well surely that sensible widow was in on whatever distaff discussions went on overhead yes and better to be blunt than misunderstood and far better to be blunt with betriz than with iselle herself betriz no child and most of all not teidezs only sister could decide what was fit to pass on to iselles ears better than he could dondo dy jironal brought teidez a drab for his bed last night dy sanda threw her back out teidez was infuriated infuriated embarrassed possibly secretly relieved and later in the evening sick on wine ah the glorious courtly life oh said betriz hed shocked her a little but not excessively he was relieved to see oh she fell into a thoughtful silence for a few moments staring out over the rolling golden plains beyond the river and its widening valley the harvest was almost all in she bit her lower lip and looked back at him in narroweyed concern its not its surely not there is something very odd in the spectacle of a fortyyearold man like lord dondo hanging on a fourteenyearold boys sleeve to hang on a boy odd indeed to hang on a royse his future roya future dispenser of position wealth preferment military opportunitywell there you have it grant you if dondo were to let go his space on that sleeve it would instantly be seized by three other men its the the manner thats the matter her lips twisted in disgust indeed a drab ugh and lord dondo thats what is called a procurer is it not mm and ruder names not that not that teidez is not on the brink of full manhood and every man must learn sometime their wedding night isnt good enough we must learn it all then men usually marry later he attempted deciding this was an argument hed best stay away from and besides embarrassed by the memory of how late his own apprenticeship had been yet normally a man will have a friend a brother or at least a father or an uncle to introduce him to um how to go on with ladies but dondo dy jironal is none of these things to teidez betriz frowned teidez has none of those well except except roya orico who is both father and brother in a way their eyes met and cazaril realized he didnt have to add aloud but not in a very useful way she added after an even more thoughtful moment and i cant imagine ser dy sanda cazaril muffled a snort oh poor teidez nor can i he hesitated then added its an awkward age if teidez had been at court all along he would be used to this atmosphere not be so impressed or if hed been brought here when he was older he might have a more settled character a firmer mind not that court isnt dazzling at any age especially if youre suddenly plopped down in the center of the whole wheel and yet if teidez is to be oricos heir its time he began training up to it how to handle pleasures as well as duties with proper balance is he being so trained i do not see it dy sanda tries desperately but hes outnumbered cazaril finished for her glumly that is the root of the trouble his brow wrinkled as he thought it through in the provincaras household dy sanda had her backing her authority to complete his own here in cardegoss roya orico should take that part but takes no interest dy sanda has been left to struggle on his own against impossible odds does this court betriz frowned clearly trying to frame unfamiliar thoughts does this court have a center cazaril vented a wary sigh a wellconducted court always has someone in moral authority if not the roya perhaps his royina someone like the provincara to set the tone keep the standards orico is he could not say weak dared not say ill not doing so and royina sara royina sara seemed a ghost to cazaril pale and drifting nearly invisible doesnt either that brings us to chancellor dy jironal who is much absorbed by the affairs of state and does not take it upon himself to curb his brother betrizs eyes narrowed are you saying he sets dondo on cazaril touched his finger warningly to his lips do you remember umegats little joke about the zangres courtly crows try it in reverse have you ever watched a mob of crows combine to rob another birds nest one will draw off the parent birds while another darts in to take the eggs or chicks his voice went dry fortunately most of the courtiers of cardegoss dont work together as cleverly as a flock of crows betriz sighed im not even sure teidez realizes its not all for his own sake im afraid dy sanda for all his very real concern has not laid it all out in blunt enough terms grant you hed need to be pretty blunt to get through the fog of flattery teidez floats in right now but you do it for iselle all the time betriz objected you say watch this man see what he does next see why he moves sothe seventh or eighth time you turn out to be dead on the target we cannot help but listenand the tenth or twelfth time to begin to see it too cant dy sanda do that for royse teidez its easier to see the smudge on anothers face than on ones own this flock of courtiers is not pressing iselle nearly so hard as they are teidez thank the gods they all know she must be sold out of court probably out of chalion altogether and is not meat for them teidez will be their future livelihood on that inconclusive and unsatisfactory note they were forced to leave it for a time but cazaril was glad to know betriz and iselle were growing alive to the subtler hazards of court life the gaiety was dazzling seductive a feast to the eye that could leave the reason as drunk and reeling as the body for some courtiers and ladies cazaril supposed it actually was the cheerful innocentalbeit expensivegame it seemed for others it was a dance of display ciphered message thrust and counterthrust as serious if not so instantly deadly as a duel to stay afoot one had to distinguish the players from the played dondo dy jironal was a major player in his own right and yet if not every move he made was directed by his older brother it was surely safe to say his every move was permitted by him no not safe to say merely true to think however dim his view of the morals of court he had to grant that oricos musicians were very good cazaril reflected opening his ear greedily to them at the next evening dance if royina sara had a consolation to match oricos menagerie it was surely the zangres minstrels and singers she never danced she rarely smiled but she never missed a fête where music was played either sitting next to her sodden and sleepy spouse or if orico staggered off to bed early lingering behind a carved screen with her ladies on the gallery opposite the musicians cazaril thought he understood her hunger for this solace as he leaned against the chamber wall in what was becoming his usual spot tapping his foot and benignly watching his ladies twirl about on the polished wooden floor musicians and dancers stopped for breath after a brisk roundel and cazaril joined the smattering of applause led by the royina from behind her screen a completely unexpected voice spoke next to his ear well castillar youre looking more your old self palli cazaril controlled his surge forward turning it into a sweeping bow instead palli formally dressed in the blue trousers and tunic and white tabard of the daughters military order boots polished and sword glittering at his waist laughed and returned an equally ceremonious bow though he followed it up with a firm if brief grip of cazarils hands what brings you to cardegoss cazaril asked eagerly justice by the goddess and a good job of it too a year in the making i rode up in support of the lord dedicat the provincar dy yarrin on a little holy quest of his ill tell you more but ahpalli glanced around the crowded chamber where the dancers were forming up againmaybe not here you seem to have survived your trip to courtyoure over that little burst of nerves now i trust cazarils lips twisted so far ill tell you more butnot here a glance around assured him neither lord dondo nor his elder brother were present at the moment though some half dozen men he knew to be their creatures were just as certain to report this meeting and greeting so be it let us find a cooler spot then they strolled out casually together into the next chamber and cazaril led palli to a window embrasure that overlooked a moonlit courtyard on the courtyards far side a couple sat closely together but cazaril judged them out of both earshot and caring so what is old dy yarrin about that brings him hot to court asked cazaril curiously the provincar of yarrin was the highestranking lord of chalion to have chosen allegiance to the holy military order of the daughter most young men with military leanings dedicated themselves to the far more glamorous order of the son with its glorious tradition of battle against the roknari invaders even cazaril had sworn himself a lay dedicat to the son in his youthand unsworn himself when let it go the far smaller holy military order of the daughter concerned itself with more domestic challenges guarding the temples patrolling the roads to the pilgrimage shrines by extension controlling banditry pursuing horse and cattle thieves assisting in the capture of murderers granted what the goddesss soldiers lacked in numbers they frequently made up in romantic dedication to her palli was a natural cazaril thought with a grin and had surely found his calling at last spring cleaning palli smiled like one of umegats sand foxes for a moment a smelly little mess inside the temple walls is going to get washed out at last dy yarrin had suspected for some time that with the old general sick and dying for so long the orders comptroller here in cardegoss was filtering the orders funds as they flowed through his fingers palli wiggled his in illustration into his personal purse cazaril grunted unfortunate palli cocked an eyebrow at him this doesnt take you by surprise cazaril shrugged not in the main such things happen now and then when men are tempted beyond their strength id not heard anything specific said against the daughters comptroller though no beyond the usual slanders against every official in cardegoss be he honest or not that every fool repeats palli nodded dy yarrins been over a year quietly collecting the evidence and the witnesses we took the comptrollerand his booksby surprise about two hours ago hes locked down now in the daughters houses own cellar under guard dy yarrin will present the whole case to the orders council tomorrow morning the comptroller will be stripped of his post and rank by tomorrow afternoon and delivered to the chancellery of cardegoss for punishment by tomorrow night ha his fist closed in anticipated triumph well done will you stay on after that i hope to stay a week or two for the hunting oh excellent time to talk and a man of wit and certain honor to talk withdouble luxury im lodging in town at yarrin palacei cant linger long here tonight though i just came up to the zangre with dy yarrin while he made his bowand his reportto roya orico and general lord dondo dy jironal palli paused i take it by your very healthy appearance that your worries about the jironals turned out to be groundless cazaril fell silent the breeze through the embrasure was growing chill even the lovers across the courtyard had gone in he finally said i take care not to cross either of the jironals in any way palli frowned and seemed to hold some speech jostling just behind his lips a pair of servants wheeled a cart holding a crock of hot mulled wine redolent of spices and sugar through the antechamber toward the dancing chamber a giggling young lady exited closely pursued by a laughing young courtier they both vanished out the other side though their blended laughter lingered in the air strains of music sounded again floating down from the gallery like flowers pallis frown quirked away did lady betriz dy ferrej also accompany royesse iselle from valenda didnt you see her among the dancers noi saw you first long stick that you are propping up the walls when id heard the royesse was here i came looking in the chance you would be too though from the way you talked when last we met i couldnt be sure id find you do you think i might seize a dance before dy yarrin is done closeting himself with orico if you think you have the strength to fight your way through the mob that surrounds her perhaps said cazaril dryly waving him on they usually defeat me palli managed this without apparent effort and soon was handing a surprised and laughing betriz in and out of the figures with cheery panache he took a turn with royesse iselle as well both ladies seemed delighted to meet him again drawing breath afterward he was greeted by some four or five other lords he apparently knew until a page approached and touched him on the elbow and murmured some message in his ear palli made his bows and left presumably to join his fellow lord dedicat dy yarrin and escort him back to his mansion cazaril hoped the daughters new holy general lord dondo dy jironal would be glad and grateful to have his house cleaned for him tomorrow he hoped it fervently cazaril spent the following day in smiling anticipation of the delight pallis visit to court would bring to his routine betriz and iselle also spoke in praise of the young march which gave cazaril brief pause palli would show to his best in this splendid setting and what of it palli was a landed man with money looks charm honorable responsibilities suppose he and the lady betriz were to hit it off was either of them less than what the other deserved nevertheless cazaril found his mind unwilled revolving plans for pleasures with palli that somehow did not include his ladies but to his disappointment palli did not appear at court that eveningnor did the provincar of yarrin cazaril supposed their wearing day of presenting evidence at the daughters house to whatever committee of justice had assembled there had run into complexities and stretched past dinner if the case took longer than pallis first optimistic estimate well it would at least extend his visit to cardegoss he did not see palli again until the next morning when the march appeared abruptly at the open door of cazarils office which was an antechamber to the succession of rooms occupied by royesse iselle and her ladies cazaril stared up from his writing desk in surprise palli had discarded his court attire and was dressed for the road in wellworn tall boots thick tunic and a short cloak for riding palli sit down cazaril gestured to a stool palli pulled it up across from him and lowered himself with a tired grunt only for a moment old friend i could not leave without bidding you farewell i dy yarrin and our troops are commanded to be quit of cardegoss before noon today under pain of expulsion from the daughters holy order his smile was tight as a stretched hawser what what has happened cazaril laid down his quill and pushed aside the book of iselles increasingly complex household accounts palli ran a hand through his dark hair and shook his head as if in disbelief im not sure i can speak of it without bursting it was all i could do last night not to pull out my sword and run the smirking son of a bitch through his soft guts on the spot caz they threw out dy yarrins case confiscated all his evidence dismissed all his witnessesuncalled unheardlet that lying thieving worm of a comptroller out of the cellar who has our holy general dondo dy jironal and his his his creatures on the daughters council his cowed dogsgoddess blind me if ive ever before seen such a set of cringing cursa disgrace to her pure colors palli clenched his fist upon his knees sputtering we all knew the orders house in cardegoss has been in disarray for some time i suppose we should have petitioned the roya to dismiss the old general when he first grew too ill to keep it all in hand but no one had the heart to kick him sowe all thought a new younger vigorous man would turn it all out again and start fresh but this this this is worse than neglect its active malfeasance caz they cleared the comptroller and dismissed dy yarrinthey scarcely glanced at his letters and ledgers dear goddess the papers filled two trunksi swear the decision was made before the meeting was called cazaril had not heard palli stammer with rage like this since the day the news of the sale of gotorget had been delivered to the starving battered garrison by the royas stout courier passed through the roknari lines he sat back and pulled his beard i suspectno im certain in my heartlord dondo was paid off for his judgment if he is not simply the comptrollers new masterand two trunks of evidence now being used to feed the fires on the ladys altarcaz our new holy general is running the daughters order as his personal milch cow i was told by an acolyte yesterdayon the stairs and the man shook as he whispered it to mehes placed out six troops of the daughters men to the heir of ibra in south ibraas plain paid mercenaries thats not their mandate thats not the goddesss workits worse than stealing money its stealing blood a rustle and an indrawn breath drew both mens glances to the inner doorway lady betriz stood there with her hand upon the frame and the royesse iselle peeked over her shoulder both ladies eyes were round palli opened and shut his mouth swallowed then jumped to his feet and bowed to them royesse lady betriz alas that i must take my leave of you i return to palliar this morning we shall regret the loss of your company march said the royesse faintly palli wheeled to cazaril caz he gave an apologetic little nod im sorry i disbelieved you about the jironals you werent crazed after all you were right on every point cazaril blinked nonplussed i thought you had believed me old dy yarrin was as canny as you he suspected this trouble from the first id asked him why he thought we needed to bring so large a troop to enter cardegosshe murmured no boyit is to leave cardegoss i didnt understand his joke till now palli vented a bitter laugh will you bewill you not be returning here asked betriz in a rather breathy voice her hand went to her lips i swear before the goddess palli touched his hand to forehead lip navel and groin and then spread it flat over his heart in the fivefold sacred gesture i will not return to cardegoss except it be to dondo dy jironals funeral ladies he stood at attention and gave them a bow caz he grasped cazarils hands across the table and bent to kiss them hastily cazaril returned the honor farewell palli turned and strode from the room the space he had vacated seemed to collapse around his absence as if four men had just left betriz and iselle were drawn into it betriz tiptoed to the outer door and peered around it to spy the last of his clomping retreat down the corridor cazaril picked up his quill and drew the feather end nervously through his fingers how much of that did you hear he asked the ladies betriz glanced back at iselle and replied all of it i think his voice was not pitched low she returned slowly across the antechamber her face troubled cazaril groped for some way to caution these unintended auditors it was the business of a closed council of a holy military order palli should not have spoken of it outside the daughters house iselle said but isnt he a lord dedicat a member of that councildoesnt he have as much rightdutyto speak as any of them yes but in the heat of his temper he has made serious accusations against his own holy general that he has not the power to prove iselle gave him a sharp look do you believe him my belief is not the issue butif its trueits a crime and worse than a crime an insulting impiety and a violation of the trust not only of the roya and the goddess above but of all who are sworn to obey in their names below she sees the consequences in both directions good no wait no we havent seen the evidence maybe the council was justified in discarding it we cannot know if we cant see the evidence as march dy palliar has can we judge the men and reason backward to it no said cazaril firmly even a habitual liar may tell the truth from time to time or an honest man be tempted to lie by some extraordinary need betriz startled said do you think your friend was lying as he is my friend no of course not but but he might be mistaken this is all too murky said iselle decisively i shall pray to the goddess for guidance cazaril remembering the last time shed done that said hastily you need not reach that high for guidance royesse you inadvertently overheard a confidence you have a plain duty not to repeat it in word or deed but if its true it matters it matters greatly lord caz nevertheless liking and disliking do not constitute proof any more than hearsay does iselle frowned thoughtfully its true i do not like lord dondo he smells odd and his hands are always hot and sweaty betriz added with a grimace of distaste yes and hes always touching one with them ugh the quill snapped in cazarils hand spraying a small spatter of ink drops on his sleeve he set the pieces aside oh he said in what he trusted was a neutral tone when was this oh everywhere at the dances at dinner in the halls i mean many gentlemen here flirt some quite agreeably but lord dondo presses there are enough fine ladies here at court nearer his own age i dont know why he doesnt go try to charm them cazaril almost asked her if thirtyfive seemed as ancient to her as forty but bit it short and said instead he desires influence over royse teidez of course and therefore desires whatever good grace he can obtain from teidezs sister directly or through her attendants betrizs breath puffed out in relief oh do you think thats so it made me quite ill to think he might really be in love with me but if hes only flattering me for his advantage thats all right cazaril was still laboring to work this through when iselle said he has a very odd idea of my character if he thinks seducing my attendants will gain my good graces and i do not think he needs any more influence over teidez if what ive seen so far is a sample i meanif it were good influence shouldnt we see good results we ought to see teidez growing firmer in his studies clearer in health opening his mind to a wider world of some kind cazaril also bit back the observation that teidez was certainly getting that last from lord dondo in a way iselle went on with growing passion shouldnt teidez be apprenticing statecraft at least seeing the chancellery work sitting in on councils listening to envoys or if not statecraft real warcraft hunting is fine but shouldnt he be learning military drill with men his spiritual diet seems all candy and no meat what kind of roya do they mean to train him to be possibly one just like oricosodden and sicklywho will not compete with chancellor dy jironal for power in chalion but what cazaril said aloud was i do not know royesse how can i know how can i know anything she stepped back and forth across the chamber her spine tense with frustration her skirts swishing mama and grandmama would wish me to watch out for him cazaril can you at least find out if its true about selling the daughters men to the heir of ibra that at least cant be any kind of subtle secret she was right about that cazaril swallowed ill try my lady butthen what he made his voice stern for emphasis dondo dy jironal is a power you dare not treat with anything but strictest courtesy iselle swirled round and stared intently at him no matter how corrupt that power is the more corrupt the less safe iselle raised her chin so castillar tell mehow safe in your judgment is dondo dy jironal he was caught out his mouth at half cock so say itdondo dy jironal is the secondmostdangerous man in chalion after his brother instead he picked up a new quill from the clay jar and began shaping its tip with the penknife after a moment or two he got out i do not like his sweaty hands either iselle snorted but cazaril was saved from further crossexamination by a call from nan dy vrit some vital little matter of scarves and straying seed pearls and the two ladies went back into their chambers on cool afternoons when no moreexciting hunting party went out royesse iselle vented her restless energy by gathering up her little household and going for rides in the oak woods near cardegoss cazaril along with lady betriz and a couple of wheezing grooms was cantering in the wake of her dappled mare down a green ride the crisp air spangled with golden falling leaves when his ear picked up a thunder of new hooves gaining ground behind them he glanced over his shoulder and his stomach lurched a cavalcade of masked men was pelting down the track the yelling crew overtook them he had his sword halfout before he recognized the horses and equipage as belonging to some of the zangres younger courtiers the men were dressed in an amazing array of rags bare arms and legs smeared with a dirt suspiciously reminiscent of boot blacking cazaril drew a long breath and bent briefly over his saddlebow willing his heart to slow as the grinning mob captured the royesse and lady betriz and tied their prisoners including cazaril with silk ribands he wished fervently someone would warn him at least about these pranks in advance the laughing lord dy rinal had come though he apparently did not realize it to within a fraction of a reflex of receiving a length of razor steel across his throat his sturdy page galloping up on cazarils other side might have died on the backstroke and cazarils sword sheathed itself in a third mans belly before had they been real bandits they could have combined to take him down and all before cazarils brain had formulated his first clear thought or his mouth opened to scream warning they all laughed heartily at the look of terror theyd surprised on his face and teased him about drawing steel he smiled sheepishly and decided not to explain just what aspect of it all had drained the blood from his face they rode to their bandit camp a large clearing in the forest where a number of servants from the zangre also dressed in artistic rags roasted deer and lesser game on spits over open fires bandit ladies shepherdesses and some rather stately beggar girls hailed the kidnappers return iselle squeaked in laughing outrage when the bandit king dy rinal clipped a lock of her curling hair and held it up for ransom the masque was not yet finished for upon this cue a troop of rescuers in blue and white led by lord dondo dy jironal galloped into the camp vigorous mock swordplay ensued including some alarming and messy moments involving pigs bladders filled with blood before all the bandits were slainsome still complaining about the unfairness of itand the lock of hair rescued by dondo a mock divine of the brother then went about miraculously raising the bandits back to life with a skin of wine and the entire company settled down upon cloths spread on the ground for some serious feasting and drinking cazaril found himself sharing a cloth with iselle betriz and lord dondo he sat crosslegged toward the edge nibbled venison and bread and watched and listened as dondo entertained the royesse with what was to his ear heavyhanded wit dondo begged iselle to award him her shorn lock as his prize for her daring rescue and offered up in return with a snap of his fingers to his hovering page a tooled leather case containing two beautiful jeweled tortoiseshell combs a treasure for a treasure and all is quits dondo told her and ostentatiously tucked the curl of hair away in an inner pocket of his vestcloak over his heart its a cruel gift though iselle parried to give me combs but leave me no hair to hold with them she held a comb up and turned it glittering and translucent in the sunlight but you may grow new hair royesse but can you grow new treasure as easily as you can grow new hair i assure you he leaned on his elbow by her side and grinned up at her his head nearly in her lap iselles amused smile faded do you find your new post so profitable then holy general indeed you are miscast then perhaps you should have played the bandit king today dondos smile thinned if the world were not so how could i ever buy enough pearls to please the pretty ladies spots of color flared in iselles cheeks and she lowered her eyes dondos smile grew satisfied cazaril his tongue clamped between his teeth reached for a silver flagon of wine with an eye to accidentally in this emergency spilling it down the back of iselles neck alas the flagon was empty but to his intense relief iselle took a bite of bread and meat next and chewed instead on it it was notable though that she drew her skirts aside from lord dondo when next she shifted position the chill of the autumn evening was rising with the shadows from the low places when the replete company rode slowly back to the zangre after the bandits picnic iselle reined in her dappled mare and fell back beside cazaril for a moment castillar did you ever discover for me the truth of the rumor of the daughters troops being sold for mercenaries one or two other men have said so but it is not what i would call confirmed news it was in fact quite thoroughly confirmed but cazaril judged it imprudent to say so to iselle just at this moment she frowned silently then spurred her horse forward to catch up with lady betriz again that night the sparerthanusual evening banquet broke up without dancing and tired courtiers and ladies went off to an early bed or private pleasures cazaril found dondo dy jironal falling into step beside him in an antechamber walk with me a little castillar i think we need to talk cazaril shrugged obligingly and followed dondo feigning not to notice the two choice young bravos a couple of dondos riper friends who padded along a few paces behind them they exited the tower block at the narrow end of the fortress onto an irregular little quadrangle of a courtyard overlooking the confluence of the rivers at a hand signal from dondo his two friends waited by the door leaning against the stone wall like bored and tired sentries cazaril calculated the odds he had reach on dondo and despite his subsequent illness his months pulling the oar on the galleys had left his wiry arms much stronger than they looked dondo was doubtless better trained the bravos were young a little drunk but young at threetoone swordplay might not even be required an unagile secretary too full of wine after supper taking a walk on the battlements could slip and fall in the dark bouncing off the rock face three hundred feet down to the water below his broken body might be found next day without a single telltale stab wound in it a few lanterns in wall brackets cast flickering orange light across the paving stones dondo gestured invitingly to a carved granite bench against the outer wall the stone was gritty and chill against cazarils legs as he sat the night breeze dank on his neck with a little grunt dondo seated himself too automatically flipping his vestcloak aside to free his sword hilt so cazaril dondo began i see you are quite close in the confidence of the royesse iselle these days the post of her secretary is one of great responsibility of her tutor even more so i take it quite seriously no surprise thereyou always took everything too seriously too much of a good thing can be a fault in a man you know cazaril shrugged dondo sat back and crossed his legs at the ankles as if making himself comfortable for a chat with some intimate for examplehe waved a hand toward the tower block now rising before thema girl of her age and style should be just starting to warm to men and yet i find her strangely chill a mare like that is made for breedingshe has good wide hips to cradle a man he gave his own a little double jerk for illustration one hopes she has escaped that unfortunate taint in the blood and its not an early sign of the sort of ah difficulties of mind that overset her poor mother cazaril decided not to touch this one mm he said one hopes and yet if that is not the case one is almost led to wonder if some overserious person has taken to poisoning her mind against me this court is full of gossip and gossipers indeed and ah just how do you speak of me to her cazaril carefully dondo sat back and folded his arms good thats good he paused for a time and yet withal i think that i should prefer warmly warmly would be better cazaril moistened his lips iselle is a very clever and sensitive girl im sure she could sense if i were lying better to leave it as it is dondo snorted ah here we come to it i suspected you might still be holding a grudge against me for that evil little game of mad oluss cazaril made a little negating gesture no it is forgotten my lord the proximity of dondo as close as in oluss tent his slightly peculiar scent brought it back in intense detail blaring through cazarils memory the panting despair the skree the heavy blow it was a long time ago huh i do like a man with a malleable memory and yet i still feel you need more heat i suppose youre still a poor man as ever some fellows never catch the tricks of getting on in the world dondo unfolded his arms and with some little difficulty twisted a ring off one of his thick damp fingers its gold was thin but a large bevelcut flat green stone gleamed in its setting he held it out to cazaril let this warm your heart to me and your tongue cazaril didnt move i have all i need from the royesse my lord indeed dondos black brows knotted his dark eyes glittered in the lanternlight between his narrowed lids your position does give you considerable opportunity to fill your pockets i suppose cazaril closed his teeth hiding his tremble of outrage if you decline to believe in my probity my lord you might at least reflect upon royesse iselles future and believe i still possess the wits the gods gave me today she has a household another day it may be some royacy or a princedom indeed think you so dondo sat back with a strange grin then laughed aloud ah poor cazaril if a man neglects his bird in the hand for the flock he sees in the tree hes very like to end with no bird at all how clever is that he set the ring coyly down on the stone between them cazaril opened both his hands and held them out palm up in front of his chest in a gesture of release he returned them firmly to his knees and said with undeceptive mildness save your treasure my lord to buy yourself a man with a lower price im sure you can find one dondo scooped his ring back up and frowned fiercely at cazaril you havent changed still the same sanctimonious prig you and that fool dy sanda are much alike no wonder i suppose considering that old woman in valenda who chose you both he rose and stalked indoors shoving the ring back on his finger the two men waiting glanced across curiously at cazaril and turned to follow cazaril sighed and wondered if his moment of furious satisfaction had been bought at too high a price it might have been wiser to take the bribe and leave lord dondo calm happy in the belief that hed bought another man one just like himself easy to understand certain of control feeling very tired he pushed himself to his feet and went back inside to mount the stairs to his bedchamber he was just putting his key in his lock when dy sanda passed him in the corridor yawning they exchanged cordialenough murmurs of greeting stay a moment dy sanda dy sanda glanced back over his shoulder castillar are you careful to keep your door locked these days and your key about your person dy sandas brows rose and he turned i have a trunk with a good stout lock that serves for all i have to guard thats not enough you need to block your whole room so that nothing can be stolen i have little enough that no so that nothing stolen can be placed therein dy sandas lips parted he stood a moment as this sank in and raised his eyes to meet cazarils oh he said at last he gave cazaril a slow nod almost a bow thank you castillar i hadnt thought of that cazaril returned the nod and went inside cazaril sat in his bedchamber with a profligacy of candles and the classic brajaran verse romance the legend of the green tree and sighed in contentment the zangres library had been famous in the days of fonsa the wise but neglected ever sincethis volume judging by the dust hadnt been pulled off the shelves since the end of fonsas reign but it was the luxury of enough candles to make reading late at night a pleasure and not a strain as much as behars versifying that gave his heart joy and a little guiltthe charges for good wax candles upon iselles household accounts were going to add up after a time and look a trifle odd behars thundering cadences echoing in his head he moistened his finger and turned a page behars stanzas werent the only things around here thundering and echoing he glanced upward as rapid thumps and scrapes and the muffled sounds of laughter and calling voices penetrated from the ceiling well enforcing reasonable bedtimes in iselles household was nan dy vrits job not his thank the gods he returned his eye to the poets theologically symbolic visions and ignored the clatter till the pig squealed shrilly even the great behar could not compete with that mystery his lips drawing back in a grin cazaril set the volume down on his coverlet and swung his stilltrousered legs out of bed fastened his tunic wriggled his feet into his shoes and picked up the candle with the glass chimney to light his way up the back stairs he met dondo dy jironal coming down dondo was dressed in his usual courtiers attire blue brocade tunic and linenwoolen trousers though his white vestcloak swung from his hand along with his sword in its scabbard and sword belt his face was set and flushed cazarils mouth opened to give some polite greeting but his words died on his lips at dondos murderous glare dondo stormed on past him without a word cazaril swung into the upstairs corridor to find all its wall sconces lit and an inexplicable array of people gathered not only betriz iselle and nan dy vrit but lord dy rinal one of his friends and another lady and ser dy sanda were all crowded around laughing they scattered to the walls as teidez and a page blasted through their midst in hot pursuit of a scrubbed and beribboned young pig trailing a length of scarf the page tackled the animal at cazarils feet and teidez hooted triumph in the bag in the bag dy sanda called he and lady betriz came up as teidez and the page collaborated on inserting the squealing creature into a large canvas sack where it clearly didnt want to go betriz bent to give the struggling animal a quick scratch behind its flapping ears my thanks lady pig you played your part superbly but its time to go back to your home now the page hoisted the heavy sack up over his shoulder saluted the assembled company and staggered off grinning what is going on up here demanded cazaril torn between laughter and alarm oh it was the greatest jest cried teidez you should have seen the look on lord dondos face cazaril just had and it hadnt inspired him with mirth his stomach sank what have you done iselle tossed her head neither my hints not lady betrizs plain words having served to discourage lord dondos attentions or to convince him they were unwelcome we conspired to make him the assignation of love he desired teidez undertook to secure our player from the stable so instead of the virgin lord dondo was confidently expecting to find waiting when he went tiptoeing up to betrizs bed in the dark he foundlady pig oh you traduce the poor pig royesse cried lord dy rinal she may have been a virgin too after all im sure she was or she would not have squealed so the laughing lady on his arm put in its only too bad said dy sanda acidly she was not to lord dondos taste i confess im surprised from all reports of the man id have thought hed lie down with anything his eyes flicked sideways to check the effect of these words on the grinning teidez and after wed doused her with my best darthacan perfume too sighed betriz hugely the merriment in her eyes was underscored by a glittering rage and sharp satisfaction you should have told me cazaril began told him what of this prank it was clear enough they knew he would have suppressed it of dondos continued pressings just how vile had they been his fingernails bit into his palm and what could he have done about them eh gone to orico or royina sara futile lord dy rinal said it will be the best tale of the week in all of cardegossand the best tail too if a curly one lord dondo hasnt played the butt for years and i do think it was past his turn i can hear the oinking already the man wont sit to a pork dinner for months without hearing it royesse lady betrizhe swept them a bowi thank you from the bottom of my heart the two courtiers and the lady took themselves off presumably to spread the jest to whatever of their friends were still awake cazaril suppressing the first several remarks trying to rip from his lips finally ground out royesse that was not wise iselle frowned back undaunted the man wears the robes of a holy general of the lady of spring yet undertakes to rob women of their virginity sacred to her just as he robs well so you say we have no proof of what else he robs we had proof enough of this by the goddess at least this may teach him the unwisdom of attempting to steal from my household the zangre is supposed to be a royal court not a barnyard cheer up cazaril dy sanda advised him the man cannot revenge his outraged vanity upon the royse and royesse after all he glanced around teidez had gone off up the corridor to collect the trampled ribbons the pig had shed in its attempted flight he lowered his voice and added and it was well worth the trouble for teidez to see his ah hero in a less flattering light when the amorous lord dondo stumbled out of betrizs bedchamber with the strings of his trousers in his hands he found all our witnesses lined up waiting lady pig nearly knocked him down escaping between his legs he looked an utter fool its the best lesson ive been able to bring off all this month weve been here maybe we can start to regain some lost ground in that direction eh i pray you may be right said cazaril carefully he did not say aloud his reflection that the royse and the royesse were the only people dondo could not revenge himself upon nevertheless there was no sign of retaliation in the next several days lord dondo took the raillery of dy rinal and his friends with a thin smile but a smile nonetheless cazaril sat to every meal in the expectation of at the very least a certain pig served up roasted with ribbons round its neck to the royesses table but the dish did not appear betriz at first infected by cazarils nerves was reassured cazaril was not for all his hot temper dondo had amply demonstrated just how long he could wait for his opportunities without forgetting his wounds to cazarils relief the oinking about the castle corridors died down in less than a fortnight as new fêtes and pranks and gossip took its place cazaril began to hope lord dondo was going to swallow his so publicly administered medicine without spitting perhaps his elder brother with larger horizons in view than the little society inside the zangres walls had undertaken to suppress any inappropriate response there was news enough from the outside world to absorb grown mens attention sharpening of the civil war in south ibra banditry in the provinces bad weather closing down the high passes unseasonably early in light of these last reports cazaril gave an eye to the logistics of transporting the royesses household should the court decide to leave the zangre early and remove to its traditional winter quarters before the fathers day he was sitting in his office totting up horses and mules when one of oricos pages appeared at the antechamber door my lord dy cazaril the roya bids you attend upon him in iass tower cazaril raised his eyebrows set down his quill and followed the boy wondering what service the roya desired of him oricos sudden fancies could be a trifle eccentric twice he had ordered cazaril to accompany him on expeditions to his menagerie there to perform no offices more complex than what a page or groom might well have done holding his animals chains or fetching brushes or feed well nothe roya had also asked leading questions about his sister iselles doings in an apparently desultory fashion cazaril had seized the opportunity to convey iselles horror of being bartered to the archipelago or to any other roknari prince and had hoped the royas ear was more open than his sleepy demeanor would indicate the page guided him to the long room on the second floor of iass tower that dy jironal used for his chancellery when the court was resident in the zangre it was lined with shelves crammed with books parchments files and a row of the seallocked saddlebags used by the royal couriers the two liveried guards standing at attention followed them within and took up their posts inside the door cazaril felt their eyes follow him roya orico was seated with the chancellor behind a large table scattered about with papers orico looked weary dy jironal was spare and intense dressed today in ordinary court garb but with his chain of office around his neck a courtier whom cazaril recognized as ser dy maroc master of the royas armor and wardrobe stood at one end of the table one of oricos pages looking very worried stood at the other cazarils escort announced the castillar dy cazaril sire and then after a glance at his fellow page backed away to make himself invisible by the far wall cazaril bowed sire my lord chancellor dy jironal stroked his steelstreaked beard glanced at orico who shrugged and said quietly castillar you will oblige his majesty please by removing your tunic and turning around cold unease knotted the words in his throat cazaril closed his lips gave a single nod and undid the frogs of his tunic tunic and vestcloak he slipped off together and folded neatly over his arm face set he made a military aboutface and stood still behind him he heard two men stifle gasps and a young voice mutter it was so i did see oh that page yes someone cleared his throat cazaril waited for the hot flush to die from his cheeks then wheeled around again he said steadily was that all sire orico fidgeted and said castillar it is whispered you are accused an accusation has been made that you were convicted of the crime of rape in ibra and flogged in the stocks that is a lie sire who has said it he glanced at ser dy maroc who had grown a trifle pale while cazarils back was turned dy maroc was not in either of the jironal brothers direct employ and he was not so far as cazaril knew one of dondos riper creatures might he have been bribed or was he an honest gull a clear voice rang from the corridor i will too see my brother and at once i have the right oricos guards surged forward then hastily back again as royesse iselle trailed by a very pale lady betriz and ser dy sanda burst into the chamber iselles quick glance took in the tableau of men she raised her chin and cried what is this orico dy sanda tells me you have arrested my secretary without even warning me by the peeved ripple of chancellor dy jironals mouth this intrusion had not been in his plans orico waved his thick hands no no not arrested no one has arrested anyone we are gathered to investigate an accusation what accusation a very serious one royesse and not for your ears said dy jironal you should withdraw pointedly ignoring him she pulled up a chair and plunked down into it folding her arms if its a serious accusation against the most trusted servant of my household it is very much for my ears cazaril what is this about cazaril gave her a slight bow a slander has apparently been circulated by persons not yet named that the scars on my back were punishment for a crime last fall dy maroc put in nervously in ibra by betrizs widening stare and caught breath she had obtained a good close view of the ropy mess as shed followed iselle around cazaril ser dy sandas lips too pursed in a wince may i put my tunic back on sire cazaril added stiffly yes yes orico waved a hasty assent the nature of the crime royesse dy jironal put in smoothly is such as to cast very serious doubts on whether the man should be a trusted servant of your or indeed any ladys household what rape said iselle scornfully cazaril that is the most absurd lie i have ever heard and yet said dy jironal there are the flogging scars the gift said cazaril through his teeth of a roknari oarmaster in return for a certain illconsidered defiance last fall and off the coast of ibra that much is true plausible and yet odd said dy jironal in a judicious tone the cruelties of the galleys are legendary but one would not think a competent oarmaster would damage a slave past use cazaril half smiled i provoked him how so cazaril asked orico leaning back and squeezing the fat of his chin with one hand wrapped my oarchain around his throat and did my best to strangle him i almost succeeded too but they pulled me off him a trifle too soon dear gods said the roya were you trying to commit suicide i am not quite sure id thought i was past fury but i had been given a new benchmate an ibran boy maybe fifteen years old kidnapped he said and i believed him you could tell he was of good family soft wellspoken not used to rough placeshe blistered dreadfully in the sun and his hands bled on the oars scared defiant ashamed he said his name was danni but he never told me his surname the oarmaster made to use him after a manner forbidden to roknari and danni struck out at him before i could stop him it was insanely foolish but the boy didnt realize i thoughtwell i wasnt thinking very clearly but i thought if i struck harder i could distract the oarmaster from retaliating upon him by retaliating against you instead said betriz wonderingly cazaril shrugged hed kneed the oarmaster hard enough in the groin before wrapping the chain around his neck to assure he wouldnt be amorous again for a week but a week would have passed soon enough and then what it was a futile gesture would have been futile but for the chance of the ibran naval flotilla crossing our bows the next morning and rescuing us all dy sanda said encouragingly you have witnesses then quite a large number of them it sounds like the boy the galley slaves the ibran sailors what became of the boy after i dont know i lay ill in the temple hospital of the mothers mercy in zagosur for for a while and everyone was scattered and gone by the time i um left a very heroic tale said dy jironal in a dry tone well calculated to remind his listeners that this was cazarils version he frowned judiciously and glanced around the assembled company his gaze lingering for a moment upon dy sanda and the outraged iselle still i suppose you might ask the royesse to give you a months leave to ride to ibra and locate some of these ah conveniently scattered witnesses if you can leave his ladies unguarded for a month here and would he survive the trip or be slain and buried in a shallow grave in the woods two hours ride out of cardegoss leaving the court to construe his guilt from his supposed flight betriz pressed her hand to whitened lips but her glare was wholly for dy jironal here at least was one who believed cazarils word and not his back he stood a little straighter no he said at last i am slandered my sworn word stands against hearsay unless you have some better support than castle gossip i defy the lie orwhere did you have the tale have you traced it to its source who accuses meis it you dy maroc he frowned at the courtier explain it dy maroc dy jironal invited with a careless wave de maroc took a breath i had it from an ibran silk merchant that i dealt with for the royas wardrobehe recognized the castillar he said from the flogging block in zagosur and was very shocked to see him here he said it was an ugly casethat the castillar had ravished the daughter of a man who took him in and gave him shelter and he remembered it very well therefore because it was so vile cazaril scratched his beard are you sure he didnt simply mistake me for another man dy maroc replied stiffly no for he had your name cazarils eyes narrowed no mistake hereit was a lie outright bought and paid for but whose tongue had been bought the courtiers or the merchants where is this merchant now dy sanda broke in led his pack train back to ibra before the snows cazaril said in a mild voice just exactly when did you have this tale dy maroc hesitated apparently casting back for his fingers twitched down by his side as if counting three weeks gone he rode out it was just before he left that we talked i know whos lying now yes cazarils lip turned up without humor that there was a real silk merchant who had really ridden out of cardegoss on that date he had no doubt but the ibran had departed well before dondos emerald bribe and dondo would not have troubled to invent this indirect route for getting rid of cazaril until after hed failed to purchase him direct unfortunately this was not a line of reasoning cazaril could adduce in his defense the silk merchant dy maroc added could have had no reason to lie but you do i wonder what it is youve known of this serious charge for over three weeks yet only now have brought it to your lords attention how very odd of you dy maroc dy maroc glowered at him if the ibrans gone said orico querulously its impossible to find out who is telling the truth then my lord dy cazaril should surely be given the benefit of the doubt said dy sanda standing sternly upright you may not know him but the provincara dy baocia who gave him this trust did hed served her late husband some six or seven years in all in his youth said dy jironal men do change you know especially in the brutality of war if there is any doubt of the man he should not be trusted in such a critical and dare i say ithe glanced pointedly at betriztempting post betrizs long incensed inhalation was perhaps fortunately cut across by iselle who cried oh rubbish in the midst of the brutality of war you yourself gave this man the keys to the fortress of gotorget which was the anchor of chalions whole battle line in the north you clearly trusted him enough then march nor did he betray that trust dy jironals jaw tightened and he smiled thinly why how militant chalion is grown that our very maidens seek to give us better advice upon our strategies they could hardly give us worse growled orico under his breath only a slight sideways flick of the eyes betrayed that dy jironal had heard him dy sanda said in a puzzled voice yes and why wasnt the castillar ransomed with the rest of his officers when you surrendered gotorget dy jironal cazaril clenched his teeth shut up dy sanda the roknari reported hed died replied the chancellor shortly theyd hid him for revenge id assumed when i learned he yet lived though if the silk merchant spoke truth maybe it was for embarrassment he must have escaped them and knocked about ibra for a time until his um unhappy arrest he glanced at cazaril and away you know you lie i know you lie but dy jironal did not even now know for certain if cazaril knew he lied it didnt seem much of an advantage this was a weak moment for a countercharge this slander already half cut the ground from under his feet regardless of the outcome of oricos inquiry well i do not understand how his loss was allowed to pass without investigation said dy sanda staring narrowly at dy jironal he was the fortresss commander iselle put in thoughtfully if you assumed revenge you must have judged hed cost the roknari dearly in the field for them to use him so thereafter dy jironal grimaced clearly misliking where this line of logic was leading he sat back and waved away the digression we are come to an impasse then a mans word against a mans word and nothing to decide it sire i earnestly advise prudence let my lord dy cazaril be given some lesser post or sent back to the dowager of baocia iselle nearly sputtered and let the slander go unchallenged no i will not stand for it orico rubbed his head as if it ached and shot side glances at his chilly chief advisor and his furious half sister he vented a small groan oh gods i hate this sort of thing his expression changed and he sat upright again ah but of course there is just the solution just the just solution heh heh he beckoned to the page who had summoned cazaril and murmured in his ear dy jironal watched frowning but apparently could not make out what had been said either the page scampered out what is your solution sire asked dy jironal apprehensively not my solution the gods we will let the gods decide who is innocent and who lies youre not thinking of putting this to trial by combat are you asked dy jironal in a voice of real horror cazaril could only share that horrorand so did ser dy maroc judging by the way the blood drained from his face orico blinked well now theres another thought he glanced at dy maroc and at cazaril they appear evenly matched withal dy maroc is younger of course and does very well on the sand of my practice ring but experience counts for something lady betriz glanced at dy maroc and frowned in sudden worry so did cazaril for the opposite reason he suspected dy maroc was indeed a very pretty duello dancer against the brutality of the battlefield he would last cazaril calculated maybe five minutes dy jironal met cazarils eyes directly for almost the first time in this inquiry and cazaril knew he was making the identical calculation cazarils stomach heaved at the thought of being forced to butcher the boy even if he was a tool and a liar i do not know if the ibran lied or not put in dy maroc warily i only know what i heard yes yes orico waved this away i think my plan will be better he sniffed rubbed his nose on his sleeve and waited a lengthy and unnerving silence fell it was broken when the page returned announcing umegat sire the dapper roknari groom entered and glanced in faint surprise at the people assembled but trod directly to his master and made his bow how may i serve you my lord umegat said orico i want you to go outside and catch the first sacred crow you see and bring it back in here youhe gestured at the pagego with him for witness hurry now quick quick orico clapped his hands in his urgency without evincing the least surprise or question umegat bowed again and padded back out cazaril caught dy maroc giving the chancellor a piteous now what look dy jironal set his teeth and ignored it now said orico how shall we arrange this i knowcazaril you go stand in one end of the room dy maroc you go stand in the other dy jironals eyes shifted in uncertain calculation he gave dy maroc a slight nod toward the end of the room with the open window cazaril found himself relegated to the dimmer closed end you allorico gestured to iselle and her cohortstand to the side for witness you and you and you too this to the guards and the remaining page orico heaved to his feet and went about the table to arrange his human tableau to his close satisfaction dy jironal stayed seated where he was playing with a quill and scowling in much less time than cazaril would have expected umegat returned with a crankylooking crow tucked under his arm and the excited page bouncing around him was that the first crow you saw orico asked the boy yes my lord the page replied breathlessly well the whole flock was circling above fonsas tower so i suppose we saw six or eight at once so umegat just stood in the courtyard with his arm out and his eyes closed quite still and this one came down to him and landed right on his sleeve cazarils eyes strained trying to see if the muttering bird might just possibly be missing two tail feathers very good said orico happily now umegat i want you to stand in the exact center of the room and when i give the signal release the sacred crow well see which man he flies to and then well know waiteveryone should say a prayer in their hearts first to the gods for guidance iselle composed herself but betriz looked up but sire what shall we know is the crow to fly to the liar or the honest man she stared hard at umegat oh said orico hm and what if it just flies around in circles said dy jironal an exasperated edge leaking into his voice then well know the gods are as confused as all of the rest of us cazaril did not say out loud umegat stroking the bird to calm it gave a slight bow as the truth is sacred to the gods let the crow fly to the honest man sire he did not glance at cazaril oh very good carry on then umegat with what cazaril was beginning to suspect was a fine sense of theater positioned himself precisely between the two accused men and held the bird out on his arm slowly removing his controlling hand he stood a moment with a look of pious quietude on his face cazaril wondered what the gods made of the cacophony of conflicting prayers no doubt arising from this room at this instant then umegat tossed the crow into the air and let his arms hang down it squawked and spread its wings and fanned a tail missing two feathers dy maroc held his arms widespread hopefully looking as if he wondered if he was allowed to tackle the creature out of the air as it swooped by him cazaril about to cry caz caz to be safe was suddenly overcome with theological curiosity he already knew the truthwhat else might this test reveal he stood still and straight lips parted and watched in disturbed fascination as the crow ignored the open window and flapped straight to his shoulder well he said quietly to it as it dug in its claws and shifted from side to side well it tilted its black beak regarding him with expressionless beady eyes iselle and betriz jumped up and down and whooped hugging each other and nearly frightening the bird off again dy sanda smiled grimly dy jironal gritted his teeth dy maroc looked faintly appalled orico dusted his plump hands good that settles that now by the gods i want my dinner iselle betriz and dy sanda surrounded cazaril like an honor guard and marched him out of iass tower to the courtyard how did you know to come to my rescue cazaril asked them surreptitiously he glanced up no crows were circling just now i had it from a page that you were to be arrested this morning said dy sanda and i went at once to the royesse cazaril wondered if dy sanda like himself kept a private budget to pay for early news from various observers around the zangre and why his own arrangements hadnt worked a trifle better in this case i thank you for covering myhe swallowed the word backblind side i should have been dismissed by now if you all hadnt come to stand up for me no thanks needed said dy sanda i believe youd have done as much for me my brother needed someone to prop him said iselle a trifle bitterly else he bows to whatever force blows most proximately cazaril was torn between commending her shrewdness and suppressing her frankness he glanced at dy sanda how longdo you knowhas this story about me been circulating in the court he shrugged some four or five days i think this was the first we heard of it said betriz indignantly dy sanda opened his hands in apology likely it seemed too raw a thing to pour in your maiden ears my lady iselle scowled dy sanda accepted reiterated thanks from cazaril and took his leave to check on teidez betriz who had grown suddenly quiet said in a stifled voice this was all my fault wasnt it dondo struck at you to avenge himself for the pig oh lord caz im sorry no my lady said cazaril firmly there is some old business between dondo and me that goes back to before before gotorget her face lightened to his relief nevertheless he seized the chance to add prudently grant you the prank with the pig didnt help and you should not do anything like that again betriz sighed but then smiled just a little bit well he did stop pressing himself upon me so it helped that much i cant deny thats a benefit but dondo remains a powerful man i beg youbothto take care to walk wide around him iselles eyes flicked toward him she said quietly were under siege here arent we me teidez all our households i trust sighed cazaril it is not quite so dire just go more carefully from now on eh he escorted them back to their chambers in the main block but did not take up his calculations again instead he strode back down the stairs and out past the stables to the menagerie he found umegat in the aviary persuading the small birds to take dust baths in a basin of ashes as proof against lice the neat roknari his tabard protected by an apron looked up at him and smiled cazaril did not smile back umegat he began without preamble i have to know did you pick the crow or did the crow pick you does it matter to you my lord yes why cazarils mouth opened and shut he finally began again almost pleadingly it was a trick yes you tricked them by bringing the crow i feed at my window the gods didnt really reach into that room right umegats brows rose the bastard is the most subtle of the gods my lord merely because something is a trick is no guarantee you are not godtouched he added apologetically im afraid thats just the way it works he chirped at the bright bird apparently now done with its flutter in the ashes coaxed it onto his hand with a seed drawn from his apron pocket and popped it back into its nearby cage cazaril followed arguing it was the crow that i fed of course it flew to me you feed it too eh i feed all the sacred crows of fonsas tower so do the pages and ladies the visitors to the zangre and the acolytes and divines of all the temple houses in town the miracle of those crows is that theyre not all grown too fat to fly with a neat twist of his wrist umegat secured another bird and tipped it into the ash bath cazaril stood back from him as ashes puffed and frowned youre roknari arent you of the quadrene faith no my lord said umegat serenely ive been a devout quintarian since my late youth did you convert when you came to chalion no when i was still in the archipelago how came it about that you were not hanged for heresy i made it to the ship to brajar before they caught me umegats smile crimped indeed he still had his thumbs cazarils brows drew down as he studied the mans finedrawn features what was your father in the archipelago narrowminded very pious though in his foursquare way that is not what i meant i know my lord but hes been dead these twenty years it doesnt matter anymore i am content with what i am now cazaril scratched his beard as umegat traded for another bright bird how long have you been head groom of this menagerie then from its beginning about six years i came with the leopard and the first birds we were a gift who from oh from the archdivine of cardegoss and the order of the bastard upon the occasion of the royas birthday you see many fine animals have been added since then cazaril digested that for a little this is a very unusual collection yes my lord how unusual very unusual can you tell me more i beg you will not ask me more my lord why not because i do not wish to lie to you why not everyone else does umegat drew in his breath and smiled crookedly watching cazaril because my lord the crow picked me cazarils return smile grew a trifle strained he gave umegat a small bow and withdrew cazaril was just exiting his bedchamber on the way to breakfast some three mornings later when a breathless page accosted him grabbing him by the sleeve m lord dy cazaril the castle warder begs you tend on him at once in the courtyard why whats the matter obedient to this urgency cazaril swung into motion beside the boy its ser dy sanda he was set upon last night by footpads and robbed and stabbed cazarils stride lengthened how badly was he injured where does he lie not injured mlord slain oh gods no cazaril left the page behind as he clattered down the staircase he hurried into the zangres front courtyard in time to see a man in the tabard of the constable of cardegoss and another man dressed as a farmer lower a stiff form from the back of a mule and lay it out on the cobbles the zangres castle warder frowning squatted down by the body a couple of the royas guards watched from a few paces back warily as if knife wounds might prove contagious what has happened demanded cazaril the farmer in his courtiers garb taking pulled off his wool hat in a sort of salute i found him by the riverside this morning sir when i took my cattle down to drink the river curvesi often find things hung up upon the shoal twas a wagon wheel last week i always check not bodies too often thank the mother of mercy not since that poor lady who drowned herself two years back he and the constables man exchanged nods of reminiscence this one has not a drowned look dy sandas trousers were still sodden but his hair was done dripping his tunic had been removed by his finderscazaril saw the brocade folded up over the mules withers the mouths of his wounds had been cleaned of blood by the river water and showed now as dark puckered slits in his pale skin in his back belly neck cazaril counted over a dozen strikes deep and hard the castle warder sitting on his heels pointed to a bit of frayed cord knotted around dy sandas belt his purse was cut off in a hurry they were but it wasnt just a robbery said cazaril one or two of these blows would have put him on the ground stopped resistance they didnt need to they were making sure of his death they or he no real way to know but dy sanda could not have been either easy or safe to bring down he rather thought they i suppose his sword was taken had he ever had time to draw it or had the first blow fallen on him by surprise from a man he walked beside in trust taken or lost in the river said the farmer he would not have floated down to me so soon if it had still been dragging him down did he have rings or jewelry asked the constables man the castle warder nodded several and a gold ear loop they were all gone now ill want a description of them all my lord the constables man said and the warder nodded understanding you know where he was found said cazaril to the constables man do you know where he was attacked the man shook his head hard to say somewhere in the bottoms maybe the lower end of cardegoss both socially and topographically huddled on both sides of the wall that ran between the two rivers there are only half a dozen places someone might pitch a body over the town walls and be sure the stream would take it off some are more lonely than others when did anyone here see him last i saw him at supper said cazaril he said nothing to me about going into town there were a couple of places right here in the zangre where a body might also be pitched into the rivers below has he broken bones not as i felt sir said the constables man indeed the pale corpse did not show great bruises inquiry of the castle guards disclosed that dy sanda had left the zangre alone and on foot about the midwatch last night cazaril gave up a budding plan to check every foot of the castles great lengths of corridors and niches for new bloodstains later in the afternoon the constables men found three people whod said theyd seen the royses secretary drinking in a tavern in the bottoms and depart alone one swore hed left staggering drunk that witness cazaril would have liked to have had alone for a time in one of the zangres stony screamabsorbing cells off the old old tunnels going down to the rivers some better kind of truth might have been pounded out of him there cazaril had never seen dy sanda drink to drunkenness ever it fell to cazaril to inventory and pack dy sandas meager pile of worldly goods to be sent off by carter to the mans surviving older brother somewhere in the provinces of chalion while the city constables men searched the bottoms futilely cazaril was sure for the supposed footpads cazaril turned out every scrap of paper in dy sandas room but whatever lying assignation had lured him to the bottoms hed either received verbally or taken with him dy sanda having no relatives near enough to wait upon the funeral was held the next day the services were somberly graced by both the royse and royesse and their households so a few courtiers anxious for their favor likewise attended the ceremony of departure held in the sons chamber off the main courtyard of the temple was brief it was borne in upon cazaril what a lonely man dy sanda had been no friends thronged to the head of his bier to speak long eulogies for each others comfort only cazaril spoke a few formal words of regret on behalf of the royesse managing to get through them without the embarrassment of referring to the paper upon which he had so hastily composed them that morning tucked in his sleeve cazaril stood down from the bier to make way for the blessing of the animals going to stand with the little crowd of mourners before the altar acolytes dressed each in the colors of their chosen gods brought in their creatures and stood round the bier at five evenly spaced points in country temples the most motley assortment of animals was used for this rite cazaril had once seen it carried throughsuccessfullyfor the dead daughter of a poor man by a single overworked acolyte with a basket of five kittens with colored ribbons tied round their necks the roknari often used fish though in the number of four not five the quadrene divines marked them with dye and interpreted the will of the gods by the patterns they made swimming about in a tub whatever the means used the omen was the one tiny miracle the gods granted every person no matter how humble at their last passing the temple of cardegoss had the resources to command the most beautiful of sacred animals selected for appropriate color and gender the daughters acolyte in her blue robes had a fine female crested blue jay newhatched last spring the mothers woman in green held on her arm a great green bird close relative cazaril thought to umegats prize in the royas menagerie the acolyte of the son in his redorange robes led a glorious young dogfox whose burnished coat seemed to glow like fire in the somber shadows of the echoing vaulted chamber the fathers acolyte in gray was led in by a stout elderly and immensely dignified gray wolf cazaril expected the bastards acolyte in her white robes to bear one of fonsas sacred crows but instead she cradled a pair of plump inquisitivelooking white rats in her arms the divine prostrated himself for the gods to make their sign then stood back at dy sandas head the brightly robed acolytes each in turn urged their creatures forward at a jerk of the acolytes wrist the blue jay fluttered up but then back down to her shoulder as did the mothers green bird the dogfox released from its copper chain sniffed trotted to the bier whined hopped up and curled itself at dy sandas side it rested its muzzle over the dead mans heart and sighed deeply the wolf obviously very experienced in these matters evinced no interest the bastards acolyte released her rats upon the paving stones but they merely ran back up her sleeve nuzzled her ears and caught their claws in her hair and had to be gently disengaged no surprises today unless persons had dedicated themselves especially to another god the childless soul normally went to the daughter or the son deceased parents to the mother or the father dy sanda was a childless man and had ridden as lay dedicat of the sons military order himself in his youth it was the natural order of things that his soul would be taken up by the son although it was not unknown for this moment of a funeral to be the first notice surviving family had that the member they buried had an unexpected child somewhere the bastard took up all of his own orderand all those souls disdained by the greater gods the bastard was the god of last resort ultimate if ambiguous refuge for those who had made disasters of their lives obedient to the clear choice of autumns elegant fox the acolyte of the son stepped forward to close the ceremonies calling down his gods special blessing upon dy sandas sundered soul the mourners filed past the bier and placed small offerings on the sons altar for the dead mans sake cazaril nearly drove his fingernails through his palms watching dondo dy jironal go through the motions of pious grief teidez was shocked and quiet regretting cazaril hoped all the hot complaints hed heaped on his rigid but loyal secretarytutors head while he lived his offering was a notable heap of gold iselle and betriz too were quiet both then and later they passed little comment upon the buzzing court gossip that surrounded the murder except for refusing invitations to go into town and finding excuses to check on cazarils continued existence four or five times of an evening the court murmured over the mystery new and more draconian punishments were mooted for such dangerous lowlife scum as cutpurses and footpads cazaril said nothing there was no mystery in dy sandas death to him except how to bring home its proof to the jironals he turned it over and over in his mind but the way defeated him he dared not start the process until he had every step laid clear to the end or he might as well slit his own throat and be done with it unless he decided some luckless footpad or cutpurse was falsely accused then he would what what was his word worth now after the misfired slander about his flogging scars most of the court had been impressed by the testimony of the crowsome had not easy enough to tell which was which by the way some gentlemen drew aside their cloaks from cazaril or ladies recoiled from his touch but no sacrificial peasants were brought forth by the constables office and the revived gaiety of the court closed over the unpleasant incident like a scab over a wound teidez was assigned a new secretary handselected from the royas own chancellery by the senior dy jironal himself he was a narrowfaced fellow altogether the chancellors creature and he made no move to make friends with cazaril dondo dy jironal publicly undertook to distract the young royse from his sorrow by providing him with the most delectable entertainments just how delectable cazaril had all too good a view of watching the drabs and ripe comrades pass in and out of teidezs chamber late at night once teidez stumbled into cazarils room apparently not able to tell one door from another and vomited about a quart of red wine at his feet cazaril guided him sick and blind back to his servants for cleanup cazarils most troubled moment however was the evening his eye caught a green glint on the hand of teidezs guard captain the man who had ridden with them from baocia who before riding out had sworn to mother and grandmother formally and on one knee to guard both young people with his life cazarils hand snaked out to grab the captains hand in passing bringing him up short he gazed down at the familiar flatcut stone nice ring he said after a moment the captain pulled his hand back frowning i thought so i hope you didnt pay too much for it i believe the stone is false it is a true emerald my lord if i were you id have it to a gemcutter and check its a continuing source of amazement to me the lies that men will tell these days for their profit the captain covered one hand with the other it is a good ring compared to what you traded for it id say it is trash the captains lips pressed closed he shrugged away and stalked off if this is a siege thought cazaril were losing the weather turned chill and rainy the rivers swelling as the sons season ran toward its close at the musicale after supper one sodden evening orico leaned over to his sister and murmured bring your people to the throne room tomorrow at noon and attend dy jironals investiture ill have some happy announcements afterward to make to the whole court and wear your most festive raiment oh and your pearlslord dondo was saying only last night he never sees you wear his pearls i do not think they become me iselle replied she glanced sideways at cazaril seated nearby and then down at her hands tightening in her lap nonsense how can pearls not become any maiden the roya sat back to applaud the sprightly piece just ending iselle kept her lips closed upon this suggestion until cazaril had escorted his ladies as far as his office antechamber he was about to bid them to sleep well and depart yawning to his own bed when she burst out i am not wearing that thief lord dondos pearls i would give them back to the daughters order but i swear they would be an insult to the goddess theyre tainted cazaril what can i do with them the bastard is not a fussy god give them to the divine of his foundling hospital to sell for the orphans he suggested her lips curved wouldnt that annoy lord dondo and he couldnt even protest good idea you shall take them to the orphans with my goodwill and for tomorrowill wear my red velvet vestcloak over my white silk gown that will certainly be festive and my garnet set mama gave me none can chide me for wearing my mothers jewels nan dy vrit said but what do you suppose your brother meant by happy announcements you dont think hes determined upon your betrothal already do you iselle went still blinking but then said decisively no it cant be there must be months of negotiations firstambassadors letters exchanges of presents treaties for the dowryand my assent won my portrait taken and i will have a portrait of the man whoever he may turn out to be a true and honest portrait by an artist i send myself if my prince is fat or squinty or bald or has a lip that hangs loose so be it but i will not be lied to in paint betriz made a face at the image this conjured i do hope youll win a handsome lord when the time does come iselle sighed it would be nice but given most of the great lords ive seen not likely i should settle for healthy i think and not plague the gods with impossible prayers healthy and a quintarian very sensible cazaril put in encouraging this practical frame of mind with an eye to easing his life in the near future betriz said uneasily there have been a great many envoys from the roknari princedoms in and out of court this fall iselles mouth tightened mm there are not a great many quintarian choices amongst the highest lords cazaril conceded the roya of brajar is a widower again nan dy vrit put in pursing her lips in doubt iselle waved this away surely not hes fiftyseven years old has gout and he already has an heir fullgrown and married wheres the point of my having a son friendly to his uncle oricoor his uncle teidez if it should chance soif hes not ruling his land theres brajars grandson said cazaril seven years old id have to wait seven more years not cazaril thought altogether a bad thing now is too soon but that is too long anything could happen in seven years people die countries go to war its true said nan dy vrit your father roya ias betrothed you at the age of two to a roknari prince but the poor lad took a fever and died soon after so that never came to anything or you would have been taken off to his princedom these two years ago betriz said a little teasingly the fox of ibras a widower too iselle choked hes over seventy not fat though and i suppose you wouldnt have to endure him for very long ha he could live another twenty years just for spite i thinkhes full enough of it and his heir is married too i think his second son is the only royse in the lands whos near to my age and hes not the heir you wont be offered an ibran this year royesse said cazaril the fox is exceedingly wroth with orico for his clumsy meddling in the war in south ibra yes but they say all the ibran high lords are trained as naval officers said iselle taking on an introspective look well and how useful is that likely to be to orico nan dy vrit snorted chalion has not one yard of coastline to our cost iselle murmured cazaril said regretfully when we had gotorget and held those passes we were almost in position to swoop down and take the port of visping weve lost that leverage now well anyway my best guess royesse is that you are destined for a lord of darthaca so lets spend a little more time on those declensions this coming week eh iselle made a face but sighed assent cazaril smiled and bowed himself out if she was not to espouse a ruling roya he wouldnt altogether mind a darthacan border lord for iselle he thought as he made his way down the stairs at least a lord of one of its warmer northern provinces either power or distance would do to protect iselle from the difficulties of the court of chalion and the sooner the better for her or for you for both of us for all that nan dy vrit put her hand over her eyes and winced cazaril thought iselle looked very bright and warm in her carmine robes with her amber curls cascading down her back nearly to her waist given the hint he wore a red brocade tunic that had been the old provincars and his white wool vestcloak betriz too wore her favorite red nan claiming eyestrain had chosen a sober black and white the reds clashed a trifle but they certainly defied the rain they all scurried across the wet cobbles to iass great tower block the crows from fonsas tower were all gone to roostno not quite cazaril ducked as a certain foolish bird missing two feathers from its tail swooped down out of the drizzling mist past him cawing caz caz with an eye to defending his white cloak from birdish deposits he fended it off it circled back up to the ruined slates screeching sadly oricos red brocade throne room was brilliantly lit with wall sconces against the autumn gray two or three dozen courtiers and ladies warmed it thoroughly orico wore his formal robes and his crown but royina sara was not at his side today teidez was given a seat in a lower chair at oricos right hand the royesses party kissed his hands and took their places iselle in a smaller chair to the left of saras empty one the rest standing orico smiling began the days largesse by awarding teidez the revenues of four more royal towns for the support of his household for which his younger half brother thanked him with proper handkisses and a brief setspeech dondo had not kept the royse up last night so he was looking much less green and seedy than usual orico then motioned his chancellor to his royal knee as had been announced the roya awarded the letters and sword and received the oath that made the senior dy jironal into the provincar of ildar several of ildars minor lords knelt and took oath in turn to dy jironal it was less expected when the two turned round at once and transferred the marchship of jironal together with its towns and tax revenues immediately to lordnow marchdondo iselle was surprised but obviously pleased when her brother next awarded her the revenues of six towns for the support of her household not before time to be sureher allowance till now had been notably scant for a royesse she thanked him prettily while cazarils brain lurched into calculation might iselle afford her own guard company instead of the loan of men from baocia shed shared till now with teidez and might cazaril choose them himself could she take a house of her own in town protected by her own people iselle returned to her chair on the dais and arranged her skirts a certain tension easing from her face that had not been apparent till its absence orico cleared his throat im pleased to come to the happiest of this days rewards well merited and er muchdesired iselle up orico stood and held out his hand to his half sister puzzled but smiling she rose and stood with him before the dais march dy jironal come forth orico continued lord dondo in the full robes of the daughters holy generalship and with a page in dy jironal livery at his heels came and stood at oricos other hand the skin on the back of cazarils neck began to creep as he watched from the side of the room what is orico about my muchbeloved and loyal chancellor and provincar dy jironal has begged a boon of blood from my house and upon meditation i have concluded it gives my heart joy to comply he didnt look joyful he looked nervous he has asked for the hand of my sister iselle for his brother the new march freely do i betroth and bestow it he turned dondos thick hand palm up iselles slim one palm down pressed them together at the height of his chest and stepped back iselles face drained of color and all expression she stood utterly still staring across at dondo as though she could not believe her senses the blood thudded in cazarils ears almost roaring and he could hardly draw his breath no no no as a betrothal gift my dear royesse i have guessed what your heart most desired to complete your trousseau dondo told her and motioned his page forward iselle regarding him with that same frozen stare said you guessed i wanted a coastal city with an excellent harbor dondo momentarily taken aback choked out a hearty laugh and turned from her the page flipped open the tooled leather box revealing a delicate pearlandsilver tiara and dondo reached in to hold it up before the eyes of the court a smattering of applause ran through the crowd from his friends cazarils hand clenched on his sword hilt if he drew and lunged hed be struck down before he made it across the throne room as dondo raised the tiara high to bring down upon iselles head she recoiled like a shying horse orico this betrothal is my will and desire dear sister said orico in edged tones dondo apparently unwilling to chase her about the room with the tiara paused and shot a meaningful glance at the roya iselle swallowed it was clear her mind was frantically churning over responses shed stifled her first scream of outrage and had not the trick of falling down in a convincing dead faint she stood trapped and conscious sire as the provincar of labran said when the forces of the golden general poured over his walls this is entirely a surprise a very hesitant titter ran through the courtiers at this witticism her voice lowered and she murmured through her teeth you didnt tell me you didnt ask me orico returned equally sotto voce well talk of it after this after another frozen moment she accepted this with a small nod dondo managed to complete his divestiture of the pearl tiara he bent and kissed her hand wisely he did not demand the usual return kiss from the look of astonished loathing on iselles face there seemed a good chance she might have bitten him oricos court divine in the seasonal robes of the brother stepped forward and called down a blessing upon the pair from all the gods orico announced in three days time we will all meet again here and witness this union sworn and celebrated thank you all three days three days said iselle her voice breaking for the first time dont you mean three years sire three days said orico prepare yourself he prepared himself to duck out of the throne room motioning his servants about him most of the courtiers departed with the dy jironals offering congratulations a few of the more boldly curious lingered ears pricking for the conversation between brother and sister what in three days there is not even time to send a courier to baocia let alone to have any reply from my mother or grandmother your mother as all know is too ill to stand the strain of a trip to court and your grandmother must stay in valenda to attend upon her but i dont she found herself addressing the broad royal back as orico scurried from the throne room she plunged after him into the next chamber betriz nan and cazaril following anxiously but orico i dont wish to marry dondo dy jironal a lady of your rank does not marry to please herself but to bring advantage to her house he told her sternly when she brought him to bay only by dint of rushing around in front of him and planting herself in his path is that indeed so then perhaps you can explain to me what advantage it brings to the house of chalion to throw meto waste meupon the younger son of a minor lord my husband should have brought us a royacy for his dowry this binds the dy jironals to meand to teidez say rather it binds us to them the advantage is a trifle onesided i think you said you did not wish to marry a roknari prince and i have not given you to one and it wasnt for lack of offersive refused two this season think on that and be grateful dear sister cazaril wasnt sure if orico was threatening or pleading he went on you didnt wish to leave chalion very well you shall not leave chalion you wanted to marry a quintarian lordi have given you one a holy general at that besides he went on with a petulant shrug if i gave you to a power too close to my borders they might use you as an excuse to claim some of my lands i do well with this for the future peace of chalion lord dondo is forty years old hes a corrupt impious thief an embezzler a libertine worse orico you cannot do this to me her voice was rising ill not hear you said orico and actually put his hands over his ears three days compose your mind and see to your wardrobe he fled her as if she were a burning tower ill not hear this he meant it four times that afternoon she attempted to seek him in his quarters to further her plea and four times he had his guards repulse her after that he rode out of the zangre altogether to take up residence in a hunting lodge deep in the oak woods a move of remarkable cowardice cazaril could only hope its roof leaked icy rain on the royal head cazaril slept badly that night venturing upstairs in the morning he found three frayed women who appeared to have not slept at all iselle heavyeyed drew him by the sleeve into her sitting chamber sat him down on the window seat and lowered her voice to a fierce whisper cazaril can you get four horses or three or two or even one ive thought it through i spent all night thinking it through the only answer is to fly he sighed i thought it through too first i am watched when i went to leave the zangre last night two of the royas guards followed me to protect me they said i might be able to kill or bribe onei doubt two we could ride out as if we were hunting argued iselle in the rain cazaril gestured to the steady mizzle still coming down outside the high window fogging the valley so that one could not even see the river below turning the bare tree branches to black ink marks in the gray and even if they let us ride out theyd be sure to send an armed escort if we could get any kind of a head start and if we could what then ifwhenthey overtook us on the road the first thing they would do is pull me from my horse and cut off my head and leave my body for the foxes and crows and then they would take you back and if by some miracle they didnt catch us where would we go a border any border brajar and south ibra would send you right back to please orico the five princedoms or the fox of ibra would take you hostage darthaca presupposes we could make it across half of chalion and all of south ibra i fear not royesse what else can i do her young voice was edged with desperation no one can force a marriage both parties must freely assent before the gods if you have the courage to simply stand there and say no it cannot go forth can you not find it in yourself to do so her lips tightened of course i could then what now i think you are the one who has not thought it through do you think lord dondo would just give up at that point he shook his head its not valid if they force it and everyone knows it just hold on to that thought she shook her head in something between grief and exasperation you dont understand hed have taken that for the wail of youth everywhere till dondo himself came that afternoon to the royesses chamber to persuade his betrothed to a more seemly compliance the doors were left open to the royesses sitting room but an armed guard stood at each keeping back both cazaril on one side and nan dy vrit and betriz on the other he did not catch one word in three of the furious undervoiced argument that raged between the thickset courtier and the redhaired maiden but at the end of it dondo stalked out with a look of savage satisfaction on his face and iselle collapsed on the window seat nearly unable to breathe so torn was she between terror and fury she clutched betriz and choked out he said if i did not make the responses he would take me anyway i said orico would never let you rape his sister he said why not he let us rape his wife when royina sara would not conceive and could not conceive and orico was too impotent to get a bastard no matter how many ladies and maidens and whores they brought to him and and even more disgusting things the jironals finally persuaded him to let them in upon her and try dondo said he and his brother tried every night for a year one at a time or both together till she threatened to kill herself he said he would roger me till hed planted his fruit in my womb and when i was ripe to bursting id hang on him as husband hard enough she blinked blurry eyes at cazaril her lips drawn back on clenched teeth he said my belly would grow very big indeed because i am short how much courage do i need for that simple no cazaril do you think and what happens when courage makes no difference at all at all i thought the only place that courage didnt matter was on a roknari slave galley i was wrong he whispered abjectly i do not know royesse trapped and desperate she fell to fasting and prayer nan and betriz helped to set up a portable altar to the gods in her chambers and collected all the symbols of the lady of spring they could find to decorate it cazaril trailed by his two guards walked down into cardegoss and found a flowerseller with forced violets out of season and brought them back to put in a glass jar of water on the altar he felt stupid and helpless though the royesse dropped a tear on his hand when she thanked him taking neither food nor drink she lay back down on the floor in the attitude of deepest supplication so like royina ista when cazaril had first caught sight of her in the provincaras ancestors hall that he was unnerved and fled the room he spent hours walking about the zangre trying to think thinking only of horrors late that evening the lady betriz called him up to the office antechamber that was rapidly becoming a place of hectic nightmare i have the answer she told him cazaril teach me how to kill a man with a knife what dondos guards know enough not to let you close to him but i will be standing beside iselle on her wedding morning to be her witness and make the responses no one will expect it of me ill hide the knife in my bodice when dondo comes close and bends to kiss her hand i can strike at him two three times before anyone can stop me but i dont know just how and where to cut to be sure the neck yes but what part earnestly she drew a heavy dirk out from behind her skirts and held it out to him show me we can practice till i have it very smooth and fast gods no lady betriz give up this mad plan they would strike you downtheyd hang you afterward provided only i was able to kill dondo first id go gladly to the gallows i swore to guard iselle with my life well so her brown eyes burned in her white face no he said firmly taking the knife and not giving it back where had she obtained it anyway this is no work for a woman id say its work for whoever has a chance at it my chance is best show me look no just wait ill ill try something find what i can do can you kill dondo iselle is in there praying to the lady to slay either her or dondo before the wedding she doesnt care anymore which well i care which i think it should be dondo i entirely agree look lady betriz wait just wait ill see what i can do if the gods will not answer your prayers lady iselle by the gods i will try to he spent hours the following day the last before the marriage trying to stalk lord dondo through the zangre like a boar in a forest of stone he never got within striking distance in midafternoon dondo returned to the jironals great palace in town and cazaril could not get past its walls or gates the second time dondos bravos threw him out one held him while another struck him enough times in the chest belly and groin to make his return to the zangre a slow weave supporting himself like a drunk with a hand out to nearby walls the royas guards whom he had scraped off in a dodge through cardegosss alleys arrived in time to watch both the beating and the crawl home they did not interfere with either in a burst of inspiration he bethought himself of the secret passage that had run between the zangre and the jironals great palace when it had been the property of lord dy lutez ias and dy lutez had been reputed to use it daily for conference or nightly for assignations of love depending on the teller the tunnel he discovered was now about as secret as cardegosss main street and had guards on both ends and locked doors his attempt at bribery won him shoves and curses and the threat of another beating some assassin i am he thought bitterly as he reeled into his bedchamber as dusk descended and fell groaning into his bed head pounding body aching he lay still for a time then at last roused himself enough to light a candle he ought to go upstairs and check on his ladies but he didnt think he could bear the weeping or the reporting of his failure to betriz or what she would demand of him after that if he could not kill dondo what right had he to try to thwart her effort i would gladly die if only i could stop this abomination tomorrow do you mean that he sat stiffly wondering if that last voice was quite his own his tongue had moved a little behind his lips as usual for when he was babbling to himself yes he lurched around to the end of his bed fell to his knees and flipped open the lid of his trunk he dived down amongst the folded garments scented with cloves as proof against moths until he came to a black velvet vestcloak folded around a brown wool robe folded around a ciphered notebook that he had never finished deciphering when the crooked judge had fled valenda that it had seemed too late to return to the temple without embarrassing explanations feverishly he drew it out and lit more candles theres not much time left about a third of it was left untranslated forget all the failed experiments go to the last page eh even in the bad cipher the wool merchants despair came through in a kind of strange shining simplicity eschewing all his previous bizarre elaborations he had turned at the last not to magic but to plain prayer rat and crow only to carry the plea candles only to light his way herbs only to lift his heart with their scents and compose his mind to purity of will a will then put aside laid wholehearted on the gods altar help me help me help me those were the last words entered in the notebook i can do that thought cazaril in wonder and if he failed there would still be betriz and her knife i will not fail ive failed practically everything else in my life i will not fail death he slipped the book under his pillow locked his door behind him and went to find a page the sleepy boy he selected was waiting in the corridor upon the pleasure of the lords and ladies at their dinner in oricos banqueting hall where iselles nonappearance was doubtless the subject of much gossip not even kept to a whisper since none of the principals were present dondo roistered privately in his palace with his hangerson orico still cowered out in the woods he fished a gold royal from his purse and held it up smiling through the o of his thumb and finger hey boy would you like to earn a royal the zangre pages had learned to be wary a royal was enough to buy some truly intimate services from those who sold such and enough to be a caution to those who didnt care to play those games doing what my lord catch me a rat a rat my lord why ah why why so that i can work the crime of death magic upon the second most powerful lord in chalion of course no cazaril leaned his shoulders against the wall and smiled down confidingly when i was in the fortress of gotorget during the siege three years agodid you know i was its commander until my brave general sold it out from under us that iswe learned to eat rats tasty little things if you could catch enough of them i really miss the flavor of a good candleroasted rat haunch catch me a really big fat one and there will be another to match this cazaril dropped the coin in the pages hand and licked his lips wondering how crazed he looked right now the page was edging farther from him you know where my chamber is yes mlord bring it there in a bag quick as you can im hungry cazaril lurched off laughing really laughing not feigning it a weird wild exhilaration filled his heart it lasted until he reached his bedchamber again and sat to plan the rest of his ploy his dark prayer his suicide it was night the crow would not fly to his window at night even for the piece of bread hed snatched from the banqueting hall before returning to the main block he turned the bread roll over in his hands the crows roosted in fonsas tower if they wouldnt fly to him he could crawl to them over the roof slates sliding in the dark and then back to his chamber with a squawking bundle under his arm no let the bundle be the bagged rat if he did the deed there in the shadow of the broken roof upon whatever scorched and shaking platform still stood inside hed only have to make the trip one way and death magic had worked there once before eh spectacularly for iselles grandfather would fonsas spirit lend his aid to his granddaughters unholy soldier his tower was a fraught place sacred to the bastard and his pets especially at night midnight in the cold rain cazarils body need never be found nor buried the crows could feast upon his remains fair trade for the depredation he planned upon their poor comrade animals were innocent even the grisly crows that innocence surely made them all a little sacred the dubious page arrived much quicker than cazaril had thought he might with a wriggling bag cazaril checked its contentsthe snapping hissing rat must have weighed a pound and a halfand paid up the page pocketed his coin and walked off staring over his shoulder cazaril fastened the mouth of the bag tight and locked it in his chest to prevent the condemned prisoners escape he put off his courtiers garb and put on the robe and vestcloak the wool merchant had died in just for luck boots shoes barefoot which would be more secure upon the slippery stones and slates barefoot he decided but he slipped on his shoes for one last practical expedition betriz he whispered loudly through the door of his office antechamber lady betriz i know its latecan you come out to me she was still fully dressed for the day still pale and exhausted she let him grip her hands and leaned her forehead briefly against his chest the warm scent of her hair took him back for a dizzy instant to his second day in valenda standing by her in the temple crowd the only thing unchanged from that happy hour was her loyalty how does the royesse cazaril asked her she looked up in the dim candlelight she prays unceasingly to the daughter she has not eaten or drunk since yesterday i dont know where the gods are nor why they have abandoned us i couldnt kill dondo today i couldnt get near him id guessed as much or we would have heard something i have one more thing to try if it doesnt work ill return in the morning and well see what we can do with your knife but i just wanted you to know if i dont come back in the morning im all right and not to worry about me or look for me youre not abandoning us her hands spasmed around his no never she blinked i dont understand thats all right take care of iselle dont trust the chancellor dy jironal ever i dont need you to tell me that theres more my friend palli the march dy palliar knows the true story of how i was betrayed after gotorget how i came to be enemies with dondo wont matter but iselle should know his elder brother deliberately struck me from the list of men to be ransomed to betray me to the galleys and my death theres no doubt i saw the list in his own hand which i knew well from his military orders she hissed through clenched teeth can nothing be done i doubt it if it could be proved some half the lords of chalion would likely refuse to ride under his banner thereafter maybe it would be enough to topple him or not its a quarrel iselle can store up in her quiver someday she may be able to fire it he stared down at her face turned up to his ivory and coral and deep deep ebony eyes huge in the dim light awkwardly he bent and kissed her her breath stopped then she laughed in startlement and put her hand to her mouth im sorry your beard scratches i forgive me palli would make you a most honorable husband if youre inclined to him hes very true as true as you tell him i said so cazaril what are you nan dy vrit called from the royesses chambers betriz come here please he must part with everything now even regret he kissed her hands and fled the night scramble over the roof of the zangre from main block to fonsas tower was every bit as stomachchurning as cazaril had anticipated it was still raining the moon shone fitfully behind the clouds but its gloomy radiance didnt help much the footing was either gritty or breathcatchingly slippery under his naked soles and numbingly cold the worst part was the final little jump across about six feet to the top of the round tower fortunately the leap was angled down and not up and he didnt end a simple suicide wasted spattered on the cobbles far below bag jerking in his hand breath whistling past his cold lips he half squatted trembling after the jump leaning into a bank of roof slates slick with rain beneath his hands he pictured one working loose shattering on the stones below drawing the guards attention upward slowly he worked his way around until the dark gap of the open roof yawned beside him he sat on the edge and felt with his feet he could touch no solid surface he waited for a little moonlight was that a floor down there or a bit of rail a crow muttered in the dark he spent the next ten minutes teetering hands shaking trying to light the candle stub from his pocket by feel with flint and tinder in his lap he burned himself but won a little flame at last it was a rail and a bit of crude flooring someone had built up heavy timbering inside the tower after the fire to work on some reinforcement of the stones so they didnt fall down on peoples heads presumably cazaril held his breath and dropped to a solid if small and splintery platform he wedged his candle stub in a gap between two boards and lit another from it got out his bread and betrizs razoredged dirk and stared around catch a crow right it had sounded so simple back in his bedchamber he couldnt even see the crows in these flickering shadows a flap by his head as a crow landed on the railing nearly stopped his heart shivering he held out a bit of bread it snatched the fragment from his hand and flew off again cazaril cursed then drew some deep breaths and organized himself bread knife candles wriggling cloth bag man on his knees serenity in his heart hardly help me help me help me the crow or its twin brother returned caz caz it cried not very loudly but the sound echoed down the tower and back up weirdly resonant right huffed cazaril right he wrestled the rat from its bag laid the knife against its throat and whispered run to your lord with my prayer sharp and quick he let its lifeblood out the warm dark liquid ran over his hand he laid the little corpse down at his knee he held out his arm to his crow it hopped aboard and bent to lap the rat blood from his hand its black tongue darting out startled him so much that he flinched and nearly lost the bird again he folded its body under his arm and kissed it on the head forgive me my need is great maybe the bastard will feed you the bread of the gods and you can ride on his shoulder when you reach him fly to your lord with my prayer a quick twist broke the crows neck it fluttered briefly quivering then went still in his hands he laid it down in front of his other knee lord bastard god of justice when justice fails of balance of all things out of season of my need for dy sanda for iselle for all who love herlady betriz royina ista the old provincara for the mess on my back for truth against lies receive my prayer he had no idea if those were the right words or if there were any right words his breath was coming short maybe he was crying surely he was crying he found himself bending over the dead animals a terrible pain was starting in his belly cramping burning in his gut oh he hadnt known this was going to hurt anyway its a better death than from a flight of brajaran crossbow bolts in my ass on the galley for no reason politely he remembered to say for your blessings too we thank you god of the unseason just like in his bedside prayers as a boy help me help me help me oh the candle flames guttered and died the dark world darkened further and went out cazarils eyes pulled open against the glue that rimmed their lids he stared up without comprehension at a ragged gray rift in the sky framed in black he licked crusted lips and swallowed he lay on his back on hard boardsthe bracing frame inside fonsas tower recollection of the night came rushing back to him i live therefore i have failed his right hand reaching blindly about him encountered an inert little mound of cold feathers and recoiled he lay panting in remembered terror a cramp gnawed his gut a dull ache he was shivering damp chilled through as cold as any corpse but not a corpse he breathed and so likewise must dondo dy jironal on was this his wedding morning as his eyes slowly adjusted he saw he was not alone lined up along the crude rail that bounded the workmens platform a dozen or more crows perched in the shadows utterly silent nearly still they all seemed to be staring down at him cazaril touched his face but no wounds bled thereno bird had tried an experimental peck yet no he whispered shakily i am not your breakfast im sorry one rustled its wings uneasily but none of them flapped away at the sound of his voice even when he sat up they shifted about but did not take to the air all was not drowned blackness since the night beforefragments of a dream coursed through his memory he had dreamed that he was dondo dy jironal roistering with his friends and their whores in some torchlit and candlegilded hall the board gleaming with silver goblets his thick hands glittering with rings he had toasted the bloodsacrifice of iselles maidenhood with obscene jests and drunk deeply then hed been taken with a cough a scratching in his throat that needled rapidly to pain his throat had swelled closing shut choking him cutting off his air as if he were being strangled from the inside out the flushed faces of his companions had whirled about him their laughter and derision turning to panic as it was forced upon them by his purpling livid features that he was not clowning cries wine cups knocked over shocked fearful hisses of poison no last words squeezed through that inwardstrangled throat past that thickening tongue just silent convulsions laboring heart racing viselike pain in the chest and head black clouds shot with red boiling up in his darkening vision it was only a dream if i live so does he cazaril lay back down upon the hard boards curled around his bellyache for half the turning of a glass exhausted despairing the row of crows kept watch over him in unnerving silence it gradually came to him that he would have to go back and he hadnt planned a return route he might climb down the bracing frames but that would leave him standing in the bottom of a brickedup tower atop a yearslong accumulation of guano and detritus crying to be let out could anyone even hear him through the thick stone would they take his muffled voice for an echo of the crows caws or the howling of a ghost up then back the way hed come in he stood at last pulling himself up by the raileven now the crows did not fly awayand stretched his cramped and aching muscles he had to physically shove a couple of crows from the railing to clear a place to stand they flapped off indignantly but still with that uncanny silence he rucked up the brown gown tucked hem in belt when he balanced on the rail it was a short reach to the towers rim he grasped heaved his arms were strong and his body was lean one hideous moment of consciousness of the air below his bare kicking legs and he was up over the stones and out onto the slates the fog was so thick he could barely see down into the courtyard below dawn or just after dawn he guessed the lesser denizens of the castle would already be awake this tagendofautumn morning the crows followed him solemnly flapping up one by one through the gap in the roof to find perches on stone or slate their heads turned to track his progress he had a vision of them mobbing him to spoil his next leap from the tower up to the main block revenging their comrade and then another vision as his feet scrambled and his arms shook of letting go letting it all go and falling to his welcome death on the stones below a wrenching cramp coiled in his gut driving out his breath in a gasp he would have let go then except for the sudden terror that he might survive the fall legsmashed and crippled only that drove him up over the eaves to the slates of the main blocks roof his muscles cracked as he lifted himself his hands were scraped raw by their frantic gripping he was not sure in this paling fog which of the dozen dormer windows erupting out of the slates hed emerged from last night suppose someone had come along and closed and locked it since he inched slowly along trying each one the crows followed stalking along the gutters flapping up in brief hops their clawed feet slipping on the slates too at times the mist beaded glistening on their feathers and in his beard and hair silver sequins on his black vestcloak the fourth casement window swung open to his scrabbling fingers it was the unused lumber room he slid through and slammed it upon his blackliveried escort just in time to stop a couple of the birds from flying in after him one bounced off the glass with a thud he crept down the stairs to his floor without encountering any early servants stumbled into his chamber and closed the door behind him tightbladdered and cramping he used his chamber pot his bowels voided frightening blood clots his hands trembled as he washed them in his basin when he went to fling the bloodied wash water out into the ravine the opening window dislodged two silent sentinel crows from the stone sill he closed it tight again and locked the latch he weaved to his bed like a man drunk on his feet fell into it and wrapped his coverlet around himself as his shivering continued he could hear the sounds of the castles servants carrying water or linens or pots feet plodding up stairs and down corridors an occasional lowvoiced call or order was iselle being waked now on the floor above to be washed and attired bound in ropes of pearls chained in jewels for her dreadful appointment with dondo had she even slept or wept all night prayed to gods gone deaf he should go up to offer what comfort he could had betriz found another knife i cannot bear to face them he curled tighter and shut his eyes in agony he was still lying in bed gasping in breaths perilously close to sobs when booted steps sounded in the corridor and his door banged open chancellor dy jironals voice snarled i know its him it has to be him the steps stalked across his floorboards and his coverlet was snatched from him he rolled over and stared up in surprise at dy jironals steelbearded panting face glaring down at him in astonishment youre alive cried dy jironal his voice was indignant half a dozen courtiers a couple of whom cazaril recognized as dondos bravos crowded dy jironals shoulder to gape at him they had their hands upon their swords as if prepared to correct this mistaken animation of cazarils at dy jironals word roya orico clad in a nightgown a shabby old cloak clutched about his neck by his fat fingers stood at the back of the mob orico looked strange cazaril blinked and rubbed his eyes a kind of aura surrounded the roya not of light but of darkness cazaril could see him perfectly clearly so he could not call it a cloud or a fog for it obscured nothing and yet it was there moving as the man moved like a trailing garment dy jironal bit his lip his eyes boring into cazarils face if not youwho then it has to be someone it has to be someone close to that girl the foul little murderess he spun around and stormed out curtly motioning his men to follow him whats afoot cazaril demanded of orico who had turned to waddle after them orico looked back over his shoulder and spread his hands in a wide bewildered shrug weddings off dondo dy jironal was murdered around midnight last nightby death magic cazarils mouth opened nothing came out but a weak oh he sank back dazed as orico shuffled out after his chancellor i dont understand if dondo is slain and yet i live i cannot have been granted a death miracle and yet dondo is slain how how else but that someone had beaten cazaril to the deed belatedly his wits caught up with dy jironals betriz no oh no he surged out of bed fell heavily to the floor scrambled to his feet and staggered after the crowd of enraged and baffled courtiers he arrived at his invaded office antechamber to hear dy jironal bellowing then bring her out that i may see to a disheveled and frightenedlooking nan dy vrit who nevertheless blocked the doorway to the inner rooms with her body as though ready to defend a drawbridge cazaril nearly fainted with relief when betriz frowning fiercely came up behind nans shoulder nan was in her nightdress but betriz rumpled and wearylooking was still wearing the same green wool gown shed had on last night had she slept but she lives she lives why do you make this uncouth roaring here my lord betriz demanded coldly it is unseemly and untimely dy jironals lips parted in his beard he was clearly taken aback after a moment his teeth snapped closed where is the royesse then i must see the royesse she is sleeping a little for the first time in days ill not have her disturbed shell have to exchange dreams for nightmare soon enough betrizs nostrils flared with open hostility dy jironals back straightened his breath hissed in wake her can you wake her dear gods might iselle have but before this new panic closed down cazarils throat iselle herself appeared pushed between her ladies and walked coolly forward into the antechamber to face dy jironal i do not sleep what do you want my lord her eyes passed over her brother orico hovering at the edge of the mob and dismissed him with contempt returning to dy jironal her brows tensed in wariness no question but that she understood whose power forced her to her unwelcome wedding dy jironal stared from woman to woman all indisputably alive before him he wheeled around and stared again at cazaril who was blinking at iselle aura flared around her too just like orico but hers was more disturbed a churning of deep darkness and luminous pale blue like the aurora hed once seen in the far southern night sky whoever grated dy jironal wherever ill find the filthy cowards corpse if i have to search all of chalion and then what inquired orico rubbing his unshaven jowls hang it he returned a raisedbrow look of irony for dy jironals driven glare dy jironal whirled and stamped back out cazaril stepped aside to let the entourage pass his gaze flicking covertly from orico to iselle comparing the two hallucinations no one else here pulsed like that maybe im sick maybe im mad cazaril said iselle in urgent bewilderment as soon as the men had cleared the outer doornan hurried to shut it behind the invaderswhat has happened someone killed dondo dy jironal last night by death magic her lips parted and her hands clasped together like a child just promised its hearts desire oh oh oh this is welcome news oh thank the lady oh thank the bastardi will send such gifts to his altaroh cazaril who at betrizs look of wild surmise in his direction cazaril grimaced not me obviously though not for want of trying did you betriz began then pressed her lips closed cazarils grimace tilted in appreciation of her delicacy in not inquiring out loud before two witnesses if hed plotted a capital crime he hardly needed to speak her eyes blazed with speculation iselle paced back and forth almost bouncing with relief i think i felt it she said in a voice of great wonder in any case i felt something midnight around midnight you said no one had said so here an easing of my heart as if something in me knew my prayers were heard but i never expected this id asked the lady for my death she paused and touched her hand to her broad white forehead or what she willed her voice slowed cazaril did i could i have done this did the goddess answer me so i i dont see how royesse you prayed to the lady of spring did you not yes and to her mother of summer both but mostly to spring herself the great ladies grant miracles of life and healing not death normally and all miracles were rare and capricious gods who knew their limits their purposes it didnt feel like death iselle confessed and yet i was eased i took a little food and didnt throw it up and i slept for a time nan dy vrit nodded confirmation and glad i was of it my lady cazaril took a deep breath well dy jironal will solve the mystery for us im sure hell hunt down every person to die last night in cardegossin all of chalion i have no doubtuntil he finds out his brothers murderer bless the poor soul who put his vile plans in such disarray formally iselle touched forehead lip navel groin and heart spreading her fingers wide and at such a cost may the bastards demons grant him what mercy ever they can amen said cazaril lets just hope dy jironal finds no close comrades or family to wreak his vengeance upon he wrapped his arms around his belly which was cramping again betriz came near him and stared him in the face her hand going out but then falling back hesitantly lord caz you look dreadful your skin is the color of cold porridge im ill something i ate he took a breath so we prepare today not for grievous wedding but joyous funeral i trust you ladies will contain your glee in public nan dy vrit snorted iselle motioned her to silence and said firmly solemn piety i promise you and if it is thanksgiving and not sorrow in my heart only the gods shall know cazaril nodded and rubbed his aching neck usually a victim of death magic is burned before nightfall to deny the body the divines say to uncanny things that might want to move in apparently such a death invites them it will be a terribly hurried funeral for such a high lord theyll have to assemble all before dark iselles coruscating aura was making him almost nauseated he swallowed and looked away from her then cazaril said betriz for pitys sake go lie down till then were safe all unexpectedly you need do no more she took him by his cold hands clasped them briefly and smiled in wry concern he managed a wan return smile and retreated he crawled back into his bed he had lain there perhaps an hour bewildered and still shivering when his door swung open and betriz tiptoed in to stare down at him she laid a hand across his clammy forehead i was afraid youd taken a fever she said but youre chilled i was um chilled yes must have thrown off my blankets in the night she touched his shoulder your clothes are damp through her eyes narrowed when was the last time you ate he could not remember yesterday morning i think i see she frowned at him a moment longer then whirled and went out ten minutes later a maid arrived with a warming pan full of hot coals and a feather quilt a few minutes after that a manservant with a can of hot water and firm instructions to see him washed and put back to bed in dry nightclothes this in a castle gone mad with the disruption of every courtier and lady at once trying to prepare themselves for an unscheduled public appearance of utmost formality cazaril questioned nothing the servant had just finished tucking him into the hot dry envelope of his sheets when betriz reappeared with a crockery bowl on a tray she propped his door open and seated herself on the edge of his bed eat this it was bread soaked in steaming milk laced with honey he accepted the first spoonful in bemused surprise then struggled up on his pillows im not that sick attempting to regain his dignity he took the bowl from her she made no objection as long as he continued to eat he discovered he was ravenous by the time hed finished hed stopped shivering she smiled in satisfaction your colors much less ghastly now good how fares the royesse vastly better shes i want to say collapsed but i dont mean overcome the blessed release that comes when an unbearable pressure is suddenly removed its a joy to look upon her yes i understand betriz nodded shes resting now till time to dress she took the empty bowl from him set it aside and lowered her voice cazaril what did you do last night nothing evidently her lips thinned in exasperation but what use was it to lay the burden of his secret upon her now confession might relieve his soul but it would put hers in danger in any subsequent investigation that demanded oathsworn testimony from her lord dy rinal had it that you paid a page to catch you a rat last night it was that news that sent chancellor dy jironal pelting up to your bedchamber dy rinal told me the page said youd claimed you wanted it to eat well so its no crime for a man to eat a rat it was a little memorial feast for the siege of gotorget oh you just said youd eaten nothing since yesterday morning she hesitated her eyes anxious the chambermaid also said there was blood in your pot that she emptied this morning bastards demons cazaril who had slid down into his covers struggled up again is nothing sacred to castle gossip cant a man even call his chamber pot his own here she held out a hand lord caz dont joke how sick are you i had a bellyache its eased off now a passing thing so to speak he grimaced and decided not to mention the hallucinations obviously the blood in the pot was from butchering the rat and the bellyache just what i deserved for eating such a disgusting creature eh she said slowly its a good story it all hangs together so there but cazpeople will think youre strange i can add them to the collection along with the ones who think i rape girls i suppose i need a third perversion to balance me properly well there was being suspected of attempting death magic that could balance him over a gallows she sat back frowning deeply all right i wont press you but i was wondering she wrapped her arms around herself and regarded him intently if twotheoreticalpersons were to attempt death magic on the same victim at the same time might they each end up halfdead cazaril stared backno she didnt look sickand shook his head i dont think so given all the various vain attempts that people have made to compel the gods with death magic if it could happen that way it surely would have before now the bastards death demon is always portrayed in the temple carvings with a yoke over his shoulders and two identical buckets one for each soul i dont think the demon can choose differently umegats words came back to him im afraid thats just the way it works im not even sure the god can choose differently her eyes narrowed further you said if you werent back this morning not to worry for you or look for you you said youd be all right you also said if the bodies are not burned properly terrible uncanny things happen to them he shifted uncomfortably i made provision of sorts what provision you sneaked away leaving none who cared for you to know where to look or even whether to pray he cleared his throat fonsas crows i climbed over the roof to fonsas tower to ah say my prayers last night if if things had ah come out differently i figured theyd clear up the mess just as their brethren clean up a battlefield or a stray sheep lost over a cliff cazaril she cried in indignation then hastily lowered her voice to a near whisper caz thats thats you mean to tell me you crawled off all alone to die in despair expecting to leave your body to be eaten by thats horrid he was startled to see tears welling in her eyes hey now its not so bad right soldierly i thought his hand began to reach for the drops on her cheeks then hesitated and fell back to his coverlet her fists clenched in her lap if you ever do anything like that again without telling metelling anyoneill ill slap you silly she knuckled her eyes rubbed her face and sat up her spine stern her voice returned abruptly to a conversational tone the funeral has been set for an hour before sunset at the temple do you mean to go or will you stay in bed if i can walk at all im going i mean to see it through every enemy of dondos will be there if only to prove they didnt do it its going to be a remarkable event to behold the funeral rites at the temple of cardegoss were far more heavily attended for dondo dy jironal than they had been for poor lonely dy sanda roya orico himself soberly garbed led the mourners from the zangre walking in loose procession down the hill royina sara was carried in a sedan chair her face was as blank as though carved from an ice block but her raiment was a shout of color festival gear from three holidays jumbled together draped and spangled with what looked like half the jewels from her jewel case everyone pretended not to notice cazaril eyed her covertly but not for the sake of her bizarrely chosen clothing it was the other garment the shadowcloak visibleinvisible twin to oricos that tugged and twisted at his minds eye teidez wore another such dark aura blurring along with his steps down the cobbled streets whatever the black mirage was it seemed to run in the family cazaril wondered what he would see if he could look upon dowager royina ista right now the archdivine of cardegoss himself in his fivecolored robes conducted the ceremony so crowded it was held in the temples main courtyard the procession from the jironals palace placed the bier with dondos body down a few paces in front of the gods hearth a round stone platform with a pierced copper tent raised over it on five slim pillars to protect the holy fire from the elements a shadowless gray light filled the court as the cold wet day sank toward foggy evening the air was hazy violet with a clashing mélange of the incenses burned in the prayers and rites of cleansing dondos stiff body laid out on the bier and banked around with flowers and herbs of good fortune and symbolic protectiontoo late cazaril thoughthad been dressed in the blueandwhite robes of his holy generalship of the daughters military order the sword of his rank lay unsheathed upon his chest his hands clasped over the hilt his body did not seem particularly swollen or misshapendy rinal whispered the gruesome rumor that it had been tightly wrapped with linen bands before being dressed the corpses face was hardly more puffy than from one of dondos morning hangovers but he would have to be burned with his rings still on theyd never pry them from those sausage fingers without the aid of a butchers knife cazaril had managed the walk down from the zangre without stumbling but his stomach was cramping again now unpleasantly distended against his belt he took what he hoped was an unobtrusive place standing behind betriz and nan in the crowd from the castle iselle was pulled away to stand between the chancellor and roya orico in the position of a chief mourner that her brief betrothal bequeathed her she was still shimmering like an aurora in cazarils aching eyes her face was stern and pale the sight of dondos body had apparently drained her of any impulse to an unseemly display of joy two courtiers stepped forth to deliver seemingly heartfelt eulogies upon dondo that cazaril entirely failed to relate to the erratic real life of the man cut down here chancellor dy jironal was too overcome to speak very long though whether with grief or rage or both it was hard to tell beneath that steely surface he did announce a purse of a thousand royals reward for information leading to the identification of his brothers murderer the only overt reference made this day to the abrupt manner of dondos death it was clear that a large purse had been laid down on the temple altar what seemed all the dedicats acolytes and divines of cardegoss were massed in robed blocks to chant the prayers and responses in both unison and harmony as though extra holiness were to be obtained by volume one of the singers in the greenrobed squad of altos caught cazarils inner eye she was middleaged and dumpy and she glowed like a candle seen through green glass she looked up once directly at cazaril then away back to the harried divine who directed their orisons cazaril nudged nan and whispered who is that woman acolyte on the end of the second row of the mothers singers do you know she glanced over one of the mothers midwives i believe shes said to be very good oh when the sacred animals were led forth the crowd grew attentive it was by no means clear which god would take up the soul of dondo dy jironal his predecessor in the daughters generalship though a father and grandfather had been claimed at once by the lady of spring in whose long service he had died dondo himself had served in the sons military order as an officer in his youth and he was known to have sired a scattering of bastards as well as two scorned daughters by his late first wife left to be raised by country kin andunspoken thoughtas his soul had been carried off by the bastards death demon it had surely passed through the bastards hands might those hands have closed upon it the acolytegroom carrying the daughters jay stepped forth at archdivine mendenals gesture and raised her wrist the bird bobbed but clung stubbornly to her sleeve she glanced up at the archdivine who frowned and gave her a little nod toward the bier her nostrils flared in faint protest but she obediently stepped forward wrapped both hands around the jay and set it firmly down upon the corpses chest she lifted her hands the jay lifted its tail dropped a blob of guano and shot skyward trailing its embroidered silk jesses screeching piercingly at least three men in cazarils hearing choked and hissed but at the sight of the chancellors set teeth did not laugh aloud iselles eyes blazed like cerulean fires and she cast her glance demurely downward her aura roiled the acolyte stepped back head tipped up following the birds flight anxiously the jay came to roost on the ornaments at the top of one of the ring of porphyry pillars circling the court and screeched again the acolyte glared at the archdivine he waved her hastily away and she bowed and retreated to go try to coax the bird back to her hand the mothers green bird also refused to leave its handlers arm archdivine mendenal did not repeat the previous disastrous experiment but merely nodded her back to her place in the circle of creatures the sons acolyte dragged the fox by its chain to the edge of the bier the animal whined and snapped its black claws scrabbling noisily on the tiles as it struggled to get away the archdivine waved him back the stout gray wolf sitting on its haunches with its great red tongue lolling out of its unmuzzled jaws growled deeply as its grayrobed handler suggestively lifted its silver chain the vibrato resonated around the stone courtyard the wolf lowered itself to its belly on the tiles and stretched out its paws gingerly the acolyte lowered his hands and stood down his glance at the archdivine shouted silently im not touching this mendenal didnt argue all eyes turned expectantly to the bastards whiterobed acolyte with her white rats chancellor dy jironals lips were pressed flat and pale with his impotent fury but there was nothing he could do or say the white lady took a breath stepped forward to the bier and lowered her sacred creatures to dondos chest to sign the gods acceptance of the unacceptable disdained discarded soul the moment her hands released the silky white bodies both rats sprang away to either side of the bier as though shot from catapults the acolyte dodged right and left as though unable to decide which sacred charge to chase after first and flung up her hands one rat scurried for the safety of the pillars the other scampered into the crowd of mourners which stirred around its track a couple of ladies yipped nervously a murmur of astonishment disbelief and dismay ran through the array of courtiers and ladies and a stream of shocked whispers betrizs was among them cazaril she said anxiously crowding back under his arm to hiss in his ear what does it mean the bastard always takes the leftovers always it is his his its his job he cant not take a severed souli thought he already had cazaril was stunned too if no god has taken up lord dondos soul then its still in the world i mean if its not there then it has to be here somewhere an unquiet ghost a revenant spirit sundered and damned the ceremonies stopped dead as the archdivine and chancellor dy jironal retreated around the hearth for a lowvoiced conversation or possibly argument from the rise and chop of swallowed words that drifted back to the curious crowd waiting the archdivine popped around the hearth to call an acolyte of the bastard to him after a whispered conference the whitegarbed young man departed at a run the gray sky overhead was darkening a subdivine in a burst of initiative struck up an unscheduled hymn from the robed singers to cover the gap by the time theyd finished dy jironal and mendenal had returned still they waited the singers embarked on another hymn cazaril found himself wishing hed used ordols fivefold pathway for something other than a prop to cover his naps alas the book was still back in valenda if dondos spirit had not been taken by the servantdemon back to its master where was it and if the demon could not return except with both its soulbuckets filled where was the sundered soul of dondos unknown murderer now for that matter where was the demon cazaril had never read much theology for some reason now obscure to him hed thought it an impractical study suited only to unworldly dreamers till hed waked to this nightmare a scritching noise from his boot made him look down the sacred white rat was stretching itself up his leg its pink nose quivering it rubbed its little pointed face rapidly against cazarils shin he bent and picked it up meaning to return it to its handler it writhed ecstatically in his cupped hands and licked his thumb to cazarils surprise the wheezing acolyte returned to the temple courtyard leading the groom umegat dressed as usual in the tabard of the zangre but it was umegat who stunned him the roknari shone with a white aura like a man standing in front of a clear glass window at a sea dawn cazaril shut his eyes though he knew he didnt see this with his eyes the white blaze still moved behind his lids over there a darkness that wasnt darkness and two more and an unrestful aurora and off to the side a faint green spark his eyes sprang open umegat stared straight at him for the fraction of a second and cazaril felt flensed the royas groom moved on to present himself with a diffident bow to the archdivine and step aside for some whispered conference the archdivine called the bastards acolyte to him who had recaptured one of her charges she gave up the rat to umegat who cradled it in one arm and glanced toward cazaril the roknari groom trod over to him humbly excusing himself through the crowd of courtiers who barely glanced at him cazaril could not understand why they did not open before that bow wave of his white aura like the sea before a spinnakerdriven ship umegat held out his open hand cazaril blinked down stupidly at it the sacred rat my lord prompted umegat gently oh the creature was still sucking on his fingers tickling them umegat pulled the reluctant animal off cazarils sleeve as though removing a burr and just prevented its mate from springing across to take its place juggling rats he walked quietly back to the bier where the archdivine waited was cazaril losing his minddont answer thator did mendenal barely keep himself from bowing to the groom the zangres courtiers seemed to see nothing unreasonable in the archdivine calling in the royas most expert animalhandler in this awkward crisis all eyes were locked on the rats not on the roknari the unreason was all cazarils umegat held the creatures in his arms and whispered to them and approached dondos body a long moment while the rats though quiescent made no move to claim dondo for their god at last umegat backed away and shook his head apologetically to the archdivine and gave up the rats to their anxious young woman mendenal prostrated himself between the hearth and the bier for a moment of abject prayer but rose again soon dedicats were bringing out tapers to light the wall lanterns around the darkening courtyard the archdivine called forth the pallbearers to take up the bier to dondos waiting pyre and the singers filed out in procession iselle returned to betriz and cazaril she rubbed the back of her hand across eyes rimmed with dark circles i dont think i can bear any more of this dy jironal can see to his brothers roasting take me home lord caz the royesses little party split off from the main body of mourners not the only wearied persons to do so and exited through the front portico into the damp dusk of the autumn day the groom umegat waiting with his shoulders propped against a pillar shoved himself upright came toward them and bowed my lord dy cazaril might i have a brief word it almost surprised cazaril that the aura did not reflect off the wet pavement at his feet he gave iselle an apologetic salute and went aside with the roknari the three women waited at the edge of the portico iselle leaning on betrizs arm my lord at your earliest convenience i beg that i might have some private audience with you ill come to you at the menagerie as soon as i have iselle settled cazaril hesitated do you know that you are lit like a burning torch the groom inclined his head so i have been told my lord by the few with eyes to see one can never see oneself alas no mundane mirror reflects this only the eyes of a soul there was a woman inside who glowed like a green candle mother clara yes she just spoke to me of you she is a most excellent midwife what is that that antilight then cazaril glanced toward where the women lingered umegat touched his lips not here if you please my lord cazarils mouth formed a silent oh he nodded the roknari swept him a lower bow as he turned to pad quietly into the gathering gloom he added over his shoulder you are lit like a burning city the royesse was so drained by the ordeal of lord dondos odd funeral that she was stumbling by the time they had climbed to the castle again cazaril left nan and betriz making sensible plans to put iselle straight to bed and have the servants bring a plain dinner to their chambers he made his way back out of the main block to the zangres gates pausing he glanced out over the city to see if a column of smoke was still rising from the temple he fancied he saw a faint orange reflection on the lowering clouds but it was too dark by now to make out anything more his heart leapt in shock at the sudden flapping around him as he crossed the stable yard but it was only fonsas crows mobbing him again he fended off two that attempted to land on his shoulder and tried to wave them away hissing and stamping they hopped back out of reach but would not leave following him conspicuously all the way to the menagerie one of umegats undergrooms was waiting by the wall lanterns bracketing the aisle door he was a little elderly thumbless man who gave cazaril a wide smile that showed a truncated tongue accounting for a welcome that was a kind of mouthed hum the meaning made clear by his friendly gestures he slid the broad door back just enough to admit cazaril before him and shooed away the crows who tried to follow scooping the most persistent one back out the gap with a flip of his foot before closing it the grooms candlestick shielded by a blownglass tulip had a thick handle made for him to wrap his fingers around by this light he guided cazaril down the menageries aisle the animals in their stalls snuffled and thumped as cazaril passed pressing to the bars to stare at him from the shadows the leopards eyes shone like green sparks its ratcheting growl echoed off the walls not low and hostile but pulsing in a weirdly inquiring singsong the menageries grooms had their sleeping quarters on half the buildings upper floor the other half being devoted to the storage of fodder and straw a door stood open candlelight spilling from it into the dark corridor the undergroom knocked on the frame umegats voice responded good thank you the undergroom gave way with a bow cazaril ducked through the door to see a narrow but private chamber with a window looking out over the dark stable yard umegat pulled the curtain across the window and bustled around a rude pine table that held a brightly patterned cloth a wine jug and clay cups and a plate with bread and cheese thank you for coming lord cazaril enter please seat yourself thank you daris that will be all umegat closed the door cazaril paused on the way to the chair umegats gesture had indicated to stare at a tall shelf crammed with books including titles in ibran darthacan and roknari a bit of gold lettering on a familiarlooking spine on the top shelf caught his eye the fivefold pathway of the soul ordol the leather binding was worn with use the volume and most of its company free of dust theology mostly why am i not surprised cazaril lowered himself onto the plain wooden chair umegat turned up a cup and poured a heavy red wine into it smiled briefly and held it out to his guest cazaril closed his shaking hands around it with vast gratitude thank you i need that i should imagine so my lord umegat poured a cup for himself and sat across the table from cazaril the table might be plain and poor but the generous braces of wax candles upon it gave a rich clear light a reading mans light cazaril raised the cup to his lips and gulped when he set it down umegat immediately topped it up again cazaril closed his eyes and opened them open or shut umegat still glowed you are an acolyteno youre a divine arent you said cazaril umegat cleared his throat apologetically yes of the bastards order although that is not why i am here why are you here well come to that umegat bent forward picked up the waiting knife and began to saw off hunks of bread and cheese i thoughti hopedi wonderedif you might have been sent by the gods to guide and guard me umegats lip quirked up indeed and here i was wondering if you had been sent by the gods to guide and guard me oh thats not so good then cazaril shrank a little in his seat and took another gulp of wine since when since the day in the menagerie that fonsas crow practically jumped up and down on your head crying this one this one my chosen god is dare i say it fiendishly ambiguous at times but that was a little hard to miss was i glowing then no when did i start um doing that sometime between the last time i saw you which was late yesterday afternoon when you came back to the zangre limping as though youd been thrown from a horse and today at the temple i believe you may have a better guess than i do as to the exact time will you not take a little food my lord you dont look well cazaril had eaten nothing since betriz had brought him the milk sops at noon umegat waited until his guests mouth was full of cheese and chewy crust before remarking one of my varied tasks as a young divine before i came to cardegoss was as an assistant inquirer for the temple investigating alleged charges of death magic cazaril choked umegat went on serenely or death miracle to put it with more theological accuracy we uncovered quite a number of ingenious fakesusually poison though the ah dimmer murderers sometimes tried cruder methods i had to explain to them that the bastard does not ever execute unrepentant sinners with a dirk nor a large hammer the true miracles were much more rare than their notoriety would suggest but i never encountered an authentic case where the victim was an innocent to put it more finely still what the bastard granted was miracles of justice his voice had grown crisper more decisive the servility evaporating out of it along with most of his soft roknari accent ah cazaril mumbled and took another gulp of wine this is the most witfull man i have met in cardegoss and ive spent the last three months looking past him because he wears a servants garb granted umegat apparently did not wish to draw attention to himself that tabard is as good as a cloak of invisibility you know umegat smiled and took a sip of his wine yes so are you an inquirer now was it all over would he be charged convicted executed for his murderous if vain attempt on dondo no not anymore what are you then to cazarils bewilderment umegats eyes crinkled with laughter im a saint cazaril stared at him for a long long moment then drained his cup amiably umegat refilled it cazaril was certain of very little tonight but somehow he didnt think umegat was mad or lying a saint of the bastard umegat nodded thats an unusual line of work for a roknari how did it come about this was inane but with two cups of wine on an empty stomach he was growing lightheaded umegats smile grew sadly introspective for youthe truth i suppose the names no longer matter this was a lifetime ago when i was a young lord in the archipelago i fell in love young lords and young louts do that everywhere my lover was about thirty then a man of keen mind and kind heart oh not in the archipelago you dont indeed i had no interest in religion whatsoever for obvious reasons he was a secret quintarian we made plans to flee together i reached the ship to brajar he did not i spent the voyage seasick and desperate learningi thoughtto pray hoping hed made it to another vessel and wed meet in the port city wed chosen for our destination it was over a year before i found out how hed met his end from a roknari merchant trading there whom we had once both known cazaril took a drink the usual oh yes genitals thumbsthat he might not sign the fifth god umegat touched forehead navel groin and heart folding his thumb beneath his palm in the quadrene fashion denying the fifth finger that was the bastardsthey saved his tongue for last that he might betray others he never did he died a martyr hanged cazaril touched forehead lip navel groin and heart fingers spread wide im sorry umegat nodded i thought about it for a time at least those times when i wasnt drunk or vomiting or being stupid eh youth eh it didnt come easily finally one day i walked to the temple and turned myself in he took a breath and the bastards order took me in gave a home to the homeless friends to the friendless honor to the despised and they gave me work i was charmed a temple divine umegat was leaving out a few details cazaril felt forty years or so of them but there was nothing inexplicable about an intelligent energetic dedicated man rising through the temple hierarchy to such a rank it was the part about shining like a full moon over a snowfall that was making his head reel good wonderful great works foundling hospitals and um inquiries now explain why you glow in the dark he had either drunk too much or not nearly enough he decided glumly umegat rubbed his neck and pulled gently on his queue do you understand what it means to be a saint cazaril cleared his throat uncomfortably you must be very virtuous i suppose no in fact one need not be good or even nice umegat looked wry of a sudden grant you once one experiences what one experiences ones tastes change material ambition seems immaterial greed pride vanity wrath just grow too dull to bother with lust umegat brightened lust im happy to say seems largely unaffected or perhaps i might grant love for the cruelty and selfishness that make lust vile become tedious but personally i think it is not so much the growth of virtue as simply the replacement of prior vices with an addiction to ones god umegat emptied his cup the gods love their greatsouled men and women as an artist loves fine marble but the issue isnt virtue it is will which is chisel and hammer has anyone ever quoted you ordols classic sermon of the cups that thing where the divine pours water all over everything i first heard it when i was ten i thought it was pretty entertaining when he got his shoes wet but then i was ten im afraid our temple divine at cazaril tended to drone on attend now and you shall not be bored umegat inverted his clay cup upon the cloth mens will is free the gods may not invade it any more than i may pour wine into this cup through its bottom no dont waste the wine cazaril protested as umegat reached for the jug ive seen it demonstrated before umegat grinned and desisted but have you really understood how powerless the gods are when the lowest slave may exclude them from his heart and if from his heart then from the world as well for the gods may not reach in except through living souls if the gods could seize passage from anyone they wished then men would be mere puppets only if they borrow or are given will from a willing creature do they have a little channel through which to act they can seep in through the minds of animals sometimes with effort plants require much foresight orumegat turned his cup upright again and lifted the jugsometimes a man may open himself to them and let them pour through him into the world he filled his cup a saint is not a virtuous soul but an empty one heor shefreely gives the gift of their will to their god and in renouncing action makes action possible he lifted his cup to his lips stared disquietingly at cazaril over the rim and drank he added your divine should not have used water it just doesnt hold the attention properly wine or blood in a pinch some liquid that matters um managed cazaril umegat sat back and studied him for a time cazaril didnt think the roknari was looking at his flesh so tell me whats a renegade roknari temple divine scholarsaint of the bastard doing disguised as a groom in the zangres menagerie out loud he managed to pare this down to a plaintive what are you doing here umegat shrugged what the god wills he took pity on cazarils exasperated look and added what he wills it seems is to keep roya orico alive cazaril sat up fighting the slurry that the wine seemed to be making of his brains orico sick yes a state secret mind you although one thats grown obvious enough to anyone with wits and eyes nevertheless umegat laid his finger to his lips in a command of discretion yes buti thought healing was the province of the mother and the daughter were the royas illness of natural causes yes unnatural causes cazaril squinted the dark cloakcan you see it too yes but teidez has the shadow too and iselleand royina sara is tainted as well what evil thing is it that you would not let me speak of it in the street umegat put his cup down tugged on his bronzegray queue and sighed it all goes back to fonsa the fairlywise and the golden general which is i suppose history and tale to you i lived through those desperate times he added conversationally i saw the general once you know i was a spy in his princedom at the time i hated everything he stood for and yet had he given me a word a mere word i think i might have crawled after him on my knees he was more than just godtouched he was avatar incarnate striding toward the fulcrum of the world in the perfected instant of time almost he was reaching for his moment when fonsa and the bastard cut him down umegats cultured voice lightly reminiscent had dropped to remembered awe he stared into the middle distance of his memory his gaze jumped out of the lost past and back to cazaril remembering to smile he held out his hand thumb up and waggled it gently from side to side the bastard though the weakest of his family is the god of balance the opposition that gives the hand its clever grip it is said that if ever one god subsumes all the others truth will become single and simple and perfect and the world will end in a burst of light some tidyminded men actually find this idea attractive personally i find it a horror but then i always did have low tastes in the meantime the bastard unfixed in any season circles to preserve us all umegats fingers tapped one by one daughtermothersonfather against the ball of his thumb he went on the golden general was a tidal wave of destiny gathering to crash upon the world fonsas soul could match his soul but could not balance his vast fate when the death demon carried their souls from the world that fate overflowed to settle upon fonsas heirs a miasma of ill luck and subtle bitterness the black shadow you see is the golden generals unfulfilled destiny curdling around his enemies lives his death curse if you will cazaril wondered if this explained why all of iass and oricos military campaigns that hed ever been in had fared so ill how how may the curse be lifted umegat sighed in six years no answer has been given me perhaps it will run out in the deaths of all who flowed from fonsas loins but thats the roya teideziselle or perhaps umegat continued even then it will continue to trickle down through time like a stream of poison it should have killed orico years ago contact with the sacred creatures cleanses the roya from the corrosion of the curse but only for a little time the menagerie delays his destruction but the god has never told me why umegats voice went glum the gods dont write letters of instruction you know not even to their saints ive suggested it in my prayers sat by the hour with the ink drying on my quill entirely at his service and what does he send instead an overexcited crow with a oneword vocabulary cazaril winced in guilt thinking of that poor crow in truth he felt far worse about the crows death than dondos so thats what im doing here said umegat he glanced up keenly at cazaril and so what are you doing here cazaril spread his hands helplessly umegat i dont know he added plaintively cant you tell you said i was lit up do i look like you or like iselle or orico even you look like nothing ive seen since i was lent the inner eye if iselle is a candle you are a conflagration you are actually quite disturbing to contemplate i dont feel like a conflagration what do you feel like right now like a pile of dung sick drunk he swirled the red wine in the bottom of his cup i have this belly cramp that comes and goes it was quiescent at the moment but his stomach was still swollen and tired i havent felt this tired since i was sick in the mothers house in zagosur i think umegat spoke carefully that it is very very important that you tell me the truth his lips still smiled but his gray eyes seemed to burn it occurred to cazaril then that a good temple inquirer would likely be charming and adept at worming confidences from people in his investigations smooth at getting them drunk you laid down your life its not fair to whine for it back now i attempted death magic upon dondo dy jironal last night umegat looked neither shocked nor surprised merely more intent yes where in fonsas tower i crawled over the roof slates i brought my own rat but the crow it came to me it wasnt afraid id fed it you see go on breathed umegat i slew the rat and broke the poor crow and i prayed on my knees and then i hurt i wasnt expecting that and i couldnt breathe the candles went out and i said thank you because i felt he could not speak of what hed felt that strange peace as if hed lain down in a place of safety to rest forever and then i passed out i thought i was dying and then then nothing i woke up in the dawn fog sick and cold and feeling an utter fool no waitid had a nightmare about dondo choking to death but i knew id failed so i crawled back to bed and then dy jironal came bursting in umegat drummed his fingers on the table a moment staring at him through slitted eyes and then he stared with his eyes closed open again my lord may i touch you all right briefly as the roknari bent over him cazaril feared some unwelcome attempt at intimacy but umegats touch was as professional as any physicians forehead face neck spine heart belly cazaril tensed but umegats hand descended no farther when he finished umegats face was set the roknari went to fetch another jug of wine from a basket by the door before returning to his chair cazaril attempted to fend the jug from his cup ive had enough ill be stumbling if i take any more my grooms can walk you back to your chambers in a little while no umegat filled his own cup instead and sat again he ran his finger over the tabletop in a little pattern repeated three timescazaril wasnt sure if it was a charm or just nervesand finally said by the testimony of the sacred animals no god accepted the soul of dondo dy jironal normally that is a sign that an unquiet spirit is abroad in the world and relatives and friendsand enemiesrush to buy rites and prayers from the temple some for the sake of the deadsome for their own protection i am sure said cazaril a little bitterly dondo will have all the prayers that money can buy i hope so why what what do you see what do you know umegat glanced up and inhaled dondos spirit was taken by the death demon but not passed to the gods this we know it is my conjecture that the death demon could not return to its master because it was prevented from taking the second and balancing soul cazaril licked his lips and husked fearfully how prevented at the instant of attempting to do so i believe the demon was capturedconstrainedbound if you willby a second and simultaneous miracle judging by the distinctive colors boiling off you it was from the holy and gracious hand of the lady of spring if i am right the acolytes of the temple can all go back to bed for dondos spirit is not abroad it is bound to the death demon who is bound in turn to the locus of the second soul which is presently bound to its stillliving body umegats finger rose to point directly at cazaril there cazarils jaw fell open he stared down at his aching swollen belly and back up at the fascinated saint briefly he was put in mind of fonsas entranced crows violent denial boiled to his lips and caught there stopped by his inner sight of umegats clear aura i didnt pray to the daughter last night apparently someone did iselle the royesse said she prayed did you see her as i saw her today cazaril made inarticulate motions with his hands not knowing what words to use to describe that roiling perturbation is that what you see in me does iselle see me as i do her did she say anything about it asked umegat no but neither did i umegat gave him that sidewise stare again did you ever see when you were in the archipelago the nights when the sea was mothertouched the way the wake glowed green in the breaking waves of a ships passage yes what you saw around iselle was such a wake the passage of the daughter like a lingering perfume in the air what i see in you is not a passage but a presence a blessing far more intense your corona is slowly dying downthe sacred animals should be less enthralled by you in a day or twobut at the center there sits a tight blue core of sapphire into which i cannot see i think it is an encapsulation he brought his cupped hands together like a man enclosing a live lizard cazaril swallowed and panted are you saying the goddess has turned my belly into a perfect little annex of hell one demon one lost soul sealed together like two snakes in a bottle his clawed hands went to his stomach as if ready to rip his guts apart on the spot and you call it a blessing umegats eyes remained serious but his brows crimped in sympathy well what is a blessing but a curse from another point of view if its any consolation to you i imagine dondo dy jironal is even less happy about this development than you are he added after a thoughtful moment i cant imagine the demon is too pleased with it either cazaril nearly convulsed out of his chair five gods how do i rid myself of thisthisthishorror umegat held up a restraining hand i suggest that you not be in a great rush about that the consequences could be tangled how tangled how could anything be more tangled than this monstrosity wellumegat leaned back and tented his hands togetherthe most obvious way to break the ah blessing would be by your death with your soul freed from its material locus the demon could fly away with you both a chill stole over cazaril as he remembered how his belly cramp had almost betrayed him to a fall when jumping the roof gap at dawn he took refuge from his drunken terror in a dryness to match umegats oh wonderful have you any other cures to suggest physician umegats lips twitched and he acknowledged the jibe with a brief wave of his fingers likewise should the miracle cease that you presently hostshould the ladys hand lift umegat mimed someone opening their hands as if to release a bird i think the demon would immediately attempt to complete its destiny not that it has a choicethe bastards demons have no free will you cant argue with or persuade them in fact theres no use talking to one at all so youre saying that i could die at any moment yes and this is different from your life yesterday in what way umegat cocked his head in dry inquiry cazaril snorted it was cold comfort but comfort still in a backhanded sort of way umegat was a sensible saint it seemed which was not what cazaril would have expected had he ever met a saint before how would i know i walked right past this one umegats voice took on a tinge of scholarly curiosity actually this could answer a question ive long had does the bastard command a troop of death demons or just one if all death miracles in the world cease while the demon is bound in you it would be compelling evidence for the singularity of that holy power a ghastly laugh pealed from cazarils lips my service to quintarian theology godsumegatwhat am i to do there has never been any of this this godtouched madness in my family im not fit for this business i am not a saint umegat opened his lips but then closed them again he finally said one grows more accustomed with use the first time i hosted a miracle i wasnt too happy either and im in the trade so to speak my personal recommendation to you tonight is to get pieeyed drunk and go to sleep so i can wake in the morning both demonridden and with a hangover granted he couldnt imagine getting to sleep under any other circumstances apart from a blow to the head well it worked for me once the hangover is a fair trade for being so immobilized one cannot do anything stupid for a little while umegat looked away for a moment the gods do not grant miracles for our purposes but for theirs if you are become their tool it is for a greater reason an urgent reason but you are the tool you are not the work expect to be valued accordingly while cazaril was still trying unsuccessfully to unravel that umegat leaned forward and poured fresh wine into cazarils cup cazaril was beyond resistance it took two undergrooms an hour or so later to guide his slithering steps across the wet cobbles of the stable yard past the gates and up the stairs where they poured his limp form into his bed cazaril wasnt sure just when he parted from his beleaguered consciousness but never had he been more glad to do so cazaril had to allow umegats wine this much meritit did mean he spent the first few hours of the next morning wishing for death rather than dreading it he knew his hangover was passing off when fear began to regain the upper hand he found oddly little regret in his heart for his own lost life hed seen more of the world than most men ever did and hed had his chances though the gods knew hed made little enough of them marshaling his thoughts as he sheltered under his covers he realized with some wonder that his greatest dismay was for the work hed be forced to leave undone fears hed had no time for during the day hed stalked dondo now crowded into his mind who would guard his ladies if he were to die now how much time was going to be granted to him to try to find some better bastion for them on whom could they be safely bestowed betriz might find protection as the wife say of a stout country lord like march dy palliar but iselle her grandmother and mother were too weak and distant teidez too young orico apparently entirely the creature of his chancellor there could be no security for iselle until she was out of this cursed court altogether another cramp riveted his attention again on the lethal little hell in his belly and he peered worriedly down under the tent of his sheet at his knotted stomach how much was this dying going to hurt he had not passed so much blood this morning he blinked around his chamber in the earlyafternoon light the odd hallucinations pale blurred blobs at the corners of his vision that he had earlier blamed on last nights wine were still present maybe they were another symptom a brisk knock sounded at his chamber door cazaril crawled from his warm refuge and walking only a little bent over went to unlock it umegat bearing a stoppered ewer bade him good afternoon stepped within and closed the door behind him he was still faintly radiant alas yesterday hadnt been a bizarre bad dream after all my word the groom added staring about in astonishment he waved his hand shoo shoo the pale blurred blobs swirled about the chamber and fled into the walls what are those things cazaril asked easing back into his bed do you see them too ghosts here drink this umegat poured from the ewer into the glazed cup from cazarils washbasin set and handed it across it will settle your stomach and clear your head about to reject it with loathing cazaril discovered it to be not wine but some sort of cold herbed tea he tasted it cautiously pleasantly bitter its astringency made a most welcome sluicing in his sticky mouth umegat pulled a stool over to his bedside and settled cheerfully cazaril squeezed his eyes shut and open again ghosts ive never seen so many of the zangres ghosts collected in one place they must be attracted to you just like the sacred animals can anyone else see them anyone with the inner eye thats three in cardegoss to my knowledge and two of them are here have they been around all this time i glimpse them now and then theyre usually more elusive you neednt be afraid of them they are powerless and cannot hurt you old lost souls in response to cazarils rather stunned stare umegat added when as happens from time to time no god takes up a sundered soul it is left to wander the world slowly losing its mindfulness of itself and fading into air new ghosts first take the form they had in life but in their despair and loneliness they cannot maintain it cazaril wrapped his arms around his belly oh his mind tried to gallop in three directions at once so what was the fate of those souls the gods did accept and just what exactly was happening to the enraged spirit so miraculously and hideously lodged in him and the dowager royina istas words came back to him the zangre is haunted you know not metaphor or madness after all it appeared but simple observation how much else then of the eerie things shed said might be not derangement but plain truthseen with altered eyes he glanced up to find umegat regarding him thoughtfully the roknari inquired politely and how are you feeling today better this afternoon than this morning he added a little reluctantly better than yesterday have you eaten not yet later perhaps he rubbed a hand over his beard whats happening out there umegat sat back and shrugged chancellor dy jironal finding no candidates in the city has ridden out of cardegoss in search of the corpse of his brothers murderer and any confederates left alive i trust he will not seize some innocent in error an experienced inquirer from the temple rides with him which should suffice to prevent such mistakes cazaril digested this after a moment umegat added also a faction in the military order of the daughters house has sent couriers riding out to all its lord dedicats calling them to a general council they mean not to allow roya orico to foist another commander like lord dondo onto them how should they defy him revolt umegat hastily waved away this treasonable suggestion certainly not petition request mm but i thought they protested last time to no avail dy jironal will not be wanting to let control of that order slip from his hands the military order is backed by the whole of its house this time and ah what have you been doing today praying for guidance and did you get an answer umegat smiled ambiguously at him perhaps cazaril considered for a moment how best to phrase his next remark interesting gossip youre privy to i take it then that it would now be redundant for me to go down to the temple and confess to archdivine mendenal for dondos murder umegats brows went up i suppose he said after a moment that it should not surprise me that the lady of spring has chosen a sharpedged tool you are a divine a trained inquirer i didnt imagine you could or would evade your oaths and disciplines you immobilized me to give yourself time to report and confer cazaril hesitated that i am not presently under arrest should tell me something about that conference but im not at all sure what umegat studied his hands spread on his knees as a divine i defer to my superiors as a saint i answer to my god alone if he trusts my judgment so perforce must i and so must my superiors he looked up and now his gaze was unsettlingly direct that the goddess has set your feet on some journey on her behalfcourieris abundantly plain from her hourbyhour preservation of your life the temple is at not your service but hers i think i can promise you none shall interfere with you cazaril was stung into a wail but what am i supposed to be doing umegats voice grew almost apologetic speaking just from my own experience i would surmiseyour daily duties as they come to you thats not very helpful yes i know umegats lips twitched in a dry humor so the gods humble the wouldbe wise i think he added after a moment speaking of daily duties i must return now to mine orico is unwell today feel free to visit the menagerie anytime you are so moved my lord dy cazaril wait cazaril held out a hand as umegat rose can you tell medoes orico know of the miracle of the menagerie does he understanddoes he even know he is accursed ill swear iselle knows naught of it nor teidez royina ista on the other hand or does the roya just know he feels better for contact with his animals umegat gave a little nod orico knows his father ias told him on his deathbed the temple has made many secret trials to break this curse the menagerie is the only one that has seemed to do any good and what of the dowager royina ista is she shadowed like sara umegat tugged his queue and frowned thoughtfully i could better guess if id ever met her facetoface the dy baocia family removed her from cardegoss shortly before i was brought here does chancellor dy jironal know the frown deepened if he does it was not from my lips i have often cautioned orico not to discuss his miracle but if orico has kept something from dy jironal it would be a first umegat shrugged acknowledgment but added given the early disasters in his reign orico believes that any action he dares take will redound to the detriment of chalion the chancellor is the tongs by which the roya attempts to handle all matters of state without spilling his bane thereupon some might wonder if dy jironal is the answer to the curse or part of it the proxy seemed to work at first and lately latelyweve redoubled our petitions to the gods for aid and how have the gods answered it would seemby sending you cazaril sat up in renewed terror clutching his bedclothes no one sent me i came by chance id like an accounting of those chances someday soon when you will my lord umegat with a deeply hopeful gaze that frightened cazaril quite as much as any of his saintly remarks bowed himself out after a few more hours spent cowering under his quilts cazaril decided that unless a man could dither himself to death he wasnt going to die this afternoon or if he was there was nothing he could do about it and his stomach was growling in a decidedly unsupernatural fashion as the chill autumn light faded he crept out of bed stretched his aching muscles dressed himself and went down to dinner the zangre was extremely subdued with the court plunged into deep mourning no fêtes or music were offered tonight cazaril found the banqueting hall thin of company neither iselles household nor teidezs were present royina sara absented herself and roya orico his dark shadow clinging about him ate hastily and departed immediately thereafter the reason for teidezs absence cazaril soon learned was that chancellor dy jironal had taken the royse with him when he rode out on his mission of investigation cazaril blinked and fell silent at this news surely dy jironal could not be attempting to continue the seduction by corruption his brother had taken so well in hand downright austere by comparison to dondo he had not the taste or style for such puerile pleasures it was impossible to imagine him roistering with a juvenile was it too much to hope he might be reversing his strategy for ascendancy over teidezs mind taking the boy up after a true fatherly manner apprenticing him to statecraft the young royse was halfsick with idleness as well as dissolution almost any exposure to mens work must be medicine for him more probably cazaril thought wearily the chancellor simply dared not let his future handle upon chalion out of his grip for an instant lord dy rinal seated across from cazaril twisted his lips at the halfempty hall and remarked everyones deserting off to their country estates if they have em before the snow flies its going to be a gloomy fathers day celebration i warrant only the tailors and seamstresses are busy furbishing up mourning garb cazaril reached through the ghostsmudge that was hovering next to his plate and washed down the last bite of his repast with a gulp of wellwatered wine four or five of the revenants had trailed after him to the hall and now clustered about him like cold children crowding a hearth he had chosen somber clothing himself tonight automatically he wondered if he should trouble himself to obtain the full correct lavenders and blacks such as dy rinal always fashionable now sported would the abomination locked in his belly take it as hypocrisy or as a gesture of respect would it even know newriven from its body how much of its repulsive nature did dondos soul now retain these weathered old spirits seemed to watch him from the outside was dondo watching him from the inside he grinned briefly as an alternative to startling poor dy rinal with a fit of screaming he managed a politely inquiring do you stay or go i go i think ill ride down with marchess dy heron as far as heron itself and then cut over the lower passes to home the old lady might be glad enough of another sword in her party that shed even invite me to stay he took a swallow of wine and lowered his voice if not even the bastard would take lord dondo off our hands you realize he must still be about somewhere one trusts hell just haunt jironals palace where he died but really he could be anywhere in cardegoss and he was vicious enough before he was murdered hes bound to be vengeful now slain the night before his wedding gods cazaril made a neutral noise the chancellor seems set on calling it death magic but i shouldnt wonder if it was poison after all no way of telling now the bodys burned i suppose convenient for somebody that but he was surrounded by his friends surely no one could have administeredwere you there dy rinal grimaced after lady pig no thanks be to all her squeals i was not present at that butchering dy rinal glanced around as if afraid a ghost with a grudge might be sneaking up on him even now that there were half a dozen within his arms reach was evidently not apparent to him cazaril brushed one away from his face trying not to let his eyes focus on what to his companion must seem empty air ser dy maroc the royas wardrobemaster strolled up to their table saying dy rinal have you heard the news from ibra belatedly he observed cazaril leaning with elbows on the board opposite and hesitated flushing slightly cazaril smiled sourly one trusts youre getting your gossip from ibra from more reliable sources these days maroc dy maroc stiffened if the chancellerys own courier be one yes he came in pellmell while my head tailor was refitting oricos mourning garb that he had to let out by four fingerbreadthsanyway its official the heir of ibra died last week all suddenly of the coughing fever in south ibra his faction has collapsed and rushes to make treaty with the old fox or save their lives by sacrificing each other the war in south ibra is ended well dy rinal sat up and stroked his beard do we call that good news or bad good for poor ibra the gods know but our orico has chosen the losing side again dy maroc nodded the fox is rumored to be most wroth with chalion for stirring the pot and keeping it boiling not that the heir needed help putting wood on that fire perhaps the old royas taste for strife shall be buried with his firstborn said cazaril not too hopefully so the fox has a new heir that child of his agewhat was the boys name said dy rinal royse bergon cazaril supplied aye said dy maroc a young one indeed and the fox could drop at any moment leaving an untried boy on the throne not so untried as all that said cazaril hes seen the prosecution of one siege and the breaking of another riding in his late mothers train and survived a civil war and one would think a son of the fox could not be stupid the first one was said dy rinal unassailably to leave his supporters in such naked disarray one cannot blame death of the coughing fever on a lack of wit said cazaril assuming it really was the coughing fever said dy rinal pursing his lips in new suspicion what dyou think the fox would poison his own son said dy maroc his agents man well then he might have done it sooner and saved ibra a world of woe cazaril smiled thinly and pushed up from the table leaving dy rinal and dy maroc to their talespinning his winesickness was past and he felt better for his dinner but the shaky exhaustion that remained was not anything he was accustomed to calling well in the absence of any summons from the royesse he made his way back to his bed wearied beyond fear he fell asleep soon enough but around midnight he was brought awake with a gasp a mans screams echoed distantly in his head screams and broken weeping and choked howls of ragehe bolted upright heart pounding turning his head to locate the sound faint and strangemight it be coming from across the ravine from the zangre or down by the river below his window no one from the castle seemed to respond no footsteps or cries of inquiry from the guards in another few moments cazaril realized he was not hearing the tormented howls with his ears any more than he saw the pale smudges floating around his bed with his eyes and he recognized the voice he lay back down panting and curled around himself and endured the uproar for another ten minutes was the damned soul of dondo preparing to break free of the ladys miracle and haul him off to hell he was about to leave his bed and run to the menagerie all in his nightdress pound on the doors and wake up umegat and beg the saint for helpcould umegat do anything about thiswhen the cries faded again it was about the hour of dondos death he realized perhaps the spirit took up some special powers at this time he couldnt tell if it had or had not done so last night hed been so sodden drunk one uneasy nightmare had blended in mad fragments with all the others it might have been worse he told himself as his heart gradually slowed again dondo might have been given an articulate voice the thought of dondos ghost made nightly free to speak to him whether in rage or abuse or vile suggestion broke his courage as the plain howls had not and he wept for a little in the sheer terror of the imagining trust the lady trust the lady he whispered some incoherent prayers and slowly regained control of himself if she had brought him this far for some purpose surely she would not abandon him now a new horrible thought occurred to him as he told umegats sermon over in his mind if the goddess only entered the world by cazaril renouncing his will on her behalf could wanting desperately to live an act of will if ever there was one be enough to exclude her and her miracle her protective encapsulation might pop like a soap bubble releasing a paradox of death and damnation following this logic loop around and around was enough to keep him awake for hours as the night slowly wore itself out the square of his chambers window was growing faintly gray before he dropped again into blessed unconsciousness so it was that flanked by his ghostly outriders he climbed the stairs late the following morning to his office antechamber he felt stupid and eroded from lack of sleep and he looked forward without enthusiasm to a weeks worth of neglected correspondence and bookkeeping dropped in disordered piles on his desk from the hour of iselles disastrous betrothal he found his ladies up betimes in the sitting room just past the frontier of his office all his good new schoolroom maps were spread out on a table iselle leaned on her hands staring down at them betriz her arms folded under her breasts stood watching over her shoulder and frowning both young women and nan dy vrit who sat sewing wore the blacks and lavenders of strict formal court mourning a prudent dissimulation of which cazaril approved as he entered he saw next to iselles hand a scattering of paper scraps with scribbled lists some items scratched through some circled or ticked with checks iselle scowled and pointed to a spot on the map marked with a sturdy hat pin and said over her shoulder to her handmaiden but thats no better than she broke off when she saw cazaril the dark invisible cloak still clung about her only an occasional faint thread of blue light still glinted in its sluggish folds the ghostblobs veered violently away from it and only partly to cazarils relief vanished from his second sight are you all right lord caz iselle inquired looking at him with her brows drawing down you dont look well cazaril bowed greeting my apologies for absenting myself yesterday royesse i was taken with a a colic it has mostly passed off now nan dy vrit from her seat in the corner looked up from her sewing with an unfriendly stare to remark the chamber woman had it that you were taken with a bad head from drinking and carousing with the stable grooms she said she saw you come in so drunk after lord dondos funeral you could barely stagger conscious of betrizs unhappy scrutiny he said apologetically drinking yes carousing no it wont happen again milady he added a little dryly it didnt answer anyway its a scandal to the royesse that her secretary be seen so inebriated that he hush nan iselle interrupted this lecture impatiently leave be whats this royesse cazaril gestured at the pinstudded map iselle drew a long breath ive thought it through ive been thinking for days as long as i remain unwed plots will swirl about me i dont doubt dy jironal will produce some other candidate to try to bind me and teidez to his clan and other factionsnow its revealed that orico would willingly bestow me on a lesser lord every lesser lord in chalion will begin badgering him for my hand my only defense my only certain refuge is if i am married already and not to a lesser lord cazarils brows rose i confess royesse my own thoughts have been running something along those lines and swiftly swiftly cazaril before they can come up with someone even more disgusting than dondo her voice was edged with stress even our dear chancellor must find that a daunting challenge he murmured diffidently and had the satisfaction of drawing a brief bark of laughter from her he pursed his lips the need is great i grant you but the danger is not so instantly pressing as all that dy jironal himself will block the lesser lords for you i am sure your first line of defense must be to block dy jironals next candidate although thinking over his family its not clear to me who he can offer up his sons are both married or he might have put forth one of them in place of dondo or offered himself were he not wed wives die said betriz darkly sometimes they even die conveniently cazaril shook his head dy jironal has planned his family alliances with care his daughtersinlawhis wife tooare his links to some of the greatest families in chalion the daughters and sisters of powerful provincars i dont say he wouldnt seize a vacancy but he dare not be seen or even suspected of creating one and his grandsons are toddlers no dy jironal must play a waiting game what about his nephews said betriz cazaril after a pause for thought shook his head again too loose a connection not controlled enough he desires a subordinate not a rival i decline said iselle through her teeth to wait a decade to be wed to a boy fifteen years younger than i am cazaril glanced involuntarily at lady betriz he himself was fifteen years older thanhe thrust the discouraging thought from his mind the evil barrier between them now was less surmountable than merely that of youth versus age life does not wed death weve placed a pin in the map for every unwed ruler or heir we can think of between here and darthaca said betriz cazaril advanced and looked over the map what even the roknari princedoms i wanted to be complete said iselle without them well there werent very many choices i admit i dont much like the idea of a roknari prince leaving aside their horrid squaredoff religion their custom of choosing as heir any son at all whether of true wife or concubine makes it nearly impossible to tell if one is wedding a future ruler or a future drone or a future corpse said cazaril half the victories chalion ever gained over the roknari were the result of some embittered failed candidate stabbing his princely half brother in the back but that leaves only four true quintarians of rank put in betriz the roya of brajar bergon of ibra and the twin sons of the high march of yiss just across the darthacan border who are twelve years old not impossible said iselle judiciously but march dy yiss would have no natural reason to ally with teidez later against the roknari he shares no borders with the princedoms and does not suffer from their depredations and he pays fealty to darthaca who has no interest in seeing a strong united alliance of ibran states arise to put an end to the perpetual war in the north cazaril was pleased to hear his own analysis coming back to him in the royesses mouth shed paid more attention during her geography lessons than hed thought he smiled encouragingly and besides iselle added crossly yiss has no coastline either her hand drifted unhappily across the map to the east my cousin the roya of brajar is quite old and they say is grown too sodden with drink to ride to war and his grandson is too young brajar does have good ports said betriz she added more dubiously although in the tone of one pointing out an advantage i suppose he wouldnt live very long yes but what help could i be to teidez as a mere dowager royina its not as though i might tell a a stepgrandson how to deploy his troops iselles hand trailed back to the opposite coast and the fox of ibras eldest son is married and his younger not the heir and the country is convulsed with civil strife not anymore said cazaril abruptly did no one tell you the news that came yesterday from ibra the heir is dead struck down in south ibrathe coughing fever no one doubts that young royse bergon will take his place hes been loyal to his father throughout the whole mess iselle turned her head and stared at him her eyes widening really how old is bergon again fifteen was he not he must be rising sixteen now royesse better than fiftyseven her fingers walked lightly up the coast of ibra along the string of maritime cities to the great port of zagosur where they stopped resting upon a certain pin with a carved motherofpearl head what do you know of royse bergon cazaril is he wellfavored did you ever see him when you were in ibra not with my own eyes they say hes a handsome boy iselle shrugged impatiently all royses are always described as handsome unless theyre absolutely grotesque then its said they have character i believe bergon to be reasonably athletic which argues for at least a pleasantly healthy appearance they say he has been trained at seamanship cazaril saw the glow of youthful enthusiasm starting in her eyes and felt constrained to add but your brother orico has been at this half war with the roya of ibra for the past seven years the fox has no love for chalion iselle pressed her hands together but what better way to end a war than with a marriage treaty chancellor dy jironal is bound to oppose it quite aside from wanting you for his own family connection he wants teidez to have no ally now or in the future stronger than himself by that reasoning he must oppose any good match i can suggest iselle leaned over the map again her hand sweeping in a long arc encompassing chalion and ibra bothtwothirds of the lands between the seas but if i could bring teidez and bergon together her palm pressed flat and slowly slid along the north coast across the five roknari princedoms pins popped from the paper and scattered yes she breathed her eyes narrowed and her jaw tightened when she again looked up at cazaril her eyes were blazing i shall put it to my brother orico at once before dy jironal returns if i can get his word on it publicly declared surely even dy jironal cannot make him take it back think it through first royesse think of all the issues one drawback is surely the ghastly fatherinlaw cazarils brow wrinkled though i suppose time will remove him and if anyone is capable of overcoming his emotions in favor of policy its the old fox she turned from the table to pace hastily back and forth across the chamber heavy skirts swishing her dark aura clung about her royina sara shared the vilest dregs of oricos curse she must presumably have entered into it upon her marriage to the roya if iselle married out of chalion would she shed her curse reciprocally leaving it behind was this a way for her to escape the geas his rising excitement was cut by caution or would the golden generals old dark destiny follow her across the borders to her new country he must consult with umegat and soon iselle stopped and stared out the window embrasure where she had sat to endure dondos hideous wooing her eyes narrowed at last she said decisively i must try i cannot will not leave my fate to drift downstream to another disastrous falls and make no push to steer it i will petition my royal brother and at once she wheeled for the door and beckoned sharply like a general urging on his troops betriz cazaril attend upon me after some time casting about the zangre they ran orico to earth to cazarils surprise in royina saras chambers on the top floor of iass tower the roya and royina were seated at a small table by a window playing at blocksanddodges together the simple game with its carved board and colored marbles seemed a pastime for children or convalescents not for the greatest lord and lady in the land not that orico could be mistaken for a well man by any experienced eye the royal couples eerie shadows seemed merely a redundant underscore to their weary sadness they played not for idleness cazaril realized but for distraction diversion from the fear and woe that hedged them all around cazaril was taken aback by saras garb instead of the blackandlavender court mourning that orico wore she was dressed all in white the festival garb of the bastards day that intercalary holiday inserted every two years after mothers midsummer to prevent the calendars precessing from its proper seasons the bleached linens were far too light for this weather and she huddled into a large puffy white wool shawl to combat the chill she looked dark and thin and sallow in the pale wrappings withal it was an even more edged insult than the colorful gowns and robes shed hastily donned for dondos funeral cazaril wondered if she meant to wear the bastards whites for the whole period of mourning and if dy jironal would dare protest iselle curtseyed to her royal brother and sisterinlaw and stood before orico with eyes bright hands clasped before her in an attitude of demure femininity belied by the steel in her spine cazaril and lady betriz flanking her also made their courtesies orico turning from the game table acknowledged his sisters greeting he adjusted his paunch in his lap and eyed her uneasily on closer view cazaril could see where his tailor had added a matched panel of lavender brocade beneath the arms to enlarge his tunics girth and the slight discoloration where the sleeve seams had been picked out and resewn royina sara gathered her shawl and withdrew a little into the window seat with the barest preamble iselle launched into her plea for the roya to open formal negotiations with ibra for the hand of the royse bergon she emphasized the opportunity to make a bid for peace thus repairing the breach created by oricos illfated support of the late heir for surely neither chalion nor exhausted ibra were prepared to continue the conflict now she pointed out how appropriate a match in age and rank bergon was for her own years and station and the advantage to oricoshe diplomatically did not add and then teidezin future years to have a relative and ally in ibras court she painted a vivid wordpicture of the harassment from lesser lords of chalion vying for her hand that orico might neatly sidestep by this ploy a bit of eloquence that caused the roya to vent a wistful sigh nonetheless orico began his expected equivocation by seizing on this last point but iselle your mourning protects you for a time not even martoui mean martou wont insult the memory of his brother by marrying off dondos bereaved fiancée over his hot ashes iselle snorted at the bereaved dondos ashes will chill soon enough and what then orico you will never again force me to a husband without my assentmy prior assent obtained beforehand i wont let you no no orico agreed hastily waving his hands that that was a mistake i see it now im sorry now theres an understatement i did not mean to insult you dear sister or or the gods orico glanced around a little vaguely as though afraid an offended god might pounce upon him out of some astral ambuscade at any moment i meant well for you and for chalion belatedly it dawned upon cazaril that while no one at court but himself and umegat knew just whose prayers had hurried dondo well not out of the world but out of his lifeall knew that the royesse had been praying for rescue none cazaril thought suspected or accused her of working death magicof course neither did they suspect or accuse himnevertheless iselle was here and dondo was gone every thinking courtier must be unnerved by dondos mysterious death and some more than a little no marriage shall be offered to you in future without your prior accordance said orico with uncharacteristic firmness that i promise you upon my own head and crown it was a solemn oath cazarils brows rose orico meant it apparently iselle pursed her lips then accepted this with a slight wary nod a faint dry breath puffed through feminine nostrilscazarils eyes went to royina sara her face was shadowed by the window embrasure but her mouth twisted briefly in some small irony at her husbands words cazaril considered what solemn promises orico had broken to her and looked away discomfited by the same token orico skipped to his next evasion like a man crossing steppingstones on a steam our mourning makes it too soon to offer you to ibra the fox may construe an insult in this haste iselle made a gesture of impatience but if we wait bergon is likely to be snatched up the royse is now the heir hes of marriageable age and his father wants safety on his borders the fox is bound to barter him for an allya daughter of the high march of yiss perhaps or a rich darthacan noblewoman and chalion will have lost its chance its too soon too soon i dont disagree that your arguments are good and may have their day indeed the fox made diplomatic inquiries for your hand some years ago i forget for which son but all was broken off when the troubles in south ibra erupted nothing is fixed why my poor brajaran mother was betrothed five different times before she was finally wed to roya ias take patience calm yourself and await a more seemly time i think now is an excellent time i want to see you make a decision announce it and stand by itbefore chancellor dy jironal returns ah um yes and thats another thing i cannot possibly take a step of this grave nature without consultation with my chief noble and the other lords in council orico nodded to himself you didnt consult the other lords the last time i think youre most strangely afraid to do anything dy jironal doesnt approve who is roya in cardegoss anyway orico dy chalion or martou dy jironal iii will think on your words dear sister orico made craven little wavingaway motions with his fat hands iselle after a moment spent staring at him with a burning intensity that made him writhe accepted this with a small provisional nod yes do think on my petition my lord ill ask you again tomorrow with this promiseor threatshe made courtesy again to orico and sara and withdrew betriz and cazaril trailing tomorrow and every day thereafter cazaril inquired in an undervoice as she sailed down the corridor in a savage rustling of skirts every day till orico yields she replied through set teeth plan on it cazaril wintry yellow light slanted through gray clouds later that afternoon as cazaril made his way out of the zangre to the stable block he pulled his fine embroidered wool coat around him and drew in his neck like a turtle against the damp cold wind when he opened his mouth and exhaled he could make his breath mist in a little cloud before him he blew a few puffs at the ghosts that pale almost to invisibility in the sunlight bobbed perpetually after him a damp frost rimed the cobbles beneath his feet he pushed the menageries heavy door aside just enough to nip within and pulled it shut again immediately thereafter he stood a moment letting his eyes adjust to the darker interior and sneezed from the sweet dust of the hay the thumbless groom set down a pail hurried up to him bowed and made welcoming noises i have come to see umegat cazaril told him the little old man bowed again and beckoned him onward he led cazaril down the aisle the beautiful animals all lurched to the front of their stalls to snort at him and the sand foxes jumped up and yipped excitedly as he passed a stonewalled chamber at the far end proved to be a tack room converted to a work and leisure room for the menageries servants a small fire burned cheerfully in a fieldstone fireplace taking the chill off the faint pleasant scent of woodsmoke combined with that of leather metal polish and soaps the woolstuffed cushions on the chairs to which the groom gestured him were faded and worn and the old worktable was stained and scarred but the room was swept and the glazed windows one on either side of the fireplace had the little round panes set in their leads polished clean the groom made noises and shuffled out again in a few minutes umegat entered wiping his hands dry on a cloth and straightening his tabard welcome my lord he said softly cazaril felt suddenly uncertain of his etiquette whether to stand as for a superior or sit as for a servant there was no court roknari grammatical mode for secretary to saint he sat up and half bowed from the waist awkwardly by way of compromise umegat umegat closed the door assuring privacy cazaril leaned forward clasping his hands upon the tabletop and spoke with the urgency of patient to physician you see the ghosts of the zangre do you ever hear them not normally have you umegat pulled out a chair and seated himself at right angles to cazaril not these he batted away the most persistent one which had followed him inside umegat pursed his lips and flipped his cloth at it and it flitted off dondos cazaril described last nights internal uproar i thought he was trying to break out can he succeed if the goddesss grip fails i am certain no ghost can overpower a god said umegat thats not quite an answer cazaril brooded perhaps dondo and the demon meant to kill him from sheer exhaustion can you at least suggest a way to shut him up putting my head under the pillow was no help at all there is a kind of symmetry to it observed umegat slowly outer ghosts that you may see but not hear inner ghosts that you may hear but not see if the bastard has a hand in it it may have something to do with maintaining balance in any case i am sure your preservation was no accident and would not be accidentally withdrawn cazaril absorbed this for a moment daily duties eh todays had brought some curious turns he spoke now as comrade to comrade umegat listen ive had an idea we know the curse has followed the house of chalions male line fonsa to ias to orico yet royina sara wears nearly as dark a shadow as orico does and she is no spawn of fonsas loins she must have married into the curse yes the fine lines of umegats face deepened with his frown sara already bore the shadow when i first came years ago but i suppose yes it must have been so ista likewise presumably presumably socould iselle marry out of the curse shed it with her marriage vows when she leaves her family of birth behind and enters into the family of her husband or would the curse follow her to taint them both umegats brows went up i dont know but you dont know that its impossible i was thinking that it might be a way to salvage something umegat sat back possibly i dont know it was never a ploy to consider for orico i need to know umegat royesse iselle is pushing orico to open negotiations for her marriage out of chalion chancellor dy jironal will surely not allow that i would not underestimate her powers of persuasion she is not another sara neither was sara once but you are right oh my poor orico to be pressed between two such grinding stones cazaril bit his lip and paused a long time before venturing his next query umegat youve been observing this court for many years was dy jironal always so poisonous a peculator or has the curse slowly been corrupting him too did the curse draw such a man to his position of power or would any man trying to serve the house of chalion become so corroded in time you ask very interesting questions lord cazaril umegats graying brows drew down in thought i wish i had better answers martou dy jironal was always forcible intelligent able we shall leave aside consideration of his younger brother who made his reputation as a strong arm in the field not a strong head in the court when he first took up the post of chancellor i would have judged the elder dy jironal no more susceptible to the temptations of pride and greed than any other high lord of chalion with a clan to provide for faint enough praise that and yet yet i think umegat seemed to continue cazarils very thought his eyes rising to meet his guests the curse has done him no good either so getting rid of dy jironal is not the solution to oricos woes another such man perhaps worse would simply rise in his place umegat opened his hands the curse takes a hundred forms twisting each good thing that should be oricos according to the weaknesses of its nature a wife grown barren instead of fertile a chief advisor corrupt instead of loyal friends fickle instead of true food that sickens instead of strengthening and on and on a secretarytutor grown cowardly and foolish instead of brave and wise or maybe just fey and mad if any man who came within the curses ambit was vulnerable was he destined to become iselles plague as dy jironal was oricos and teidez and isellemust all her choices fall out as ill as oricos or does he bear a special burden being the roya i think the curse has grown worse for orico over time the roknaris gray eyes narrowed you have asked me a dozen questions lord cazaril allow me to ask you one how came you into the service of royesse iselle cazaril opened his mouth and sat back his mind jumping first to the day the provincara had ambushed him with her offer of employment but no before that came and before that came he found himself instead telling umegat of the day a soldier of the daughter astride a nervy horse had dropped a gold coin in the mud and how he had arrived in valenda umegat brewed tea at the little fire and pushed a steaming mug in front of cazaril who paused only to lubricate his drying throat cazaril described how iselle had discomfited the crooked judge on the daughters day and at length how they had all come to cardegoss umegat pulled on his queue do you think your steps were fated from that far back disturbing but the gods are parsimonious and take their chances where they can find them if the gods are making this path for me then where is my free will no it cannot be ah umegat brightened at this thorny theological point i have had another thought on such fates that denies neither gods nor men perhaps instead of controlling every step the gods have started a hundred or a thousand cazarils and umegats down this road and only those arrive who choose to but am i the first to arrive or the last well said umegat dryly i can promise you youre not the first cazaril grunted understanding after a little time spent digesting this he said suddenly but if the gods have given you to orico and me to isellethough i think someone has made a holy mistakewho is given for the protection of teidez shouldnt there be three of us a man of the brother surely though whether tool or saint or fool i know notor have all the boys hundred destined protectors fallen by the roadside one by one maybe the man is just not here yet a new thought robbed cazaril of breath maybe it was supposed to have been dy sanda he leaned forward burying his face in his hands if i stay here talking theology with you much longer i swear ill end up drinking myself blind again just to make my brain stop spinning round and round inside my skull addiction to drink is actually a fairly common hazard among divines said umegat i begin to see why cazaril tilted back his head to catch the last trickle of tea grown cold in his cup and set it down umegat if i must ask of every action not only if it is wise or good but also if its the one im supposed to choose i shall go mad madder ill end up curled in a corner not doing anything at all except maybe mumbling and weeping umegat chuckledcruelly cazaril thoughtbut then shook his head you cannot outguess the gods hold to virtueif you can identify itand trust that the duty set before you is the duty desired of you and that the talents given to you are the talents you should place in the gods service believe that the gods ask for nothing back that they have not first lent to you not even your life cazaril rubbed his face and inhaled then i shall bend all my efforts to promoting this marriage of iselles to break the hold of the curse upon her i must trust my reason or why else did the goddess choose a reasonable man for iselles guardian though he added under his breath at least i used to be a reasonable man he nodded far more firmly than he felt and pushed back his chair pray for me umegat every hour my lord it was growing dark when lady betriz brought a taper into cazarils office and drifted about for a moment lighting his reading candles in their glass vases he smiled and nodded thanks she smiled back and blew out her taper but then paused not yet returning to the womens chambers she stood cazaril observed in the same spot where they had parted the night of dondos death things seem to be settling down a little now thank the gods she remarked yes a little cazaril laid down his quill i begin to believe all will be well yes his stomach cramped no a long pause he picked up his quill again and dipped it although he had nothing more to write cazaril must you believe you are about to die in order to bring yourself to kiss a lady she demanded abruptly he ducked his head flushing and cleared his throat my deepest apologies lady betriz it wont happen again he dared not look up lest she try anew to break through his fragile barriers lest she succeed oh betriz do not sacrifice your dignity to my futility her voice grew stiff im very sorry to hear that castillar he kept his eyes on his ledger as her footsteps retreated several days passed as iselle continued her campaign upon orico several nights passed made ghastly for cazaril by the howls of dondos soul in its private torment this intestinal visitation did indeed prove to be nightly a quarter of an hour reprising the terror of that death cazaril could not fall to sleep before the midnight interlude in sick apprehension nor for long after it in shaken resonance and his face grew gray with fatigue the blurry old phantasms began to seem pleasant pets by comparison there was no way he could drink enough wine nightly to sleep through it so he set himself to endure orico endured his sisters visitations with less fortitude he took to avoiding her in increasingly bizarre ways but she broke in upon him anyway in chamber kitchen and once to nan dy vrits scandal his steam bath the day he rode out to his hunting lodge in the oak woods at dawn iselle followed promptly after breakfast cazaril was relieved to note that his own spectral retinue fell behind as they rode out of the zangre as though bound to their place of death it was clear that the fast gallop was an inexpressible joy to iselle as she shook out the knots and strains of her trammeled existence in the castle a day in the saddle in the crisp earlywinter air going and returning from an otherwise futile interview brightened her eye and put color in her cheeks lady betriz was no less invigorated the four baocian guards told off to ride with them kept up but only just laboring along with their horses cazaril concealed agony he passed blood again that evening which hed not done for some days and dondos nightly serenade proved especially shattering because for the first time cazarils inward ear could make out words in the cries they werent words that made any sense but they were distinguishable would more follow dreading another such ride cazaril wearily climbed the stairs to iselles chambers late the next morning he had just eased himself stiffly into his chair at his desk and taken up his account book when royina sara appeared accompanied by two of her ladies she wafted past cazaril in a cloud of white wool he scrambled to his feet in surprise and bowed deeply she acknowledged his existence with a faint faraway nod a flurry of feminine voices in the forbidden chambers beyond announced her visit to her sisterinlaw both the royinas ladiesinwaiting and nan dy vrit were exiled to the sitting room where they sat sewing and quietly gossiping after about half an hour royina sara came out again and crossed through cazarils office antechamber with the same unsmiling abstraction betriz followed shortly the royesse bids you attend upon her in her sitting chamber she told cazaril her black eyebrows were crimped tight with worry cazaril rose at once and followed her inside iselle sat in a carved chair her hands clenched upon its arms pale and breathing heavily infamous my brother is infamous cazaril she told him as he made his bow and pulled a stool up to her knee my lady he inquired and let himself down as carefully as he could last nights belly cramp still lingered and stabbed him if he moved too quickly no marriage without my consent aye he spoke that truly enoughbut none without dy jironals consent either sara has whispered it to me after his brothers death but before he rode out of cardegoss to seek the murderer the chancellor closeted himself with my brother and persuaded him to make a codicil to his will in the event of oricos death the chancellor is made regent for my brother teidez i believe that arrangement has been known for quite some time royesse there is a regency council set up to advise him as well the provincars of chalion would not let that much power pass to one of their number without a check yes yes i knew that but the codicil does not attempt to abolish the council does it asked cazaril in alarm that would set the lords in an uproar no that part is left all as it was but formerly i was to be the ward of my grandmother and my uncle the provincar of baocia now i am to be transferred to dy jironals own wardship there is no council to check that and listen cazaril the term of his guardianship is set to be until i marry and permission for my marriage is left entirely in his hands he can keep me unwed till i die of old age if he chooses cazaril concealed his unease and held up a soothing hand surely not he must die of old age long before you and well before that when teidez comes to his mans estate and the full powers of the royacy he can free you with a royal decree teidezs majority is set at twentyfive years cazaril a decade ago cazaril would have shared her outrage at this lengthy term now it sounded more like a good idea but not granted with dy jironal in the saddle instead i would be almost twentyeight years old twelve more years for the curse to work upon her and within her no it was not good by any measure he could dismiss you from my household instantly you have another patroness who has not chosen to dismiss me yet i grant you have cause for concern royesse but dont borrow trouble before its time none of this matters while orico lives he is not well sara says he is not very fit cazaril agreed cautiously but hes not by any means an old man hes barely more than forty by the expression on iselles face she found that quite aged enough he is more notwell than he appears sara says cazaril hesitated is she that intimate with him to know this i had thought them estranged i dont understand them iselle knuckled her eyes oh cazaril it was true what dondo told me i thought later that it might have been just a horrid lie to frighten me sara was so desperate for a child she agreed to let dy jironal try when orico could not anymore martou was not so bad she said he was at least courteous it was only when he could not get her with child either that his brother cajoled him to let him into the venture dondo was dreadful and took pleasure in her humiliation but cazaril orico knew he helped persuade sara to this outrage i dont understand because orico surely does not hate teidez so much hed wish to set dy jironals bastard in his place no and yes a son of dy jironal and sara would not be a descendant of fonsa the fairlywise orico must have reasoned that such a child might grow up to free the royacy of chalion from the golden generals death curse a desperate measure but possibly an effective one royina sara iselle added her mouth crooking says if dy jironal finds dondos murderer she plans to pay for his funeral pension his family and have perpetual prayers sung for him in the temple of cardegoss thats good to know said cazaril faintly although he had no family to pension he hunched over a little and smiled to hide a grimace of pain so not even sara who had filled iselles maiden ears with details of shocking intimacy had told her of the curse and he was certain now that sara too knew of it orico sara dy jironal umegat probably ista possibly even the provincara and not one had chosen to burden these children with knowledge of the dark cloud that hung over them who was he to betray that implicit conspiracy of silence no one told me either do i thank them now for their consideration when then did teidezs and iselles protectors plan to let them know of the geas that wrapped them round did orico expect to tell them on his deathbed as hed been told by his father ias had cazaril the right to tell iselle secrets that her natural guardians chose to conceal was he prepared to explain to her just how he had found it all out he glanced at lady betriz seated now on another stool and anxiously watching her distressed royal mistress even betriz who knew quite well that he had attempted death magic did not know that he had succeeded i dont know what to try next moaned iselle orico is useless could iselle escape this curse without ever having to know of it he took a deep breath for what he was about to say skirted treason you could take steps to arrange your marriage yourself betriz stirred and sat up her eyes widening at him what in secret said iselle from my royal brother certainly in secret from his chancellor is that legal cazaril blew out his breath a marriage contracted and consummated cannot readily be set aside even by a roya if a sufficiently large camp of chalionese were persuaded to support you in itand a considerable faction of opposition to dy jironal exists readymadesetting it aside would be rendered still harder and if she were got out of chalion and placed under the protection of say as shrewd a fatherinlaw as the fox of ibra she might leave curse and faction both behind altogether arranging the matter so that she didnt simply trade being a powerless hostage in one court for being a powerless hostage in another was the hard part but at least an uncursed hostage eh ah iselles eyes lit with approval cazaril can it be done there are practical difficulties he admitted all of which have practical solutions the most critical is to discover a man you can trust to be your ambassador he must have the wit to gain you the strongest possible position in negotiation with ibra the suppleness to avoid offending chalion nerve to pass in disguise across uneasy borders strength for travel loyalty to you and you alone and courage in your cause that must not break a mistake in this selection would be fatal possibly literally she pressed her hands together and frowned can you find me such a man i will bend my thoughts to it and look about me do so lord cazaril she breathed do so lady betriz said in an oddly dry voice surely you need not look far it cannot be me with a swallow he converted i could fall dead at your feet at any moment to i dare not leave you here without protection we shall all think on it said iselle firmly the fathers day festivities passed quietly chill rain dampened the celebrations in cardegoss and kept many from the zangre from attending the municipal procession though orico went as a royal duty and as a result contracted a head cold he turned this to account by taking to his bed and avoiding everyone thereby the zangres denizens still in black and lavender for lord dondo kept a sober fathers feast with sacred music but no dancing the icy rain continued through the week cazaril one sodden afternoon was combining practical application with tutorial by teaching betriz and iselle how to keep accounts when a crisp rap on the chamber door overrode a pages diffident voice announcing the march dy palliar begs to see my lord dy cazaril palli cazaril turned in his chair and levered himself to his feet with a hand on the table bright delight flooded both his ladies faces with sudden energy driving out the ennui i wasnt expecting you in cardegoss so soon nor was i palli bowed to the women and favored cazaril with a twisted grin he dropped a coin in the pages hand and jerked his head the boy bent double in a gradation that indicated deep approval of the amount of the largesse and scampered off palli continued i took only two officers and rode hard my troop from palliar follows at a pace that will not destroy horses he glanced around the chamber and shrugged his broad shoulders goddess forfend i didnt think i was speaking prophecy last time i was here gives me a worse chill than this miserable rain he cast off a waterspotted woolen cloak revealing the blueandwhite garb of an officer of the daughters order and ran a rueful hand through the bright drops beading in his dark hair he clasped hands with cazaril and added bastards demons caz you look terrible cazaril could not alas respond to this with a very well put he instead turned off the remark with a mumble of its the weather i suppose it makes everyone dull and drab palli stood back and stared him up and down weather when last i saw you your skin was not the color of moldy dough you didnt have black rings around your eyes like a striped rockrat and and you looked pretty fit notpale pinched and potbellied cazaril straightened up indignantly sucking in his aching gut as palli jerked a thumb at him and added royesse you should get your secretary to a physician iselle stared at cazaril in sudden doubt her hand going to her mouth as if really looking him for the first time in weeks which he supposed she was her attentions had been thoroughly absorbed by her own troubles through these late disasters betriz looked from one of them to the other and set her teeth on her lower lip i dont need to see a physician said cazaril firmly loudly and quickly or any other such interrogator dear gods so all men say in terror of the lancet and the purgative palli waved away this stung protest the last one of my sergeants who developed saddle boils i had to march in to the old leechhandler at swords point dont listen to him royesse cazarilhis face sobered and he made an apologetic half bow to isellemay i speak to you privately for a moment i promise i shall not keep him from you long royesse i cannot linger gravely iselle granted her royal permission cazaril quick to catch the undertone in pallis voice led him not to his office antechamber but all the way down the stairs to his own chamber the corridor was empty happily he closed his heavy door firmly behind them to thwart human eavesdroppers the senile spirit smudges kept their confidences cazaril took the chair the better to conceal his lack of grace in movement palli sat on the edge of the bed folded his cloak beside him and clasped his hands loosely between his knees the daughters courier to palliar must have made excellent time despite the winter muds said cazaril counting days in his head pallis dark brows rose you know of that already id thought it a ah quite private call to conclave though it will become obvious soon enough as the other lord dedicats arrive in cardegoss cazaril shrugged i have my sources i dont doubt it and so have i mine palli shook his finger at him you are the only intelligencer in the zangre that i would trust at present what under the gods eyes has been happening here at court the most lurid and garbled tales are circulating regarding our late holy generals sudden demise and delightful as the picture is somehow i dont really think he was carried off bodily by a flight of demons with blazing wings called down by the royesse iselles prayers ah not exactly he just choked to death in the middle of a drinking fest the night before his wedding on his poisonous lying tongue one would wish very nearly palli sniffed the lord dedicats whom lord dondo put in a furywho are not only all the ones he failed to buy outright but also those whove grown ashamed of their purchase sincehave taken his takingoff as a sign the wheel has turned as soon as our quorum arrives in cardegoss we mean to steal a march on the chancellor and present our own candidate for holy general to orico or perhaps a slate of three acceptable men from which the roya might choose that would likely go down better its a delicate balance between cazaril cut off loyalty and treason too dy jironal has his own powers in the temple as well as in the zangre you dont want this infighting to turn too ugly even dy jironal would not dare disrupt the temple by setting soldiers of the son upon soldiers of the daughter said palli confidently mm said cazaril at the same time some of the lord dedicatsnaming no names right nowwant to go farther maybe assemble and present evidence of enough of both the jironals bribes threats peculations and malfeasances to orico that it would force him to dismiss dy jironal as chancellor make the roya take a stand cazaril rubbed his nose and said warningly forcing orico to stand would be like trying to build a tower out of custard i dont recommend it nor will he readily be parted from dy jironal the roya relies on him more deeply than i can explain your evidence would need to be utterly overwhelming yes which is part of what brings me to you palli leaned forward intently would you be willing to repeat under oath before the daughters conclave the tale you told me in valenda about how the jironals sold you to the galleys cazaril hesitated i have only my word to offer as proof palli too weak to topple dy jironal i assure you not alone no but it might be just the coin to tip the scale the straw to light the fire just the straw to stand out from all the others did he want to be known as the pivot of this plot cazarils lips screwed up in dismay and youre a man of reputation palli went on persuasively cazaril jerked no good one surely what everyone knows of royesse iselles clever secretary the man who keeps his own counseland hersthe bastion of gotorgetutterly indifferent to wealth no im not cazaril assured him earnestly i just dress badly i quite like wealth and possessing the royesses total confidence and dont pretend a courtiers greed to mewith my own eyes i saw you turn down three rich roknari bribes to betray gotorget the last while you were starving near to death and i can produce living witnesses to back me well of course i didnt your voice would be listened to in council caz cazaril sighed i ill think about it i have nearer duties say that ill speak in the sealed session if and only if you think my testimony would be truly needed temple internal politics are no business of mine a twinge in his gut made him regret that word choice i fear i am afflicted with the goddesss own internal politics just now pallis happy nod claimed this as a firmer assent than cazaril quite wished he rose thanked cazaril and took his leave two afternoons later cazaril was sitting unguardedly at his worktable mending his pens when a page of the zangre entered his antechamber and announced here is dedicat rojeras in obedience to the order of the royesse iselle mlord rojeras was a man of about forty with sandy red hair receding a little from his forehead freckles and keen blue eyes the mans trade was recognizable by the green robes of a lay dedicat of cardegosss temple hospital of the mothers mercy that swung at his brisk step and his rank by the masters braid sewn over his shoulder cazaril knew at once that none of his ladies could be the quarry or the mothers order would have sent a woman physician he stiffened in alarm but nodded politely he rose and turned to convey the message to the inner chambers only to find lady betriz and the royesse already at the door smiling unsurprised greetings to the man betriz dropped a half curtsey in exchange for the dedicats deep bow and said this is the man i told you about royesse the mothers senior divine says he has made a special study of wasting diseases and has apprentices whove traveled from all over chalion to be taught by him so lady betrizs excursion to the temple yesterday had included more than prayers and charity offerings iselle had less to learn about court conspiracies than cazaril had thought shed certainly smuggled this past him smoothly enough he was ambushed and by his own ladies he smiled tightly swallowing his fear the man had none of the luminous signs of second sight about him what could he tell from cazarils mere body iselle looked the physician over and nodded satisfaction dedicat rojeras please examine my secretary and report back to me royesse i dont need to see a physician and i most especially dont need a physician to see me then all we shall waste is a trifle of time iselle countered which the gods give us each day all the same upon pain of my displeasure i order you to go with him cazaril there was no mistaking the determination in her voice damn palli for not only putting this into her head but teaching her how to block his escape iselle was too quick a study still the physician would either diagnose a miracle or he would not if he did cazaril could call for umegat and let the saint with his undoubted high connections to the temple deal with it and if not what harm was in it cazaril bowed obedient if stiffly offended assent and led his unwelcome visitor downstairs to his bedchamber lady betriz followed to see that her royal mistresss orders were carried out she offered him a quick apologetic smile but her eyes were apprehensive as cazaril closed his door upon her shut in with cazaril the physician made him sit by the window while he felt his pulse and peered into his eyes ears and throat he bade cazaril make water which he sniffed and studied in a glass tube held up to the light he inquired after cazarils bowels and cazaril reluctantly admitted to the blood then cazaril was required to undress and lie down and suffer to have his heart and breathing listened to by the mans ear pressed to his chest and be poked and prodded all over his body by the cool quick fingers cazaril had to explain how he came by his flogging scars rojerass comments upon them were limited to some hairraising suggestions of how he might rid cazaril of his remaining adhesions should cazaril desire it and gather the nerve withal cazaril thought he would prefer to wait and fall off another horse and said so which only made rojeras chuckle rojerass smile faded as he returned to a more careful and deeper probing of cazarils belly feeling and leaning this way and that pain here cazaril determined to pass this off said firmly no how about when i do this cazaril yelped ah some pain then more poking more wincing rojeras paused for a time his fingertips just resting on cazarils belly his gaze abstracted then he seemed to shake himself awake he reminded cazaril of umegat rojeras still smiled as cazaril dressed himself again but his eyes were shadowed with thought cazaril offered encouragingly speak dedicat i am a man of reason and will not fall to pieces is it so good rojeras took a breath and said plainly my lord you have a most palpable tumor is that it said cazaril gingerly seating himself again in his chair rojeras looked up swiftly this does not surprise you not as much as my last diagnosis did cazaril thought longingly of what a relief it would be to learn that his recurring belly cramp was such a natural normal lethality alas he was quite certain that most peoples tumors didnt scream obscenities at them in the middle of the night i have had reasons to think something was not right but what does this mean what do you think will happen he kept his voice as neutral as possible well rojeras sat on the edge of cazarils vacated bed and laced his fingers together there are so many kinds of these growths some are diffuse some knotted or encapsulated some kill swiftly some sit there for years and hardly seem to give trouble at all yours seems to be encapsulated which is hopeful there is one common sort a kind of cyst that fills with liquid that one woman i cared for held for over twelve years oh said cazaril and produced a heartened smile it grew to over a hundred pounds by the time she died the physician went on cazaril recoiled but rojeras continued blithely and there is another a most interesting one that i have only seen twice in my years of studya round mass that when opened proved to contain knots of flesh with hair and teeth and bones one was in a womans belly which almost made sense but another was in a mans leg i theorize that they were engendered by an escaped demon trying to grow to human form if the demon had succeeded i posit that it might have chewed its way out and entered the world in fleshly form which would surely have been an abomination i have for long wished to find such another one in a patient who was still alive that i might study it and see if my theory is so he eyed cazaril in speculation with the greatest effort cazaril kept himself from jolting up and screaming he glanced down at his swollen belly in terror and carefully away he had thought his affliction spiritual not physical it had not occurred to him that it could be both at once this was an intrusion of the supernatural into the solid that seemed all too plausible given his case he choked out do they grow to a hundred pounds too the two i excised were much smaller rojeras assured him cazaril looked up in sudden hope you can cut them out then ohonly from dead persons said the physician apologetically but but might it be done if a man were brave enough to lie down and offer himself in cold blood to razoredged steel if the abomination could be carved out with the brutal speed of an amputation was it possible to physically excise a miracle if that miracle were in fact made flesh rojeras shook his head on an arm or a leg maybe but this you were a soldieryouve surely seen what happens with dirty belly wounds even if you chanced to survive the shock and pain of the cutting the fever would kill you within a few days his voice grew more earnest i have tried it three times and only because my patients threatened to kill themselves if i would not try they all died i dont care to kill any more good people that way do not tease and torment yourself with such desperate impossibilities take what you can of life meantime and pray it was praying that got me into thisor this into me do not tell the royesse my lord said the physician gravely i must but i must notnot nowshe must not dismiss me to my bed i cannot leave her side cazarils voice rose in panic rojerass brows rose your loyalty commends you lord cazaril calm yourself there is no need for you to take to your bed before you feel the need indeed such light duties as may come your way in her service may occupy your mind and help you to compose your soul cazaril breathed deeply and decided not to disabuse rojeras of his pleasant illusions about service to the house of chalion as long as you make it clear that i am not to be exiled from my post as long as you grasp that this is not a license to exert yourself unduly rojeras returned sternly you are plainly in need of more rest than you have allowed yourself cazaril nodded hasty agreement trying to look at once biddable and energetic there is one other important thing rojeras added stirring as if to take his leave but not yet rising i only ask this because as you say you are a man of reason and i think you might understand yes said cazaril warily upon your deathlong delayed we must praymay i have your note of hand saying i might cut out your tumor for my collection you collect such horrors cazaril grimaced most men content themselves with paintings or old swords or ivory carvings offense struggled with curiosity and lost um how do you keep them in jars of wine spirits rojeras smiled a faint embarrassed flush coloring his fair skin i know it sounds gruesome but i keep hoping if only i learn enough someday i will understand someday i will be able to find some way to keep these things from killing people surely they are the gods dark gifts and we cannot in piety resist them we resist gangrene by amputation sometimes we resist the infection of the jaw by drawing out the bad tooth we resist fevers by applications of heat and cold and good care for every cure there must have been a first time rojeras fell silent after a moment he said it is clear that the royesse iselle holds you in much affection and esteem cazaril not knowing quite how to respond to this replied i have served her since last spring in valenda i had formerly served in her grandmothers household she is not given to hysterics is she highborn women are sometimes rojeras gave a little shrug in place of saying something rude no cazaril had to admit none of her household are quite the reverse he added but surely you dont have to tell the ladies and distress them so so soon of course i do said the physician although in a gentled tone he rose to his feet how can the royesse choose good actions without good knowledge an all too cogent point cazaril chewed on it in embarrassment as he followed the dedicat back upstairs betriz leaned out onto the corridor at the sound of their approaching steps is he going to be all right she demanded of rojeras rojeras held up a hand a moment my lady they made their way into the royesses sitting chamber where iselle waited bolt upright on the carved chair her hands tight in her lap she accepted rojerass bow with a nod cazaril didnt want to watch but he did want to know what was said and so sank into the chair betriz anxiously dragged up for him and to which iselle pointed rojeras remained standing in the presence of the royesse my lady rojeras said to iselle bowing again as if in apology for his bluntness your secretary is afflicted with a tumor in his gut iselle stared at him in shock betrizs face drained of all expression iselle swallowed and said hes not not dying surely she glanced fearfully at cazaril rojeras losing his grip on his stated principles of forthrightness in the face of this retreated briefly into courtly dissimulation death comes to all men variously it is beyond my skills to say how long lord cazaril may yet live his glance aside caught cazarils hard pleading stare and he added faithfully there is no reason he may not continue in his secretarial duties as long as he feels well enough you should not permit him to overtax himself however by your leave i should like to return each week to reexamine him of course said iselle faintly after a few more words on the subject of cazarils diet and duties rojeras made a courteous departure betriz tears blurring her velvety brown eyes choked i didnt think it was going to behad you guessed this whencazaril i dont want you to die cazaril replied ruefully well i dont want me to die either so that makes two of us three said iselle cazarilwhat can we do for you cazaril about to reply nothing seized this opportunity instead to rap out firmly this above allkindly do not discuss this with every castle gossiper it is my earnest desire that this stay private information forfor as long as may be for one thing the news that cazaril was dying might give dy jironal some fresh ideas about his brothers death the chancellor had to return to cardegoss soon possibly frustrated enough to start rethinking his missing corpse problem iselle accepted this with a slow nod and cazaril was permitted to return to his antechamber where he failed to concentrate upon his account books after the third time lady betriz tiptoed out to inquire if he wanted anything once at the royesses instigation and twice on her own cazaril counterattacked by declaring it was time for some longneglected grammar lessons if they werent going to leave him alone he might as well make use of their company his two pupils were very subdued ladylike and submissive this afternoon even though this meek studious virtue was something hed long wished for he found himself hoping it wouldnt last still they brushed through the lessons pretty well even the long drill on court roknari grammatical modes his prickly demeanor did not invite consolation the ladies bless their steadfast wits did not attempt to inflict any on him by the end the two young women were treating him almost normally again as he plainly desired though around betrizs grave mouth no dimples solaced him iselle rose to shake out her knots by pacing about the chamber she stopped to stare out the window at the chill winter mist that filled the ravine below the zangres walls she rubbed absently at her sleeve and remarked querulously lavender is not my color its like wearing a bruise there is too much death in cardegoss i wish wed never come here considering it impolitic to agree cazaril merely bowed and withdrew to make himself ready to go down to dinner the first flakes of winter snow powdered the streets and walls of cardegoss that week but melted off in the afternoons palli kept cazaril informed of the arrival of his fellow lord dedicats filtering in to the capital one by one and in turn decanted zangre gossip from his friend mutual aid and trust cazaril reflected but also a dual breach of the walls that each of them in theory helped to man yet if it ever came down to choosing sides between the temple and the zangre chalion would already have lost dy jironal royse teidez in tow returned as if blown in by the cold southeast wind that also dumped an unwelcome gift of sleet on the town in passing to cazarils relief the chancellor was emptyhanded balked of quarry in his quest for justice and revenge no telling from dy jironals set face if he had despaired of his hunt or had just been drawn back by spies riding hard and fast to tell him of the forces gathering in cardegoss that were not of his own summoning teidez dragged back to his quarters in the castle looking tired sullen and unhappy cazaril was not surprised chasing down every death for three provinces around that had occurred during the night of dondos takingoff had surely been gruesome enough even without the vile weather during his bedazzlement by dondos practiced sycophancy teidez had neglected his elder sisters company when he came to visit iselles chambers that afternoon he both accepted and returned a sisterly embrace seeming more eager to talk to her than he had for a long time cazaril withdrew discreetly to his antechamber and sat with his account books open fiddling with his drying quill since orico had for a betrothal gift assigned the rents of six towns to the support of his sisters household and not taken them back when funeral had replaced wedding cazarils accounts and correspondence had grown more complex he listened meditatively through the open door to the rise and fall of the young voices teidez detailed his trip to his sisters eager ears the muddy roads and floundering horses the tense and cranky men indifferent food and chilly quarters iselle in a voice that betrayed more envy than sympathy pointed out how good a practice it was for his future winter campaigns the cause of the journey was scarcely touched upon between them teidez still baffled and offended by his sisters rejection of his late hero and iselle apparently unwilling to burden him with knowledge of the more grotesque causes of her antipathy besides being shocked by the sudden and dreadful nature of lord dondos murder teidez must be one of the few whod known the man who genuinely mourned him and why not dondo had flattered and cajoled and made much of teidez hed showered the boy with gifts and treats some toxically inappropriate for his age and how was teidez to grasp that grown mens vices were not the same as grown mens honors the elder dy jironal must seem a cold and unresponsive companion by comparison the expedition had apparently left a trail of disruption behind as its inquiries grew rough and ready in dy jironals frustration worse dy jironal who needed teidez desperately was insufficiently adept at concealing how little he liked him and had left him to his handlerssecretarytutor guards and servantstreating him as tailpiece rather than lieutenant but if as his surly words hinted teidez had begun to reciprocate his chief guardians dislike it was surely for all the wrong reasons and if his new secretary was taking up any of the abandoned load of his noble education nothing in teidezs tale gave hint of it at length nan dy vrit bade the young people prepare for dinner and drew the visit to a close teidez walked slowly out through cazarils antechamber frowning at his boots the boy was grown almost as tall as his half brother orico his round face hinting that in future he might grow as broad as well though for now he kept youths muscular fitness cazaril turned a leaf in his account book at random dipped his pen again and glanced up with a tentative smile how do you fare my lord teidez shrugged but then halfway across the room wheeled back and came to cazarils table his expression was not miffedor not merely miffedbut tired and troubled as well he drummed his finger briefly on the wood and stared down over the pile of books and papers cazaril folded his hands and cast him an encouraging look of inquiry teidez said abruptly theres something wrong in cardegoss isnt there there were so many things wrong in cardegoss cazaril scarcely knew how to take teidezs words he said cautiously what makes you think that teidez made a little gesture pulled short orico is sickly and does not rule as he should he sleeps so much like an old man but hes not that old and everyone says hes lost histeidez colored slightly and his gesture grew vagueryou know cannot act as a man is supposed to with a woman has it never struck you that there is something uncanny about his strange illness after a slight hesitation cazaril temporized your observations are shrewd royse lord dondos death was uncanny too i think its all of a piece the boy was thinking good you should take your thoughts to not dy jironal your brother orico he is the most proper authority to address them cazaril tried to imagine teidez getting a straight answer out of orico and sighed if iselle could not draw sense from the man with all her passionate persuasion what hope had the much less articulate teidez orico would evade answer unless stiffened to it in advance should cazaril take this tutelage into his own hands not only had he not been given authority to disclose the state secret he wasnt even supposed to know it himself and the knowledge of the golden generals curse needed to come straight to teidez from the roya not around him or despite him lest it take up a suspicious tinge of conspiracy hed been silent too long teidez leaned forward across the table eyes narrowing and hissed lord cazaril what do you know i know we dare not leave you in ignorance much longer nor iselle either royse i shall talk to you of this later i cannot answer you tonight teidezs lips tightened he swiped a hand through his dark amber curls in a gesture of impatience his eyes were uncertain untrusting and cazaril thought strangely lonely i see he said in a bleak tone and turned on his heel to march out his lowvoiced mutter carried back from the corridor i must do it myself if he meant talk to orico good cazaril would go to orico first though yes and if that proved insufficient return with umegat to back him up he set his pens in their jar closed his books took a breath to steel himself against the twinges that stabbed him with sudden movement and pushed to his feet an interview with orico was easier resolved upon than accomplished taking him as still an ambassador for iselles ibran proposal the roya ducked away from cazaril on sight and set the master of his chamber to offer up a dozen excuses for his indisposition the matter was made more difficult by the need for this conversation to take place in private just between the two of them and uninterrupted cazaril was walking down the corridor from the banqueting hall after supper head down and considering how best to corner his royal quarry when a thump on his shoulder half spun him around he looked up and an apology for his clumsy abstraction died on his lips the man hed run into was ser dy joal one of dondos nowunemployed bravosand what were all those ripe souls doing for pocket money these days had they been inherited by dondos brotherflanked by one of his comrades halfgrinning and ser dy maroc who frowned uneasily the man whod run into him cazaril corrected himself the candlelight from the mirrored wall sconces made bright sparks in the younger mans alert eyes clumsy oaf roared dy joal sounding just a trifle rehearsed how dare you crowd me from the door i beg your pardon ser dy joal said cazaril my mind was elsewhere he made a half bow and began to go around dy joal dodged sideways blocking him and swung back his vestcloak to reveal the hilt of his sword i say you crowded me do you give me the lie as well this is an ambush ah cazaril stopped his mouth tightening wearily he said what do you want dy joal bear witness dy joal motioned to his comrade and dy maroc he crowded me his comrade obediently replied aye i saw though dy maroc looked much less certain i seek a touch with you for this lord cazaril said dy joal i see that you do said cazaril dryly but was this drunken stupidity or the worlds simplest form of assassination a duel to first blood approved practice and outlet for high spirits among young courtly hotheads followed by the sword slipped upon my honor he ran upon it and whatever number of paid witnesses one could afford to confirm it i say i will have three drops of your blood to clear this slight it was the customary challenge i say you should go dip your head in a bucket of water until you sober up boy i do not duel eh cazaril lifted his arms briefly hands out flipping his own vestcloak open to show hed borne no sword in to dinner let me pass urrac lend the coward your sword we have our two witnesses well have this outside now dy joal jerked his head toward the doors at the corridors end that led out into the main courtyard the comrade unbuckled his sword grinned and tossed it to cazaril cazaril lifted an eyebrow but not his hand and let the sheathed weapon clatter uncaught to his feet he kicked it back to its owner i do not duel shall i call you coward direct demanded joal his lips were parted and his breath already rushing in his elation anticipating battle cazaril saw out of the corner of his eye a couple of other men attracted by the raised voices advance curiously down the corridor toward this knot of altercation call me anything you please depending on how much of a fool you want to sound your mouthings are naught to me sighed cazaril he did his best to project languid boredom but his blood was pulsing faster in his ears fear no fury you have a lords name have you no lords honor one corner of cazarils mouth turned up not at all humorously the confusion of mind you dub honor is a disease for which the roknari galleymasters have the cure so much for your honor then you shall not refuse me three drops for mine thats right cazarils voice went oddly calm his heart which had sped slowed his lips drew back in a strange grin thats right he breathed again cazaril held up his left hand palm out and with his right jerked out his belt knife last used for cutting bread at supper dy joals hand spasmed on his sword hilt and he half drew not within the royas hall cried dy maroc anxiously you know you must take it outside dy joal by the brother he has no sword you cannot dy joal hesitated cazaril instead of advancing toward him shook back his left sleeveand drew his knife blade shallowly across his own wrist cazaril felt no pain none blood welled gleaming dark carmine in the candlelight though not spurting dangerously a kind of haze clouded his vision blocking out everyone but himself and the now uncertainly grinning young fool whod hustled him for a touch ill give you touch he spun his knife back into its belt sheath dy joal not yet wary enough let his sword slide back and lifted his hand from it smiling cazaril held up his hands one arm bleeding the other bare then he lunged he caught up the shocked dy joal and bore him backward to the wall where he landed with a thump that reverberated down the corridor one arm trapped behind him cazarils right hand pressed under dy joals chin lifting him from his feet and pinning him to the wall by his neck cazarils right knee ground into dy joals groin he kept up the pressure to deny dy joal his trapped arm the other clawed at him and he pinned it too to the wall dy joals wrist twisted in the slippery blood of his grip but could not break free the purpling young man did not of course cry out though his eyes rolled whitely and a grunting gargle broke from his lips his heels hammered the wall the bravos knew cazarils crooked hands had held a pen theyd forgotten hed held an oar dy joal wasnt going anywhere now cazaril snarled in his ear lowvoiced but audible to all i dont duel boy i kill as a soldier kills which is as a butcher kills as quickly efficiently and with as least risk to myself as i can arrange if i decide you die you will die when i choose where i choose by what means i choose and you will never see the blow coming he released dy joals nowenfeebled arm and brought his left wrist up and pressed the bloody cut to his terrified victims halfopen trembling mouth you want three drops of my blood for your honor you shall drink them blood and spittle spurted around dy joals chattering teeth but the bravo didnt even dare try to bite now drink damn you cazaril pressed harder smearing blood all over dy joals face fascinated with the vividness of it red streaks on livid skin the catch of rough beard stubble against his wrist the bright blur of the candlelight reflected in the welling tears spilling from the staring eyes he stared into them watching them cloud cazaril for the gods sake let him breathe dy marocs distressed cry broke through cazarils red fog cazaril reduced the pressure of his grip and dy joal inhaled shuddering keeping his knee in place cazaril drew back his bloodied left hand in a fist and placed very precisely a hard blow to the bravos stomach that shook the air again dy joals knees jerked up with it only then did cazaril step back and release the man dy joal fell to the floor and bent over himself gasping and choking weeping not even trying to get up after a moment he vomited cazaril stepped across the mess of food and wine and bile toward urrac who lurched backward until stopped by the far wall cazaril leaned into his face and repeated softly i dont duel but if you seek to die like a bludgeoned steer cross me again he turned on his heel dy marocs face drained white wavered past his vision hissing cazaril have you gone mad try me cazaril grinned fiercely at him dy maroc fell back cazaril strode down the corridor past a blur of men blood drops still spattering off his fingers as he swung his arms and out into the chill shock of the night the closing door cut off a rising babble of voices he almost ran across the icy cobbles of the courtyard toward the main block and refuge both his steps and his breath growing faster and less even as somethingsanity delayed terrorseeped back into his mind his belly cramped violently as he mounted the stone stairs his fingers shook so badly as he fumbled out his key to let himself into his bedchamber that he dropped it twice and had to use both hands braced against the door to finally guide it into the lock he locked the door again behind him and fell wheezing and groaning across his bed his attendant ghosts had fled into hiding during the confrontation their desertion unnoticed by him at the time he rolled onto his side and curled around his aching stomach now at last his cut wrist began to throb so did his head hed seen men go berserk a few times in the madness of battle hed just never imagined what it must feel like from the inside before no one had mentioned the floating exhilaration intoxicating as wine or sex an unusual but natural result of nerves mortality and fright jammed together in too small a space too short a time not unnatural not the thing in his belly reaching out to twist and taunt and trick him into death and its own release oh you know what you did to dondo now you know what dondo is doing to you it was by chance late the following morning that cazaril spied orico ambling out the zangre gates toward the menagerie with only a page at his heels cazaril tucked the letters hed been carrying to the chancellery office into the inner pocket of his vestcloak turned from the door of iass tower and followed the royas master of the chamber had earlier refused to disturb his lords afterbreakfast nap clearly orico had finally roused himself and now sought comfort and solace among his animals cazaril wondered if the roya had awoken with as bad a headache as he had as he strode across the cobbles cazaril marshaled his arguments if the roya feared action cazaril would point out that inaction was equally likely to be bent to ill by the curses malign influence if the roya insisted that the children were too young he would note that they should not then have been ordered to cardegoss in the first place but now that they were here if orico could not protect them then he had an obligation to both chalion and the children to tell them of their danger cazaril would call on umegat to confirm that the roya could not did not in fact hold the curse all to himself do not send them blindfolded into battle he would plead and hope pallis cry would strike orico as much to the heart as it had him and if it didnt if he took this into his own hands should he first tell teidez as heir of chalion and appeal for his aid in protecting his sister or iselle and enlist her help in managing the more difficult teidez the second choice would better allow him to hide his complicity behind the royesses skirts but only if the secret of his guilt survived her shrewd crossexamination a scraping of hooves broke into his selfabsorption he looked up just in time to dodge from the path of the cavalcade starting out from the stables royse teidez mounted on his fine black horse led a party of his baocian guards their captain and two men the royses blackandlavender mourning garb made his round face appear drawn and pale in the winter sunlight dondos green stone glinted on the guard captains hand raised to return cazarils polite salute where away royse cazaril called do you hunt the party was armed for it with spears and crossbows swords and cudgels teidez drew up his fretting horse and stared briefly down at cazaril no just a gallop along the river the zangre is stuffy this morning indeed and if they just happened to flush a deer or two well they were prepared to accept the gods largesse but not really hunting while in mourning no i understand said cazaril and suppressed a smile it will be good for the horses teidez lifted his reins again cazaril stepped back but then added suddenly i would speak to you later royse on the matter that concerned you yesterday teidez gave him a vague wave and a frownnot exactly assent but it would do cazaril bowed farewell as they clattered out of the stable yard and remained bent over as the worst cramp yet kicked him in the belly with the power of a horses hind hooves his breathing stopped waves of pain seemed to surge through his whole body from this central source even to burning spasms in the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet a hideous vision shook him of rojerass postulated demonmonster preparing to bloodily claw its way out of him into the light one creature or two with no bodies to keep their spirits apart bottled under the pressure of the ladys miracle might dondo and the demon have begun to blend together into one dreadful being it was true that hed distinguished only one voice not a duet baying at him from his belly in the night his knees sank helplessly to the cold cobbles he drew in a shuddering breath the world seemed to churn around his head in short dizzy jerks after a few minutes a shadow trailing a powerful aroma of horses loomed at his shoulder a gruff voice muttered in his ear mlord you all right cazaril blinked up to see one of the stable grooms a middleaged fellow with bad teeth bending over him not really he managed to reply ought you go indoors sir yes i suppose the groom helped him to his feet with a hand under his elbow and steadied him back through the gates to the main block at the bottom of the stairs cazaril gasped wait not yet and sat heavily upon the steps after an awkward minute the groom asked should i get someone for you mlord i should return to my duties its just a spasm it will pass off in a few minutes im all right now go on the pain was dwindling leaving him feeling flushed and strange the groom frowned uncertainly staring down at cazaril but then ducked his head and departed slowly as he sat quietly on the stair he began to regain his breath and balance and was able to straighten his back again the world stopped pulsing even the couple of ghostblotches that had crept out of the walls to cluster at his feet grew quiescent cazaril eyed them in the shadows of the stairwell considering what a cold and lonely damnation was their slow erosion loss of all that had made them individual men and women what must it be like to feel ones very spirit slowly rot away around one as flesh rotted from dead limbs did the ghosts sense their own diminishment or did that selfperception too mercifully wear away in time the bastards legendary hell with all its supposed torments seemed a sort of heaven by comparison ah cazaril a surprised voice made him look up palli stood with one booted foot on the first step flanked by two young men also wearing the blue and white of the daughters order beneath gray wool riding cloaks i was just coming to find you pallis dark brows drew down what are you doing sitting on the stairs just resting a moment cazaril produced a quick concealing smile and levered himself up though he kept a hand on the wall as if casually for balance whats afoot i hoped you would have time to take a stroll down to the temple with me and talk to some men about thatpalli made a circling gesture with his fingerlittle matter of gotorget already dy yarrin came in last night we are now a sufficient assembly to make binding decisions and with dy jironal also arrived back in town its as well we chart our course without further delay indeed cazaril would search out orico immediately upon his return then he glanced at the two companions and back at palli as if seeking introduction but with the hidden question in his glance are these safe ears ah said palli cheerfully permit me to make known to you my cousins ferda and foix dy gura they rode with me from palliar ferda is lieutenant to my master of horse and his younger brother foixwell we keep him for the heavy lifting make your bow to the castillar boys the shorter stouter of the two grinned sheepishly and they both managed reasonably graceful courtesies they bore a faint family resemblance to palli in the strong lines of jaw and the bright brown eyes ferda was of middle height and wiry an obvious rider his legs already a little bowed while his brother was broad and muscular they seemed a pleasant enough pair of country lordlings healthy cheerful and unscarred and appallingly young but pallis faint emphasis on the word cousins answered cazarils silent question the two brothers fell in behind as cazaril and palli walked out the gates and down into cardegoss young they might be but their eyes were alert looking all around and they casually kept their sword hilts free of entanglement with cloak and vestcloak cazaril was glad to know palli did not go about the streets of cardegoss unattended even in this bright gray winter noon cazaril tensed as they passed under the dressedstone walls of jironal palace but no armed bravos issued from its ironbound doors to molest them they arrived in the temple square having encountered no one more daunting than a trio of maidservants they smiled at the men in the colors of the daughters order and giggled among themselves after passing which slightly alarmed the dy gura brothers or at least made them stride out more stiffly the great compound of the daughters house made a wall along one whole side of the temples fivesided square the main gate was devoted to the women and girls who were the houses more usual dedicats acolytes and divines the men of its holy military order had their own separate entrance building and stable for couriers horses the hallways of the military headquarters were chilly despite a sufficiency of lit sconces and the abundance of beautiful tapestries and hangings woven and embroidered by pious ladies all over chalion blanketing its walls cazaril started toward the main hall but palli drew him down another corridor and up a staircase you do not meet in the hall of the lord dedicats cazaril inquired looking over his shoulder palli shook his head too cold too large and too empty we felt excessively exposed there for these sealed debates and depositions weve taken a chamber where we can feel a majority and not freeze our feet palli left the dy gura brothers in the corridor to contemplate a brightly colored quilted rendering of the legend of the virgin and the water jar featuring an especially voluptuous virgin and goddess he ushered cazaril past a pair of daughters guardsmen who looked closely at their faces and returned pallis salute and through a set of double doors carved with interlaced vines the chamber beyond held a long trestle table and two dozen men crowded but warmand above all cazaril noted private in addition to the good wax candles a window of colored glass depicting the ladys favorite spring flowers fought the winter gloom pallis fellow lord dedicats sat at attention young men and graybeards in blueandwhite garb bright and expensive or faded and shabby but all alike in the grim seriousness of their faces the provincar of yarrin ranking lord of chalion present held down the head of the table beneath the window cazaril wondered how many here were spies or at least careless mouths the group seemed already too large and diverse for successful conspiracy despite their outward precautions to seal their conclave lady guide them to wisdom palli bowed and said my lords here is the castillar dy cazaril who was my commander at the siege of gotorget to testify before you palli took an empty seat halfway around the table and left cazaril standing at its foot another lord dedicat had him swear an oath of truth in the goddesss name cazaril had no trouble repeating with sincerity and fervor the part about may her hands hold me and not release me dy yarrin led the questioning he was shrewd and clearly well primed by palli for he had the whole tale of the aftermath of gotorget out of cazaril in a very few minutes cazaril added no coloring details for some here he didnt need to he could mark by the tightening of their lips how much of what was unspoken they understood inevitably someone wanted to know how he had first come to such enmity with lord dondo and he was reluctantly compelled to repeat the story of his near beheading in prince oluss tent it was normally considered bad manners to denigrate the dead on the theory that they could not defend themselves in dondos case cazaril wasnt so sure but he kept that account too as brief and bald as possible despite his succinctness by the time he was done he was leaning on his hands on the table feeling dangerously lightheaded a brief debate followed on the problem of obtaining corroborating evidence which cazaril had thought insurmountable dy yarrin it seemed did not find it so but then cazaril had never thought to try to obtain testimony from surviving roknari or via sister chapters of the daughters order across the borders in the princedoms but my lords cazaril said diffidently into one of the few brief pauses in the flow of suggestion and objection even if my words were proved a dozen times over mine is no great matter by which to bring down a great man not like the treason of lord dy lutez that was never well proved even at the time murmured dy yarrin in a dry tone palli put in what is a great matter i think the gods do not calculate greatness as men do i for one find a casual destruction of a mans life even more repugnant than a determined one cazaril leaned more heavily on the table in the interests of not collapsing in an illustrative way at this dramatic moment palli had insisted his voice would be listened to in council very well let it be a voice of caution choosing your own holy general is surely within your mandate lords orico may well even accede to your selection if you make it easy for him challenging the chancellor of chalion and holy general of your brother order is reaching beyond and it is my considered opinion that orico will never be persuaded to support it i recommend against it it is all or nothing broke in one man and never again will we endure another dondo began another dy yarrin held up his hand stemming the tide of hot comment i thank you lord cazaril for both your testimony and your opinion his choice of words invited his fellows to note which was which we must continue this debate in private conclave it was a dismissal palli pushed back his chair and rose to his feet they collected the dy guras from the corridor cazaril was a little surprised when pallis escort did not stop at the houses gates should you not return to your council he asked as they turned into the street dy yarrin will tell me of it when i get back i mean to see you safe to the zangres gates ive not forgotten your tale of poor ser dy sanda cazaril glanced over his shoulder at the two young officers pacing behind as they crossed over to the temple plaza oh the armed escort was for him he decided not to complain asking palli instead who looks like your prime candidate for holy general then to present to orico dy yarrin he would be my choice said palli he does seem a force in your council has he a little selfinterest there perhaps but he means to hand the provincarship of yarrin down to his eldest son and devote his whole attention to the order if he is chosen ah would that martou dy jironal had done likewise for the sons order aye so many posts how is he serving any of them rightly they climbed uphill threading their way through the stonepaved town stepping carefully across central gutters well rinsed by the recent cold rains narrow streets of shops gave way to wider squares of fine houses cazaril considered dy jironal as his palace loomed once more on their route if the curse worked by distorting and betraying virtues what good thing had it corrupted in martou dy jironal love of family perhaps turning it into mistrust of all that was not family his excessive reliance on his brother dondo was surely turning to weakness and downfall maybe well i hope that level heads prevail palli grimaced court life is turning you into a diplomat caz cazaril returned a bleak smile i cant even begin to tell you what court life is turning meah he ducked as one of fonsas crows popped over a nearby housetop and came hurtling down at his head screaming hoarsely the bird almost tumbled out of the air at his feet and hopped across the pavement cawing and flapping it was followed by two more one landed on cazarils outflung arm and clung there shrieking and whistling its claws digging in a few black feathers spiraled wildly in the air blast these birds hed thought they had lost interest in him and here they were back in all their embarrassing enthusiasm palli who had jumped back laughing glanced up over the roof tiles and said five gods something has stirred them up the whole flock is in the air above the zangre look at them circle about ferda dy gura shielded his eyes and stared where palli pointed at the distant whirl of dark shapes like black leaves in a cyclone dipping and swooping his brother foix pressed his hands to his ears as the crows continued to shriek around their feet and shouted over the din noisy too these birds were not entranced cazaril realized they were hysterical his heart turned cold in his chest theres something very wrong come on he was not in the best shape for running uphill he had his hand pressed hard to the violent stitch in his side as they approached the stable block at the zangres outskirts his courier birds flapped above his head in escort by that time mens shouts could be heard beneath the crows continued screaming and palli and his cousins needed no urging to keep pace with him a groom in the royal tabard of the menagerie was staggering in circles before its open doors screaming and crying blood running down his face two of teidezs greenandblackclad baocian guards stood before the doors with swords drawn holding off three zangre guards who hovered apprehensively before them also with blades out seeming not to dare to strike the crows lacked no such courage they stooped awkwardly at the baocians trying to claw with their talons and stab with their beaks the baocians cursed and beat them off two bundles of black feathers lay on the cobbles already one still one twitching cazaril strode up to the menagerie doors roaring what in the bastards name is going on here how dare you slay the sacred crows one of the baocians pointed his sword toward him stay back lord cazaril you may not pass we have strict orders from the royse lips drawn back in fury cazaril knocked the sword aside with his cloaked arm lunged forward and wrenched it from the guardsmans grasp give me that you fool he flung it to the stones in the general direction of the zangre guards and palli who had drawn in a panic when the unarmed cazaril had waded into the fray the sword clanged and spun across the cobbles till foix stopped it with a booted foot stamped down upon it and held it with a challenging weight and stare cazaril turned on the second baocian whose blade drooped abruptly recoiling from cazarils step the guardsman cried hastily castillar we do this to preserve the life of roya orico do what is orico in there what are you about a feline snarl rising to a yowl from inside whirled cazaril around and he left the daunted baocian to the zangre guards now encouraged to advance he strode into the shadowed aisle of the menagerie the old tongueless groom was on his knees on the tiles bent over making choked weeping sounds his thumbless hands were pressed to his face and a little blood ran between his fingers he looked up at the sound of cazarils step his quavering wet mouth ravaged with woe as he ran past the bears stalls cazaril glimpsed two inert black heaps studded with crossbow bolts fur wet and matted with blood the vellas stall door was open and they lay on their sides in the bright straw eyes open and fixed throats slashed at the far end of the aisle royse teidez was rising to his feet from the limp body of the spotted cat he pushed himself up with his bloodied sword and leaned upon it panting his face wild and exultant his shadow roiled around him like thunderclouds at midnight he looked up at cazaril and grinned fiercely ha he cried the baocian guard captain a twisted little bird still in his hand plunged out of the aviary into cazarils path bundles of colored feathers dead and dying birds of all sizes littered the aviary floor some still fluttering helplessly hold castillar he began his words were whipped away as cazaril grasped him by the tunic and spun him around throwing him to the floor into the path of palli who was following on his heels muttering in astonished dismay bastard weeps bastard weeps that had been pallis battlemumble at gotorget when his sword had risen and fallen endlessly on men coming up over the ladders and hed had no breath for cries hold him cazaril snarled over his shoulder and strode on toward teidez teidez threw back his head and met cazarils eyes squareon you cant stop meive done it i have saved the roya whatwhatwhat cazaril was so frightened and furious his lips and mind could scarcely form coherent words fool boy what destructive madness is this this his hands opened shaking and jerked about teidez leaned toward him his teeth glinting in his drawnback lips ive broken the curse the black magic that has been making orico sick it was coming from these evil animals they were a secret gift from the roknari meant to slowly poison him and weve slain the roknari spyi think teidez glanced somewhat doubtfully over his shoulder only then did cazaril notice the last body on the floor at the far end of the aisle umegat lay on his side in a heap as unmoving as the birds or the vellas the carcasses of the sand foxes lay tumbled nearby cazaril had not seen him at first because his clear white glow was extinguished dead cazaril moaned lurched toward him and fell to his knees the left side of umegats head was lacerated the graybronze braid disheveled and soaked with gore his skin was as gray as an old rag but his scalp was still sluggishly bleeding therefore does he still breathe asked teidez advancing to peer over cazarils shoulder the captain hit him with his sword pommel when he would not give way fool fool fool boy no fool i he was behind it all teidez nodded toward umegat a roknari wizard sent to drain and kill orico cazaril ground his teeth umegat is a temple divine sent by the bastards order to care for the sacred animals who were given by the god to preserve orico and if you have not slain him it is the only good luck here umegats breath came shallow and odd his hands were cold as a corpses but he did breathe no teidez shook his head no youre wrong that cant be for the first time the heroic elation wobbled in his face cazaril uncoiled and rose to his feet and teidez stepped back a trifle cazaril turned to find palli blessedly at his back and ferda at pallis shoulder staring around at it all in horrified amazement palli at least cazaril could trust to know field aid palli he rasped out take over here see to the wounded grooms this one especially his skull may be broken he pointed down to umegats darkened body ferda my lord ferdas badge and colors would gain him admittance anywhere in the sacred precincts run to the temple find archdivine mendenal let no one and nothing keep you from coming instantly to him tell him what has transpired here and have him send temple physicianstell him umegat needs the mothers midwife the special one hell know what you mean hurry palli already kneeling beside umegat added give me your cloak and run boy ferda tossed his cloak at his commander whirled and was gone before palli drew a second breath palli began to wrap the gray wool around the unconscious roknari cazaril turned back to teidez whose eyes were darting this way and that in growing uncertainty the royse retreated to the lifeemptied husk of the leopard six feet from nose to tail tip lying limply on the tiles its beautiful spotted fur hid the mouths of its wounds marked by matted blood on its sides cazaril thought of dy sandas pierced corpse i slew it with my sword because it was a royal symbol of my house even if it was ensorcelled teidez offered and to test my courage it clawed my leg he bent and rubbed awkwardly at his right shin where his black trousers were indeed ripped and hanging in bloodwet ribbons teidez was the heir of chalion and iselles brother cazaril could not wish the beast had bitten out his throat should not anyway five gods how did you come by this black nonsense it is not nonsense you knew oricos illness was uncanny i saw it in your facebastards demons anyone could see it lord dondo told me the secret before he died was murderedmurdered to keep the secret i think but it was too late did you come up with this plan of attack on your own teidezs head came up proudly no but when i was the only one left i carried it through all by myself we had been going to do it together after dondo married iselledestroy the curse and free the house of chalion from its evil influence but then it was left to me so i made myself his bannercarrier his arm to reach from beyond the grave and strike one last blow for chalion ah ah cazaril was so overcome he stamped in a circle but had dondo believed his own rubbish or had this been a clever plan to use teidez obliquely and unprovably to disable or assassinate orico malice or stupidity with dondo who could tell no lord cazaril what should we do with these baocians foixs voice inquired diffidently cazaril looked up to find the disarmed baocian guard captain held between foix and one of the zangre guards and you snarled cazaril at him you tool you fool you lent yourself to this this stupid sacrilege and told no one or are you dondos creature still ah take him and his men and lock them in a cell until cazaril hesitated dondo was behind this oh yes reaching out to wreak chaos and disaster it bore his stampbut for once cazaril suspected martou was not behind dondo quite the opposite unless he missed his guess until the chancellor is notified cazaril continued you there a downward sweep of his arm commanded another zangre guards attention run to the chancellery or jironal palace or wherever he may be found and tell him what has happened here beg him to wait upon me before he goes to orico lord cazaril you cannot order my guards arrested cried teidez cazaril was the only one here with the air if not the fact of authority needed to carry out this next step you are going straight to your chamber until your brother orders otherwise i will escort you there take your hand off me teidez yelped as cazarils iron grip closed around his upper arm but he did not quite dare to struggle against whatever he was seeing in cazarils face cazaril said through his teeth in a voice dripping false cordiality no indeed you are wounded young lord and i have a duty to help you to a physician he added under his breath to teidezs ear alone and i will knock you flat and drag you if i have to teidez recovering what dignity he could grumbled to his guard captain go quietly with them then ill send for you later when i have proved lord cazarils error since his two captors had already spun the captain around and were marching him out this ended up addressed to the baocians back and fell a little flat the injured grooms had crept up to pallis side and were trying to help him with umegat palli glanced over his shoulder and gave cazaril a quick reassuring wave cazaril nodded back and under the guise of lending support strongarmed the royse out of the nightmarish abattoir he had made of the royas menagerie too late too late too late beat in his brain with every stride outside the crows were no longer whirling and screaming in the air they hopped about in agitation upon the cobbles seeming as bewildered and directionless as cazarils own thoughts still keeping a grip on teidez cazaril marched him through the zangres gates where now more guards had appeared teidez closed his lips on further protest though his sullen angry and insulted expression boded no good for cazaril later on the royse scorned to favor his wounded leg though it left a trail of bloodied footprints across the cobbles of the main courtyard cazarils attention was jerked leftward when one of saras waiting women and a page appeared in the doorway to iass tower hurry hurry the woman urged the boy who dashed toward the gates whitefaced he nearly caromed off cazaril in his haste where away boy cazaril called after him he turned and danced backward for a moment temple lord dare not stayroyina sarathe roya has collapsed he turned and sprinted in earnest through the gates the guards stared at him and uneasily back toward iass tower teidezs arm beneath cazarils hand lost its stiff resistance beneath his scowl a scared look crept into his eyes and he glanced aside warily at his selfappointed detainer after a moments indecision cazaril not letting go of teidez wheeled around and started for iass tower instead he hurried to catch up with the waiting woman who had ducked back inside and called after her but she seemed not to hear him as she scurried up the end stairs he was wheezing as he reached the third floor where orico kept his chambers he stared in apprehension down its central corridor royina sara her white shawl bundled about her and a woman at her heels was hurrying up the hall cazaril bowed anxiously as she came to the staircase my lady what has happened can i help she touched her hand to her frightened face i scarcely know yet castillar oricohe was reading aloud to me in my chambers while i stitched as he sometimes does for my solace when suddenly he stopped and blinked and rubbed his eyes and said he could not see the words anymore and that the room was all dark but it wasnt then he fell from his chair i cried for my ladies and we put him in his bed and have sent for a temple physician we saw the royas page cazaril assured her he was running as fast as he could oh good was it an apoplexy do you think i dont think i dont know he speaks a little and his breath is not very labored what was all that shouting down by the stables earlier distractedly not waiting for an answer she passed him and mounted the stairs teidez his face gone leaden licked his lips but said no more as cazaril turned him around and led him down to the courtyard the royse did not find his voice again till they were mounting the stairs in the main block where he repeated breathlessly it cannot be dondo told me the menagerie was black sorcery a roknari curse to keep orico sick and weak and i could see that it was so a roknari curse there truly is but the menagerie is a white miracle that keeps orico alive despite it was till now cazaril added bitterly no no its all wrong dondo told me dondo was mistaken cazaril hesitated briefly or else dondo wished to hurry the replacement of a roya who favored his elder brother with one who favored himself teidezs lips parted in protest but no sound came from them cazaril didnt think the royse could be feigning the shocked look in his eyes the only mercy in this day if mercy it wasdondo might have misled teidez but he seemed not to have corrupted him not to that extent teidez was tool not coconspirator not a willing fratricide unfortunately he was a tool that had kept on functioning after the workmans hand had fallen away and whose fault was it that the boy swallowed down lies when no one would feed him the truth the sallow fellow who was the royses secretarytutor looked up in surprise from his writing desk as cazaril swung the boy into his chambers look to your master cazaril told him shortly hes injured he is not to quit this building until chancellor dy jironal is informed what has occurred and gives him leave he added with a little sour satisfaction if you knew of this outrage and did nothing to prevent it the chancellor will be furious with you the man paled in confusion cazaril turned his back on him now to go see what was happening with umegat but lord cazaril teidezs voice quavered what should i do cazaril spat over his shoulder as he strode out again pray as he turned onto the end stairs cazaril heard a womans slippers scuffing rapidly on the steps he looked up to find lady betriz her lavender skirts trailing hurrying down toward him lord cazaril whats going on we heard shoutingone of the maids cried royse teidez has run mad and tried to slay the royas animals not madmisled i think and not triedsucceeded in a few brief bitter words cazaril described the horror in the stable block but why her voice was husky with shock cazaril shook his head a lie of lord dondos nearly as i can tell he convinced the royse that umegat was a roknari wizard using the animals to somehow poison the roya which turned the truth exactly backwards the animals sustained orico and now he has collapsed five gods i cannot explain it all here upon the stairs tell royesse iselle i will attend upon her soon but first i must see to the injured grooms stay awaykeep iselle away from the menagerie and if he didnt give iselle action shed surely take it for herself wait upon sara both of you shes halfdistracted cazaril continued on down the stairs past the place where he had beendeliberatelydecoyed away by his own pain earlier dondos demonic ghost made no move to grip him now back at the menagerie cazaril found that the excellent palli and his men had already carried off umegat and the more seriously injured of the undergrooms to the mothers hospital the remaining groom was stumbling around trying to catch a hysterical little blueandyellow bird that had somehow escaped the baocian guard captain and taken refuge in the upper cornices some servants from the stable had come over and were making awkward attempts to help one had taken off his tabard and was sweeping it up trying to knock the bird out of the air stop cazaril choked back panic for all he knew the little feathered creature was the last thread by which orico clung to life he directed the wouldbe helpers instead to the task of collecting the bodies of the slain animals laying them out in the stable courtyard and cleaning up the bloody mess on the tiles inside he scooped up a handful of grains from the vellas stall remains of their last interrupted dinner and coaxed the little bird down to his own hand chirping as hed seen umegat do rather to his surprise the bird came to him and suffered itself to be put back into its cage guard it with your life he told the groom then added scowling for effect if it dies you die an empty threat though it must do for now the grooms at least looked impressed if it dies orico dies that suddenly seemed frighteningly plausible he turned to lend a hand in dragging out the heavy bodies of the bears should we skin them lord one of the stable hands inquired staring at the results of teidezs hellish hunt piled up outside on the paving stones no said cazaril even the few of fonsas crows still lingering about the stable yard though they regarded the bloody carcasses with wary interest made no move toward them treat them as you would the royas soldiers who had died in battle burned or buried not skinned nor eaten for the gods sakes swallowing cazaril bent and added the bodies of the two dead crows to the row there has been sacrilege enough this day and the gods forfend teidez had not slain a holy saint as well as the sacred animals a clatter of hooves heralded the arrival of martou dy jironal fetched presumably from jironal palace he was followed up the hill by four retainers on foot gasping for breath the chancellor swung down from his snorting sidling horse handed it off to a bowing groom and advanced to stare at the row of dead animals the bears dark fur riffled in the cold wind the only movement dy jironals lips spasmed on unvoiced curses what is this madness he looked up at cazaril and his eyes narrowed in bewildered suspicion did you set teidez onto this dy jironal was not cazaril judged dissimulating he was as offbalance as cazaril himself i no i do not control teidez cazaril added sourly and neither it appears do you he was in your constant company for the past two weeks had you no hint of this dy jironal shook his head in his defense teidez seems to have had some garbled notion that this act would somehow help the roya that hed no better sense is a fault of his age that he had no better knowledge well you and orico between you have served him ill if hed been more filled with truth hed have had less room for lies ive had his baocian guard locked up and taken him to his chambers to await the royas orders would not be forthcoming now cazaril finished your orders dy jironals hand made a constricted gesture wait the royessehe was closeted with his sister yesterday could she have set him on five witnesses will say no including teidez himself he gave no sign yesterday that this was in his mind almost no sign should have should have should have you control the royesse iselle closely enough snapped dy jironal bitterly do you think i dont know who encouraged her in her defiance i fail to see the secret of her pernicious attachment to you but i mean to cut that connection yes cazaril bared his teeth dy joal tried to wield your knife last night hell know to charge you more for his services next time hazard pay dy jironals eyes glittered with understanding cazaril took a breath for selfcontrol this was bringing their hostilities much too close to the surface the last thing he desired was dy jironals full attention in any case there is no mystery teidez says your amiable brother dondo plotted this with him before he died dy jironal stepped back a pace eyes widening but his teeth clenched on any other reaction cazaril continued now what i should dearly like to know isand you are in a better position to guess the answer than i amdid dondo know what this menagerie really did for orico dy jironals gaze flew to his face do you all the zangre knows by now orico was stricken blind and fell from his chair during the very moments his creatures were dying sara and her ladies brought him to his bed and have sent for the temple physicians this answer both evaded the question and abruptly redirected dy jironals attention the chancellor paled whirled away and made for the zangre gates he did not cazaril noted stay to inquire after umegat clearly dy jironal knew what the menagerie did did he understand how do you cazaril shook his head and turned the other way for yet another weary march down into town cardegosss temple hospital of the mothers mercy was a rambling old converted mansion bequeathed to the order by a pious widow on the street beyond the mothers house from the temple square cazaril tracked palli and umegat through its maze to a secondfloor gallery above an inner courtyard he spotted the chamber readily by the reunited dy gura brothers standing guard outside its closed door they saluted and passed him through he entered to find umegat laid out unconscious upon a bed a whitehaired woman in a temple physicians green robes bent over him stitching up the lacerated flap of his scalp she was assisted by a familiar dumpy middleaged woman whose viridescent tinge owed nothing to her green dress cazaril could still see her faint effulgence with his eyes closed the archdivine of cardegoss himself in his fivecolored vestment hovered anxiously palli leaned against a wall with his arms crossed his face lightened and he pushed to his feet when he saw cazaril how goes it cazaril asked palli in a low voice poor fellows still out cold palli murmured back i think he must have taken a mighty whack and you cazaril repeated the tale of oricos sudden collapse archdivine mendenal stepped closer to listen and the physician glanced over her shoulder had they told you of this turn archdivine cazaril added oh aye i will follow oricos physicians to the zangre as soon as i may if the whitehaired physician wondered why an injured groom should claim more of the archdivines attention than the stricken roya she gave no more sign than a slight lifting of her eyebrows she finished her last neat stitch and dipped a cloth in a basin to wash the crusting gore from the shaved scalp around the wound she dried her hands checked the rolledback eyes under umegats lids and straightened the mothers midwife gathered up umegats cutaway left braid and the rest of the medical mess and made all tidy archdivine mendenal clutched his fingers together and asked the physician well well his skull is not broken that i can feel i shall leave the wound uncovered to better mark bleeding or swelling i can tell nothing more until he wakes theres naught to do now but keep him warm and watch him till he stirs when will that be the physician stared down dubiously at her patient cazaril did too the fastidious umegat would have hated his present crumpled halfshorn desperately limp appearance umegats flesh was still that deathly gray making his golden roknari skin look like a dirty rag his breath rasped not good cazaril had seen men who looked like that go on to recover hed also seen them sink and die i cannot say the physician replied at last echoing cazarils own mental diagnosis leave us then the acolyte will watch him for now yes your reverence the physician bowed and instructed the midwife send for me at once if he either wakes or takes a fever or starts to convulse she gathered up her instruments lord dy palliar i thank you for your aid the archdivine said he added lord cazaril please stay palli said merely youre entirely welcome your reverence then after a heartbeat as the hint penetrated oh ah if youre all right caz for now then i should perhaps return to the daughters house if you need anything at any time send for me there or at yarrin palace and ill tend upon you at once you should not go about alone he gave cazaril a stern look to be sure this was understood as command and not parting pleasantry he too then bowed and opening the door for the physician followed in her wake as the door closed mendenal turned to cazaril his hands outstretched in pleading lord cazaril what should we do cazaril recoiled five gods youre asking me the mans lips twisted ruefully lord cazaril ive only been the archdivine of cardegoss for two years i was chosen because i was a good administrator i fancy and to please my family because my brother and my father before him were powerful provincars i was dedicated to the bastards order at age fourteen with a good dower from my father to assure my care and advancement i have served the gods faithfully all my life but they do not speak to me he stared at cazaril and glanced aside to the mothers midwife with an odd hopeless envy in his eyes devoid of hostility when a pious ordinary man finds himself in a room with three working saintsif he has any wits lefthe seeks instruction he does not feign to instruct i am not cazaril bit back the denial he had more urgent concerns than arguing over the theological definition of his current condition though if this was sainthood the gods must exceed themselves for damnation honorable acolyteim sorry i have forgotten your name i am clara lord cazaril cazaril gave her a little bow acolyte clara do you seedo you not seeumegats glow ive never seen him whenis it supposed to go out when a man is asleep or unconscious she shook her head the gods are with us waking and sleeping lord cazaril im sure i dont have the strength of sight you do but indeed the bastard has withdrawn his presence from learned umegat oh no breathed mendenal are you sure said cazaril it could not be a defect in myin your second sight she glanced at him wincing a little no for i can see you plainly enough i could see you before you came in the door it is almost painful to be in the same room with you does this mean the miracle of the menagerie is broken asked mendenal anxiously gesturing at the unconscious groom we have no dike now against the tide of this black curse she hesitated umegat no longer hosts the miracle i do not know if the bastard has transferred it to anothers will mendenal wheeled to stare hopefully at cazaril his perhaps she frowned at cazaril absently holding her hand to her brow as if to shade her eyes if i am a saint as learned umegat has named me i am only a small domestic one if umegats tutelage had not sharpened my perceptions over the years i should merely have thought myself unusually lucky in my profession luck cazaril couldnt help reflecting had not been his most salient experience since hed stumbled into the gods maze and yet the mother only reaches through me from time to time then passes on lord cazaril blazes from the day i first saw him at lord dondos funeral the white light of the bastard and the blue clarity of the lady of spring both at once the constant living presence of two gods all mixed with some other dark thing i cannot make out umegat could see more clearly if the bastard has added more to the roil already there i cannot tell the archdivine touched brow lips navel groin and heart fingers spread wide and stared hungrily at cazaril two gods two gods at once and in this room cazaril bent forward hands clenching hideously reminded by the pressure of his belt of the terrifying distention beneath it did umegat not make known to you what i did to lord dondo did you not talk to rojeras yes yes and i spoke to rojeras too good man but of course he could not understand he understood better than you seem to i bear death and murder in my gut an abomination for all i know taking physical and not just psychic form engendered by a demon and dondo dy jironals accursed ghost which screams at me nightly by the way in dondos voice with all his vilest vocabulary and dondo had a mouth like the cardegoss main sewer with no way out but to tear me open it is not holy it is disgusting mendenal stepped back blinking cazaril clutched his head i have terrible dreams and pains in my belly and rages and im afraid dondo is leaking oh dear said mendenal faintly i had no idea lord cazaril umegat said only that you were skittish and it was best to leave you in his hands skittish cazaril repeated hollowly and oh did i mention the ghosts it was surely a measure of something that they seemed the least of his worries ghosts all the ghosts of the zangre follow me about the castle and cluster around my bed at night oh said mendenal looking suddenly worried ah ah did umegat warn you about the ghosts no he said they could do me no harm well yes and no they can do you no harm while you live but as umegat explained it to me the ladys miracle has delayed the working out of the bastards miracle not reversed it it follows that hm should her hand open and the demon fly away with your souland dondos of courseit will leave your husk with a certain um dangerous theological emptiness which is not quite like natural death and the ghosts of the excluded damned will attempt to er move in after a short fraught silence cazaril inquired do they ever succeed sometimes i saw a case once when i was a young divine the degraded spirits are shambling stupid things but its so very awkward to get them out again once they take possession they must be burned well alive is not quite the right term very ugly scene especially if the relatives dont understand because of course being your body it screams in your voice it would not in the event be your problem of course you would be um elsewhere by then but it might save hm others some painful troubles if you make sure you always have someone by you who would understand the necessity of burning your body before sunset mendenal trailed off apologetically thank you your reverence said cazaril with awful politeness i shall add that to rojerass theory of the demon growing itself a new body in my tumor and gnawing its way out should i ever again be in danger of getting a nights sleep although i suppose theres no reason both could not occur sequentially mendenal cleared his throat sorry my lord i thought you should know cazaril sighed yes i suppose i should he looked up remembering last nights scene with dy joal is it possible suppose the ladys grip loosened just a little is it possible for dondos soul to leak into mine mendenals brows rose i dont umegat would know oh how i wish he would wake up i suppose it would be a faster way for dondos ghost to get a body than to grow one in a tumor you would think it would be too small he made an uncertain measuring gesture with his hands not according to rojeras said cazaril dryly mendenal rubbed his forehead ah poor rojeras he thought i had taken a sudden interest in his specialty when i asked about you and of course i did not correct his misapprehension i thought he was going to talk for half the night i finally had to promise him a purse for his ward to escape the tour of his collection id pay money to escape that too cazaril allowed after a moment he asked curiously your reverence why was i not arrested for dondos murder how did umegat finesse that murder there was no murder excuse me the man is dead and by my hand by death magic which is a capital crime oh yes i see the ignorant are full of errors about death magic well even the name is wrong its a nice theological point dyou see attempting death magic is a crime of intent of conspiracy successful death magic is not death magic at all but a miracle of justice and cannot be a crime because it is the hand of the god that carries off the victimvictimsi mean its not as if the roya can send his officers to arrest the bastard eh do you think the present chancellor of chalion will appreciate the distinction ah no which is why umegat advised that the temple prefer a discreet approach to this this very complicated issue mendenal scratched his cheek in new worry not that the supplicant of such justice has ever lived through it before the distinction was clearer when it was all theoretical two miracles i never thought of two miracles unprecedented the lady of spring must love you dearly as a teamster loves his mule that carries his baggage said cazaril bitterly whipping it over the high passes the archdivine looked a little distraught only acolyte claras lips twisted in appreciation umegat would have snorted cazaril thought he began to understand why the roknari saint had been so fond of talking shop with him only the saints would joke so about the gods because it was either joke or scream and they alone knew it was all the same to the gods yes but said mendenal umegat concurredso extraordinary a preservation must surely be for an extraordinary purpose have you have you no guess at all archdivine i know naught cazarils voice shook and i am he broke off yes encouraged mendenal if i say it aloud i will fall to pieces right here he licked his lips and swallowed when he forced the words from his tongue at last they came out a hoarse whisper i am very frightened oh said the archdivine after a long moment ah yes i i see that it would be oh if only umegat would wake up the mothers midwife cleared her throat diffidently my lord dy cazaril yes acolyte clara i think i have a message for you what the mother spoke to me in a dream last night i was not altogether sure for my sleeping brain spins fancies out of whatever is common in my thoughts and i think often of her so i had meant to take it to umegat today and be guided by his good advice but she said to me she saidclara took a breath and steadied her voice her expression growing calmer tell my daughters faithful courier to beware despair above all yes said cazaril after a moment and blast it if the gods were going to trouble to send him messages in other peoples dreams hed prefer something less cryptic and more practical that was all are you sure asked mendenal well she might have said her daughters faithful courtier or castlewarder or captain or all four of themthat parts blurred in my memory if it is so who are the other three men asked mendenal puzzled the unknowing echo of the provincaras words to him in valenda chilled cazaril to the pit of his aching belly i i am archdivine i am he bowed to the acolyte and said through stiff lips thank you clara pray to your lady for me she gave him a silent understanding smile and a little nod leaving the mothers acolyte to keep close watch over umegat the archdivine excused himself to go attend upon roya orico and with a shy diffidence invited cazaril to accompany him to the zangre gates cazaril found himself grateful for the offer and followed him out his earlier towering rage and terror had long since passed leaving him limp and weak his knees buckled on the gallery stairs but for catching the railing he would have tumbled down half a flight to his embarrassment the solicitous mendenal insisted cazaril be carried up the hill in his own sedan chair hoisted by four stout dedicats with mendenal walking beside cazaril felt a fool and conspicuous but he had to admit vastly obliged the interview cazaril had been dreading did not take place until after supper summoned by a page he climbed reluctantly to the royesses sitting room iselle looking strained awaited him attended by betriz the royesse waved him to a stool candles burning brightly in all the mirrored wall sconces did not drive away the shadow that clung about her how does orico go on he asked the ladies anxiously they had neither of them come to supper in the banqueting hall instead remaining with the royina and the stricken roya above stairs betriz answered he seemed calmer this evening when he found he was not completely blindhe can see a candle flame with his right eye but he is not passing water properly and his physician thinks he is in danger of growing dropsical he does look terribly swollen she bit her lip in worry cazaril ducked his head at the royesse and were you able to see teidez iselle sighed yes right after chancellor dy jironal dressed him down he was too distraught to be sensible if he were younger i would name it one of his tantrums im sorry he is grown too big to slap he takes no food and throws things at his servants and now hes freed from his chambers is refusing to come out theres nothing to do when he gets like this but to leave him alone hell be better tomorrow her eyes narrowed at cazaril and her lips compressed and so my lord just how long have you known of this black curse that hangs over orico sara finally talked to you did she yes what exactly did she say iselle gave a tolerably accurate summation of the story of fonsa and the golden general and the descent of the legacy of ill fortune through ias to orico she did not mention herself or teidez cazaril chewed on a knuckle you have about half the facts then i do not like this half portion cazaril the world demands i make good choices on no information and then blames my maidenhood for my mistakes as if my maidenhood were responsible for my ignorance ignorance is not stupidity but it might as well be and i do not like feeling stupid steel rang in these last words unmistakably he bowed his head in apology he wanted to weep for what he was about to lose it was not to shield her maiden innocence nor betrizs that he had kept silent for too long nor even dread of arrest he had feared to lose the paradise of their regard been sickened with the horror of becoming hideous in their eyes coward speak and be done i first learned of the curse the night after dondos death from the groom umegatwho is no groom by the way but a divine of the bastard and the saint who hosted the miracle of the menagerie for orico betrizs eyes widened oh i i liked him how does he go on cazaril made a little balancing gesture with one hand badly still unconscious and worse heshe swallowed here we gostopped glowing stopped glowing said iselle i didnt know hed started yes i know you cannot see it theres something i havent told you about dondos murder he took a breath it was me who sacrificed crow and rat and prayed to the bastard for dondos death ah id suspected as much said betriz sitting straighter yes butwhat you dont know is i was granted it i should have died that night in fonsas tower but anothers prayers intervened iselles i think he nodded to the royesse her lips parted and her hand went to her breast i prayed that the daughter spare me from dondo you prayedand the daughter spared me he added ruefully but not as it turned out from dondo you saw how at his funeral all the gods refused to sign that his soul was taken up yes and so he was excluded damned trapped in this world said iselle half the court feared he was loose in cardegoss and festooned themselves with charms against him in cardegoss yes loose no most lost ghosts are bound to the place where they died dondos is bound to the person who killed him he shut his eyes unable to bear looking at their draining faces you know my tumor its not a tumor or not only a tumor dondos soul is trapped inside of me along with the death demon apparently but the demon at least is blessedly quiet about it all its dondo who wont shut up he screams at me at night anyway he opened his eyes again though he still did not dare look up all this divine activity has given me a sort of second sight umegat has itthere is a little saint of the mother in town who has itand i have it umegat hashada white glow the mother clara shines a faint green they have both told me i am mostly blue and white all roiling and blazing at last he forced himself to look up and meet iselles eyes and i can see oricos curse as a dark shadow iselle listen this is important i dont think sara knows this its not just a shadow on orico its on you and teidez too all the descendants of fonsa seem to be smeared by this black thing after a little silence sitting stiff and still iselle said only that makes a sort of sense betriz was eyeing him sideways by the testimony of his belt his tumor was not grown more gross than before but her gaze made him feel monstrous he bent a little over his belly and managed a weak unfelt grin in her direction but how do you get rid of this haunting betriz asked slowly um as i understand it if i am killed my soul will lose its anchor in my body and the death demon will be released to finish its job i think im a little afraid the demon will try to trick or betray me to my death if it can it seems a trifle singleminded it wants to go home or if the ladys hand opens the demon will be released and wrench my soul from my body and off we all go together again the same he decided not to burden her with rojerass other theory no lord caz you dont understand i want to know how you can get rid of it without dying id like to know that too cazaril sighed with an effort he straightened his spine and managed a better smile it doesnt matter i traded my life for dondos death of my own free will and ive received my due payment of my debt is merely delayed not rescinded the lady apparently keeps me alive for some service i have yet to perform or else i would slay myself in disgust and end it iselle eyes narrowing at this sat up and said sharply well i do not release you from my service do you hear me cazaril his smile grew more genuine for an instant ah yes said betriz and you cant expect us to get all squeamish just because youre inhabited i mean were expected to share our bodies someday doesnt make us horrible does it she hesitated at where this metaphor was taking her cazaril whose mind had been shying from just that parallel for some time said mildly yes but with dondo you both drew the line at dondo in truth every man hed ever killed had traveled back up the shock of his sword arm into his memory and rode with him still in a sense and so we bear our sins iselle put her hand to her lips in sudden alarm cazarilhe cant get out can he i pray to the lady he may not the idea of him seeping into my mind is is the worst of all worse even than never mind oh that reminds me i should warn you about the ghosts briefly he repeated what the archdivine had told him about making sure his body was burned and why it afforded him an odd relief to have that out they were dismayed but attentive he thought he might trust them to have the courage for the task and then was ashamed to have not trusted their courage earlier but listen royesse he went on the golden generals curse has followed fonsas get but sara is shadowed too umegat and i both think she married into it her life has certainly been made miserable enough by it agreed iselle it therefore follows logically that you might marry out of it it is a hope anyway a great hope i think we should turn our minds to the matteri would have you out of cardegoss out of the curse out of chalion altogether as soon as may be arranged with the court in this uproar marriage arrangements are out of iselle paused abruptly but what about teidez and orico and chalion itself am i to abandon them like a general running away from a losing battle the highest commanders have wider responsibilities than a single battle if a battle may not be wonif the general cannot save that day at least such a retreat saves the good of another day she frowned doubtfully taking this in her brows lowered cazaril do you think my mother and grandmother knew of this dark thing that hangs over us your grandmother i dont know your mother if ista had seen the ghosts of the zangre for herself she must have been lent the second sight for a time what did this imply cazarils imagination foundered your mother knew something but i dont know how much enough to be terrified when you were called to cardegoss anyway id thought her overfussy iselles voice lowered id thought her mad as the servants whispered her frown deepened i have a lot to think about as her silence lengthened cazaril rose and bade both ladies a polite good night the royesse acknowledged him with an absent nod betriz clasped her hands together staring at him in agonized searching and dipped a half curtsey wait iselle called suddenly as he reached the door he wheeled around she sprang from her chair strode up to him and gripped both his hands you are too tall bend your head she commanded obligingly he ducked his head she stood on tiptoe he blinked in surprise as her young lips planted a firm and formal kiss upon his brow and then upon the back of each hand lifted to her mouth and then she sank to the floor in a rustle of perfumed silk and as his mouth opened in inarticulate protest she kissed each booted foot with the same unhesitating firmness there said iselle rising her chin came up now you may be dismissed tears were running down betrizs face too shaken for words cazaril bowed deeply and fled to his unquiet bed cazaril found the zangre eerily quiet the following day after dondos death the court had been alarmed yes but excited and given over to gossip and whispering now even the whispering was stilled all who had no direct duties stayed away and those who had inescapable tasks went about them in a hurried apprehensive silence iselle and betriz spent the day in iass tower waiting upon sara and orico at dawn cazaril and the grim castle warder oversaw the cremation and burial of the remains of the animals for the rest of the day cazaril alternated feeble attempts to attend to the mess on his desk with trudges down to the temple hospital umegat lay unchanged gray and rasping after his second visit cazaril stopped in at the temple itself and prayed prostrate and whispering before all five altars in turn if he was in truth infected with this saintdisease dammit shouldnt it be good for something the gods do not grant miracles for our purposes but for theirs umegat had said yes it seemed to cazaril that this bargain ought to run two ways if people stopped lending the gods their wills by which to do miracles eh what would the gods do about it then well the first thing to happen would be that id drop dead there was that cazaril lay a long time before the altar of the lady of spring but here found himself mute not even his lips moving abashed ashamed despairing but wordy or wordless the gods returned him only the same blank silence five times over he was reminded of pallis insistence that he not go about alone when slogging back up the hill he passed dy joal and another of dy jironals retainers entering jironal palace dy joals hand curled on his sword hilt but he did not draw with polite wary nods they walked wide about each other back in his office cazaril rubbed his aching brow and turned his thoughts to iselles marriage royse bergon of ibra eh the boy would do as well as any and better than most cazaril supposed but this turmoil in the court of chalion made open negotiations impossible to carry out it would have to be a secret envoy and soon running down the list in his mind of courtiers capable of such a diplomatic mission turned up none cazaril would trust running down the much shorter list of men he could trust turned up no experienced diplomats umegat was laid low the archdivine could not leave in secret palli march dy palliar had the rank at least to demand ibras respect he tried to imagine honest palli negotiating the subtleties of iselles marriage contract with the fox of ibra and groaned maybe maybe if palli were sent with an extremely detailed and explicit list of instructions needs must drive he would broach it to palli tomorrow cazaril prayed on his knees before bed to be spared from the nightmare that had recurred three nights running where dondo grew back to life size within his swelling stomach and then somehow dressed in his funeral robes and armed with his sword carved his way out perhaps the lady heard his plea at any rate he woke at dawn his head and heart pounding from a new nightmare in this one dondo somehow sucked cazarils soul into his own belly in his place and escaped to take over cazarils body and then embarked on a career of rapine in the womens quarters while cazaril helpless to stop him watched to his dismay as he panted in the gray light and regained his grip on reality cazaril realized his body was painfully aroused so was dondo plunged into a lightless prison sealed from sound deprived of sensation or did he ride along as the ultimate spy and voyeur cazaril had not imagined making love to beto any lady since this damned affliction had been visited upon him he imagined it now a crowded quartet between the sheets and shuddered briefly cazaril envisioned escaping by the window he might squeeze his shoulders through and dive the drop would be stupendous the crunch at the end quick or with his knife taken to wrists or throat or belly or all three he sat up blinking to find a half a dozen phantasms gathered avidly around him crowding each other like vultures around a dead horse he hissed lurched and swiped his arm through the air to scatter them could a body with its head smashed in be animated by one of them the archdivines words implied so escape through suicide was blocked by this ghastly patrol it seemed dreading sleep he stumbled from bed and went to wash and dress coming back from a perfunctory breakfast in the banqueting hall cazaril encountered a breathless nan dy vrit upon the stairs my lady begs you tend upon her at once nan told him and cazaril nodded and pushed up the steps not in her chambers nan added as he started past the third floor in royse teidezs oh cazarils brows rose and he turned instead to pass his own chamber and go down the hall to teidezs nan at his heels as he entered the office antechamber twin to iselles above he heard voices from the rooms opening beyond iselles murmur and teidezs raised i dont want anything to eat i dont want to see anyone go away the sitting room was cluttered with weapons clothes and gifts strewn about haphazardly cazaril picked his way across to the bedchamber teidez lay back on his pillows still in his nightgown the close moist air of the room smelled of boy sweat and another tang teidezs secretarytutor hovered anxiously on one side of the bed iselle stood with her hands on her hips on the other teidez said i want to go back to sleep get out he glanced up at cazaril cringed and pointed i especially dont want him in here nan dy vrit said in a very domestic voice now none of that young lord you know better than to talk to old nan that way teidez cowed by some ancient habit went from surly to whiney i have a headache iselle said firmly nan bring a light cazaril i want you to look at teidezs leg it looks very odd to me nan held a brace of candles high supplementing the wan gray daylight from the window teidez at first clutched his blankets to his chest but didnt quite dare fight his older sisters glare she twitched them out of his hands and folded them aside three scabbed parallel grooves ran in a spiral partway around the boys right leg in themselves they did not appear deep or dangerous but the flesh around them was so swollen that the skin was shiny and silvery translucent pink drainage and yellow pus oozed from their edges cazaril forced himself to keep his expression even as he studied the hot red streaks climbing past the boys knee and winding up the inside of his thigh teidezs eyes were glazed he jerked back his head as cazaril reached for him dont touch me be still cazaril commanded in a low voice teidezs forehead beneath cazarils wrist was scorching he glanced up at the sallowfaced secretary watching with a frown how long has he been feverish just this morning i believe when did his physician last see this he would not have a physician lord cazaril he threw a chair at me when i tried to help him and bandaged it himself and you let him cazarils voice made the secretary jump the man shrugged uneasily he would have it so teidez grumbled some people obey me ill remember who too later he glowered up at cazaril through halflowered lashes and stuck out his lower lip at his sister hes taken an infection ill see that a temple physician is sent in to him at once teidez disgruntled wriggled back down under his covers can i go back to sleep now if you dont mind and draw the curtain the light hurts my eyes yes stay abed cazaril told him and withdrew iselle followed him into the antechamber lowering her voice its not right is it no its not good observation royesse your judgment was correct she gave him a satisfied nod and he bowed himself out and made for the end stairs by nan dy vrits shadowed face she at least understood just how notright it was all cazaril could think of as he hastened down the stairs and back across the stones of the courtyard toward iass tower was how very seldom hed seen any man no matter how young or strong survive an amputation that high upon the thigh his stride lengthened by good luck cazaril found dy jironal at once in the chancellery he was just sealing a saddlebag and dispatching a courier with it how are the roads dy jironal asked the fellow who was typically lean and wiry and wore the chancellerys tabard over an odd assortment of winter woolens muddy mlord it will be dangerous to ride after dark well do your best dy jironal sighed and clapped him on the shoulder the man saluted and made his way out past cazaril dy jironal scowled at his new visitor cazaril my lord cazaril offered a fractional bow and entered dy jironal seated himself on the edge of his desk and folded his arms your attempt to hide behind the daughters order in its plot to unseat me is doomed to fail you know he said conversationally i intend to see that its failure will be miserable impatiently cazaril waved this aside hed have been more surprised had dy jironal not had an ear in the orders councils you have much worse troubles this morning than anything i can offer you my lord dy jironals eyes widened in surprise his head tilted in an attitude of sudden attention oh what did teidezs wound look like when you saw it what wound he showed me no wound on his right leghe was scratched by oricos leopard apparently while he was killing the poor beast in truth the marks didnt look deep but theyve taken an infection his skin burns and you know how a poisoned wound sometimes throws out feverish marks upon the skin aye said dy jironal uneasily teidezs run from ankle to groin they look like a bloody conflagration dy jironal swore i advise you pull that troop of useless physicians off of orico for a moment and send them across to teidezs chambers or you could lose two royal puppets in one week dy jironals glare met cazarils like flint on steel but after one fierce inhalation he nodded and shifted to his feet cazaril followed him out corrupted with greed and familial pride dy jironal might be but he wasnt incompetent cazaril could see why orico might have chosen to endure much in exchange for that after assuring himself that dy jironal was climbing the stairs to oricos chambers with due haste cazaril turned back down them hed had no word from the temple hospital since last night he wanted to check again on umegat he made his way out the zangre gates past the illfated stable block a little to his surprise he spotted umegats tongueless undergroom climbing the hill toward him the man waved his thumbless hand when he saw cazaril and hurried his step he arrived breathless and smiling his face was marked with livid bruises redpurple around one eye from the futile fight in the menagerie and his broken nose was still swollen its lacerated edge dark and scabbed but his eyes were shining in their wrecked matrix he almost danced up to cazaril cazarils brows rose you look happywhat man is umegat awake he nodded vigorously cazaril grinned back at him faint with relief he spoke a mumbled sort of gargle of which cazaril made out perhaps one word in four but enough to gather he was on some urgent errand he motioned cazaril to wait outside the silent dark menagerie and returned in a few minutes with a sack tied to his belt and clutching a book which he brandished happily by which cazaril understood umegat was not only awake but well enough to want his favorite bookordol cazaril noted with bemusement glad of the stout little mans company cazaril walked beside him down into town cazaril reflected on the fellows stigmata of martyrdom displayed with such seeming indifference it was silent testimony of horrendous torment endured in the name of his god had his terror lasted an hour a day months it was not quite possible to be sure whether the softened roundness of his appearance was the result of castration or just old age cazaril couldnt very well ask him his story just attempting to listen to his badly mouthed ordinary exchanges was a painful strain upon the ears and attention he didnt even know if the fellow was chalionese or ibran brajaran or roknari or how he had come to cardegoss or how long he had served with umegat doing his daily duties as they came to him he stumped along now with the book under his arm eyes bright so this was what a faithful servant of the gods heroic and beloved ended up looking like they arrived at umegats chamber to find him sitting up in bed against some pillows he was pale and washedout his prickly scalp puckered along its stitches remaining hair a tumbled rats nest lips crusted his face unshaved the tongueless groom rummaged in his sack pulled out some shaving gear and waved it triumphantly in the air umegat smiled wanly he stared at cazaril not lifting his head from the pillow he rubbed his eyes and squinted uncertainly cazaril swallowed how do you feel headache umegat managed he snorted softly finally he said are all my beautiful creatures dead his tongue was thick his voice low and a little slurred but he seemed coherent enough nearly all there was one little blueandyellow bird got away its back safely in its cage now i let no one make trophies of them i saw them cremated like fallen soldiers yesterday archdivine mendenal has undertaken to find their ashes a place of honor umegat nodded then winced his crusted lips tightened cazaril glanced at the undergroomyes this man had to be one of those who knew the truthand back to umegat and said hesitantly do you know youve stopped glowing umegat blinked rapidly at him i suspected it at least you are much less disturbing to look upon this way your second sight is taken from you mm second sight is redundant to reason anyway you live therefore i know perfectly well the ladys hand still grips you he added after a moment i always knew it was only lent to me for a time well it was quite a ride while it lasted his voice fell to a whisper quite a ride he turned his face away i could have borne it being taken back to have it knocked from my hands i should have seen it coming the gods should have warned you the little elderly undergroom whose face had drooped at the pain in umegats voice picked up the book and held it out consolingly umegat smiled weakly and took it tenderly from him at least i have my old profession to fall back on eh his hands smoothed the pages open to some familiar spot and he glanced down his smile faded his voice sharpened is this a joke is what a joke umegat it is your book i saw him bring it from the menagerie umegat struggled awkwardly to sit upright what language is this cazaril advanced and glanced over his shoulder ibran of course umegat paged through the book fingers shaking his eyes twitching over the pages his breath coming faster through lips open in something like terror it is it is gibberish its just just little blotches of ink cazaril it is ibran umegat its just ibran it is my eyes it is something in me he clutched his face rubbed his eyes and cried suddenly oh gods and burst into tears the tears became wracking sobs on the third breath i am punished get the physician fetch the physician cazaril cried to the frightenedlooking undergroom and the man nodded and sped away umegats clutching fingers were tearing the pages in his blind grip awkwardly cazaril tried to help him patting his shoulder straightening the book and then taking it away altogether the coolly resisted breakdown having breached umegats walls in this unguarded spot poured through and the man weptnot like a child no childs sobs were ever this terrifying after agonizing minutes the whitehaired physician arrived and soothed the distraught divine he seized upon her in hope and would scarcely let her hands go free to carry out her business her explanation that many men and women taken with a palsystroke improved in a few days people carried in by anxious relatives even walking out on their own a few days later did the most to help him regain his shattered selfcontrol it took all his strength of mind for her further tests conducted after sending a passing dedicat running to the orders library revealed he could not read roknari nor darthacan either and furthermore his hands had lost the ability to wield a pen to make any kind of letters the quill fell from his awkward grip trailing ink across the linens and he buried his face in his hands groaning again i am punished my joy and my refuge taken from me sometimes people can relearn things they have forgotten the physician said tentatively and your understanding of the words in your ears has not been taken nor your recognition of the people you know i have seen that happen with some afflicted people someone could still read books aloud to you umegats eyes met those of the tongueless groom who was standing to one side still holding the ordol the old man scrubbed his fist across his mouth and made an odd noise down in his throat a whimper of pure despair tears were running from the corners of his eyes down his seamed face umegats breath puffed from his lips and he shook his head drawn from his trouble by its reflection in that aged face he reached across to grip the undergrooms hand sh sh arent we a pair now he sighed and sank back on his pillows never say the bastard has no sense of humor after a moment his eyes closed exhausted or shutting it all out cazaril was not sure which he choked down his own terrified demand of umegat what should we do now umegat was in no condition to do anything even give direction even pray cazaril hardly dared ask him to pray for teidez under the circumstances umegats breath thickened and he dropped into an uneasy doze softly careful to make no sound the undergroom laid out his shaving gear on a side table and sat patiently to await his wakening again the physician made notes and left quietly cazaril followed her out to the gallery overlooking the courtyard its central fountain was not playing in this chill and the water in it was dark and scummy in the gray winter light is he punished he asked her she rubbed the back of her neck in a weary gesture how do i know head injuries are the strangest of all i once saw a woman whose eyes appeared wholly undamaged go blind from a blow to the back of her head ive seen people lose speech lose control of half their body but not the other half are they punished if so the gods are evil and that i do not believe i think it is chance i think the gods load the dice he wanted to urge her to take good care of umegat but clearly she already was doing so and he didnt want to sound frantic or as though he doubted her skill or dedication he bade her a polite good morning instead and took himself off to track down the archdivine and apprise him of the ugly turn of teidezs wound he found archdivine mendenal in the temple at the mothers altar celebrating a ceremony of blessing upon a rich leather merchants wife and newborn daughter cazaril perforce waited until the family had laid their thanksgiving offerings and filed out again before approaching him and murmuring his news mendenal turned pale and hurried off to the zangre at once cazaril had developed unsettling new views of the efficacy and safety of prayer but laid himself down on the cold pavement before the mothers altar anyway thinking of ista if there was little hope of mercy for teidezs own sake lured into violent sacrilege and left there by dondo surely the mother might spare some pity for his mother ista the goddesss message to him via her acolytes dream the other day had sounded merciful in a way though it might prove to be merely brutally practical prone on the polished patterned slates he could feel the lethal lump in his belly an uncomfortable mass seeming the size of his doubled fists he rose at length and sought out palli at provincar dy yarrins narrow old stone palace cazaril was conducted by a servant to a guest chamber at the back of the house palli was seated at a small table writing in a ledger but laid his quill aside when cazaril entered and motioned his visitor to a chair across from him as soon as the servant had shut the door behind him cazaril leaned forward and said palli could you at need ride courier to ibra in secret for the royesse iselle pallis brows climbed when soon he shook his head if by soon you mean now i think not i am much taken up with my duties as a lord dedicati have promised dy yarrin my voice and my vote in the council you could leave a proxy with dy yarrin or some other trusted comrade palli rubbed his shaven chin and vented a dubious hm cazaril considered claiming to be a saint of the daughter and pulling rank on palli dy yarrin and their entire military order it would require complicated explanations it would require divulging the secret of fonsas curse it would entail not merely admitting but asserting his peculiar disorder godtouched godravished and sounding as mad or madder than ista ever had he compromised i think this may be the daughters business pallis lips screwed up how can you tell i just can well i cant wait i know before you go to sleep tonight pray for guidance me why dont you my nights are full and since when did you believe in prophetic dreams i thought you always claimed it was nonsense people fooling themselves or pretending to an importance they could otherwise never claim its a recent conversion look palli just do it for for the experiment to please me if you will palli made a surrendering gesture for you yes for the rest of it his black brows lowered ibra just who would i be riding in secret from dy jironal mostly oh dy yarrin might be interested in that something in it for him not in any direct way i dont think cazaril added reluctantly and likewise secret from orico palli sat back his head tilting his voice lowered coy caz just what kind of noose are you offering to put round my neck here is this treason worse cazaril sighed theology eh oh that reminds me cazaril pinched the bridge of his nose trying to decide if his headache was getting worse tell dy yarrin his councils are being reported by some spy to dy jironal though he may be canny enough to realize it already i dont know worse and worse are you getting enough sleep caz a bark of bitter laughter broke from cazarils lips no you always did go strangely fey when you were overtired yknow well im not riding anywhere on the basis of a bunch of dark hints in the event youd be given full knowledge when i am given full knowledge then ill decide fair enough cazaril sighed i will discuss it with the royesse but i didnt want to propose to her a man who would fail her hey said palli indignantly when have i failed never palli thats why i thought of you cazaril grinned and with a little grunt of pain pushed to his feet i must return to the zangre briefly he described the unpleasant progression of teidezs claw mark pallis face grew very sober indeed just how bad is it i dont caution tempered cazarils frankness teidez is young strong well fed i see no reason why he cannot throw off this infection five gods caz hes the hope of his house what will chalion do if he doesnt and orico laid low as well cazaril hesitated orico hasnt been well for some time but im sure dy jironal never imagined them both becoming so sick at once you might note to dy yarrin that our dear chancellor is going to be fairly distracted for the next few days if the lord dedicats want to get past him to oricos bed and get anything signed now might be their best chance he extracted himself from pallis cascade of second thoughts although not from pallis insistence that he take the dy gura brothers for escort climbing the hill once more his circling calculations of how to effect iselles escape from the wreck of her cursed house spiraled inward on a much simpler grim determination not to fall down in front of these earnest young men to be hauled home stumbling with his arms across their shoulders cazaril found the thirdfloor corridor of the main block promisingly crowded upon his return greenrobed physicians and their acolyte assistants scurried in and out servants hurried with water linens blankets strange drinks in silver ewers as cazaril lingered wondering what assistance he might offer the archdivine emerged from the antechamber and started down the corridor his face set and introspective your reverence cazaril touched his fivecolored sleeve in passing how goes the boy ah lord cazaril mendenal turned aside briefly the chancellor and the royesse have given me purses for prayers on his behalf i go to set them in motion do you think prayers will do any good do you think any prayers will do good prayer is always good no its not cazaril wanted to reply but held his tongue mendenal added suggestively lowering his voice yours might be especially efficacious at this time not so far as cazaril had noticed your reverence i do not hate any man in this world enough to inflict the results of my prayers upon him ah said mendenal uneasily he managed a smile and took polite leave royesse iselle stepped into the corridor and glanced up and down it she spied cazaril and motioned him to her he bowed royesse she too lowered her voice everyone here seemed to speak in hushed tones there is talk of an amputation can youwould you be willingto help hold him down if it chances so i think you are familiar with the procedure indeed royesse cazaril swallowed nightmare memories of bad moments in field hospitals flitted through his mind he had never been able to decide if the men who tried to take it bravely or the men whose minds broke in terror were the hardest for their helpers to endure better by far the men who were unconscious to start with tell the physicians i am at their service and lord teidezs cazaril could hear from the antechamber where he leaned against the wall to wait just when the proposal was floated to teidez the boy was going to be of the second category it seemed he cried and bellowed that he would not be made a cripple by traitors and idiots and threw things his rising hysteria was only calmed when a second physician opined that the infection was not gangrene after allcazarils nose agreedbut rather blood poisoning and that amputation would do more harm than good now treatment was reduced to a mere lancing although from teidezs yells and struggles it might as well have been an amputation despite the draining of the wound teidezs fever soared servants brought buckets of cold water to make him a bath in a copper tub in the sitting room then the physicians had to wrestle him into it between physicians acolytes and servants they seemed to have enough hands for these practical tasks and cazaril withdrew for a time to his own office on the floor above there he diverted his mind by writing tart letters to those town councils late with their royally mandated payments to the royesses household which was all of them they had sent letters of excuse claiming poor crops banditry plague evil weather and cheating tax gatherers six towns worth of troubles cazaril wondered if orico had pulled a fast one with his betrothal gift and dumped the six worst towns on his rent rolls onto his sister and dondo or whether all of chalion was in such disarray iselle and betriz came in looking weary and strained my brother is more ill than i have ever seen him iselle confided to cazaril we are going to set up my private altar and pray before dinner im wondering if we should perhaps fast as well i think what may be needed here are not others prayers but teidezs himself and not for health but for forgiveness iselle shook her head he refuses to pray at all he says its not his fault but dondos which is certainly true up to a point he cries he never intended to hurt orico and they are slanderers who say so is anyone saying so betriz put in no one says it to the royesses face but there are strange rumors among the servants nan says iselles frown deepened cazaril could it be cazaril leaned his elbows on his table and rubbed the ache between his brows i think not on teidezs part i believe him when he says it was dondos idea dondo now of him i would believe anything think it through from his point of view he marries teidezs sister then arranges for teidez to ascend the throne while still a minor he knew from watching his brother martou just how much power a man may wield sitting in a royas pocket grant you i dont know how he intended to rid himself of martou but i am certain dondo meant to be the next chancellor perhaps regent of chalion maybe even roya of chalion depending on what evil chances he could arrange for teidez iselle caught her lower lip in her teeth and here i thought you had only saved me she touched cazaril briefly on the shoulder and passed on into her chambers cazaril accompanied iselle and betriz on their predinner visit to orico orico though no better was no worse they found him arrayed in fresh linens sitting up in bed and being read to by sara the roya spoke hopefully of an improvement in his right eye for he thought he could now see shapes moving cazaril thought the physicians diagnosis of dropsy all too likely for oricos gross flesh was swollen even more grossly the royas thumbprint placed upon the tight fat of his face stayed pale and visible for a long time iselle downplayed the alarming reports of teidezs infection to orico but in the antechamber on the way out spoke frankly to sara saras lips tightened she made little comment to teidezs sister but cazaril thought that here at least was one who did not pray for the bewildered brutal boy after supper teidezs fever rose even higher he stopped fighting and complaining and fell into lassitude a couple of hours before midnight he seemed to fall to sleep iselle and betriz at last left the royses antechamber and climbed to their own rooms for some rest close to midnight unable to sleep for sake of his usual anticipations cazaril again went down the corridor to teidezs chambers the chief physician going to wake the boy to administer some feverreducing syrup freshconcocted and delivered by a panting acolyte found that teidez could not be roused cazaril trudged up the stairs to report this to a sleepy nan dy vrit well theres naught iselle can do about it opined nan shes just dropped off poor girl can we not let her sleep cazaril hesitated then said no so the two tired worried young women dressed themselves again and trooped back down to teidezs crowded sitting room chancellor dy jironal arrived fetched from jironal palace dy jironal frowned at cazaril and bowed to iselle royesse this sickroom is no place for you his sour glance back to cazaril silently added or you iselles eyes narrowed but she replied in a quiet dignified voice none here has a better right or a greater duty after a brief pause she added and i must bear witness on my mothers behalf dy jironal inhaled then apparently thought better of whatever hed been about to say he might profitably save the clash of wills for some other time and place cazaril thought there would be opportunities enough cold compresses failed to lower teidezs fever and needle pricks failed to rouse him his anxious attendants were thrown into a flurry when he had a brief seizure his breathing became even more rasping and labored than the unconscious umegats had been out in the corridor a quintet of cantors one voice from each of the five orders sang prayers their voices blended and echoed a heartbreakingly beautiful background of sound to these dreadful doings the harmonies paused in that moment cazaril realized the labored breathing from the bedchamber beyond had stopped everyone fell silent in the face of that silence one of the several attendant physicians his face drained and wet with tears came to the antechamber and called in dy jironal and iselle for witnesses voices rose and fell very soft and low from teidezs bedchamber for a moment or two both were pale when they came out again dy jironal was pale and shocked even to the last cazaril realized the man had been expecting teidez to pull through and recover iselle was pale and nearly expressionless the black shadow boiled thickly about her every face in the antechamber turned toward her like compass needles swinging the royacy of chalion had a new heiress iselles eyes though reddened with fatigue and grief were dry betriz going to support her dashed tears from the corners of hers it was a little hard to tell which young woman leaned upon the other chancellor dy jironal cleared his throat i will take word of this bereavement to orico belatedly he added allow me to serve you in this royesse yes iselle looked around the chamber a little blindly let all these good people go about their tasks dy jironals brows drew down as though a hundred thoughts flitted behind his eyes and he scarcely knew which to grasp first he glanced at betriz and at cazaril your household your household must be increased to match your new dignity i shall see to it i cannot think about all these things now tomorrow will be soon enough for tonight my lord chancellor please leave me to my sorrow of course royesse dy jironal bowed and made to depart oh iselle added pray do not dispatch any courier to my mother until i can write a letter to include in the doorway dy jironal paused and gave another half bow in acknowledgment certainly as betriz escorted iselle out the royesse murmured to cazaril in passing cazaril tend on me in half an hour i must think cazaril bent his head the crowd of courtiers in the antechamber and sitting room dispersed but for teidezs secretary who stood looking bereft and useless only the acolytes and servants whose task it now was to wash and prepare the royses body remained the stunned and distraught chorus of cantors sang one last prayer this time a threnody for the passage of the dead their voices choked and wavering and then they too turned to make their way out cazaril was not sure if his head or his belly ached more he fled into his own chamber at the end of the hallway shut the door behind him and braced himself for dondos nightly onslaught not his knotting stomach told him to be any further delayed his familiar cramps doubled him over as usual but to his surprise dondo was silent tonight was he too daunted by teidezs death if dondo had intended the boys destruction to follow from oricos he had it nowtoo late to serve any purpose hed pursued in life cazaril did not find the silence a respite his heightened sensitivity to that malevolent presence assured him dondo was still trapped within him hungry angry thinking intelligence had not been a notable characteristic of dondos spewing before now perhaps the shock of his death was passing off leaving what a waiting a stalking dondo had been a competent hunter once it occurred to cazaril that while the demon might seek only to fill its two soulbuckets and return to its master dondo likely did not share that desire the belly of his best enemy was a hateful prison to him but neither the bastards purging hell nor the chilled forgetfulness of a godsrejected ghost was a very satisfactory alternative fate exactly what else might be possible cazaril could scarcely imagine but he was intensely aware that if dondo sought a physical form through which to reenter the world his own was closest to hand one way or another his hands kneaded his belly and he tried to decide for the hundredth time how fast his tumor was really growing the cramps and the wracking quarter hour of terror passed iselles request returned to his mind composing the necessary letter to ista informing her of her sons death would be excruciating little wonder iselle should desire assistance unequal to the task though cazaril felt himself to be whatever she asked of him in her grief and devastation he must undertake to supply he uncurled himself heaved out of bed and climbed the stairs he found iselle already seated at his antechamber desk his best parchment pens and sealing wax laid out before her extra candles were lit all around the chamber driving back the dark upon a square of silk betriz was just laying out and counting over an odd little pile of ornaments brooches rings and the pale glowing heap of dondos rope of pearls that cazaril had not yet had opportunity to deliver to the temple iselle was frowning down at the blank page and turning her seal ring round and round on her thumb she glanced up and said in a low voice good youre here close the door he shut it quietly behind him at your service royesse i pray so cazaril i pray so her eyes searched him betriz said in a worried voice he is so sick iselle are you sure i am sure of nothing but that i have no time left and no other choices she drew a long breath cazaril tomorrow morning i want you to ride to ibra as my envoy to arrange my marriage to royse bergon cazaril blinked laboring to catch up with a baggage train of thought evidently already far down the road chancellor dy jironal will never let me leave of course it cant be openly iselle made an impatient gesture so you will ride first to valenda which is nearly on the way as my personal courier to take the news of my brothers death to my mother dy jironal will agree delighted hell think to see the back of youhell doubtless even lend you a couriers baton by which to commandeer horses from the chancellerys posting houses you know by noon tomorrow hell have stuffed my household with his spies that was very clear but after you stop in valenda youll ride not back to cardegoss but on to zagosur or wherever royse bergon is to be found in the meantime i will insist that teidez be buried in valenda his beloved home teidez couldnt wait to get out of valenda cazaril pointed out beginning to feel dizzy yes well dy jironal doesnt know that does he the chancellor would not let me out of cardegoss and his eye for any other reason but he cannot deny the demands of family piety i will enlist saras support in the project too first thing tomorrow morning you are doubly in mourning now for your brother and his he cannot foist another fiancé upon you for months yet she shook her head an hour ago i became the future of chalion dy jironal must take and keep hold of me if he means to control that future the critical moment is not the beginning of my mourning for teidez but of the beginning of my mourning for orico at which timeand not beforei pass into dy jironals control absolutely unless i am married first once im out of cardegoss i mean not to go back in this weather teidezs cortege could be weeks on the road and if the weather doesnt cooperate ill find other delays by the time you return with royse bergon i should still be safe in valenda wait whatreturn with royse bergon yes of course you must bring him to me think it through if i leave chalion to be wed in ibra dy jironal will declare me in rebellion forcing me to return at the head of a column of foreign troops but if i seize my ground from the very first instant i will never have to wrest it back you taught me that i did she leaned forward growing more intent i will have royse bergon yes but i will not give up chalion to get him no not one yard of soil not to dy jironal and not to the fox either these are my terms bergon and i will each of us inherit our respective crowns to ourselves bergon will hold authority in chalion as royaconsort and i will hold authority in ibra as royinaconsort each through the other reciprocally and equally our future sonthe mother and father willingto inherit and join them into one crown thereafter but my future authority in chalion is to be mine not made over as dowry to my spouse i will not be turned into a sara a mere and disregarded wife silenced in my own councils the fox will be greedy for more her chin came up this is why i must have you as my envoy and no other if you cannot get me royse bergon on terms that do not violate my future sovereignty then turn around and ride home and upon oricos death i will raise my banner against dy jironal myself her mouth set in a grim line her black shadow roiled curse or no curse i will not be martou dy jironals bridled mare to ride to his spurring yesiselle had the nerve the will and the wit to resist dy jironal as orico did not as teidez would never have cazaril could see it in her eyes could see armies with pennoned lances writhing in the black dark hanging around her like a pall of smoke from a burning town this was the form that the curse of her house would take in the next generation not personal sorrow but civil war between royal and noble faction tearing the country apart from end to end unless she could shrug off house and curse both and pass into the protection of bergon i will ride for you royesse good she sat back and swept her hand over the blank parchments now we must make several letters the first shall be your letter of authority to the fox and i think it should be in my own hand youve read and written treaties you must tell me all the right phrases so i do not sound like an ignorant girl ill do my best but am no lawyer iselle she shrugged if we succeed i will have swords to back my words and if we do not no legal niceties will make them stand let them be plain and clear begin a grueling threequarters of an hour of lipbiting concentration resulted in a clean draft which iselle signed with a flourish and sealed with her seal ring betriz meanwhile had finished collecting and inventorying the little pile of coins and jewelry is that all the coin we have asked iselle unfortunately yes sighed betriz well hell just have to pawn the jewelry when he gets to valenda or some other safe place iselle wrapped the silk around the gauds and shoved them across the table to cazaril your purse my lord daughter grant it is enough to get you there and back more than enough if i am not cheated mind you this is to spend not save you are to put on a good show as my representative in ibra remember to dress and royse bergon is to travel in a style befitting his rank and mine and no shame to chalion that could be tricky i mean without the army i will bend my thoughts to it much will depend on well a number of unsettled things which reminds me we must have a secure means of communication dy jironal or his spies will surely be making all efforts to intercept any letters you receive ah there is a very simple cipher that is nonetheless nearly impossible to break it depends upon having two copies of the same printing of some book one goes with me one stays with you two threenumber sequences pick out wordspage number line number and rank in the linewhich the recipient then works backward to find the word again you do not always use the same numberings for the same words but find them on another page if you can there are better ciphers but there is no time to teach them to you i uh have not two of any book though i will find two such books before you leave tomorrow said betriz sturdily thank you cazaril rubbed his forehead it was madness to undertake to ride sick and maybe bleeding over the mountains in midwinter he would fall off his horse into the snows and freeze and he and his horse and his letters of authorization would all be eaten by the wolves iselle my heart is willing but my body is occupied territory halflaid waste i am afraid i will fail in the journey my friend march dy palliar is a good rider and a strong sword arm may i offer him as your envoy instead iselle frowned in thought i think it will be a duel of wits with the fox for the hand of bergon not a duel of steel better to send the wits to ibra and keep the sword in chalion beguiling thought to leave iselle and betriz not unguarded after all but with a strong friend to call upon a friend with friends aye in either case may i bring him into our councils tomorrow iselle glanced across at betriz cazaril did not see any clear signal pass between them but iselle nodded decisively yes bring him to me at the earliest possible instant the royesse pulled another piece of paper toward her and picked up a fresh quill now i shall write a personal letter to the royse bergon which you shall take sealed and pass to him unopened and after thatshe sighedthe letter to my mother i think you cannot help me with either of these go get some sleep while you can dismissed he rose and bowed as he reached the door she added softly im glad it shall be you to tell her the news cazaril and not some random chancellery courier though it will be hard she drew a deep breath and bent to the paper the candlelight made her amber hair glow in an aureole about her abstracted face cazaril left her in the pool of light and stepped into the darkness of the cold corridor cazaril was awakened at dawn by insistent knocking at his chamber door when he stumbled out of bed and went to unlock it he found not the page with some summons that hed expected but palli the normally neat palli looked as though he had dressed in the dark by guess his hair was bent with sleep and sticking out in odd directions his eyes were wide and dark the yawning dy gura brothers looking sleepy but cheerful smiled at cazaril from their station in the corridor as palli shouldered within cazaril handed out his bedside candle for the taller of them ferda to light from the wall sconce he handed it back to his lord and commander palli who took it with hands that shook slightly palli didnt speak till the door closed behind him and cazaril bastards demons caz what is all this about which what asked cazaril in some confusion palli lit another brace of candles on cazarils washstand and whirled about pray for guidance you said in my sleep if you please i was killed five times in my dreams last night ill have you know riding somewhere each time more horribly in the last dream my horses ate me i dont want to put my leg across anything horse mule or sawhorse for a week at least oh cazaril blinked taking this in it seemed clear enough in that case i dont want you to ride anywhere thats a relief i must go myself go where in this weather its snowing now you know ah it wanted only that hasnt anyone told you yet royse teidez died about midnight last night of his infected wound pallis face abruptly sobered his mouth formed a silent o that changes things in chalion indeed let me dress and then come upstairs with me hastily cazaril splashed chill water on his face and shrugged into yesterdays clothes in the chambers above cazaril found betriz also still dressed in last nights blackandlavender court mourning it was plain she had not yet slept cazaril drew the dy gura brothers out of sight of the corridor and closed them in his office antechamber he and palli entered the sitting room betrizs hand touched a sealed packet waiting on a small table all the letters are ready to go toshe glanced at palli and hesitatedvalenda is iselle asleep cazaril asked quietly resting only shell want to see you both betriz disappeared into the bedchambers for a moment from which floated low murmuring then returned with a pair of books under her arm i sneaked down to the royas library and found two identical volumes there werent many true duplicates i thought id better take the biggest so as to have more words to choose from good said cazaril and took one from her he glanced at it and choked back a black laugh ordol read the gold letters on the spine the fivefold pathway perfect i need to brush up on my theology he laid it down with the packet of letters iselle emerged wrapped in a heavy blue velvet dressing gown from which the white lace of her nightgown peeped her amber hair cascaded down across her shoulders her face was as pale and puffy with lack of sleep as betrizs she nodded to cazaril and to palli my lord dy palliar thank you for coming to my aid i uh said palli he cast a rather desperate glance at cazaril what am i agreeing to will he ride for you betriz asked cazaril anxiously you should not attempt this you know you should not ah no palli instead im asking you to swear service and protection to the royesse iselle personally in the names of the gods and especially the lady of spring there is no treason in this she is the rightful heiress of chalion and you will thus have the honor of being the first of her courtiers to do so i i i i can swear my fealty in addition to what i have sworn to your brother orico lady i cannot swear to you instead of to him i do not ask for your service before what you give to orico i only ask for your service before what you give to oricos chancellor now that i can do said palli brightening and with a will he kissed iselles forehead hands and slippers and still kneeling before her skirts swore the oaths of a lord of chalion witnessed by betriz and cazaril he added still on his knees what would you think royesse of lord dy yarrin as the next holy general of the daughters order i think such great preferences are not yet mine to give but he would certainly be more acceptable to me than any candidate from dy jironals clan palli nodded slow approval of her measured words and rose to his feet ill let him know iselle will need all the practical support you can give her all through the funeral for teidez said cazaril to palli he is to be buried in valenda might i suggest she select your troop from palliar to be part of the royses cortege it will give you good excuse to confer often and will assure that you are by her side when she rides out of cardegoss oh quick thinking said iselle cazaril didnt feel quick he felt his wits were laboring along after iselles as though in boots coated with twenty pounds of mud each the authority that had fallen to her last night seemed to have released some coiled energy within her she burned with it inside her cocoon of darkness he was afraid to close his eyes lest he see it blazing in there still but must you ride alone cazaril asked betriz unhappily i dont like that iselle pursed her lips as far as valenda i think he must there is scarcely anyone in cardegoss i would trust to dispatch with him she studied cazaril in doubt in valenda perhaps my grandmother may supply men in truth you should not arrive at the foxs court alone and unattended i dont want us to appear desperate to him she added a trifle bitterly although we are betriz plucked at her black velvets but what if you fall ill on the road suppose your tumor grows worse and who would know to burn your body if you die pallis head swiveled round tumor cazaril what is this now cazaril didnt you tell him i thought he was your friend betriz turned to palli he means to jump on a horse and riderideoff to ibra with a great uncanny murderous tumor in his gut and no help on the road i dont think thats brave i think its stupid to ibra he must go for want of any other equal to the deed but not alone like this palli sat back his thumb across his lips and studied cazaril through narrowing eyes he said at last i thought you looked sick yes well theres nothing to be done about it um just how bad i mean um are you am i dying yes how soon no one knows which makes my life different from yours as learned umegat points out not at all well who wants to die in bed you did you always said of extreme old age in bed with somebodys wife mine by preference cazaril sighed ah well he managed not to look at betriz my death is the gods problem for me i ride as soon as a horse can be saddled he grunted to his feet and collected the book and the packet palli glanced at betriz who clenched her hands together and stared beseechingly at him he muttered an oath under his breath stood and strode abruptly to the door to the antechamber which he jerked open foix dy gura his ear to the other side staggered upright and blinked and smiled at his commander his brother ferda leaning on the opposite wall snorted hello boys said palli smoothly i have a little task for you cazaril palli at his heels strode out the zangre gates dressed for winter riding the saddlebag slung over his shoulder heavy with a change of clothes a small fortune theology and arguable treason he found the dy gura brothers already in the stable yard before him sped back to yarrin palace by pallis urgent orders they had also changed out of their blueandwhite court dress into garb more practical for riding with tall and wellworn boots betriz was with them wrapped in a white wool cloak they had their heads close together and betriz was gesticulating emphatically foix glanced up to see cazaril approaching his broad face set in a sober and rather intimidated expression he made a motion and said something betriz glanced over her shoulder and the conversation abruptly ceased the brothers turned around and made small bows to cazaril betriz stared at him steadily as if his face were some lesson hed set her to memorize ferda said palli the horsemaster came to attention before him palli withdrew two letters from his vestcloak one sealed one merely folded thishe handed the folded paper to ferdais a letter of authorization from me as a lord dedicat of the daughters order entitling you to whatever assistance you may need to draft from our sister chapters on your journey any costs to be settled up with me at palliar this otherhe handed across the sealed letteris for you to open in valenda ferda nodded and tucked them both away the second letter of hand put the dy gura brothers under cazarils command in the name of the daughter with no other details their trip to ibra was going to make an interesting surprise for them palli walked about them inspecting with a commanders eye you have enough warm clothes armed for bandits they displayed polished swords and readied crossbowsbowstrings protected from dampness with a sufficiency of quarrelsgear all in good condition only a few flakes of snow now spun through the moist air to land on wool and leather and hair there to melt to small droplets the dawn snowfall had proved a mere dusting here in town in the hills it would likely be heavier from beneath her cloak betriz produced a fluffy white object cazaril blinked it into focus as a fur hat in the style of chalions hardy southern mountaineers with flaps meant to be folded down over the ears with the fur inward and tied under the chin while both men and women wore similar styles this one was clearly meant for a lady in white rabbit skin with flowers brocaded in gold thread over the crown cazaril i thought you might need this in the high passes foix raised his brows and grinned and ferda snickered behind his hand fetching he said betriz reddened it was the only thing i could find in the time i had she said defensively better than having your ears freeze indeed said cazaril gravely i do not have so good a hat i shall be very grateful ignoring the grinning youths he took it from her and knelt to pack it carefully in his saddlebag it wasnt just a gesture to gratify betriz though he smiled inwardly at her sniff in ferdas direction when the brothers met the winter wind in the border mountains those grins would vanish soon enough iselle appeared through the gates in a velvet cloak so dark a purple as to be almost black attended by a shivering chancellery clerk who handed over a numbered couriers baton in exchange for cazarils signature in his ledger he clapped the ledger shut and scurried back over the drawbridge and out of the cold you were able to get dy jironals order cazaril inquired tucking the baton into a secure inner pocket of his coat the baton would command its bearer fresh horses food and clean if hard and narrow beds in any chancellery posting house on the main roads across chalion not dy jironals oricos orico is still roya in chalion though even the chancellery clerk had to be reminded of the fact iselle snorted softly the gods go with you cazaril alas yes he sighed then realized that had been not an observation but a farewell he bowed his head to kiss her chilled hands betriz eyed him sideways he hesitated then cleared his throat and took her hands as well her fingers spasmed around his at the touch of his lips and her breath drew in but her eyes stared away over his head he straightened to see the dy gura brothers shrinking under her glower a zangre groom led out three saddled courier horses palli clasped hands with his cousins ferda took the reins of what proved to be cazarils horse a rangy roan that matched his height the muscular foix hastened to give him a leg up and as he settled in the saddle with a faint grunt inquired anxiously are you all right sir they hadnt even started yet what had betriz been telling them yes its all fine cazaril assured him thank you ferda presented him with his reins and foix assisted him in tying on his precious saddlebags ferda leapt lightly aboard his horse his brother climbed more heavily onto his and they started out of the stable yard cazaril turned in his saddle to watch iselle and betriz making their way back across the drawbridge and through the zangres great gate betriz looked back and raised her hand high cazaril returned the salute then the horses rounded the first corner and the buildings of cardegoss hid the gate from his view a single crow followed them swooping from gutter to cornice on the first street they met chancellor dy jironal riding slowly up from jironal palace flanked by two armed retainers on foot hed obviously been home to wash and eat and change his clothes and attend to his more urgent correspondence judging from his gray face and bloodshot eyes hed had no more sleep than iselle the night past dy jironal reined in and gave cazaril an odd little salute where away lord cazarilhis eye took in the light courier saddles stamped with the castleandleopard of chalionupon my chancellerys horses cazaril returned a half bow from his saddle valenda my lord the royesse iselle decided she did not want some stranger bearing the bad news to her mother and grandmother and has dispatched me as her courier mad ista eh dy jironals lips screwed up i do not envy you that task indeed cazaril let his voice go hopeful order me back to iselles side and i shall obey you at once no no dy jironals lip curled just slightly in satisfaction i can think of no man more fitted for this sad duty ride on ohwhen do you mean to return im not yet sure iselle desired me to be sure her mother was going to be all right before i returned i do not expect ista to take the news well truly well well watch for you i wager you will he and dy jironal exchanged guarded nods and the two parties rode on in their opposite directions cazaril glanced back to catch dy jironal glancing back just before he turned the corner toward the zangres gates dy jironal would know no ambush could now catch cazarils start on the courier horses the return was another opportunity except that i wont be coming back on this road or at all hed turned over in his mind all the disasters that might follow failure what would be his fate if he succeeded what did the gods do with used saints hed never to his knowledge met one save perhaps now umegat a thought that was not upon consideration very reassuring they reached the city gate and crossed over the bridge to the river road fonsas crow did not follow farther but perched upon the gates high crenellations and vented a few sad caws which echoed as they descended into the ravine the zangres cliff wall naked of verdure in the winter rose high and stark across the dark rapid water of the river cazaril wondered if betriz would watch from one of the castles high windows as they passed along the road he wouldnt be able to see her up there so high and shadowed his bleak thoughts were scattered by the thud and splash of hooves an inbound courier flashed past them galloping horse lathered and blowing heno shewaved at them in passing female couriers were much favored by some of the chancellerys horsemasters at least on the safer routes for they claimed their light weight and light hands spared the animals foix waved back and turned in his saddle to watch her flying black braids cazaril didnt think he was just admiring her horsemanship ferda nudged his mount up next to cazarils may we gallop now my lord he asked hopefully daylight is dear and these beasts are fresh but five gods im not cazaril took a breath of grim anticipation yes he clapped his booted heels to the roans side and the animal bounded into a longstrided canter the road opened before them across the snowstreaked dun landscape winding into gray mists heavy with the faint sweet rot of winter vegetation vanishing into uncertainty they came to valenda at dusk on the following day the town bulked black against a pewter sky its deepening shadows relieved here and there by the orange flare of some torch or candle faint sparks of light and life theyd had no remounts on the branch road to valenda courier stations being reserved for the route to the baocian provincial seat of taryoon so the last leg had been a long one for the horses cazaril was content to let the tired beasts walk heads down on a long rein the remaining stretch through the city and up the hill he wished he could stop here stop and sink down by the side of the road and not move for days in minutes it would be his task to tell a mother that her son was dead of all the trials he expected to face on this journey this was the worst too soon they reached the provincaras castle gates the guards recognized him at once and ran shouting for the servants the groom demi held his horse and was the first to ask why are you here my lord the first but not the last i bear messages to the provincara and the lady ista cazaril replied shortly bent over his pommel foix popped up at his horses shoulder staring up expectantly cazaril heaved his off leg up over the horses haunches kicked free of the other stirrup and dropped to his feet his knees buckled and he would have fallen then but for the strong hand that caught his elbow theyd made good time he wondered dizzily how dearly he would pay for it he stood a moment trembling till his balance returned to him is ser dy ferrej here he has escorted the provincara to a wedding feast in town demi told him i dont know when they mean to return oh said cazaril he was almost too tired to think hed been so exhausted last night hed fallen asleep in the postinghouse bunk within minutes of being steered to it by his helpers and slept even through dondo wait for the provincara hed meant to report to her first and let her determine how to tell her daughter no this is unbearable get it over with in that case i will see the lady ista first he added the horses need to be rubbed down and watered and fed these are ferda and foix dy gura men of good family in palliar please see that they are given everything weve not eaten nor washed but that was obvious everyones sweatsoaked woolens were splashed with winter road mud hands grimed faces streaked with dirt they were all three blinking and weary in the torchlight of the courtyard cazarils fingers stiff from clutching his reins in the cold since dawn plucked at the ties of his saddlebags foix took that task from him too and pulled the bags off the horse cazaril rather determinedly took them back from him folded them over his arm and turned take me to ista now please he said faintly i have letters for her from the royesse iselle a house servant led him within and up the stairs in the new building the man had to wait for cazaril to climb slowly after him his legs felt like lead murmurs rose and fell between the man and the royinas attendants as he negotiated cazarils entry to her chambers the air within was perfumed with bowls of dried flower petals and aglow with candlelight and warmth from the corner fireplace cazaril felt huge and awkward and filthy in this dainty sitting room ista sat on a cushioned bench dressed in warm wraps her dun hair bound in a thick rope down her back like sara the inky shadow of the curse hung about her so i was right in that guess ista turned toward him her eyes widened and her face stiffened she surely knew something was terribly wrong just by his sudden presence here the hundred ways to break the news to her gently that hed rehearsed during the long hours of riding seemed to fall through his fingers under the pressure of those dark dilated eyes any delay now would be cruel beyond measure he fell to one knee before her and cleared his throat first iselle is well hold to that he inhaled second teidez died two nights ago from an infected wound the two women attending upon ista cried out and clutched each other ista barely moved but for a little flinch as if an invisible arrow had struck her she vented a long wordless exhalation you understand my words royina cazaril said hesitantly oh yes she breathed one corner of her mouth turned up cazaril could not call it a smile it was nothing like a smile that black irony when it is toolonganticipated a blow falls as a relief you see the waiting is over i can stop fearing now can you understand that cazaril nodded after a moment of silence broken only by the sobbing of one of her women she added quietly how came he by this wound hunting or something else not hunting exactly in a way it was cazaril licked his lips chapped with the cold lady do you see anything odd about me i see only with my eyes now ive been blind for years you see you see her emphasis made her meaning very plain cazaril thought yes she nodded and sat back i thought so there is a look about one who sees with those eyes a trembling attendant crept up to ista and said in an overly light voice lady perhaps you should come away to bed now your lady mother will surely be back soon she shot cazaril a meaningful look over her shoulder clearly the woman thought ista was going into one of her mad fugues into what everyone thought was one of her fugues had ista ever been mad cazaril sat back on his heels please leave us now i must have some private speech with the royina on matters of some urgency sir my lord the woman managed a false smile and whispered in his ear we dare not leave her in this stricken hourshe might do herself some harm cazaril climbed to his full height and took both ladies by the arms and steered them gently but inexorably out the door i will undertake to guard her here you may wait in this chamber across the hall and if i need you i will call out all right he shut both doors upon their protests ista waited unmoving but for her hands she held a fine lace handkerchief which she commenced to folding over and over into smaller and smaller squares cazaril grunted down to sit crosslegged on the floor at her feet and stare up into that wideeyed chalky face i have seen the zangres ghosts he said yes more i have seen the dark cloud that hangs over your house the golden generals curse the bane of fonsas heirs yes you know of it then oh yes it hangs about you now yes it hung about orico and sara iselleand teidez yes she tilted her head and stared away cazaril thought about a state of shock he had seen sometimes come upon men in battle between the moment a blow fell and the time their bodies fell men who should have been unconscious should have been dead staggering about yet for a time accomplishing sometimes extraordinary acts was this quiet coherence such a shock soon to meltshould he seize it or had ista ever really been incoherent or did we just not understand her orico has become very ill how i came by my second sight is all of a piece with this black tangle but please please lady tell me how you came to know what did you see and when and how i must understand because i thinki fearit has been given to me it has fallen to me to act yet nothing has told me what that action must be even second sight cannot pierce this dark her brows went up i can tell you truths i cannot give you understanding for how can one give what one does not possess i have always told the truth yes i see that now he took a daring breath but have you ever told all of it she sucked on her lower lip a moment studying him her trembling hands seeming to belong to some other ista than the one of this carven face began unfolding the tight knot of the handkerchief again upon her knee slowly she nodded her voice was so low cazaril had to tilt his head to be sure of catching all her words it began when i became pregnant with iselle the visions the second sight came and went i thought it was an effect of my pregnancybearing turns some womens brains the physicians convinced me of that for a time i saw the blind ghosts drifting i saw the dark cloud hanging upon ias and young orico i heard voices i dreamed of the gods of the golden general of fonsa and his two faithful companions burning in his tower of chalion burning like the tower after iselle was born the visions ceased i thought i had been mad and then got well again the eye could not see itself not even the inner eye he had been granted umegat been granted knowledge bought at others cost and handed to him as a gift how frightened would he be by now if he were still groping for explanations of the inexplicable then i became pregnant again with teidez and the visions began again twice as bad as before it was unbearable to think myself mad only when i threatened to kill myself did ias confess to me that it was the curse and that he knew it had always known of it and how betrayed to find that those whod known the truth hadnt told him had left him to stagger about in isolated terror i was horrified that i had brought my two children into this dire danger i prayed and prayed to the gods that it might be lifted or that they would tell me how it might be lifted that they would spare the innocent then the mother of summer came to me when i was round to bursting with teidez not in a dream not while i was sleeping but when i was awake and sober in the broad day she stood as close to me as you are now and i fell to my knees i could have touched her robe if id dared her breath was a perfume like wildflowers in the summer grasses her face was too beautiful for my eyes to comprehend it was like staring into the sun her voice was music istas lips softened even now the peace of that vision echoed briefly in her face a flash of beauty like the reflection of sunlight on dark waters but her brows tightened again and she spoke on bending forward growing if possible more shadowed more intent she said that the gods sought to take the curse back that it did not belong in this world that it was a gift to the golden general that he had spilt improperly she said that the gods might draw the curse back to them only through the will of a man who would lay down his life three times for the house of chalion cazaril hesitated the sound of his own breath in his nostrils seemed enough to drown out that quiet voice but the question rose helplessly to his lips though he cursed himself for sounding a fool um i dont suppose that three men could lay down their lives once each instead no her lips curved in that weird ironic notsmile you see the problem i i i dont see the solution though was it a trick this prophecy her hands opened briefly ambiguously then began folding the handkerchief again i told ias he told lord dy lutez of course ias kept nothing from dy lutez except for me except for me historical curiosity overcame cazaril now that they were comrades in sainthood or something like it it seemed easy to talk to ista the ease was lunatic tilted fragile if he blinked it would be gone beyond recall and yet saint to saint and soul to soul for this floating moment it was an intimacy stranger and more soaring than lover to lover he began to understand why umegat had fallen upon him with such hunger what was their relationship really she shrugged they were lovers since before i was born who was i to judge them dy lutez loved ias i loved ias ias loved us both he tried so hard cared so much trying to bear the weight of all his dead brothers and his father fonsa too hed worn himself near to death with the caring and yet it all went wrong and wrong again she hesitated for a time and cazaril was terrified for an instant that he had inadvertently done something to bring this flow of confidences to an end but apparently she was marshaling not her thoughts but her heart for she went on even more slowly i dont remember now whose idea it first was we sat in a night council the three of us after teidez was born i still had the sight we knew both of our children were drawn into this dark thing and poor orico too save my children ias cried laying his forehead down upon the table weeping save my children and lord dy lutez said for the love i bear you i will try i will dare this sacrifice he scarcely dared whisper it but five gods how her head jerked we discussed a hundred schemes how might one kill a man and yet bring him back to die again impossible and yet not quite we finally settled on drowning as the best to try it would occasion the least physical injury and there were many stories of people whod been brought back from drowning dy lutez rode out to investigate some of them to try to determine the trick of it cazarils breath huffed out drowning oh gods and in the coldest of cold blood his hands were shaking too now her voice went on quiet and relentless we swore a physician to secrecy and descended to the dungeons of the zangre dy lutez let himself be stripped and bound arms and legs tight to his body and hung upside down over the tank we lowered him down headfirst and raised him again when he stopped struggling at last and hed died said cazaril softly then the treason charge was died indeed but not for the last time we revived him just barely oh oh it was working though her hands clenched i could feel it i could see it the crack in the curse but dy lutezhis nerve broke the next night he would not undertake the second immersion he cried i was trying to assassinate him for jealousys sake then ias and i made a mistake cazaril could see where this was going now closing his eyes would not spare him from seeing he forced them to stay open and on her face we seized him and made the second trial by force he screamed and wept ias wavered i cried but we have to think of the children but this time when we drew him out he was drowned dead and not all our tears and prayers revived him then ias was shattered i was distraught my inner vision was stripped from my eyes the gods turned their faces from me then the treason charge was false profoundly false yes a lie to hide our sins to explain the body her breath drew in but his family was allowed to inherit his estatenothing was attaindered except his reputation his public honor an honor that had been all in all to proud dy lutez who had valued all his wealth and glory but as outward signs of it it was done in the panic of the moment and then we could not draw back from it of all our regrets i think that one gnawed ias the most in the months after ias would not try again would not try to find another volunteer it had to be a willing sacrifice you see no struggling murder would have done it but only a man stepping forth of his own volition with eyes wideopen ias turned his face to the wall and died of grief and guilther hands stretched the scrap of lace almost to tearingleaving me alone with two little children and no way to protect or save them from this black thing she drew breath her chest heaving but she did not spiral into hysteria as cazaril tensing to spring up and call for her attendants feared as her breathing slowed he let his muscles slacken again but you she said at last the gods have touched you yes i am sorry an unsteady laugh left his lips aye he rubbed the back of his neck it was his turn for confession now he might shade the truth with others for expediencys sake not with ista he owed her weight for weight and value for value wound for wound how much news had you from cardegoss of iselles brief betrothal and lord dondo dy jironals fate one messenger followed atop another before we could celebratewe could not tell what to make of it celebrate a fortyyearold matched to a sixteenyearold her chin came up for a moment so like iselle that cazaril caught his breath ias and i were further apart in age than that ah yes that would tend to give her a different view of such things dondo was no ias my lady he was corruptdebauchedimpious an embezzlerand i am almost certain he had ser dy sanda murdered maybe even by his own hand he was colluding with his brother martou to gain complete control of the house of chalion through orico teidezand iselle istas hand touched her throat i met martou years ago at court he already aspired then to be the next lord dy lutez dy lutez the brightest noblest star ever to shine in the court of chalionmartou might have studied to clean his boots barely dondo i never met dondo was a disaster i first encountered him years ago and he had no character then he grew worse with age iselle was distraught and furious to have him forced upon her she prayed to the gods to release her from this abominable match but the gods didnt answer so i did i stalked him for a day intending to assassinate him for her but i couldnt get near him so i prayed to the bastard for a miracle of death magic and i was granted it after a moment istas eyebrows went up why arent you dead i thought i was dying when i awoke to find dondo dead without me i didnt know what to think but umegat determined iselles prayers had brought down a second miracle and the lady of spring had spared my life from the bastards demon but only temporarily saint umegati thought he was a groom his story was growing hopelessly tangled he took a deep breath and backed up and explained about umegat and the miracle of the menagerie and how it had preserved poor orico in the teeth of the curse except that dondo before he died when he still thought he was about to be married to iselle told teidez it was the other way aroundthat the menagerie was an evil roknari sorcery set up to sicken orico and teidez believed him five days ago he took his baocian guard and slew nearly every sacred animal in it and only by chance failed to slay the saint as well he took a scratch from oricos dying leopardi swear it was only a scratch if i had realized the wound became poisoned his end was cazaril remembered who he was talking to was very quick poor teidez whispered ista staring away my poor teidez you were born to be betrayed i think anyway finished cazaril because of this strange concatenation of miracles the death demon and the ghost of dondo were bound in my belly encapsulated in some kind of tumor evidently when they are released i will die istas grieving face went still her eyes rose to search cazarils face that would be twice she said ah eh her hands abandoned the tortured handkerchief and went out to grip cazarils collar her gaze became scorching almost painful in its intensity her breath came faster are you iselles dy lutez i i i stammered cazaril his stomach sank twice twice but how to accomplish the third oh oh oh her eyes were dilated the pupils pulsing her lips shivered with hope what are you i i im only cazaril my lady i am no dy lutez i am sure i am not brilliant or rich or strong or beautiful the gods know or brave though i fight when im trapped i suppose she made an impatient gesture take away all those ornamentsstripped naked upside down the man still shone faithful unto death only not unto two deaths or three ithis is madness now this is not the way i intend to break the curse i promise you five gods not drowning i have another plan to rescue iselle from it her eyes probed him still with that frightening wildness have the gods spoken to you then no i go by my reason she sat back to his relief releasing him and her brows crimped in puzzlement reason in this saraand youmarried into the house and the curse of chalion i think iselle can marry out of it this escape could not have been available to teidez but now i am on my way to ibra to try to arrange iselles marriage with ibras new heir royse bergon dy jironal will seek to prevent this because it will spell the end of his power in chalion iselle means to slip away from him by bringing teidezs body back here to valenda to be buried cazaril detailed iselles plan to ride with the cortege then rendezvous with bergon in valenda maybe breathed ista maybe he was unsure what she was referring to she was still giving him an extremely unsettling look your mother he said does she know of all this the curse the true tale of dy lutez i tried to tell her once she decided i was truly mad its not a bad life being mad you know it has its advantages you dont have to make any decisions what to eat what to wear where to go who lives who dies you can try it yourself if you like just tell the truth tell people you are pregnant with a demon and a ghost and you have a tumor that talks vilely to you and the gods guard your steps and see what happens next her throaty laugh did not incline cazaril to smile along her lips twisted dont look so alarmed lord cazaril if i repeat your story you have only to deny me and i will be thought mad not you i think you have been denied enough lady she bit her lip and looked away her body trembled cazaril shifted and was reminded of his saddlebag leaning against his hip iselle wrote you a letter and one to her grandmother and charged me to deliver them to you he burrowed into the bag found his packet of correspondence and handed ista her letter his hands were shaking from fatigue and hunger among other things i should go get rid of this dirt and eat something by the time the provincara returns perhaps i can make myself fit for her company ista held the letter to her breast call my ladies to me then i shall retire now i think no reason more to wake cazaril glanced up sharply iselle iselle is a reason to wake ah yes one more hostage to go then i can sleep forever she leaned forward and patted his shoulder in an odd reassurance but for now i will just sleep tonight im so tired i think i must have done all my mourning and wailing in advance and there is none left in me now all emptied out i understand lady yes you do how strange cazaril reached gingerly out to the bench pushed himself up and went to let the weepy attendants back in ista set her teeth and suffered them to descend upon her cazaril hoisted his saddlebags and bowed himself out a wash a change of clothes and a hot meal did much to restore cazaril physically though his mind still reeled from his conversation with ista when the servants set him to await the provincaras return in her quiet little parlor in the new building he was grateful for the chance to marshal his thoughts a cheerful fire was set for him in the chambers excellent fireplace aching in every bone he sat in her cushioned chair sipped wellwatered wine and tried not to nod off the old lady was not likely to stay out very late indeed she soon appeared flanked by her cousincompanion lady dy hueltar and the grave ser dy ferrej she was dressed in gala splendor in green satins and velvets glittering with jewels but one look at her ashen face told cazaril that the bad news had already been blurted to her by some excited servant cazaril lurched to his feet and bowed she gripped his hands searching his face cazaril is it true teidez has died suddenly of an infection iselle is wellhe took a breathand heiress of chalion poor boy poor boy have you told ista yet yes oh dear how did she take it well did not describe it cazaril chose calmly your grace at least she did not fly into any sort of wild pelter as id feared i think the blows her life has dealt her have left her numb i dont know how shell be tomorrow her attendants have put her to bed the provincara vented a sigh and blinked back tears cazaril knelt to his saddlebags iselle entrusted me with a letter for you and there is a note for you ser dy ferrej from betriz she did not have time to write much he handed out the two sealed missives they will both be coming here iselle means to have teidez buried in valenda oh said the provincara cracking the cold wax of the letters seal careless of where the sprinkles fell oh how i long to see her her eyes devoured the penned lines short she complained her gray eyebrows went up cazaril will explain everything to you she says yes your grace i have much to tell you some of it in confidence she waved out her companions go i will call you back dy ferrej was breaking open his letter by the time he reached the door she sat with a rustle of fabric still clutching the paper and gestured cazaril to another chair which he pulled up to her knee i must see to ista before she sleeps ill try to be succinct your grace this is what i have learned this season in cardegoss what i went through to learn it that cost the cracking open of his world ista had understood at once he was not sure the provincara would grasp it doesnt matter now but archdivine mendenal in cardegoss can confirm the truth of it all if you get a chance at him tell him i sent you and he will deny you nothing her brows went up how is it you bend an archdivine cazaril snorted softly i pull rank she sat up her lips thinning cazaril dont make stupid jokes with me you grow as cryptic as ista yes istas selfprotective sense ofnot humor ironylikely was irritating at close quarters ista who spoke for ista provincara your daughter is heartbroken ravaged in will she longs for the release of death but she is not mad the gods are not so merciful the old woman hunched as though his words grated over a raw spot her grief is extravagant was no woman ever widowed before has none lost a child ive suffered both but i did not moan and mope and carry on so not for years i cried my hour yes but then i continued about my duties if she is not broken in reason then she is vastly selfindulgent could he make her understand istas differences without violating istas tacit confidences well even a partial truth might help he bent his head to hers it all goes back to the great war of fonsa the fairlywise with the golden general in the plainest possible terms he detailed the inner workings of the curse upon the history of the house of chalion there were enough other disasters in iass reign that he scarcely needed to touch on the fall of dy lutez oricos impotence the slow corruption of his advisors the failure of both his policies and his health brought the tale to the present the provincara scowled is all this vile luck a work of roknari black magic then not as i understand it it is a spillage a perversion of some ineffable divinity lost from its proper place she shrugged close enough if it acts like black magic then black magic it is the practical question is how to counter it cazaril wasnt sure about that close enough surely only correct understanding could lead to correct action ista and ias had tried to force a solution as though the curse were magic to be countered by magic a rite done by rote she added and does this link to this wild tale we heard of dondo dy jironal being murdered by death magic that at least he could answer none better he had already decided to strip out as much of the unnatural detail as possible from her version of events he did not think her confidence in him would be augmented by his babbling of demons ghosts saints second sight and even more grotesque things more than enough remained to astound her he began with the tale of iselles disastrous betrothal although he did not attribute the source of dondos death miracle concealing his act of murder as hed concealed istas the provincara was not so squeamish if lord dondo was as bad as you say she sniffed i shall say prayers for that unknown benefactor indeed your grace i pray for him daily and dondo a mere younger sonfor iselle what was that fool orico thinking abandoning the ineffable he presented the menagerie to her as a marvel devised by the temple to preserve oricos failing health true enough as far as it went she grasped instantly the secret political purpose of dondos setting teidez to itsand oricosdestruction and ground her teeth she moaned for teidezs betrayal but the news that valenda must now prepare for a funeral a wedding and a war possibly simultaneously revitalized her can iselle count on her uncle dy baocias support cazaril asked her how many others can he and you bring in against dy jironals faction the provincara made rapid inventory of the lords she might draw in to valenda ostensibly for teidezs funeral in fact to pry iselle from dy jironals hands the list impressed him after all her decades of political observation in chalion the provincara didnt even need to look at a map to plan her tactics have them ride in for teidezs funeral with every man they can muster said cazaril especially we must control the roads between here and ibra to guarantee the safety of royse bergon difficult said the provincara sitting back with her lips pursing some of dy jironals own lands and those of his brothersinlaw lie between here and the border you should have a troop to ride with you i will strip valenda to give you the men no said cazaril slowly youll need all your men when iselle arrives which may well be before i can return and if i take a troop to ibra our speed will be limited we cannot hope to obtain remounts on the road for so large a company and maintaining secrecy would become impossible better we should travel outward light and fast and unmarked save the troop to meet us coming back oh and beware your baocian captain you sent with teidez sold himself to dondohe cannot be trusted youll have to find some way to replace him when he returns the provincara swore bastards demons ill have his ears they made plans to pass his ciphered letters to iselle and hers to him through valenda making it appear to dy jironals spies that cazaril still was in her grandmothers company the provincara undertook to pawn some of iselles jewelry for him on the morrow at the best rate to raise the coin hed need for the next part of his journey they settled a dozen other practical details in as many minutes her very determination made her godproof cazaril imagined for all her attention to pious ceremony no god was going to slip into that iron will even edgewise the gods had given her less perilous gifts and he was grateful enough for them you understand he said at last i think this marriage scheme may rescue iselle i dont know that it will also save ista neither ista drifting sadly about the castle of valenda nor orico lying blind and bloated in the zangre and no exhortation of the provincara to ista to bestir herself would be of any use while this black thing still choked her like a poisoned fog if it only rescues iselle from the clutches of chancellor dy jironal it will satisfy me i cant believe orico made such vile provisions in his will that legal note had exercised her almost more than the supernatural matters taking my granddaughter from me without even consulting me cazaril fingered his beard you realize if all this succeeds your granddaughter will become your liege lord royina in her own right of all chalion and royinaconsort of ibra her lips screwed up thats the maddest part of all shes just a girl not but that she always had more wits than poor teidez what can all the gods of chalion be thinking to place such a child on the throne at cardegoss cazaril said mildly perhaps that the restoration of chalion is the work of a very long lifetime and that no one so old as you or i could live to see it through she snorted youre barely more than a child yourself children in charge of the whole world these days no wonder its all gone mad well well we must bustle about tomorrow five gods cazaril go sleep though i doubt i shall you look like death warmed over and you havent my years to excuse you creakily he clambered to his feet and bowed himself out the provincaras bursts of irate energy were fragile it would take all her retainers aid to prevent her from exhausting herself dangerously he found the anxiously waiting lady dy hueltar in the next room and sent her in to attend upon her lady cousin they gave cazaril back his chilly honorable customary chamber in the main keep he slid gratefully between heated sheets it was as much like coming home as anything hed experienced for years yet his new eyes rendered familiar places strange again the world made strange as he was remade over and over and no place to rest at last dondo in all his motley ghostly glory scarcely kept cazaril awake that night he had become a danger almost too routine to be dreaded fresh fears assailed cazaril now memory of the terrible hope in istas eyes unnerved him and the reflection that tomorrow he would mount a horse whose every stride would carry him closer to the sea cazaril regretfully gave up use of the chancellerys courier remounts when they left valenda in favor of secrecy no merit in handing dy jironal a signed record of their route and destination armed with pallis letter of recommendation they instead arranged exchanges for fresh horses at local town chapters of the daughters order at the foot of the mountains on the western frontier they were obliged to deal with a local horse trader for the sturdy and surefooted mules to carry them over the heights the man had clearly been making a fine living for years skinning desperate travelers ferda looked over the beasts offered them and said indignantly this one has heaves and if that one isnt throwing out a splint my lord ill eat your hat the horse trader and he fell at once into acrimonious argument cazaril leaning in exhaustion on the corral rail and thinking only of how much he didnt want to throw a leg over any animal spavined or not for the next thousand years at last straightened and let himself through the gate he walked out into the herd of milling horses and mules stirred up by the roughandready capture of their rejected comrades spread his hands and closed his eyes if it please you lady give us three good mules at a nudge at his side he opened them again a curious mule its brown eyes limpid stared at him two more muscled in their long ears waggling the tallest one dark brown with a creamy nose rested its chin on his shoulder and breathed out a contentedsounding snort spraying the environs thank you lady muttered cazaril and more loudly all right follow me he plodded back through the hoofpocked muck to the gate the three mules fell in behind snuffling with interest well take these three he told the horse trader who along with ferda had fallen silent and was staring openmouthed the horse trader found his voice first butbut those are my three best animals yes i know he let himself back out leaving the horse trader to hold the gate against the three mules who still tried to follow him shouldering up heavily against the boards and making anxious mulish noises ferda come to a price im going to go lie down in that lovely straw stack wake me when were saddled up his mule proved healthy steady and bored there was nothing better in cazarils view on these treacherous mountain trails than a bored mule the fiery steeds ferda favored for making time over the flats could have climbed no faster on these breathstealing slopes besides making a menace of themselves with their nervous sidling on the narrow places and the mules gentle amble didnt churn his guts although if the goddess granted her saint mules he didnt know why she didnt also give him better weather the dy gura brothers stopped laughing at cazarils hat about halfway up the pass over the bastards teeth range he folded the fine fur flaps down over his ears and tied their strings under his chin before the sleet driven by the tumbling updrafts started stinging their faces he squinted into the wind between the laidback ears of his laboring mule at the track winding up through rocks and ice and mentally measured out the daylight left to them after a time ferda reined back beside him my lord should we take shelter from this blizzard blizzard cazaril brushed ice spicules from his beard and blinked oh palliars winters were mild sodden rather than snowy and the brothers had never been out of their province before if this were a blizzard you wouldnt be able to see your mules ears from where you sit this isnt unsafe merely unpleasant ferda made a face of dismay but pulled his hood strings tighter and bent into the wind indeed in a few more minutes they broke out of the squall and visibility returned the high vale opened out before their eyes a few fingers of pale sunlight poked down through silvery clouds to dapple the long slopesfalling away downward cazaril pointed and shouted encouragingly ibra the weather moderated as they started the long descent toward the coast though the grunting mules shuffled no faster the rugged border mountains gave way to less daunting hills humped and brown with broad valleys winding between when they left the snow behind cazaril reluctantly permitted ferda to trade in their excellent mules for swifter horses a succession of improving roads and increasingly civilized inns brought them in just two more days to the river course that ran down to zagosur they passed through outlying farms and over bridges across irrigation canals swollen with the winter rains they debouched from the river valley to find the city rising up before them gray walls a blocky jumble of whitewashed houses with roofs of the distinctive green tile of this region the fortress at its crown the famous harbor at its feet the sea stretched out beyond steel gray the endless level horizon of it streaked with aqua light the saltandseawrack smell of low tide wafting inland on a cold breeze made cazarils head jerk back foix inhaled deeply his eyes alight with fascination as he drank in his first sight of the sea pallis letter and the dy gura brothers rank secured them shelter at the daughters house off zagosurs main temple plaza cazaril sent the boys to buy beg or borrow formal dress of their order while he took himself off to a tailor the news that the tailor might name his price so long as he produced something swiftly launched a flurry of activity that resulted in cazaril emerging little more than an hour later with a tolerable version of chalionese court mourning garb under his arm after a chilly sponge bath cazaril quickly slipped into a heavy lavendergray brocade tunic very highnecked thick dark purple wool trousers and his cleaned and polished boots he adjusted the sword belt and sword ser dy ferrej had lent him so long ago rather worn but looking more honorable thereby and swung the satisfying weight of a black silkvelvet vestcloak over the whole one of iselles remaining rings a squarecut amethyst just fit over cazarils little finger its isolated heavy gold suggesting restraint rather than poverty between the court mourning and the gray streaks in his beard he fancied the result was as grave and dignified as could be wished serious he packaged up his precious diplomatic letters and tucked them under his arm collected his outriders who had refurbished themselves in neat blue and white and led the way through the narrow winding streets up the hill to the great foxs lair cazarils appearance and bearing brought him before the roya of ibras castle warder showing his letters and their seals to this official sped him in turn to the royas own secretary who met them standing in a bare whitewashed antechamber chilly with zagosurs perpetual winter damp the secretary was spare middleaged and harried cazaril favored him with a half bow equal to equal i am the castillar dy cazaril and i come from cardegoss on a diplomatic mission of some urgency i bear letters of introduction to the roya and royse bergon dy ibra from the royesse iselle dy chalion he displayed their seals but folded them back to his chest when the secretary reached for them i received these from the royesses own hand she bade me deliver them into the royas own hand the secretarys head tilted judiciously ill see what i can do for you my lord but the roya is very plagued with petitioners mostly relatives of former rebels attempting to intercede for the royas mercy which is stretched thin at present he looked cazaril up and down i think perhaps no one has warned youthe roya has forbid the court to wear mourning for the late heir of ibra as he died in a state of unreconciled rebellion only those who wish to cast their defiance in the royas teeth are wearing that sad garb and most of them have the presence of mind to do it in ah absence if you do not intend the insult i suggest you go change before you beg an audience cazarils brows went up is no one here before me with the news we rode fast but i didnt think we had outdistanced it i do not wear these bruised colors for the heir of ibra but for the heir of chalion royse teidez died barely a week ago suddenly of an infection oh said the secretary startled oh he regained his balance smoothly my condolences indeed to the house of chalion to lose so bright a hope he hesitated letters from the royesse iselle do you say aye cazaril added for good measure roya orico lies gravely ill and does not do business or so it was when we left cardegoss in haste the secretarys mouth opened and closed he finally said come with me and led them to a more comfortable chamber with a small fire in a corner fireplace ill go see what i can do cazaril lowered himself into a cushioned chair near the gentle glow foix took a bench though ferda prowled about frowning in an unfocused fashion at the wall hangings will they see us sir asked ferda to have ridden all this way only to be kept waiting on the doorstep like some peddler oh yes theyll see us cazaril smiled slightly as a breathless servant arrived to offer the travelers wine and the little spiced shortbread cakes stamped with an ibran seal which were a zagosur specialty why does this dog have no legs foix inquired staring a trifle crosseyed at the indented creature before biting into his cake it is a sea dog it has paddles in place of paws and chases fish they make colonies upon the shore here and there down the coast toward darthaca cazaril allowed the servant to pour him but a swallow of wine partly for sobriety partly to avoid waste as hed anticipated hed barely wet his lips before the secretary returned the man bowed lower than before come this way if it please you my lord gentlemen ferda gulped down his glassful of dark ibran wine and foix brushed crumbs from his white wool vestcloak they hastily followed cazaril and the secretary who led them up some stairs and across a little arched stone bridge to a newer part of the fortress after more turnings they came to a pair of double doors carved with sea creatures in the roknari style these swung open to emit a welldressed lord arm in arm with another courtier complaining but i waited five days for this audience what is this foolery youll just have to wait a little longer my lord said the courtier guiding him off with a firm hand under his elbow the secretary bowed cazaril and the dy gura brothers inside and announced their names and ranks it was not a throne room but a less formal receiving chamber set up for conference not ceremony a broad table roomy enough to spread out maps and documents occupied one end the long far wall was pierced with a row of doors with square windowpanes set top to bottom giving onto a balconycumbattlement that in turn overlooked the harbor and shipyard that were the heart of zagosurs wealth and power the silvery sea light diffuse and pale illuminated the chamber through the generous glass making the candle flames in the sconces seem wan half a dozen men were present but cazarils eye had no trouble picking out the fox and his son at seventyodd the roya of ibra was stringy balding the russet hair of his younger days reduced to a wispy fringe of white around his pate but he remained vigorous not fragile with his years alert and relaxed in his cushioned chair the tall youth standing at his side had the straight brown darthacan hair of his late mother though tinged with reddish highlights worn just long enough to cushion a helmet cut bluntly he looks healthy at least good his seagreen vestcloak was set with hundreds of pearls in patterns of curling surf which made it swing in elegant weighty ripples when he turned toward these new visitors the man standing on the foxs other side was proclaimed by his chain of office to be the chancellor of ibra a wary and intimidatedlooking fellow he was thefrom all reports overworkedservant of the fox not a rival for his power another mans badges marked him as a sea lord an admiral of ibras fleet cazaril went to one knee before the fox not too ungracefully despite his saddlestiffness and aches and bowed his head my lord i bring sad news from ibra of the death of royse teidez and urgent letters from his sister the royesse iselle he proffered iselles letter of his authority the fox cracked the seal and scanned rapidly down the simple penned lines his brows climbed and he glanced back keenly at cazaril most interesting rise my lord ambassador he murmured cazaril took a breath and managed to surge back to his feet without having either to push off the floor with his hand or worse catch himself on the royas chair he looked up to find royse bergon staring hard at him his lips parted in a frown cazaril blinked and favored him with a tentative nod and smile he was quite a wellmade young man withal evenfeatured perhaps handsome when he wasnt scowling so no squint no hanging lipa little stocky but fit not fat and not forty young cleanshaven but with a vigor in the shadow on his chin that promised he was grown to virility cazaril thought iselle should be pleased bergons stare intensified speak again he said excuse me my lord cazaril stepped back startled as the royse stepped forward and circled him his eyes searching him up and down his breath coming faster take off your shirt bergon demanded suddenly what take off your shirt take off your shirt my lordroyse bergon cazaril was thrown back in memory to the ghastly scene engineered by dy jironal to slander him to orico but there were no sacred crows here in zagosur to rescue him he lowered his voice i beg you my lord do not shame me in this company please sir a year and more ago in the fall were you not rescued from a roknari galley off the coast of ibra oh yes take off your shirt the royse was practically dancing circling around him again cazaril felt dizzy he glanced at the fox who looked as baffled as everyone else but waved his hand curiously endorsing the royses peculiar demand confused and frightened cazaril complied popping the frogs of his tunic and slipping it off together with his vestcloak and folding the garments over his arm he set his jaw trying to stand with dignity to bear whatever humiliation came next youre caz youre caz bergon cried his frown had changed to a demented grin ye gods the royse was mad and after all this pelting gallop over plain and mountain unfit for iselle after all why yes so my friends call me cazarils words were choked off as the royse abruptly flung his arms around him and nearly lifted him off his feet father bergon cried joyously this is the man this is the man what cazaril began and then by some trick of angle and shift of voice he knew cazarils own gape turned to grin the boy has grown roll him back a year in time and four inches in height erase the beardshadow shave the head add a peck of puppy fat and a blistering sunburn five gods he breathed danni danni the royse grabbed his hands and kissed them where did you go i fell sick for a week after i was brought home and when i finally set men to look for you youd disappeared i found other men from the ship but not you and none knew where youd gone i was ill also in the mothers hospital here in zagosur then i um walked home to chalion here right here all the time i shall burst ah but i sent men to the hospitalsoh how did they miss you there i thought you must have died of your injuries they were so fearsome i was sure he must have died said the fox slowly watching this play with unreadable eyes not to have come to collect the very great debt my house owed to him i did not know who you were royse bergon the foxs gray eyebrows shot up truly no father bergon confirmed eagerly i told no one who i was i used the nickname mama used to call me by when i was little it seemed to me more unsafe to claim my rank than to pass anonymously he added to cazaril when my late brothers bravos kidnapped me they did not tell the roknari captain who i was they meant me to die on the galley i think the secrecy was foolish royse chided cazaril the roknari would surely have set you aside for ransom yes a great ransom and political concessions wrung from my father too no doubt if id allowed myself to be made hostage in my own name bergons jaw tightened no i would not hand myself to them to play that game so said the fox in an odd voice staring up at cazaril you did not interpose your body to save the royse of ibra from defilement but merely to save some random boy random slave boy my lord cazarils lips twisted as he watched the fox trying to work out just what this made cazaril hero or fool i wonder at your wits im sure i was halfwitted by then cazaril conceded amiably id been on the galleys since i was sold as a prisoner of war after the fall of gotorget the foxs eyes narrowed oh so youre that cazaril eh cazaril essayed him a small bow wondering what he had heard of that fruitless campaign and shook out his tunic bergon hastened to help him don it again cazaril found himself the object of stunned stares from every man in the room including ferda and foix his tilted grin barely kept back bubbling laughter though underneath the laughter seethed a new terror that he could scarcely name how long have i been walking down this road he pulled out the last letter in his packet and swept a deeper bow to royse bergon as the document your respected father holds attests i come as spokesman for a proud and beautiful lady and i come not just to him but to you the heiress of chalion begs your hand in marriage he handed the sealed missive to the startled bergon in this i will let the royesse iselle speak for herself which she is most fit to do by virtue of her singular intellect her natural right and her holy purpose after that i will have much else to tell you royse im eager to hear you lord cazaril bergon after a taut glance around the chamber took himself off to a windowdoor where he popped the letters seal and read it at once his lips softening with wonder amazement too touched the foxs lips though it rendered them anything but soft cazaril had no doubt hed put the mans wits to the gallop for his own wits he now prayed for wings cazaril and his companions were of course invited to dine that night in the royas hall near sunset cazaril and bergon went walking together along the sea strand below the fortress it was as close to private speech as he was likely to obtain cazaril thought waving the dy guras back to trail along through the sand out of earshot the growl of the surf cloaked the sound of their voices a few white gulls swooped and cried as piercing as any crow or pecked at the smelly sea wrack on the wet sand and cazaril was reminded that these scavengers with their cold golden eyes were sacred to the bastard in ibra bergon bade his own heavily armed guard walk at a distance too though he did not seek to dispense with them the silent routine of his precautions reminded cazaril once more that civil war in this country was but lately ended and bergon had been both piece and player in that vicious game already a piece that had played himself it seemed ill never forget the first time i met you said bergon when they dropped me down beside you on the galley bench for a moment you frightened me more than the roknari did cazaril grinned what just because i was a scaly scabbed burnt scarecrow hairy and stinking bergon grinned back something like that he admitted sheepishly but then you smiled and said good evening young sir for all the world as if you were inviting me to share a tavern bench and not a rowing bench well you were a novelty of which we didnt get many i thought about it a lot later im sure i wasnt thinking too clearly at the time naturally not you arrived well roughedup truly kidnapped frightenedid just collected my first real beatingbut you helped me told me how to go on what to expect taught me how to survive you gave me extra water twice from your own portion eh only when you really needed it i was already used to the heat as desiccated as i was like to get after a time one can tell the difference between mere discomfort and the feverish look of a man skirting collapse it was very important that you not faint at your oar you see you were kind cazaril shrugged why not what could it cost me after all bergon shook his head any man can be kind when he is comfortable id always thought kindness a trivial virtue therefore but when we were hungry thirsty sick frightened with our deaths shouting at us in the heart of horror you were still as unfailingly courteous as a gentleman at his ease before his own hearth events may be horrible or inescapable men have always a choiceif not whether then how they may endure yes but i hadnt known that before i saw it that was when i began to believe it was possible to survive and i dont mean just my body cazaril smiled wryly i was taken for halfcracked by then you know bergon shook his head again and kicked up a little silver sand with his boot as they paced along the westering sun picked out the foxy copper highlights in his dark darthacan hair bergons late mother had been perceived in chalion as a virago a darthacan interloper suspected of fomenting her husbands strife with his heir on her sons behalf but bergon seemed to remember her fondly as a child hed been through two sieges with her cut off from his fathers forces in the intermittent war with his half brother he was clearly accustomed to strongminded women with a voice in mens councils when he and cazaril had shared the oar bench he had spoken of his dead mother although in disguised terms when hed been trying to encourage himself not of his live father bergons precocious wit and selfcontrol as demonstrated in the dire days on the galley werent cazaril reflected entirely the legacy of the fox cazarils smile broadened so let me tell you he began all about the royesse iselle dy chalion bergon hung on cazarils words as he described iselles winding amber hair and her bright gray eyes her wide and laughing mouth her horsemanship and her scholarship her undaunted steady nerve her rapid assessment of emergencies selling iselle to bergon seemed approximately as difficult as selling food to starving men water to the parched or cloaks to the naked in a blizzard and he hadnt even touched yet on the part about her being due to inherit a royacy the boy seemed half in love already the fox would be a greater challenge the fox would suspect a catch cazaril had no intention of confiding the catch to the fox bergon was another matter for you the truth there is a darker urgency to royesse iselles plea cazaril continued as they reached the end of the crescent of beach and turned about again this is in the deepest confidence as she prays to have safe confidence in you as her husband for your ear alone he drew in sea air and all his courage it all goes back to the war of fonsa the fairlywise and the golden general they made two more turns along the stretch of sand crossing back over their own tracks before cazarils tale was told the sun going down in a red ball was nearly touching the flat sea horizon and the breaking waves shimmered in dark and wondrous colors gnawing their way up the beach as the tide turned cazaril was as frank and full with bergon as hed been with ista keeping nothing back save istas confession not even his own personal haunting by dondo bergons face made ruddy by the light was set in profound thought when he finished lord cazaril if this came from any mans lips but yours i doubt i would believe it id think him mad although madness may be an effect of these events royse it is not the cause its all real ive seen it i half think i am drowning in it an unfortunate turn of phrase but the sea growling so close at hand was making cazaril nervous he wondered if bergon had noticed cazaril always turned so as to put the royse between him and the surf you would make me like the hero of some nursemaids tale rescuing the fair lady from enchantment with a kiss cazaril cleared his throat well rather more than a kiss i think a marriage must be consummated to be legally binding theologically binding likewise i would assume the royse gave him an indecipherable glance he didnt speak for a few more paces then he said ive seen your integrity in action it widened my world id been raised by my father who is a prudent cautious man always looking for mens hidden selfish motivations no one can cheat him but ive seen him cheat himself if you understand what i mean yes it was very foolish of you to attack that vile roknari galleyman yes and yet i think given the same circumstances you would do it again knowing what i know now it would be harder but i would hope i would pray royse that the gods would still lend me such foolishness in my need what is this astonishing foolishness that shines brighter than all my fathers gold can you teach me to be such a fool too caz oh breathed cazaril im sure of it cazaril met with the fox in the cool of the following morning he was escorted again to the high bright chamber overlooking the sea but this time for a more private conference just himself the roya and the royas secretary the secretary sat at the end of the table along with a pile of paper new quills and a ready supply of ink the fox sat on the long side fiddling with a game of castles and riders its pieces exquisitely carved of coral and jade the board fashioned of polished malachite onyx and white marble cazaril bowed and at the royas wave of invitation seated himself across from him do you play the fox inquired no my lord said cazaril regretfully or only very indifferently ah pity the fox pushed the board a little to one side bergon is very warmed with your description of this paragon of chalion you do your job well ambassador that is all my hope the roya touched iselles letter of credential lying on the glossy wood extraordinary document you know it binds the royesse to whatever you sign in her name yes sir her authority to charge you so is questionable you know there is the matter of her age for one thing well sir if you do not recognize her right to make her own marriage treaty i suppose theres nothing for me to do but mount my horse and ride back to chalion no no i didnt say i questioned it a slight panic tinged the old royas voice cazaril suppressed a smile indeed sir to treat with us is public acknowledgment of her authority hm indeed indeed young people so trusting its why we old people must guard their interests he picked up the other list cazaril had given him last night ive studied your suggested clauses for the marriage contract we have much to discuss excuse me sir those are not suggested those are required if you wish to propose additional items i will hear you the roya arched his brows at him surely not just taking onethis matter of inheritance during the minority of their heir if they are so blessed one accident with a horse and the royina of chalion becomes regent of ibra it wont do bergon bears the risks of the battlefield which his wife will not well which we hope she will not or else i am curiously poorly informed of the history of ibra my lord i thought the royses mother won two sieges the fox cleared his throat in any case cazaril continued we maintain that the risk is reciprocal and so must be the clause iselle bears the risks of childbirth which bergon never will one breech birth and he could become regent of chalion how many of your wives have outlived you sir the fox took a breath paused and went on and then theres this naming clause a few minutes of gentle argument determined that bergon dy ibrachalion was no more euphonious than bergon dy chalionibra and that clause too was allowed to stand the fox pursed his lips and frowned thoughtfully i understand you are a landless man lord cazaril how is it that the royesse does not reward you as befits your rank she rewards me as befits hers iselle is not royina of chalionyet huh i on the other hand am the present roya of ibra and have the power to dispense much cazaril merely smiled encouraged the fox spoke of an elegant villa overlooking the sea and placed a coral castle piece upon the table between them fascinated to see where this was going cazaril refrained from observing how little he cared for the sight of the sea the fox spoke of fine horses and an estate to graze them upon and how inappropriate he found clause three some riders were added cazaril made neutral noises the fox breathed delicately of the money whereby a man might dress himself as befit an ibran rank rather higher than castillar and how clause six might profitably be rewritten a jade castle piece joined the growing set the secretary made notes with each wordless murmur from cazaril both respect and contempt grew in the foxs eyes though as the pile grew he remarked in a tone of some pain you play better than i expected castillar at last the fox sat back and waved at his little pile of offering symbols how does it suit you cazaril what do you think this girl can give you that i cannot better eh cazarils smile broadened to a cheerful grin why sir i believe she will give me an estate in chalion that will suit me perfectly one pace wide and two paces long to be mine in perpetuity gently so as not to imply an insult either given or taken he stretched out his hand and pushed the pieces back toward the fox i should probably explain i bear a tumor in my gut that i expect to kill me shortly these prizes are for living men i think not dying ones the foxs lips moved astonishment and dismay flickered in his face and the faintest flash of unaccustomed shame quickly suppressed a brief bark of laughter escaped him five gods the girl has wit and ruthlessness enough to teach me my trade no wonder she gave you such powers by the bastards balls shes sent me an unbribeable ambassador three thoughts marched across cazarils mind first that iselle had no such crafty plan second that were it to be pointed out to her she would say hm and file the notion away against some future need and third that the fox did not need to know about the first the fox sobered staring more closely at cazaril i am sorry for your affliction castillar it is no laughing matter bergons mother died of a tumor in her breast taken untimely youngjust thirtysix she was all the grief she married in me could not daunt her but at the end ah well im thirtysix cazaril couldnt help observing rather sadly the fox blinked you dont look well then no cazaril agreed he picked up the list of clauses now sir about this marriage contract in the end cazaril gave away nothing on his list and obtained agreement to it all the fox rueful and reeling offered some intelligent additions to the contingency clauses to which cazaril happily agreed the fox whined a little for forms sake and made frequent reference to the submission due a husband from a wifealso not a prominent feature of recent ibran history cazaril diplomatically did not point outand to the unnatural strongmindedness of women who rode too much take heart sir cazaril consoled him it is not your destiny today to win a royacy for your son it is to win an empire for your grandson the fox brightened even his secretary smiled finally the fox offered him the castles and riders set for a personal memento for myself i think i shall decline said cazaril eyeing the elegant pieces regretfully a better thought struck him but if you care to have them packaged up i should be pleased to carry them back to chalion as your personal betrothal gift to your future daughterinlaw the fox laughed and shook his head would that i had a courtier who offered me so much loyalty for so little reward do you truly want nothing for yourself cazaril i want time the fox snorted regretfully dont we all for that you must apply to the gods not the roya of ibra cazaril let this one pass though his lips twitched id at least like to live to see iselle safely wed this is a gift you can indeed give me sir by hastening these matters along he added and it is truly urgent that bergon become royseconsort of chalion before martou dy jironal can become regent of chalion even the fox was forced to nod judiciously at this that night after the royas customary banquet and after hed shaken off bergon who if he could not stuff him with the honors cazaril steadfastly declined seemed to want to stuff him at least with food cazaril stopped in at the temple its high round halls were quiet and somber at this hour nearly empty of worshippers though the wall lights as well as the central fire burned steadily and a couple of acolytes kept night watch he returned their cordial good evenings and walked through the tiledecorated archway into the daughters court beautiful prayer rugs were woven by the maidens and ladies of ibra who donated them to the temples as a pious act saving the knees and bodies of petitioners from the marble chill of the floors cazaril thought that if the custom were imported to chalion along with bergon it could well improve the rate of winter worship there mats of all sizes colors and designs were ranged around the ladys altar cazaril chose a broad thick one dense with wool and slightly blurry representations of spring flowers and laid himself down upon it prayer not drunken sleep he reminded himself was his purpose here on the way to ibra hed seized the chance at every rural rudimentary daughters house while ferda saw to the horses to pray for oricos preservation for iselles and betrizs safety for istas solace above all intimidated by the foxs reputation hed begged for the success of his mission that prayer it seemed had been answered in advance how far in advance his outflung hands traced over the threads of his rug passed loop by loop through some patient womans hands or maybe she hadnt been patient maybe shed been tired or irritated or distracted or hungry or angry maybe she had been dying but her hands had kept moving all the same how long have i been walking down this road once he would have traced his allegiance to the ladys affairs to a coin dropped in the baocian winter mud by a clumsy soldier now he was by no means so sure and by no means sure he liked the new answer the nightmare of the galleys came before the coin in the mud had all his pain and fear and agony there been manipulated by the gods to their ends was he nothing but a puppet on a string or was that a mule on a rope balky and stubborn to be whipped along he scarcely knew whether he felt wonder or rage he considered umegats insistence that gods could not seize a mans will but only wait for it to be offered when had he signed up for that oh then one starving cold desperate night at gotorget hed walked his commanders rounds upon the battlements on the highest tower hed dismissed the famished fainting boy on guard to go below for a time and get what refreshment he could and stood the watch himself hed stared out at the enemys campfires glowing mockingly in the ruined village in the valley on the ridges all around speaking of abundant warmth and cooking food and confidence and all the things his company lacked within the walls and thought of how hed schemed and temporized and exhorted his men to faithfulness plugged holes fought sorties scraped for unclean food bloodied his sword at the scaling ladders and above all prayed till hed come to the end of prayers in his youth at cazaril hed followed the common path of most highborn young men and become a lay dedicat of the brothers order with its military promises and aspirations hed sent up his prayers when hed bothered to pray at all by rote to the god assigned to him by his sex his age and his rank on the tower in the dark it seemed to him that following that unquestioned path had brought him step by step into this impossible snare abandoned by his own side and his god both hed worn his brothers medal inside his shirt since the ceremony of his dedication at age thirteen just before hed left cazaril to be apprenticed as a page in the old provincars household that night on the tower tears of fatigue and despairand yes ragerunning down his face hed torn it off and flung it over the battlement denying the god whod denied him the spinning slip of gold had disappeared into the darkness without a sound and hed flung himself prone on the stones as he lay now and sworn that any other god could pick him up who willed or none so long as the men who had trusted him were let out of this trap as for himself he was done done nothing of course happened well eventually it started to rain in time hed picked himself back up off the pavement ashamed of his tantrum grateful that none of his men had witnessed the performance the next watch came on and hed gone down in silence where nothing more happened for some weeks till the arrival of that wellfed courier with the news that it had all been in vain and all their blood and sacrifice was to be sold for gold to go into dy jironals coffers and his men were marched to safety and his feet alone went down another road what was it that ista had said the gods most savage curses come to us as answers to our own prayers prayer is a dangerous business so in choosing to share ones will with the gods was it enough to choose once like signing up to a military company with an oath or did one have to choose and choose and choose again every day or was it both could he step off this road anytime get on a horse and ride to say darthaca to a new name a new life just like umegats postulated hundred other cazarils whod not even shown up for duty abandoning of course all whod trusted him iselle and ista and the provincara palli and betriz but not alas dondo he squirmed a little on the mat uncomfortably aware of the pressure in his belly trying to convince himself it was just the foxs banquet and not his tumor creeping to hideous new growth racing to some grotesque completion waiting only for the ladys hand to falter maybe the gods had learned from istas mistake from dy lutezs failure of nerve as well maybe they were making sure their mule couldnt desert in the middle like dy lutez this time except into death that door was always ajar what waited him on the other side the bastards hell ghostly dissolution peace bah on the other side of the temple plaza in the daughters house what waited him was a nice soft bed that his brain had reached this feverish spin was a good sign he ought to go get in it this wasnt prayer anyway it was just argument with the gods prayer he suspected as he hoisted himself up and turned for the door was putting one foot in front of the other moving all the same at the last moment with principles agreed upon treaties written out in multiple copies in a fair court hand signed by all parties and their witnesses and sealed practicalities nearly brought all to a halt the fox not without reason in cazarils view balked at sending his son into chalion with so little guarantee of his personal safety but the roya had neither the men nor the money in his warweary royacy to raise a large force to guard bergon and cazaril was fearful of the effect upon chalion of taking arms across the border even in so fair a cause their debate grew heated the fox shamed by the reminder that he owed bergons very life to cazaril took to avoiding cazarils petitions in a way that reminded cazaril forcibly of orico cazaril received iselles first ciphered letter via the relay of couriers from the daughters order that he had set up on their outbound route it had been penned just four days after he had left cardegoss and was brief simply confirming that teidezs funeral rites had taken place without incident and that iselle would leave the capital that afternoon with his cortege for valenda and the interment she noted with obvious relief our prayers were answeredthe sacred animals showed the son of autumn has taken him up after all i pray he will find ease in the gods good company she added my eldest brother lives and has back sight in one eye but he remains very swollen he stays at home abed more chillingly she reported our enemy has set two of his nieces as ladiesinwaiting in my household i will not be able to write often the lady speed your embassy he looked in vain for a postscript from betriz nearly missing it till he turned the paper over minute numbers in her distinctive hand lay halfhidden beneath the cracked wax of the seal itself he scraped at the residue with his thumbnail the brief notation thus revealed led him to a page toward the back of the book one of ordols most lyrical prayers a passionate plea for the safety of a beloved one who traveled far from home how many yearsdecadeshad it been since someone far away had prayed just for him cazaril wasnt even sure if this had been meant for his eyes or only for those of the gods but he touched the tiny cipher secretly to the five sacred points lingering a little on his lips before leaving his chamber to seek bergon he shared the other side of the letter with the royse who studied it and the code system with fascination cazaril composed a brief note telling of the success of his mission and bergon his tongue clamped between his teeth laboriously ciphered out a letter in his own hand to go to his new betrothed along with it cazaril counted days in his head it was impossible that dy jironal not have spies in the court of ibra sooner or later cazarils appearance there must be reported back to cardegoss how soon would dy jironal guess that cazarils negotiations on iselles behalf had prospered so stunningly would he seize the royesses person would he calculate cazarils next move would he try to intercept bergon in chalion after several days of the deadlock over the royses safety cazaril in a burst of genius sent bergon in to argue his own case this was an envoy the fox could not evade not even in his private chambers bergon was young and energetic his imagination passionately engaged and the fox was old and tired worse or perhaps from cazarils point of view better a town in south ibra of the late heirs party rose in arms about some failure of treaty and the fox was forced to muster men to ride out to pacify it again frenzied with the dilemma torn between his great hopes and his icy fears for his sole surviving son the fox threw the resolution back upon bergon and his coterie resolution cazaril was discovering was one thing bergon did not lack the royse quickly endorsed cazarils scheme to travel lightly and in disguise across the hostile country between the ibran border and valenda for escort bergon chose besides cazaril and the dy guras only three close companions two young ibran lords dy tagille and dy cembuer and the only slightly older march dy sould the enthusiastic dy tagille proposed that they travel as a party of ibran merchants bound for cardegoss cazaril did insist that all the men noble or humble who rode with the royse be experienced in arms the group assembled within a day of bergons decision in what cazaril prayed was secrecy at one of dy tagilles manors outside zagosur it was not cazaril discovered so small a company as all that with servants it came to over a dozen mounted men and a baggage train of half a dozen mules in addition the servants led four fine matched white ibran mountain ponies meant as a gift for bergons betrothed in the meantime doubling as spare mounts they started off in high spirits the companions obviously thought it a high and noble adventure bergon was more sober and thoughtful which pleased cazaril who felt as though he were leading a party of children into caverns of madness but at least in bergons case not blindly which was better than the gods had done for him cazaril reflected darkly he wondered if the curse could be tricking him leading them all into war and not out of it dy jironal hadnt started out so corrupt either being limited to the speed of the slowest pack mule the pace was not so painful as the race to zagosur had been the climb up from the coast to the base of the bastards teeth took four full days another letter from iselle caught up with cazaril there this one written some fourteen days after hed departed cardegoss she reported teidez buried with due ceremony in valenda and her success in her ploy of remaining there extending her visit to her bereaved mother and grandmother dy jironal had been forced to return to cardegoss by reports of oricos worsening ill health unfortunately he had left behind not only his female spies but also several companies of soldiers to guard chalions new heiress im taking thought what to do about them iselle reported a turn of phrase that brought up the hairs on the back of cazarils neck she also included a private letter to bergon which cazaril passed along unopened bergon didnt share its contents but he smiled frequently over ordols pages as he deciphered it head bent close to the candles in their stuffy inn chamber more encouragingly the provincara had included a letter of her own declaring that iselle had received private promises of support for the ibran marriage not only from her uncle the provincar of baocia but three other provincars as well bergon would have defenders when he arrived when cazaril showed this note to bergon the royse nodded decisively good we go on they suffered a check nonetheless here when discouraged travelers coming back down the road to their inn that night reported the pass blocked with new snow consulting the map and his memory cazaril led the company instead a days ride to the north to a higher and less frequented pass still reported clear the reports proved correct but two horses strained their hocks on the climb as they neared the divide the march dy sould who claimed himself more comfortable on the deck of a ship than the back of a horse and who had been growing quieter and quieter all morning suddenly leaned over the side of his saddle and vomited the company bunched to a wheezing halt on the trail while cazaril bergon and ferda consulted and the usually witty dy sould mumbled embarrassed and disturbingly muddled apologies and protests should we stop and build a fire and try to warm him the royse asked in worry staring around the desolate slopes cazaril himself standing halfbentover replied hes dazed as a man in a high fever but hes not hot hes seacoastbred i think this is not an infection but rather a sickness that sometimes overcomes lowlanders in the heights in either case it will be better to care for him down out of this miserable rocky wilderness ferda eyeing him sideways asked how are you doing my lord bergon too frowned at him in concern nothing that stopping and sitting down here will improve lets push on they mounted again bergon riding near to dy sould when the trail permitted the sick man clung to his saddle with grim determination within half an hour foix gave a thin and breathless whoop and pointed to the cairn of rocks that marked the ibrachalion border the company cheered and paused briefly to add their stones they began the descent steeper even than the climb dy sould grew no worse reassuring cazaril of his diagnosis cazaril grew no better but then he didnt expect to in the afternoon they came over the lower lip of a barren vale and dropped into a thick pine wood the air seemed richer here even if only with the sharp delicious scent of the pines and the bed of needles underfoot cushioned the horses sore feet the sighing trees sheltered them all from the winds prying fingers as they rounded a curve cazarils ears picked up the muffled thump of trotting hooves from the path ahead the first fellow traveler they had encountered all day just one rider though so no danger to their number the rider was a grizzled man with fierce bushy eyebrows and beard dressed in stained leathers he hailed them and a little to cazarils surprise pulled up his shaggy horse across their path i am castle warder to the castillar dy zavar we saw your company coming down the vale when the clouds broke my lord sends me to warn you there is a storm blowing up the valley he invites you to shelter with him till the worst is past dy tagille greeted this offer of hospitality with delight bergon dropped back and lowered his voice to cazaril do you think we ought caz im not sure he tried to think if hed ever heard of a castillar dy zavar bergon glanced at his friend dy sould drooping over his pommel id give much to get him indoors we are many and armed cazaril allowed wed not make good speed in a blizzard besides the risk of losing the trail the grizzled castle warder called out suit yourselves gentlemen but since its my job to collect the bodies from the ditches in this district come spring id take it as a personal favor if youd accept the storm will blow through before morning id guess well im glad we at least got over the pass before this broke yes decided bergon he raised his voice we thank you sir and do accept your lords kind offer the grizzled man saluted and nudged his horse back down the road a mile farther on he wheeled to the left and led them up a fainter trail through the tall dark pines the path dropped then rose steeply for a time zigzagging the horses haunches bunched and surged pushing them uphill away through the trees cazaril could hear the distant squabbling and cawing of a flock of crows and was comforted in memory they broke out into the gray light upon a rocky spur perched on the outcrop rose a small and rather dilapidated fortress built of undressed native stone an encouraging curl of smoke rose from its chimney they passed under a fieldstone arch into a courtyard paved with slates a stable opened directly onto it as well as a broad wooden portico over the doors leading into the main hall its margins were cluttered with tools barrels and odd trash curing deer hides were nailed up to the stable wall some toughlooking men servants or grooms or guards or all three in this rough rural household moved from the portico to help with the partys horses and mules but it was the nearly half dozen new ghosts whirling frantically about the courtyard that opened cazarils eyes wide and stopped the breath in his throat that they were fresh he could tell by their crisp gray outlines still holding the forms theyd had in life three men a woman and a weeping boy the womanshape pointed to the grizzled man white fire streamed from her mouth silent screams cazaril jerked his horse back beside bergons leaned over and muttered this is a trap look to your weapons pass the word bergon fell back beside dy tagille who in turn bent to speak quietly to a pair of the partys grooms cazaril smiled in dissimulation and sidled his horse over to foixs where he held up his hand before his mouth as if sharing a jest and repeated the warning foix smiled blandly and nodded his eyes darted around the courtyard counting up the odds as he leaned toward his brother the odds did not seem ill but for that rangy lout up on the wooden perch beside the gate leaning against the inner wall a crossbow dangling as if casually from his hand except that it was cocked cazaril maneuvered back by bergon putting himself and his horse between the royse and the gate ware bowman he breathed duck under a mule the ghosts were darting from place to place about the yard pointing out concealed men behind the barrels and tools shadowed in the stalls and apparently waiting just inside the main door cazaril revised his opinion of the odds the grizzled man motioned to one of his men and the gate swung shut behind the party cazaril twisted in his saddle and dug his hand into his saddlebag his fingers touched silk then the smooth coolness of round beads he had not pawned dondos pearls in zagosur because the price was disadvantageous there so close to the source he swept his hand up drawing out the glistening rope of them in a grand gesture as he swung the string around his head he popped the cord with his thumb pearls spewed off the end of the line and bounced about the slatepaved court the startled toughs laughed and began to dive for them cazaril dropped his arm and shouted now the grizzled commander who had apparently been just about to shout a similar order was taken aback cazarils men drew steel first falling upon the distracted enemy cazaril half fell out of his saddle just before a crossbow bolt thunked into it his horse reared and bolted and he scrambled to pull his own sword out of its scabbard foix bless the boy had managed to get his own crossbow quietly unshipped before the chaos of shouting men and plunging horses struck one of the male ghosts streaked past cazarils inner eye and pointed at an obscured shape dodging along the top of the portico cazaril tapped foixs arm and shouted up there foix cocked and whirled just as a second bowman popped up cazaril could swear the frantic ghost tried to guide the quarrel it entered the bowmans right eye and dropped him instantly foix ducked and began recocking the ratcheting mechanism whirred cazaril turning to seek an enemy found one seeking him from the main door steel drawn barged a startlingly familiar form ser dy joal dy jironals stirrupman whom cazaril had last seen in cardegoss cazaril raised his sword just in time to deflect dy joals first furious blow his belly twinged cramped then knotted agonizingly as they circled briefly for advantage and then dy joal bore in the excruciating belly pain drained the strength from cazarils arm almost doubling him over he barely beat off the next attack and counterattack was suddenly out of the question out of the corner of his eye he saw the female ghost curl tightly in upon herself sheor was that a pearlor both united somehow slid under dy joals boot dy joal skidded violently and unexpectedly forward flailing for balance cazarils point rammed through his throat and lodged briefly in the bones of his neck a hideous shock ran up cazarils arm not just his belly but his whole body seemed to cramp and his vision blurred and darkened within him dondo screamed in triumph the death demon surged up like a whirling fire behind his eyes eager and implacable cazaril convulsed vomiting in cazarils uncontrolled recoil his sword ripped out sideways vessels spurted and dy joal collapsed at his feet in a welter of blood cazaril found himself on his hands and knees on the icy slates his sword dropped from his nerveless hand still ringing faintly he was trembling all over so badly he could not stand up again he spat bile from his watering mouth on his swords point as it lay on the stone dy joals wet blood steamed and smoked blackening surges of nausea swept through his swollen and pulsing abdomen inside him dondo wailed and howled in frustrated rage slowly smothered again to silence the demon settled back like a stalking cat on its belly watchful and tense cazaril clenched and unclenched his hand just to be sure he was still in possession of his own body so the death demon wasnt fussy whose souls filled its buckets so long as there were two of them cazarils and dondos cazarils and some other killersor victimshe wasnt just sure which or if it even mattered under the circumstances dondo clearly had hoped to cling to his body and let cazarils soul be ripped away leaving dondo in so to speak possession dondos goals and those of the demon were it seemed slightly divergent the demon would be happy if cazaril died in any way at all dondo wanted a murder or a murdering sunk strengthless to the stones tears leaking between his eyelids cazaril became aware that the noise had died down a hand touched his elbow and he flinched foixs distressed voice came to his ear my lord my lord are you wounded not not stabbed cazaril got out he blinked wheezing he reached out for his blade then jerked his hand back fingertips stinging the steel was hot to the touch ferda appeared on his other side and the two brothers drew him to his feet he stood shivering with reaction are you sure youre all right said ferda that darkhaired lady in cardegoss promised us the royesse would have our ears if we did not bring you back to her alive yes put in foix and that she would have the rest of our skins for a drum head thereafter your skins are safe for now cazaril rubbed his watering eyes and straightened a little staring around a sergeantlylooking groom sword out had half a dozen of the toughs lying facedown on the slates in surrender three more bandits sat leaning against the stable wall moaning and bleeding another servant was dragging up the body of the dead crossbowman cazaril scowled down at dy joal lying sprawled before him they hadnt exchanged a single word in their brief encounter he was deeply sorry hed torn out the bravos lying throat his presence here implied much but confirmed nothing was he dy jironals agent or acting on his own the leaderwhere is he i want to put him to the question over there my lordfoix pointedbut im afraid he wont be answering bergon was just rising from the examination of an unmoving body the grizzled man alas ferda said uneasily in a tone of apology he fought fiercely and wouldnt surrender he had wounded two of our grooms so foix finally downed him with a crossbow bolt do you think he really was the castle warder here my lord foix added no bergon picked his way over to him sword in hand and looked him up and down in worry what do we do now caz the female ghost grown somewhat less agitated was beckoning him toward the gate one of the male ghosts equally urgent was beckoning him toward the main door i i follow momentarily what said bergon cazaril tore his gaze away from what only his inner eye saw lock themhe nodded toward their surrendered foesup in a stall and set a guard whole and wounded together for now well tend to them after our own then send a body of able men to search the premises see if there are any more hiding or or anybody else hiding or whatever his eye returned to the gate where the streaming woman beckoned again foix bring your bow and sword and come with me should we not take more men lord no i dont think so leaving bergon and ferda to direct the moppingup cazaril at last headed for the gate foix followed staring as cazaril turned without hesitation down a path into the pines as they walked along it the cries of the crows grew louder cazaril braced himself the path opened out onto the edge of a steep ravine bastards hell whispered foix he lowered his bow and touched the five theological points foreheadlipnavelgroinheart in a warding gesture theyd found the bodies they were thrown upon the midden tumbled down the edge of the crevasse atop years of kitchen and stable yard waste one younger man two older in this rural place it was not possible to distinguish certainly master from man by dress as all wore practical working leathers and woolens the woman plump and homely and middleaged was stripped naked as was the boy who appeared to have been about five both mutilated according to a cruel humor violated too probably dead about a day cazaril judged by the progress the crows had made the womanghost was weeping silently and the childghost clung to her and wailed they were not godrejected souls then just sundered still dizzied from their deaths and unable to find their way without proper ceremonies cazaril fell to his knees and whispered lady if i am alive in this place you must be too if it please you give these poor spirits ease the ghostly faces changed rippling from woe to wonder the insubstantial bodies blurred like sun diffractions in a high feathered cloud then vanished after about a minute cazaril said muzzily help me up please the bewildered foix levered him up with a hand under his elbow cazaril staggered around and started back up the path my lord should we not look around for others no thats all foix followed him without another word in the slatepaved courtyard they found ferda and an armed groom just emerging again from the main doorway did you find anyone else cazaril asked him no my lord beside the door only the young male ghost still lingered although its luminescent body seemed to be ribboning away like smoke in a wind it writhed in a kind of agony gesturing cazaril on what dire urgency was it that turned it from the open arms of the goddess to cling to this wounded world yes yes im coming cazaril told it it slipped inside cazaril motioned foix and ferda looking uneasily at him to follow on they passed through the main hall and under a gallery back through the kitchens and down some wooden stairs to a dark stonewalled storeroom did you search in here cazaril called over his shoulder yes my lord said ferda get more light he stared intently at the ghost which was now circling the room in agitation whirling in a tightening spiral cazaril pointed move those barrels foix rolled them aside ferda clattered back down from the kitchen with a brace of tallow candles their flames yellow and smoky but bright in the gloom concealed beneath the barrels they found a stone slab in the floor with an iron ring set in it cazaril motioned to foix again the boy grabbed the ring and strained and shifted the slab up and aside revealing narrow steps descending into utter blackness from below a faint voice cried out the ghost bent to cazaril seeming to kiss his forehead hands and feet and then streamed away into eternity a faint blue sparkle like a chord of music made visible glittered for a moment in cazarils second sight and was gone ferda the candles in one hand and his drawn sword in the other cautiously descended the stone steps clamor and babble wafted back up through the dank slot in a few moments ferda appeared again supporting up the stairs a disheveled stout old man his face bruised and battered his legs shaking following in his wake weeping for gladness a dozen other equally shattered people climbed one by one the freed prisoners all fell upon ferda and foix with questions and tales at once inundating them cazaril leaned unobtrusively upon a barrel and pieced together the picture the stout man proved the real castillar dy zavar a distraught middleaged woman his castillara and two young people a son and ain cazarils view miraculously spareddaughter the rest were servants and dependents of this rural household dy joal and his troop had descended upon them yesterday at first seeming merely rough travelers only when a couple of the bravos had made to molest the castillars cook and her husband and the real castle warder had gone to her defense and attempted to eject the unwelcome visitors had steel been drawn it truly was the houses custom to take in benighted or stormthreatened wayfarers from the road over the pass no one here had known or recognized dy joal or any of his men the old castillar gripped ferdas cloak anxiously my elder son does he live have you seen him he went to my castle warders aid was he a young man of about these mens agecazaril nodded to the dy gura brothersdressed in wool and leathers like your own aye the old mans face drained in anticipation he is in the care of the gods and much comforted there cazaril reported factually cries of grief greeted this news wearily cazaril mounted the stairs to the kitchen in the mobs wake as they spread out to regain their house recover their dead and care for the wounded my lord ferda murmured to him as cazaril paused briefly to warm himself by the kitchen fire had you ever been to this house before no then how did youi heard nothing when i looked in that cellar i would have left those poor people to die of thirst and hunger and madness in the dark i think dy joals men would have confessed to them before the night was done cazaril frowned grimly among the many other things i intend to learn from them the captured bravos under a duress cazaril was happy to allow and the freed housemen eager to supply told their half of the tale soon enough they were a mixed lot including some lawless and impoverished discharged soldiers who had followed the grizzled man and a few local hirelings one of whom had led them to dy zavars holding for sake of its amazing vantage of the road from its highest tower dy joal riding to the ibran border alone and in a hurry had picked them all up from a town at the foot of these mountains where they had formerly eked out a living alternating between guarding travelers and robbing them the bravos knew only that dy joal had come there looking to waylay a man expected to be riding over the passes from ibra they did not know who their new employer really was although theyd despised his courtiers clothes and mannerisms it was abundantly clear to cazaril that dy joal had not been in control of the men hed hastily hired when the altercation about the cook had tipped over into violence hed not had either the nerve or the muscle to stop it administer discipline or restore order before events had run their ugly course bergon disturbed drew cazaril aside in the flickering torchlight of the courtyard where this roughandready interrogation was taking place caz did i bring this wretched chance down upon poor dy zavars good people no royse its clear dy joal was expecting only me riding back as iselles courier chancellor dy jironal has sought to tear me from her service for some timesecretly assassinate me if there proved no other way how i wish i hadnt killed that fool id give my teeth to know how much dy jironal knows by now are you sure the chancellor set this trap cazaril hesitated dy joal had a personal grudge against me but the world knew merely that id ridden to valenda dy joal could only have had surmise of my true route from dy jironal therefore we may be certain dy jironal had some report of me from his spies in ibra his knowledge of our real aim lagsbut not i think by much dy joal was a stopgap hurriedly dispatched and certainly not the only such agent something else must follow how soon i dont know dy jironal commands the order of the son he can draw on its men as soon as he can evolve a plausible enough lie by which to move them bergon tapped his sheathed sword against his leatherclad thigh and frowned up at the sky which was clearing as evening fell the mountain spines to the west were black silhouettes against a lingering green glow and the first stars shone overhead the grizzled mans tale of an approaching blizzard had proved a mere decoy although a light snow squall that had blown through earlier might have been the seed of the idea the moon is nearly full and will be well up by midnight if we ride both night and day perchance we can push across this disturbed country before dy jironal can bring up any more reinforcements cazaril nodded let him rush his men to patrol a border that were already across good i like it bergon studied him in doubt but will you be able to ride caz id rather ride than fight bergon sighed agreement yes the grateful grieving castillar dy zavar pressed all the refreshment his disrupted household could spare upon them bergon decided to leave the mules injured grooms and lamed horses in his care to follow on when they could and lighten his own party thereby ferda selected the fastest soundest horses and made sure they were rubbed down well and fed and rested until time to start march dy sould had recovered after a few hours of rest in this more nourishing air and insisted on accompanying the royse dy cembuer who had suffered a broken arm and some freely bleeding cuts in the courtyard fight undertook to stay with the grooms and baggage and assist dy zavar until all were ready to travel the problem of justice upon the brigands cazaril was relieved to leave to their victims bergons midnight departure would spare them having to witness the hangings at dawn he left the scattered portion of dondos pearls for the stricken household to collect and tucked the remains of the rope back in his saddlebag the royses cavalcade took to the road again when the moon rose over the hills before them filling the snowy vales with liquid light there would be no turning aside now before valenda they retraced cazarils outbound route across western chalion changing horses at obscure rural posts of the daughters order at every stop he inquired anxiously for any further ciphered messages from iselle or news from valenda that might reveal the tactical situation into which they rushed he grew increasingly uneasy at the absence of letters in the original plan they had envisioned iselle waiting with her grandmother and mother guarded by her uncle dy baocias troops cazaril feared this ideal condition no longer held they checked at midevening twentyfive miles short of valenda at the village of palma the region around palma was noted for its fine pasturage a post of the daughters order there devoted itself to raising and training remounts for the temple cazaril was certain of obtaining fresh horses in palma he prayed for fresh intelligence as well cazaril did not so much dismount from his blown horse as fall slowly all in a piece as if his body were carved from a single block of wood both ferda and foix had to support him through the orders sprawling compound they brought him into a shabbily comfortable chamber where a bright fire burned in a fieldstone fireplace a plain pine table had been hastily cleared of someones card game the dedicatcommander of the post hurried in to wait upon them the man glanced uncertainly from dy tagille to dy sould his gaze passed over bergon whod dressed as a groom since the border for cautions sake the commander fell into apologetic confusion when the royse was introduced and sent his lieutenant scurrying for food and drink to offer his distinguished company cazaril sat by the table in a cushioned chair wonderfully unlike a saddle even if the room did still seem to be rocking around him he was beginning to dislike horses almost as much as he disliked boats his head felt stuffed with wool and his body didnt bear thinking about he broke into the exchange of courtly amenities to croak what word have you from valenda do you hold any new messages from the royesse iselle ferda pressed a glass of watered wine into his hand and he gulped half of it at once the dedicatcommander gave him a little understanding headshake his lips tightening chancellor dy jironal marched a thousand more of his men into the town last week he has another thousand bivouacked along the river they patrol the countryside looking for you searchers have stopped here twice he holds valenda tight in his grip didnt provincar dy baocia have any men there yes two companies but they were badly outnumbered no one would start the fight at royse teidezs interment and after that they dared not have you heard from march dy palliar he used to bring the letters weve had no direct word from the royesse for five days its rumored that she is very ill and sees no one bergons eyes widened in alarm cazaril squinted and rubbed his aching head ill iselle well maybe or else held closeconfined by dy jironal and the illness a tale put about had one of cazarils letters fallen into the wrong hands he had feared they might have to either spirit the royesse out of valenda or break her free by force of arms preferably the former he hadnt planned what to do if she had fallen perhaps too sick to ride at this critical moment his muzzy brain evolved a mad vision of somehow sneaking bergon in to her over the rooftops and balconies like a lover in a poem no a night of secret love between them might break the curse channel it back somehow to the gods who had spilled it but he couldnt see how it would miraculously make away with two thousand or so very fleshly soldiers does orico still live he asked at last as far as weve heard we can do nothing more tonight he wouldnt trust any plan that came out of his tired brain tonight tomorrow foix and ferda and i will go into valenda on foot in disguise and reconnoiter i promise you i can pass for a road vagabond if we cant see our way clear then fall back to provincar dy baocias people in taryoon and plan again can you walk my lord asked foix in a dubious voice right now he wasnt sure if he could stand up he glowered helplessly at foix who was tired but resilient pink rather than gray after days in the saddle youth eh by tomorrow i will he rubbed his face do dy jironals men realize they are not guardians but prisonkeepers that they are being led into possible treason against the rightful heiress the dedicatcommander sat back and opened his hands such charges are being flung about like snowballs from both parties right now rumors that the royesse has sent agents into ibra to contract a marriage with the new heir are flying everywhere he gave royse bergon an apologetic nod so much for the secrecy of his mission he considered the pitfalls of potential party lines in chalion iselle and orico versus dy jironal all right iselle versus orico and dy jironal hideously dangerous the news has had a mixed reception the commander continued the ladies look on bergon with approval and want to make a romance of it all because its said that he is brave and wellfavored soberer heads worry that iselle may sell chalion to the fox because she is ah young and inexperienced in other words foolish and flighty sober heads had much to learn cazarils lips drew back on a dry grin no he mumbled we have not done that he realized that he was speaking to his knees his forehead having unaccountably sunk to the table and anchored there after about a minute bergons voice murmured gently in his ear caz are you awake mm would you like to go to bed my lord the dedicatcommander inquired after another pause mm he whimpered a little as strong hands under each arm forced him to his feet ferda and foix leading him off somewhere cruelly the table had been soft enough he didnt even remember falling into the bed someone was shaking his shoulder a hideously cheerful voice bellowed in his ear rise and ride captain sunshine he spasmed and clawed at his covers tried to sit up and thought better of the effort he pulled open his gluedshut eyelids blinking in the candlelight the identity of the voice finally penetrated palli youre alive he meant to shout joyfully at least it came out audibly what time is it he struggled again to sit up making it onto one elbow he seemed to be in some evicted officerdedicats plainly furnished bedchamber about an hour before dawn weve been riding all night iselle sent me to find you he raised his brace of candles higher bergon was standing anxiously at his shoulder and foix too bastards demons caz you look like death on a trencher that has been observed he lay back down palli was here palli was here and all was well he could shove bergon and all his burdens off onto him lie here and not get up die alone and in peace taking dondo out of the world with him take royse bergon and his company to iselle leave me what for dy jironals patrols to find not if i value my future fortune as a courtier iselle wants you safe with her in taryoon taryoon not valenda he blinked safe this time he did struggle up and all the way to his feet where he passed out the black fog lifted and he found bergon roundeyed holding him slumped on the edge of the bed sit a minute with your head down palli advised cazaril obediently bent over his aching belly if dondo had visited him last night hed not been home the ghost had kicked him a few times in his sleep though it felt like from the inside out bergon said softly he ate nothing when we came in last night he collapsed straightaway and we put him to bed right said palli and jerked his thumb at the hovering foix who nodded and slipped out of the room taryoon cazaril mumbled from the vicinity of his knees aye she gave all two thousand of dy jironals men the slip she did well first of all before that her uncle dy baocia pulled his men out and went home the fools let him go thought it was a danger removed from their midst yes and made free to move at will then iselle rode out five days running always with a troop of dy jironals cavalry for escort and gave them more exercise than they cared for had em absolutely convinced she meant to escape while riding so when she and lady betriz went walking out one day with old lady dy hueltar they let her go by i was waiting with two saddled horses and two women to change cloaks with em and go back with the old lady we were gone down that ravine so fast the old provincara undertook to conceal shed flown for as long as possible pass it off that she was ill in her mothers chambers theyve doubtless tumbled to it by now but ill wager she was safe with her uncle in taryoon before valenda knew she was gone five gods those girls can ride sixty miles crosscountry between dusk and dawn under a full moon and only one change of horses girls said cazaril is lady betriz safe too oh aye both of em chipper as songbirds when i left em made me feel old cazaril squinted up at palli five years his junior but let this pass ser dy ferrej the provincara lady ista pallis face sobered still hostages in valenda they all told the girls to go on you know ah foix brought him a bowl of bean porridge hot and aromatic on a tray and bergon himself arranged his pillows and helped him sit up to eat it cazaril had thought he was ravenous yet found himself unable to force down more than a few bites palli was keen to get away while the darkness still cloaked their numbers cazaril struggled to oblige letting foix help him back into his clothes he dreaded the attempt to ride again in the posts stable yard he found that their escort a dozen men of the daughters order whod followed palli from taryoon waited with a horse litter slung between two mounts indignant at first he let bergon persuade him into it and the cavalcade swung away into the graying dark the rough back roads and trails they took made the litter jounce and sway nauseatingly after half an hour of this he cried for mercy and undertook to climb on a horse someone had thought to bring along a smoothpaced ambler for this very purpose and he clung to the saddle and endured its rippling gait while they swung wide around valenda and its occupiers patrols in the afternoon they dropped down from some wooded slopes onto a wider road and palli rode alongside him palli eyed him curiously a little sideways i hear you do miracles with mules not me the goddess cazarils smile twisted she has a way with mules it seems im also told youre strangely hard on brigands we were a strong company well armed if the brigands hadnt been set onto us by dy joal they would never have attempted us dy joal was one of dy jironals best swords foix says you took him down in seconds that was a mistake besides his foot slipped pallis lips twitched you dont have to go around telling people that you know he stared ahead between his horses bobbing ears for a time so the boy you defended on the roknari galley was bergon himself yes kidnapped by his brothers bravos it turned out now i know why the ibran fleet rowed so hard after us did you never guess who he really was then or later no he had he had a deal more selfcontrol than even i realized at the time that one will make a roya worth following when he comes into his own palli glanced ahead to where bergon rode with dy sould and signed himself in wonder the gods are on our side right enough can we fail cazaril snorted bitterly yes he thought of ista umegat the tongueless groom of the deathly straits he was in and when we fail the gods do too he didnt think hed ever quite realized that before not in those terms at least iselle was safe for now behind the shield of her uncle as heiress she would attract other ambitious men to her side she would have many not least bergon himself to protect her from her enemies although advisors wise enough to also protect her from her friends might be harder for her to come by but what provision against the looming hazards could he effect for betriz did you get the chance to know lady betriz better while you escorted the cortege to valenda and after he asked palli oh aye beautiful girl dont you think did you get much conversation with her father ser dy ferrej yes a most honorable man so i thought too shes very worried for him right now palli added i can imagine and him for her both now and later if if all goes well she will be a favorite of the future royina that kind of political influence could be worth far more to a shrewd man than a mere material dowry if the man had the wit to see it no question of it shes intelligent energetic rides well too pallis tone was oddly dry cazaril swallowed and with an effort at a casual tone got out couldnt you just see her as the future marchess dy palliar pallis mouth turned up on one side i fear my suit would be hopeless i believe she has another man in her eye judging from all the questions shes asked me about him anyway oh who he tried briefly and without success to convince himself betriz dreamed of say dy rinal or one of the other courtiers of cardegoss eh lightweights the lot of them few of the younger men had the wealth or influence and none the wit to make her a good match in fact now cazaril came to consider the matter none of them was good enough for her it was in confidence but i definitely think you should ask her all about it when we get to taryoon palli smiled and urged his horse forward cazaril considered the implications of pallis smile and of the white fur hat still tucked into his saddlebags the woman you love loves you had he any real doubt of it there was alas more than enough impediment to twist this joyous suspicion into sorrow too late too late too late for her fidelity he could return her only grief his bier would be too hard and narrow to offer as a wedding bed it was a grace note in this lethal tangle nonetheless like finding a survivor in a shipwreck or a flower blooming in a burnedover field well well she must simply get over her illfated attachment to him and he must exert the utmost selfcontrol not to encourage it in her he wondered if he could promote palli to her if he put it as the last request of a dying man fifteen miles out from taryoon they were met by a large baocian guard company they had a hand litter and relays of men to carry it aloft too far gone by now to be anything but grateful cazaril let himself be loaded into it without protest he even slept for a couple of hours lumping along wrapped in a feather quilt his aching head cushioned by pillows he woke at length and watched the dreary darkening winter landscape wobble past him like a dream so this was dying it didnt seem as bad lying down but please just let me live to see this curse lifted from iselle it was a great work one any man might look back on and say that was my life it was enough he asked nothing more now but to be permitted to finish what hed started iselles wedding and betriz made safeif the gods would but give him those two gifts he thought he could go in quiet content im tired they entered the gates of the baocian provincial capital of taryoon an hour after sunset curious citizens collected in the path of their little procession or marched beside it with torches to light the way or hurried out to watch from balconies as they passed on three occasions women tossed down flowers which after their first uncertain flinch bergons ibran companions caught it helped that the ladies had good aim the young lords sent hopeful and enthusiastic kisses through the air in return they left interested murmurs in their wake especially up on the balconies near the city center bergon and his friends escorted by palli were diverted to the town palace of the wealthy march dy huesta one of the provincars chief supporters and not coincidentally his brotherinlaw the baocian guard carried cazarils litter on at a smart pace to the provincars own new palace down the street from the cramped and lowering old fortress clutching his precious saddlebags containing the future of two countries cazaril was brought by dy baocias castle warder to a firewarmed bedchamber numerous wax lights revealed two waiting manservants with a hip bath extra hot water soap scissors scents and towels a third man bore in a tray of mild white cheese fruit cakes and quantities of hot herb tea someone was taking no chances with cazarils wardrobe and had laid out a change of clothing on the bed court mourning complete from fresh undergarments through brocades and velvets out to a silver and amethyst belt the transformation from road wreckage to courtier took barely twenty minutes from his filthy saddlebags cazaril drew his packet of documents wrapped in oilcloth around silk and checked them for dirt and bloodstains nothing untoward had leaked in he discarded the grubby oilcloth and tucked the offerings under his arm the castle warder guided cazaril through a courtyard where workmen labored by torchlight to lay down the last paving stones and into an adjoining building they passed through a series of rooms to a spacious tiled chamber softened with rugs and wall hangings manhigh iron candelabras holding five lights each intricately wrought shed a warming glow iselle sat in a large carved chair by the far wall attended by betriz and the provincar also all in court mourning they looked up as he entered the women eagerly the middleaged dy baocias expression tempered with caution iselles uncle bore only a slight resemblance to his younger sister ista being solid rather than frail though he was not overtall either and he shared istas dun hair color gone grizzled dy baocia was attended in turn by a stout man cazaril took for his secretary and an elderly fellow in the fivecolored robes of the archdivine of taryoon cazaril eyed him hopefully for any flicker of god light but he was only a plain devout the dark cloud still hung thickly about iselle in cazarils second sight though roiling in a sluggish and sullen fashion but not for much longer by the ladys grace welcome home castillar said iselle the warmth of her voice was like a caress on his brow her use of his title a covert warning cazaril signed himself five gods royesse all is well you have the treaties dy baocia asked his gaze fixing on the packets under cazarils arm he held out an anxious hand there has been much concern over them in our councils cazaril smiled slightly and walked past him to kneel at iselles feet managing with careful effort not to grunt with pain or pitch over in unseemly clumsiness he brushed his lips across the backs of the hands she held out to him and pressed the packet of documents in them and them alone as they turned palm up all is as you commanded her eyes were bright with appreciation i thank you cazaril she glanced up at her uncles secretary fetch a chair for my ambassador please he has ridden long and hard with little rest she began folding back the silk the secretary brought up a chair with a woolstuffed cushion cazaril smiled rather fixedly in thanks and considered the problem of getting up again gracefully rather to his embarrassment betriz knelt to his side and after a second more the archdivine to his other and both contrived to hoist him up betrizs dark eyes searched him lingering briefly and fearfully on his tumordistended midsection but she could do no more here than smile in encouragement iselle was reading the marriage contract though she spared a moment as cazaril seated himself to cast a small smile in his direction cazaril watched and waited as she finished each page she handed the rectangle of calligraphed and inkstamped parchment up to her hovering uncle who had them fairly snatched in turn by the archdivine the secretary was last in line but no less intent in his perusal he collected the pages reverently back into order as they came to him dy baocia clutched his hands together and watched as the archdivines eyes sped down the last page he held the parchment out silently to the stout secretary well said the provincar she hasnt sold chalion the archdivine signed himself and opened both hands palm out in thanks to the gods shes bought ibra my congratulations royesse to your ambassadorand to you to us all said dy baocia all three men were looking vastly more cheerful cazaril cleared his throat indeed but i trust you will not say as much to royse bergon the treaties are potentially advantageous to both sides after all he glanced at dy baocias secretary though perhaps it would allay peoples fears to have the articles copied out in a large fair hand and posted on the wall beside your palace doors for everyone to read dy baocia frowned uncertainly but the archdivine nodded and said a very wise suggestion castillar it would please me very much said iselle in a soft voice i pray you uncle have it seen to a breathless page burst into the chamber to skid to a stop before dy baocia and blurt your lady says royse bergons party proaches at the gate and you are to tend on her at once to welcome him im on my way the provincar took a breath and smiled at his niece and so we bring your lover to you remember now you must demand all the kisses of submission brow hands and feet chalion must be seen to rule ibra guard the pride and honor of your house we must not let him put himself above you or he will quickly become overweening you must start as you mean to go on iselles eyes narrowed around her the shadow darkened seeming to tighten its grip cazaril sat up and shot her a look of alarm and a tiny headshake royse bergon has pride also no less honorable than your own royesse and he will stand before his own lords here too she hesitated then her lips firmed i shall start as i mean to go on her voice was suddenly not soft at all but steeledged she gestured at the contract the substance of our equality is there uncle my pride demands no greater show we shall exchange the kisses of welcome each to each upon our hands alone the darkness uncurled a little cazaril felt an odd shiver as though some predatory shadow had passed over his head and flown on thwarted an admirable discretion cazaril endorsed this in relief the page dancing from foot to foot held open the door for the provincar who swept out in haste lord cazaril how was your journey betriz taxed him in this interlude you look so tired a weary lot of riding but it all went well enough he shifted in his seat and smiled up at her her dark brows arched i think we must have ferda and foix in to tell us more surely it was not so plain and dull as that well we had a little trouble with brigands in the mountains dy jironals doing im fairly sure bergon acquitted himself very well the fox went easier than i expected for a reason i didnt he leaned forward and lowered his voice to them both you remember my benchmate on the galleys i told of danni the boy of good family betriz nodded and iselle said i am not likely to forget i didnt guess how good a family danni was an alias bergon gave to keep himself secret from his captors it seems his kidnapping was a ploy of ibras late heir bergon recognized me when i stood before the ibran courthe had changed and grown almost out of reckoning iselles lips parted in astonishment after a moment she breathed surely the goddess gave you to me yes he admitted reluctantly ive come to that conclusion myself her eyes turned toward the double doors on the opposite side of the chamber her hands twisted in her lap in a sudden flush of nerves how shall i recognize him is heis he wellfavored i dont know how ladies judge such things the doors swung wide a great mob of persons surged through pages hangerson dy baocia and his wife bergon and dy sould and dy tagille and palli bringing up the rear the ibrans had been treated to baths as well and wore the best clothes theyd managed to pack in their meager bags supplemented cazaril was fairly sure with some judicious emergency borrowings bergons eyes flicked in a smiling panic from betriz to iselle and settled on iselle iselle gazed from face to face among the three strange ibrans in a momentary terror tall palli standing behind bergon pointed at the royse and mouthed this one iselles gray eyes brightened and her pale cheeks flooded with color iselle held out her hands my lord bergon dy ibra she said in a voice that only quavered a little welcome to chalion my lady iselle dy chalion bergon striding up to her returned breathlessly dy ibra thanks you he knelt to one knee and kissed her hands she bent her head and kissed his bergon rose again and introduced his companions who bowed properly with a slight scrape the provincar and the archdivine with their own hands brought up a chair for bergon and set it by iselles on the other side from cazaril from a leather pouch dy tagille held out bergon produced his royal greetinggift a necklace of fine emeraldsone of the last of his mothers pieces not pawned by the fox to buy arms the white horses unfortunately were still back on the road somewhere bergon had been going to bring a rope of new ibran pearls but had made the substitution on cazarils most earnest advice dy baocia made a little speech of welcome which would have been rather longer if iselles aunt catching her nieces eye had not seized a pause in his periods to invite the assembled company into the next room to partake of refreshments the young couple was left to have some private speech and bent their heads together largely inaudible to the eager eavesdroppers who lingered by the open doors and frequently peeked in to see how they were getting along cazaril was not least forward among this number craning his neck anxiously from his repositioned chair and alternating between nibbling on little cakes and biting his knuckles their voices grew sometimes louder sometimes softer bergon gestured and iselle twice laughed out loud and three times drew in her breath her hands going to her lips eyes widening iselle lowered her voice and spoke earnestly bergon tilted his head and listened intently and never took his eyes from her face except twice to glance out at cazaril after which they lowered their voices still further lady betriz brought him a glass of watered wine nodding at his grateful thanks cazaril felt he could guess who had taken the thought to have the hot water and servants and food and clothes waiting ready for him her fresh skin glowed golden in the candlelight smooth and youthful but her somber dress and pulledback hair lent her an unexpectedly mature elegance an ardent energy on the verge of moving into power and wisdom how did you leave things in valenda do you think cazaril asked her her smile sobered tense but we hope with iselle drawn out it will grow less so surely dy jironal will not dare offer violence to the widow and motherinlaw of roya ias mm not as his first move in desperation anything becomes possible thats true or at least people stop arguing with you about whats possible and whats not cazaril considered the young womens wild night ride that had flipped their tactical situation so abruptly topsideto how did you get away well dy jironal had apparently expected us all to cower in the castle intimidated by his show of arms you can imagine how that sat with the old provincara his women spies watched iselle all the time but not me i took nan and we went about the town doing little domestic errands for the household and observing his mens defenses all faced outward prepared to repel wouldbe rescuers and no one could keep us from going to the temple where lord dy palliar stayed to pray for oricos health her smile dimpled we became very pious for a time the dimple faded then the provincara got word i dont know through what source that the chancellor had dispatched his younger son with a troop of his house cavalry to secure iselle and bring her in haste back to cardegoss because orico was dying which may be true for all we know but all the better reason not to place herself in dy jironals hands so escape became urgent and it was done palli had drifted over to listen dy baocia strolled up to join them cazaril gave dy baocia a nod your lady mother wrote me of promises of support from your fellow provincars have you gained any more assurances dy baocia rattled off a list of names of men he had written to or heard from it was not as long as cazaril would have liked thus words what of troops dy baocia shrugged two of my neighbors have promised more material support to iselle at need they dont relish the sight of the chancellors personal troops occupying one of my towns any more than i do the thirdwell hes married to one of dy jironals daughters he sits tight for the moment saying as little as possible to anyone understandable where is dy jironal now does anyone know in cardegoss we think said palli the daughters military order still remains without a holy general dy jironal feared to absent himself for long from oricos side lest dy yarrin get in and persuade orico to his party orico himself is hanging by a thread dy yarrin reports secretly to me sick but not i think witless the roya seems to be using his own illness to delay decision trying to offend no one sounds very like him cazaril fingered his beard and glanced up at dy baocia speaking of the temples soldiers how large a force of the brothers order is stationed in taryoon just a company about two hundred men the provincar answered we are not garrisoned heavily like guarida or other of the provinces bordering the roknari princedoms that was two hundred men inside taryoons walls cazaril reflected dy baocia read his look the archdivine will have speech with their commander later tonight i think the marriage treaty will do much to persuade him that the new heiress is loyal to ah the future of chalion still they do have their oaths of obedience murmured palli it would be preferable not to strain them to breaking cazaril considered riding times and distances word of iselles flight from valenda will surely have reached cardegoss by now news of bergons arrival must follow on its heels at that point dy jironal will see the regency he counted upon slipping through his fingers dy baocia smiled in elation at that point it will be over events are moving much faster than heor indeed anyonecould have anticipated the sidelong look he cast cazaril tinged respect with awe better that way said cazaril he must not be pricked into making moves he cannot later back away from if two sides both cursed struck against each other in civil war it was perfectly possible for both sides to lose it would be the perfect culmination of the golden generals death gift for all of chalion to collapse in upon itself in such agony winning consisted of finessing the struggle so as to avert bloodshed although when bergon moved iselle out of the shadow it would presumably leave poor orico still in it and dy jironal sharing his nominal masters fate and what of ista then bluntly much depends upon when the roya dies he could linger you know the curse would surely twist orico toward whatever fate was most ghastly this would seem a more reliable guide if there were not so very many ways disasters could play out umegats menagerie had been averting cazaril realized a deal more evil than just ill health looking ahead we must consider what sops to offer to chancellor dy jironals prideboth before iselles ascent to the royacy and after i dont think hell be content with sops caz palli objected hes been roya of chalion in all but name for over a decade then surely he must be getting tired sighed cazaril some plums to his sons would soften him family loyalty is his weakness his blind side or so the curse suggested which deformed all virtue to an obverse vice ease him out but show favor to his clan pull his teeth slowly and gently and its done he glanced up at betriz listening intently yes she could be counted on to report this debate to iselle later in the other chamber iselle and bergon rose she laid her hand on his proffered arm and they both stole shy glances at their partner two persons looking more pleased with each other cazaril was hard put to imagine although when iselle entered the reception room with her fiancé and glanced around triumphantly at the assembled company she looked quite as pleased with herself bergons pride had a slightly more dazzled air though he spared cazaril scrambling up from his seat a reassuringly determined nod the heiress of chalion said iselle and paused and the heir of ibra bergon put in are pleased to announce that we will take our marriage oaths iselle continued before the gods our noble ibran guests and the people of this town in the temple of taryoon at noon upon the day after tomorrow bergon finished the little crowd broke into cheers and congratulations and cazaril had no doubt calculations of the speed at which a column of enemy troops might ride to which the answer worked out not that fast united and mutually strengthened the two young leaders could move at need thereafter in close coordination once iselle was married out from under the curse time was on their side every day would gain them more support unstrung by the most profound relief cazaril sank back into his chair grinning with the pain of the anguished cramp in his gut in a palace frantic with preparations cazaril found himself the next day the only man with nothing to do iselle had arrived in taryoon with little more than the clothes she rode in all of cazarils correspondence and books of her chambers were still in cardegoss when he attempted to wait upon her and inquire what duties she desired of him he found her rooms crammed with mildly hysterical tirewomen being directed by her aunt dy baocia all charging in and out with piles of garments in their arms iselle fought her head out through a swaddling of silks to gasp youve just ridden over eight hundred miles on my behalf go rest cazaril she held her arm out obediently while a woman tried a sleeve upon it no bettercompose two letters for my uncles clerk to copy out one to all the provincars of chalion and one to every temple archdivine announcing my marriage something they can read out to the people that should be a nice quiet task when you have all seventeenno sixteen seventeen put in her aunt from the vicinity of her hem your uncle will want one for his chancellery records stand straight when all are made ready set them aside for me and bergon to sign tomorrow after the wedding and then see that they are sent out she nodded firmly to the annoyance of the tirewoman trying to adjust her neckline cazaril bowed himself out before he was stuck with a pin and leaned a moment over the gallery railing the day was exquisitely fair promising spring the sky was a palewashed blue and mild sunlight flooded the newly paved courtyard where gardeners were carting in orange trees in full flower in tubs rolling them out to stand around the nowbubbling fountain he diverted a passing servant and had a writing table brought out and set in the sun for himself and a chair with a thick soft cushion because while a lot of those eight hundred miles were now a blur in his mind his backside seemed to remember them all he leaned back with the warm light falling on his face and his eyes closed composing his periods then bent forward to scribble dy baocias clerk carried off the results for copying out in a much fairer hand than cazarils soon enough and then he just leaned back with his eyes closed period he didnt even open them for the approaching footsteps till a clank on his table surprised him he looked up to find a servant directed by lady betriz setting down a tray with tea a jug of milk a dish of dried fruit and bread glazed with nuts and honey she dismissed the servant and poured the tea herself and pressed the bread upon him sitting on the edge of the fountain to watch him eat it your face looks very gaunt again havent you been eating properly she inquired severely i have no idea what lovely sunshine this is i hope it holds through tomorrow lady dy baocia thinks it will though she said we might have rain again by the daughters day the scent of the orange blossoms pooled in the shelter of the court seeming to mix with the honey in his mouth he swallowed tea to chase the bread and observed in idle wonder in three days time it will be exactly a year since i walked into the castle of valenda i wanted to be a scullion her dimple flashed i remember it was last daughters day eve that we first met each other at the provincaras table oh i saw you before that riding into the courtyard with iselle and and teidez and poor dy sanda she looked stricken you did where were you i didnt see you sitting on the bench by the wall you were too busy being scolded by your father for galloping to notice me oh she sighed and trailed her hand through the fountains little pool then shook off the cold drops with a frown the daughter of spring might have breathed out todays air but it was still old winters water it seems a hundred years ago not just one to me it seems an eye blink time outruns me now which explains why i wheeze so no doubt he added quietly after a moment has iselle confided to her uncle about the curse we seek to break tomorrow no of course not at his raised brows she added iselle is istas daughter she cannot speak of it lest men say she is mad too and use it as an excuse to seize everything dy jironal thought of it at teidezs interment he never missed a chance to pass some little comment on iselle to any lord or provincar in earshot if she wept wasnt it too extravagant if she laughed how odd that she should do so at her brothers funeral if she spoke he whispered that she was frenetic if she fell silent wasnt she grown strangely gloomy and you could just watch men begin to see what he told them they were seeing whether it was there or not toward the end of his visit there he even said such things in her hearing to see if he could frighten and enrage her and then accuse her of becoming an unbalanced virago and he circulated outright lies as well but i and nan and the provincara were onto his little game by then and we warned iselle and she kept her temper in his company ah excellent girl she nodded but as soon as we heard the chancellors men were coming to fetch her back to cardegoss iselle was frantic to escape valenda because once hed got her closeconfined he could put about any story he pleased of her behavior and who would there be to deny it he might get the provincars of chalion to approve the extension of his regency for the poor mad girl for as long as he pleased without ever having to raise a sword she took a breath and so she dares not mention the curse i see she is wise to be wary well the gods willing it will soon be over the gods and the castillar dy cazaril he made a little warding gesture and took another sip of tea when did dy jironal learn i was gone to ibra i dont think he guessed anything till after the cortege reached valenda and you werent to be found there the old provincara said he received some reports from his ibran spiesi think thats partly why anxious as he was to get back and block dy yarrin from orico he would not leave valenda till he had his own household troops installed there he sent assassins to intercept me at the border i wonder if he thought i would just be returning alone with the next round of negotiations i dont think he expected royse bergon so soon no one did except iselle she rubbed her fingers across the fine black wool of her vestcloak lying over her knee her next glance up at him was uncomfortably penetrating while you have spent yourself trying to save iselle have you discovered how to save yourself he was silent a moment then said simply no its its not right he glanced vaguely around the deliciously sunny court avoiding her eyes i like this nice new building it has no ghosts in it at all do you know youre changing the subject her frown deepened you do that a lot when you dont want to talk about something i just realized betriz he softened his voice our feet were set on different paths from the night i called down death upon dondo i cant go back you are going to be living and i am not we cant go on together even if well we just cant you dont know how much time youre given it could be weeks months but if an hour is all the gift the gods give us all the more insult to the gods to scorn it its not the shortage of time he shifted miserably its the abundance of company think of us alone togetheryou me dondo the death demon am i not a horror to you his tone grew almost pleading i assure you im a horror to me she glanced at his gut then stared off across the courtyard her jaw set mulishly i do not believe that being haunted is catching do you think i lack the courage never that he breathed she addressed her feet in a growl id storm heaven for you if i knew where it was what didnt you read old ordols book while you were helping iselle cipher those letters he claims that the gods and we are both right here all the time a shadows thickness apart weve no distance to cross at all to get to each other i can see their world from where i sit in fact so ordol was right but you cannot force the gods its only fair i suppose they cannot force us either youre doing it again twisting the topic what are you planning to wear tomorrow shall it be pretty youre not allowed to outshine the bride you know she glared at him up on the gallery lady dy baocia popped out of iselles chambers and called down to betriz a complicated question involving what seemed to cazaril a great many different fabrics betriz waved back and rose reluctantly to her feet she flung rather sharply over her shoulder as she made for the staircase well that may all be so and you as doomed as you please but if im thrown from a horse tomorrow and break my neck i hope you feel a fool more of a fool he murmured to the swish of her retreating skirts the bright courtyard was a blur in his disobedient eyes and he rubbed them clear with a hard surreptitious swipe of his sleeve the wedding day dawned as fair as hoped the orangeblossomscented courtyard was crowded as it could hold when iselle attended by her aunt and betriz appeared at the top of the gallery stairs cazaril tilted his face up and squinted happily the tirewomen had performed heroic feats with silks and satins garbing her in all the shades of blue proper for a bride her blue vestcloak was trimmed with as many ibran pearls as could be found in taryoon patterned as a frieze of stylized leopards a smattering of applause broke out as moving a little stiffly in all her finery she smiled and descended the steps her hair gleamed like a river of treasure in the sunlight two dy baocia girlcousins managed her train under the sporadic direction of their mother even the curse seemed to wrap about her like some trailing sable robe but not for much longer cazaril obediently fell in beside provincar dy baocia and so found himself helping to lead the parade afoot through twisting streets to taryoons nearby temple through a wonder of coordination bergons procession from march dy huestas palace arrived at the temple portico simultaneously with iselles the royse wore the reds and oranges of his age and sex and an expression of determined bravery that would not have been out of place on a man storming a bastion palli and his dozen soldierbrothers in court dress of their order had joined the royses party along with foix and ferda so as not to let the ibrans look and perhaps feel so outnumbered despite the short notice cazaril calculated that over a thousand persons of rank crowded into the temples round center court and what seemed the entire citizenry of taryoon lined the routes of the royesse and royse a festival mood had clearly seized the city the two processions coalesced in a swirl of color and entered the sacred precincts taryoon had good temple singers and the enthusiastic choir made the walls fairly ring with their songs the young couple led by the archdivine entered each of the temples lobes in turn they knelt and prayed upon new carpets for the blessing of each god to the daughter and the son in thanks for their protection in lifes journey so far and to the mother and the father in hopes of passing into their company in due course by theology and tradition the bastard had no official place in a ceremony of marriage but all prudent couples sent a placating gift anyway cazaril and dy tagille had been commissioned to play holy couriers today they received the offerings from bergon and iselle and along with a small but earnestly loud detachment of singing children marched around the outside of the main building to the bastards tower a smiling whiterobed divine stood ready to receive them inside at the altar the royal couple had been forced to borrow clothes money food and housing for this day but bergon did not shortchange the god dy tagille laid down a fat purse of ibran gold along with his prayers iselle sent a promise written in her own hand to undertake payment of roof repairs upon the bastards tower in cardegoss when she became royina there cazaril added a gift of his ownthe bloodtainted rope of pearls all the residue of dondos broken string that had not fallen to the brigands such a difficult and cursed item was absolutely without question the gods just affair and cazaril breathed a sigh of relief when it was off his hands at last proceeding back along the walkway from the bastards tower behind the slightly wobbly choir of urchins cazaril glanced at the crowd and caught his breath a man middleagedaround him hung a subdued gray light like a winters day when cazaril closed his eyes the faint light still glowed there he looked again with his first sight the man wore the blackandgray robes and red shoulder braid of an officer of the taryoon municipal courtprobably a petty judge and petty saint of the father as clara had been of the mother in cardegoss the man was staring back at cazaril in openmouthed astonishment his face drained there was no chance for them to exchange any word here as cazaril was drawn back into the ceremonies inside the high echoing court of the temple but cazaril resolved to ask the archdivine about him at the first opportunity at the central fire the newly married royse and royesse each made a short speech then the archdivine cazaril and everyone else paraded back through the bannerhung streets to dy baocias new palace there a grand feast was laid on to fill the afternoon and the celebrators to happy repletion the food was all the more amazing for having been assembled in just two days cazaril suspected supplies had been robbed from the daughters day festival coming up but he didnt think the goddess would begrudge them as principal guests both cazaril and the archdivine had places to hold so he didnt get a chance for private speech until the afterdinner music and dancing drew the younger people off to the courtyards at that point the two men he sought found him the petty judge stood at the archdivines shoulder looking unnerved cazaril and he exchanged a sidelong look as the archdivine performed a hasty introduction my lord dy cazarilmay i present to you the honorable paginine he serves the municipality of taryoon the archdivine lowered his voice he says you are godtouched is this so alas yes sighed cazaril paginine nodded in an i thought so sort of way cazaril glanced around and drew the pair aside it was hard to find a private spot they ended up in a tiny inner court off one of the palaces side entrances music and laughter carried through the darkening air a servant lit torches in wall brackets and returned inside overhead high clouds moved across the first stars your colleague the archdivine of cardegoss knows all about me cazaril told the archdivine of taryoon oh the archdivine blinked and looked vastly relieved cazaril thought it was a misplaced confidence but he elected not to rob it from him mendenal is an excellent fellow the father of winter has given you some gift i see cazaril said to the petty judge what is it paginine ducked his head nervously sometimesnot every timehe permits me to know who is lying in my justiciars chamber and who is telling the truth paginine hesitated it doesnt always do as much good as youd think cazaril vented a short laugh paginine brightened visibly to both cazarils inner and outer eye and smiled dryly ah you understand oh yes but you sir paginine turned to the archdivine with a troubled look i said godtouched but that hardly describes what im seeing it it almost hurts to look at him three times since i was given the sight i have met others who are also godafflicted but ive never seen anything like him saint umegat in cardegoss said i looked like a burning city cazaril admitted thats paginine eyed him sidewise thats well put he was a man of words once what is your gift i uh i think i am the gift actually to the royesse iselle the archdivine touched his hand to his lips then hastily signed himself so that explains the stories circulating about you what stories said cazaril in bewilderment but lord cazaril the judge broke in what is that terrible shadow hanging about royesse iselle that is no godly thing do you see it too im working on it getting rid of that ugly thing seems to be my godgiven task i think im almost done oh thats a relief paginine looked much happier cazaril realized he wanted nothing so much as to take paginine aside to talk shop how do you deal with these matters the archdivine might be pious perhaps a good administrator possibly a learned theologian but cazaril suspected he didnt understand the discomforts of the saint trade paginines bitter smile told all cazaril wanted to go get drunk with him and compare complaints to cazarils embarrassment the archdivine bowed low to him and said in an awed hushed voice blessed sir is there anything i can do for you betrizs question echoed in his mind have you discovered how to save yourself maybe you couldnt save yourself maybe you had to take turns saving each other tonight no tomorrow later in the week there is a personal matter i should like to wait upon you about if i may certainly blessed sir i am at your service they returned to the party cazaril was exhausted and longed for bed but the courtyard below his chamber door was full of noisy revelers a breathless betriz asked him once to dance from which exercise he smilingly excused himself she didnt lack for partners her gaze checked him often as he sat watching from the wall and nursing his watered wine he did not lack for company as a string of men and women struck up friendly conversations with him angling for employment in the future royinas court to all of them he returned courteous but noncommittal replies the ibran lords were collecting chalionese ladies rather as spilled honey collected ants and looking very happy indeed halfway through the evening lord dy cembuer arrived completing their company and their delight the ibrans exchanged tales of their respective journeys to the awe and fascination of their eager chalionese listeners to cazarils intense political pleasure bergon was cast as the hero of this romantic adventure with iselle no less as heroine for her night ride from valenda as appealing unifying myths went this one was going to beat dy jironals feeble fable of poor mad iselle all hollow cazaril rather thought and our tale is true at last came the hour and the ceremony cazaril had been breathlessly awaiting where bergon and iselle were conducted up to their bedchamber neither cazaril was pleased to note had drunk enough to become inebriated since his own wine had somehow grown less watered as the evening progressed he found himself a little tonguetied when the royse and royesse called him up to the foot of the staircase to give and receive ceremonial kisses of thanks upon their hands moved he signed himself and called down hopeful blessings on their heads the solemn grateful intensity of their return gazes discomfited him lady dy baocia had arranged a small choir to sing prayers to waft the couple on their way upstairs the crystal voices served to suppress the ribaldry to manageable proportions iselle was no more than beautifully blushing and starryeyed when she and bergon leaned over the railing to give smiling thanks to all and throw down flowers they disappeared into the candlelit glow of their suite and the doors swung shut behind them two of dy baocias officers took up station on the gallery to guard their repose in a little while most of the tirewomen and attendants emerged including lady betriz she was instantly carried off by palli and dy tagille for more dancing the revels looked to continue till dawn but to cazarils relief a misty rain began to sift down out of the chilling sky driving the musicians and dancers out of his courtyard and indoors to the adjoining building slowly his hand heavy on the railing cazaril climbed the stairs to his own chamber around the gallery corner from the royse and royesses my duty is done now what he scarcely knew a vast moral terror seemed lifted from his shoulders only he would live and die by his choicesand mistakesnow i refuse to regret i will not look back a moment of balance on the cusp of past and future he rather thought he would look up the little judge again tomorrow the mans company might well relieve his loneliness actually im not nearly lonely enough he thought not much later as dondos incoherent obscene bellows released by their hour of ascendance came roaring up to his inward ear the sundered ghost was more wild with fury tonight than cazaril had ever experienced it its last vestiges of intelligence and sanity shredding away in its rage cazaril could imagine why and grinned through his agony as he rolled on his bed curled around the ghastly pulsing pain in his belly he almost blacked out then forced himself up and to consciousness horrified by the possibility that the fiendishly aroused dondo might try to take over his body while he was still alive in it and use it for some vile assault upon iselle and bergon he writhed on the floor in something resembling convulsions choking back the screams and filth that tried to fly from his mouth no longer sure whose words they were when the attack passed he lay panting on the cold boards his nightgown rucked up around himself his fingernails torn and bloody he had vomited and lay in it he touched his wet beard to find spittle flayed to foam hanging around his lips his stomachor had that grotesque outbulging been a dreamhad returned to its former mild distension though his whole abdominal sheet still ached and quivered like torn muscles after some overtorqued exertion i cant go on like this much longer something had to give wayhis body his sanity his breath his faith something he rose and cleaned up the floor and washed himself at his basin and found a clean dry shirt for a nightdress then straightened his sweatstained twisted sheets lit all the candles in the room and crawled back into bed he lay eyes wide devouring the light at length the sounds of servants murmurs and quiet footsteps along the gallery told him the palace was awakening he must have dozed for his candles were burned out and he didnt remember them guttering gray light seeped in under his door and through his shutters there would be morning prayers morning prayers seemed a good plan even if the idea of attempting to move was daunting cazaril rose slowly well his wasnt going to be the only hangover in taryoon this morning even if he hadnt been drunk the household had put off court mourning for the wedding he selected among the garments that had been bestowed upon him achieving what he hoped was a sober yet cheerful result he went down to the courtyard to await the sun and the young people no sun was to be had yet the rain had stopped but the sky was clouded and chill cazaril used his handkerchief to dry the stone edge of the fountain and seated himself he exchanged a smile and a good morning with an old servingwoman who passed by with linens a crow stalked about on the far end of the courtyard looking for dropped scraps of food cazaril exchanged a tilted stare with it but the bird evinced no special fascination with him upon consideration he was more relieved than otherwise at its avian indifference at last up on the gallery the doors cazaril was waiting for swung open the sleepy baocian guards bracketing them stood to attention womens voices sounded and one mans low and cheerful bergon and iselle appeared dressed for morning prayers her hand set lightly upon his proffered arm they swung about to descend the stairs side by side and stepped out of the gallerys shadow no the shadow followed them cazaril squeezed his eyes shut and open again his breath stopped the choking cloud that wrapped iselle now wrapped bergon too iselle smiled across at her husband and bergon smiled back at her last night they had looked excited and tired and a little scared this morning they looked like two people in love with blackness boiling up around them both like the smoke from a burning ship as they approached iselle sang him a cheerful good morning lord caz bergon grinned and said will you not join us sir we have much to give thanks together for this morning do we not cazarils lips drew back on the travesty of a smile i i a little later i left something in my room he heaved himself up and rushed past them up the stairs he turned and looked again from the gallery as they passed out of the courtyard still trailing shadows he slammed the door of his chamber behind himself and stood gasping almost weeping gods gods what have i done i havent freed iselle ive cursed bergon distraught cazaril kept to his chamber all morning in the afternoon a page knocked with the unwelcome news that the royse and royesse desired him to attend upon them in their rooms cazaril considered feigning illness though he hardly need feign no for iselle would surely bring physicians down upon him probably in packshe remembered the last time with rojeras and shuddered with a boundless reluctance he straightened his garments making himself presentable and walked out around the gallery to the royal suite the sitting rooms high casement windows were open to the cool spring light iselle and bergon still in festive dress from the noon banquet at the march dy huestas palace awaited him they sat around the corner from each other at a table that bore paper parchment and new pens with a third chair pulled invitingly to the other side their heads amber and brown were bent together in lowvoiced conversation the shadow still boiled slowly around them viscous as hot tar at cazarils step they both looked up at him and smiled he moistened his lips and bowed his face stiff iselle gestured at the papers our next most urgent task is to compose a letter to my brother orico to acquaint him of the steps we have taken and assure him of our most loyal submission i think we should include extracts of all the articles of our marriage most favorable to chalion to help reconcile him to it dont you think cazaril cleared his throat and swallowed bergons brows drew inward caz you look as pale as a um are you all right please sit down cazaril managed a tiny headshake again he was tempted to flee into some malingering lieor halftruth now for he was feeling sick enough nothing is all right he whispered he sank to one knee before the royse i have made a vast mistake im sorry im sorry iselles wary startled face blurred in his vision lord caz your marriagehe swallowed again and forced his numb lips to speak onhas not lifted the curse from iselle as id hoped instead it has spread it to you both what breathed bergon tears clogged cazarils voice and now i know not what to do how do you know this iselle asked urgently i can see it i can see it on you both now if anything its even darker and thicker more grasping bergons lips parted in dismay did i did we do something wrong somehow no no but both sara and ista married into the house of chalion and into the curse i thought it was because men and women were different that it somehow followed the male line of fonsas heirs along with the name but i am fonsas heir too said iselle slowly and flesh and blood are more than just names when two become wed it doesnt mean that one disappears and only the other remains we are joined not subsumed oh is there nothing we can do there must be something ista said cazaril began and stopped he was not at all sure he wanted to tell these two decisive young people what ista had said iselle might take thought again ignorance is not stupidity but it might as well be iselle had cried it was much too late to shelter her now by the wrath of the gods she was to be the next royina of chalion with the right to rule came the duty to protectthe privilege of receiving protection had to be left behind with childhoods other toys even protection from bitter knowledge especially from knowledge cazaril swallowed to unlock his throat ista said there was another way he climbed into the chair and sat heavily in a broken voice in terms so plain as to be almost brutal cazaril repeated the tale ista had told him of lord dy lutez roya ias and her vision of the goddess of the two dark hellish nights in the zangres dungeons with the bound man and the vat of icy water when he finished both his listeners were pale and staring i thoughti fearedi might be the one cazaril said because of the night i tried to barter my life for dondos death i was terrified that i might be the one iselles dy lutez as ista named me but i swear before all the gods if i thought it would work id have you take me outside right now and drown me in the courtyard fountain twice but i cannot become the sacrifice now my second death must be my last for the death demon will fly away with my soul and dondos and i dont see how there can be any getting it back into my body then he rubbed his wet eyes with the back of his hand bergon gazed at his new wife as if his eyes could swallow her he finally said huskily what about me what said iselle i undertook to come here to save you from this thing so the methods just got a little harder thats all im not afraid of the water what if you drowned me cazarils and iselles instant protests tumbled out together cazaril gave way with a little wave of his hand iselle repeated it was tried once it was tried and it didnt work im not about to drown either one of you thank you very much no nor hang you either nor any other horrid thing you can think of no besides cazaril put in the goddesss words were a man must lay down his life three times for the house of chalion not of the house of chalion at least according to ista had she repeated her vision verbatim or did her words embed some treacherous error never mind so long as they deterred bergon from his horrifying suggestion i dont think you can break the curse from the inside or it would have been ias not dy lutez who put himself into the barrel and five gods forgive me bergon you are now inside this thing it feels wrong anyway said iselle her eyes narrowing some kind of cheat what was that thing you told me saint umegat said when youd asked him what you should do about daily duties he said i should do my daily duties as they came to me well and so surely the gods are not done with us she drummed her fingers on the tabletop it occurs to me my mother lay down twice in childbed for the house of chalion she never had the chance for a third such trial that is certainly a duty that the gods give to one cazaril considered the havoc that the curse might wreak intersecting with the hazards of pregnancy and childbirth as it had intersected with the chances of iass and oricos battles and shivered barrenness like saras was the least of the potential disasters five gods iselle i think wed do better to put me into the barrel and besides said bergon the goddess said a man she did say a man didnt she caz uh that was lady istas account of the words yes the divines say when the gods instruct men in their pious duties they mean women too iselle growled you cant have it both ways anyway i lived under the curse for sixteen years unknowing i survived somehow but its getting worse now stronger teidezs death seemed a fair example to cazaril of its working outthe boys special strengths and virtues few as they had been all twisted to a dire ill iselle and bergon between them had many strengths and virtues the scope for the curses distortions was immense iselle and bergon were gripping hands across the tabletop iselle knuckled her eyes with her free hand pinched the bridge of her nose and sniffed deeply curse or no curse she said we must make dutiful submission to orico and at once so that dy jironal cannot declare me to be in revolt if only i were by orico i know i could persuade him of the benefit of this marriage to chalion orico is very persuadable cazaril admitted dryly its making him stay persuaded thats the difficult part yes and i dont forget for a moment that dy jironal is with orico in cardegoss my greatest fear is that the chancellor may upon hearing this news somehow persuade orico to again change the terms of his will attach enough of the provincars of chalion to your party royesse and they may be willing to help you resist any such late codicils iselle frowned deeply i wish we might go up to cardegoss i should be by orico if this proves to be his deathbed we should be in the capital when events unfold cazaril paused then said difficult you must not put yourself in dy jironals hands i had not planned to go unattended her smile flashed darkly like the moon on a knife blade but we should seize every legal nicety as well as every tactical advantage it would be well to remind the lords of chalion that all the chancellors legal power flows to him through the roya only bergon said uneasily you know the man better than i do do you think dy jironal will just sit still at this news the longer he can be induced to sit the better we gain support daily have you heard anything of dy jironals response cazaril asked not yet said bergon the time lag ran both ways alas let me know at once if you do cazaril drew a long breath flattened out a clean sheet of paper and picked up a quill now how do you two wish to style yourselves the problem of how to deliver this politically vital missive was a trifle delicate cazaril reflected crossing the courtyard below the royal chambers with the signed and sealed document in his hands it would not do to toss it into a courier bag for delivery at the gallop to the zangre chancellery the article needed a delegation of men of rank not only to give it and iselle and bergon the proper weight but also to assure that it was delivered to orico and not dy jironal trustworthy men must read the letter out accurately to the dying roya in his blindness and give politic answers to any questions orico might have about his sisters precipitate nuptials lords and divinessome of each cazaril decided iselles uncle was fitted to recommend suitable men who might ride out fast and tonight his stride lengthened as he started in search of a page or servant to tell him dy baocias whereabouts under the tiled archway into the court he met palli and dy baocia himself hurrying in they too both still wore their banquet garb caz palli hailed him where were you at dinner resting i had a bad night what and here id have sworn you were the only one of us who went to bed sober cazaril let this one pass whats this palli held up a sheaf of opened letters news from dy yarrin in cardegoss sent in haste by temple courier i thought the royse and royesse should know at once dy jironal rode out of the zangre before midmorning yesterday none knows where did he take troopsno tell it once come on cazaril turned on his heel and led the way back up the gallery stairs to the royal chambers one of iselles servants admitted them and went to bring the young couple out to the sitting room again while they were waiting cazaril showed them the letter to orico and explained its contents the provincar nodded judiciously and named some likely lords for the task of carrying it to cardegoss iselle and bergon entered iselle still patting her braided hair into place and the three men bowed to them royse bergon at once alert to the papers in pallis hand bade them be seated around the table palli repeated his news of dy jironal the chancellor took only a light force of his household cavalry it seemed to dy yarrin that he meant to ride either a short way or very fast what news of my brother orico asked iselle well here palli passed the letter to her for examination with dy jironal out of the way dy yarrin tried at once to get in to see the roya but royina sara said he was asleep and refused to disturb his rest for any supplication since she had undertaken to smuggle in dy yarrin before despite dy jironal he fears the roya may have taken a turn for the worse whats the other letter asked bergon old news but interesting all the same said palli cazaril what in the world is the old archdivine saying about you the commander of the taryoon troop of the order of the son came to me all atremblehe seems to think youre godtouched and dares not approach you he wanted to talk to a man who bore temple oaths like himself hed received a copy of an order that had gone out from the chancellery to all the military posts of the order of the son in western chalionfor your arrest if it please you for treason you are slandered again murmured cazaril taking the letter and accused of sneaking into ibra to sell chalion to the fox which since all the world now knows the real case falls a trifle flat cazaril scanned down the order i see this was his net to catch me if his assassins failed at the border he set it out a bit too late im afraid as you say old news yes but it has a sequel this obedient fool of a troop commander sent a letter in turn to dy jironal admitting hed seen you but excusing himself from arresting you he protested that the arrest order was clearly a misapprehension that you had acted under the royesse iselles orders and had done great good for chalion and no treason that the marriage was immensely popular with the people of taryoon and that everyone thinks the royesse is extremely beautiful too that the new heiress was seen by everyone as wise and good and a great relief and hope after the disasters of oricos reign dy baocia snorted which as they are concomitantly the disasters of dy jironals reign works out to an unintended insult or was it unintended i rather think so the man is um plainminded and plainspoken he says he meant it to help persuade dy jironal to turn to the royesses support its more likely to effect the opposite said cazaril slowly it would persuade dy jironal that his own support is failing rapidly and that he had better take action at once to shore it up when would dy jironal have received this sage advice from his subordinate pallis lips twisted early yesterday morning well theres nothing in it that he would not have received from other sources by then i suppose cazaril passed the order over to bergon waiting with keen interest so dy jironals out of cardegoss said iselle thoughtfully yes but gone where asked palli dy baocia pulled his lip if he left with so few men it has to be to somewhere that his forces are mustered somewhere within striking distance of taryoon that means either to his soninlaw the provincar of thistan to our east or to valenda to our northwest thistan is actually closer to us said cazaril but in valenda he holds my mother and sister hostage said dy baocia grimly no more now than before said iselle her voice stiff with suppressed worry they bade me go uncle bergon was listening with close attention the ibran royse had grown up with civil war cazaril was reminded he might be disturbed but he showed no signs of panic i think we should ride straight for cardegoss while dy jironal is out of it and take possession said iselle if we are to mount such a foray her uncle demurred we should take valenda first free our family and secure our base but if dy jironal is mustering men to attack taryoon i do not wish to strip it of defenses iselle gestured urgently but if bergon and i are out of taryoon dy jironal will have no reason to attack it nor valenda either its me he wantsmust have the vision of dy jironal ambushing your column on the road where you are out in the open and vulnerable doesnt appeal to me much either said cazaril how many men could you spare to escort us to cardegoss uncle iselle asked mounted the foot soldiers to follow at their best speed and how soon could they be mustered i could have five hundred of horse by tomorrow night and a thousand of foot the day after dy baocia admitted rather reluctantly my two good neighbors could send as many but not as soon dy baocia could pull out double that number from his hat cazaril thought if he werent hedging too great a care could be as fatal as too great a carelessness when the moment came to hazard all iselle folded her hands in her lap and frowned fiercely then have them make ready we will keep the predawn vigil of prayers for the daughters day and attend the procession as we had planned uncle lord dy palliar if it please you send out what men you can find to ride in all directions for news of dy jironals movements and then well see what new information we have by tomorrow night and take a final decision then the two men bowed and hurried out iselle bade cazaril stay a moment i did not wish to argue with my uncle she said to him in a tone of doubt but i think valenda is a distraction what do you think cazaril from the point of view of the roya and royina of chalionibra it does not command a position of geographic importance whoever may hold it then let it be a sink for dy jironals forces instead of our own but i suspect my uncle will be difficult about it bergon cleared his throat the road to valenda and the road to cardegoss run together for the first stage we could put it about that we were making for valenda but then strike for cardegoss instead at the fork put it about to who everyone pretty nearly then whatever spies dy jironal has among us will send him haring off in the wrong direction yes actually this was the son of the fox of ibra cazarils brows twitched up in approval iselle thought it over then frowned it works only if my uncles men will follow us if we lead theyll have no choice but to follow us i think my hope is to avoid a war not start one said iselle then not marching up to a town full of the chancellors forces makes sense dont you think said bergon iselle smiled mistily leaned over and kissed him on the cheek he touched the spot in mild wonder we shall both take thought until tomorrow she announced cazaril start that letter toward my brother orico all the same as if we meant to sit tight here in taryoon perchance we shall overtake it on the road and deliver it ourselves with dy baocias and the archdivines guidance cazaril found no lack of eager volunteers in town or temple to take the royesses letter to cardegoss men seemed to be flocking to the royal couples side those whod missed the wedding itself were now pouring into town for the daughters day celebration tomorrow all that youth and beauty acted as a powerful talisman upon mens hearts the lady of springs season of renewal was being strongly identified with iselles impending reign the trick would be to get the governance of chalion on a more even footing while the mood held so that it might still stand strong in less happy hours surely no witness here in taryoon would ever quite forget this time of hope it would still linger in their eyes when they looked at an older iselle and bergon thus cazaril oversaw a party of a dozen grave men climb into their saddles at a time of night when most men were climbing into their beds he gave the official documents into the hands of a senior divine a sober lord who had risen high in the order of the father the march dy sould rode with them as bergons witness and spokesman the earnest ambassadors clattered out of the temple plaza and palli walked cazaril back to dy baocias palace and wished him good night the little distracting flurry of action fading in his mind cazarils steps grew heavy again as he climbed the stairs of his courtyard gallery the weight of the curse was a secret burden dragging down all bright hopes a younger orico had started out his reign just as eager and willing as iselle a dozen years ago as if hed believed then that if only he applied enough effort goodwill steady virtue he could overcome the black blight but it had all gone wrong there were worse fates than becoming iselles dy lutez cazaril reflected he might become iselles dy jironal how much frustration how much corrosion could a loyal man endure before going mad watching such a long slow drain of youth and hope into age and despair and yet whatever orico had been he had held on long enough for the next generation to gain its chance like some doomed little hero holding back a dike of woe and drowning while the others escaped the tide cazaril readied himself for bed and his nightly attack but dondo was surprisingly quiescent exhausted recouping his forces waiting despite that malevolent presence and promise cazaril slept at last a servant woke him an hour before dawn and led him by candlelight down into the courtyard where the royal couples inner household was to have its holy vigil the air was chill and foggy but a few faint stars directly overhead promised a fair dawning soon ibranstyle prayer mats had been arranged around the central fountain and each person took their station upon them on knees or prone as they were so moved iselle and bergon knelt side by side lady betriz placed herself between the royesse and cazaril dy tagille and dy cembuer yawning hurried in to join them on the outer ring of rugs with some half a dozen other persons of lesser rank a divine from the temple led a short prayer aloud then invited all to meditate upon the blessings of the turning season all over taryoon winters fires were being extinguished when all was in readiness the last candles were blown out a profound darkness and silence descended quietly cazaril laid himself prone upon his rug arms outstretched he told over the couple of spring prayers he knew three times each but then gave up trying to fill his mind with rote words to keep his thoughts out if he let his thoughts run their course perhaps some silence would follow and in it he might hear what he changed the subject betriz had charged when the answers were too difficult for him hed tried to do so to the gods he hadnt fooled them either apparently ista had been given her chance to lift the curse and failed and had failed it seemed for her generation if he failed he suspected he would not be allowed to go around to try again so would iselle or bergon or both get to be the new orico holding back the tide until they foundered to create the next chance they will be vastly unlucky in their children he knew it suddenly with a cold clarity the whole of their scheme for peace and order rode upon the hope of a strong bright heir to follow them both they would pour themselves until empty into children miscarried dead mad exiled betrayed id storm heaven for you if i knew where it was he knew where it was it was on the other side of every living person every living creature as close as the other side of a coin the other side of a door every soul was a potential portal to the gods i wonder what would happen if we all opened up at once would it flood the world with miracle drain heaven he had a sudden vision of saints as the gods irrigation system like the one around zagosur a rational and careful opening and closing of sluice gates to deliver each little soulfarm its just portion of benison except that this felt more like floodwaters backed up behind a cracking dam ghosts were exiles upon the wrong border people turned inside out why didnt it work the other way around what would it be like to be an antighost of flesh let loose in a world of spirit would one be frustratingly invisible to most spirits impotent there as ghosts were invisible to most men and if i can see ghosts sundered from their bodies why i cant see them when theyre still in their bodies had he ever tried how many people were ranged around him right now he closed his eyes and tried to see them in the dark with his inner sight his senses were still confused by matter somewhere in the outer rank of prayer rugs someone started to snore and was nudged awake with a startled grunt by a snickering companion if only it worked that way it would be like seeing through a window into heaven if the gods saw peoples souls but not their bodies in mirror to the way people saw bodies but not souls it might explain why the gods were so careless of such things as appearance or other bodily functions such as pain was pain an illusion from the gods point of view perhaps heaven was not a place but merely an angle of view a vantage a perspective and at the moment of death we slide through altogether losing our anchor in matter gaining what death ripped a hole between the worlds and if one death ripped a little hole in the world quickly healed what would it take to rip a bigger hole not a mere postern gate to slip out of but a wide breach mined and sapped one that holy armies might pour in through if a god died what kind of hole would it rip between earth and heaven what was the golden generals blessingcurse anyway this exiled thing from the other side what kind of portal had the roknari genius opened for himself what kind of channel had he been cazarils swollen belly cramped and he rolled a little sideways to give it ease i am a most peculiar locus at present two exiles from the world of spirit were trapped inside his flesh the demon which did not belong here at all and dondo who should have left but was anchored by his unrelinquished sins dondo did not desire the gods dondo was a clot of selfwill a leaden plug digging into his body with claws like grappling hooks if not for dondo he could run away could i he imagined it suppose this lethal anchor were suddenly andhamiraculously removed he could run away but then hed never know how it might have worked out that cazaril if only hed hung on another day another mile he might have saved the world but he quit just an hour too soon now there was a damnation to make the sundered ghosts seem a faint quaint amusement a lifetimean eternityof secondguessing himself but the only way ever to know for certain was to ride it out all the way to his destruction five gods i am surely mad i believe i would limp all the way to the bastards hell for that frightful curiositys sake around him he could hear the others breathing the occasional little rustle of fabric the fountain burbled gently the sounds comforted him he felt very alone but at least it was in good company welcome to sainthood cazaril by the gods blessings you get to host miracles the catch is you dont get to choose what they are betriz had it exactly backward it wasnt a case of storming heaven it was a case of letting heaven storm you could an old siegemaster learn to surrender to open his gates into your hands o lords of light i commend my soul do what you must to mend the world i am at your service the sky was brightening turning from father winters gray to the daughters own fine blue in the shadowed court cazaril could see the shapes of his companions begin to shade and fill with the lights gift of color the scent of the orange blossoms hung heavily in the dawn damp and more faintly the perfume of betrizs hair cazaril pushed back up onto his knees stiff and cold from somewhere in the palace a mans bellow split the air and was abruptly cut off a woman shrieked cazaril put a hand to the pavement shoving himself to his feet and pushed back his vestcloak from his sword hilt all around him the others were rising and looking about in alarm dy tagille bergon motioned to his ibran companion go see dy tagille nodded and departed at a run dy cembuer his right arm still in a sling clenched and unclenched his left hand awkwardly freed his sword hilt and began striding after him we should bar the gate cazaril glanced around the courtyard and at the tiled archway its decorative wroughtiron gate swung wide after dy tagille was there another entrance royesse royse betriz you must not get trapped in here he ran after dy cembuer his heart already pounding if he could get them out before the a frantic page pelted through as dy cembuer reached the archway my lords help armed men have broken into the palace he looked wildly over his shoulder and here they are two men swords out ran in the pages track dy cembuer trying to push the gate shut with his sword in his left hand barely ducked the first blow then cazaril was upon them his first swing was wild and his target parried it with a clang that echoed around the court get out he screamed over his shoulder over the roofs if you have to could iselle climb in her court dress he could not look to see if he was obeyed for his opponent recovered and bore in hard the bravos soldiers whatever they were wore ordinary street clothes no identifying colors or badgesthe better to infiltrate the city in little groups mixed in with the festival crowd no doubt dy cembuer slashed his man a heavy return blow landed on his broken arm and he whitened and fell back with a muffled cry another soldier appeared around the corner and ran toward the archway wearing the baocian colors of green and black and for a moment cazarils heart lifted in hope until he recognized him as teidezs suborned guard captaingrowing ever more expert in betrayal apparently the baocian captains lips drew back as he saw cazaril and he gripped his sword grimly moving in beside his comrade cazaril had neither breathing space nor a hand free to try to close the gate on them again and besides dy cembuers opponent had fallen in the path cazaril did not dare fall back this narrow choke point forced them to come at him one at a time the best odds he was likely to get today his hand was growing numb from the ringing blows transmitted up his blade into his hilt and his gut was cramping but his every gasping breath bought another stride of running time for bergon and iselle and betriz one step two steps five steps where was dy tagille nine steps eleven fifteen how many men were coming up after these his blade hacked a piece out of his first attackers jaw and the man reeled back with a bloody cry but it only left the guard captain with a better angle for attack the man still wore dondos green ring it flashed as his sword darted and parried forty steps fifty cazaril fought in an exaltation of terror so hardpressed to defend himself that the supernatural dangers of a successful thrust of his own of the death demon tearing his soul out of his body along with his dying victims scarcely seemed to apply cazarils world narrowed he no longer sought to win the day or this fight or his life but merely another stride each stride a little victory sixty something he was losing count begin again one two three i am probably going to die now twice was no charm he howled inside with the waste of it mad with regret that he could not die enough his arm was shaking with fatigue this gate wanted a swordsman not a secretary but the royesses private holy vigil had included only the few nobles was no one coming up behind him in support surely even the old servants could grab something and throw it twentytwo could he fall back across the courtyard to the stairs was the royal party gone up the stairs yet he threw a frantic glance backward a mistake for he lost his rhythm with a scree of metal the captains sword snaked his from his tingling grip his blade clattered across the stone spinning the baocian bore cazaril violently backward through the archway and knocked him to the pavement half a dozen attackers surged through the gate after the captain and spread out across the courtyard a couple of them prudent and experienced kicked him in passing to keep him down he still didnt know who they were but he had no doubt whose they were coughing he rolled on his side in time to see dy jironal swearing stride through the gate in the wake of another half dozen men dy cembuer was still down bent in on himself teeth clenched in agony were iselle and bergon safe away down a servants stair over the roof tiles pray the gods they had not panicked and barricaded themselves in their chambers dy jironal headed toward the stairs to the gallery where a little knot of his men waited to make a concerted rush martou cazaril bellowed wrenching over and up onto his knees dy jironal swung round as though spun on the end of a rope you at his motion the baocian guard captain and another soldier grasped cazaril by the arms bending them up behind him and dragged him to his feet you are too late cazaril called shes wed and bedded and theres no way you can undo it now chalion owns ibra at the fairest price ever paid and all the country celebrates its good fortune she is the child of spring and the delight of the gods you cant win against her give over save your life and the lives of your men wed snarled dy jironal widowed if needs be she is a mad traitor and the whore of ibra and accursed and ill not have it he whirled again toward the stairs youre the whore martou you sold gotorget for roknari money that i refused and you sold me to the galleys to stop my mouth cazaril glared around frantically at the hesitating troop fiftyfive fiftysix fiftyseven this liar sells his own men follow him and you risk betrayal the first moment he smells profit dy jironal turned again drawing his sword ill stop your mouth you miserable fool hold him up wait no the two men holding cazaril jerked a little apart their eyes widening as dy jironal began to stride forward twisting for a mighty twohanded swing my lord its murder faltered the man holding cazarils left arm the beheading arc was blocked by cazarils captors and dy jironal changed in midcareer to a violent low thrust lunging forward with all the weight of his fury behind his arm the steel pierced silk brocade and skin and muscle and drove through cazarils gut and cazaril was nearly jerked off his feet with the force of it sound ceased the sword was sliding through him as slowly as a pearl dropped in honey and as painlessly dy jironals red face was frozen in a rictus of rage on either side of cazaril his captors bent and leaned away mouths creeping open on startled cries that never emerged with a yowl of triumph that only cazaril heard the death demon coursed up the sword blade leaving it redhot in its wake and into dy jironals hand with a scream of anguish a black syrup that was dondo poured after crackling bluewhite sparks grew around dy jironals sword arm like ivy twining and then spiraled around his whole body slowly dy jironals head tilted back and white fire came from his mouth as his soul was uprooted from him his hair stood on end and his eyes widened and boiled white the driven sword still moved with his falling weight and cazarils flesh sizzled around it white and black and red whirled together braided round each other and flowed away in no direction cazarils perception was drawn into the twisting cyclones wake up out of his body like a rising column of smoke three deaths and a demon all bound together they flowed into a blue presence cazarils mind exploded he opened outward and outward and outward still till all the world lay below him as if seen from a high mountain but not the realm of matter this was a landscape of soulstuff colors he could not name of a shattering brilliance bore him up upon a glorious turbulence he could hear all the minds of the world whispering a sighing like wind in a forestif one could but distinguish simultaneously and separately the song of each leaf and all the worlds cries of pain and woe and shame and joy and hope and despair and aspiration a thousand thousand moments from a thousand thousand lives poured through his distending spirit from the surface below him little bubbles of soulcolor were boiling up one by one and floating into a turning dance hundreds thousands like great raindrops falling upward it is the dying pouring in through the rents of the worlds into this place souls gestated by matter in the world dying into this strange new birth too much too much too much his mind could not hold it all and the visions burst from him like water falling through his fingers hed once thought of the lady of spring as a sort of pleasant gentle young woman in his vague and youthful conceptualizations the divines and ordol had honed it scarcely further than to a mental picture of a nice immortal lady this overwhelming mind listened to every cry or song in the world at once she watched the souls spiral up in all their terrible complex beauty with the delight of a gardener inhaling the scent of her flowers and now this mind turned her attention fully upon cazaril cazaril melted and was cupped in her hands he thought she drank him siphoning him out of the violent concatenation of the dy jironal brothers and the demon who shot away elsewhere he was blown from her lips again back down in a tightening spiral through the great slash in the world that was his death and once again into his body dy jironals sword blade was just emerging from his back blood bloomed around the metal point like a rose and now to work the lady whispered open to me sweet cazaril can i watch he asked tremulously whatever you can bear is permitted he sank back in a languid ease as the goddess flowed through him into the world his lips curved up in a smile or started to his fleshly body was as sluggish as those of the men around him in the courtyard he seemed to be sinking to his knees dy jironals corpse had not yet finished falling to the pavement although his dead hand had spasmed from his sword hilt dy cembuer was lifting himself upon his good arm his mouth opening upon a cry that was going to eventually become cazaril some men were throwing themselves prone some were starting to run the goddess drew the curse of chalion like thick black wool into her hands lifting it from iselle and bergon somewhere in the streets of taryoon from ista in valenda from sara in cardegoss from all the land of chalion mountain to mountain river to plain cazaril could not sense orico in the dark fog the lady spun it out again through cazaril as it twisted through him into the other realm its darkness fell away and then he wasnt sure if it was a thread or a stream of bright clean water or wine or something even more wonderful another presence solemn and gray waited there and took it up and took it in and sighed in something like relief or completion or balance i think it was the blood of a god spilled soiled drawn up again cleaned and returned at last i dont understand was ista mistaken did i miscount my deaths the goddess laughed think it through then the vast blue presence poured out of the world through him like a river thundering over a waterfall the beauty of a triumphal music he knew he would never quite remember till he came to her realm again cracked his heart the great rent drew closed healed sealed and abruptly as that it all was gone the crack of the stone pavement hitting his knees was his first returning sensation desperately he held himself upright sitting on his heels so as not to wrench the sword blade around in his flesh the hilt and a handspan of bright blade hung below his downwardturning gaze driven at a crooked upward angle into his stomach just below and to the left of his navel the point seemed to come out somewhere to the right of his spine and higher now came the pain as he drew his first shuddering breath the weapon bobbed a trifle the stink of cauterized flesh assailed his nostrils mixed with a celestial perfume like spring flowers he trembled with shock and cold he tried to hold very still he had a distressing urge to giggle that would hurt more not all the scorchedmeat smell was from him dy jironal lay before him cazaril had seen corpses burned from the outside innever before from the inside out the chancellors hair and clothes smoked a little but then went out without catching to flame cazarils attention was arrested by a pebble that lay on the pavement near his knee it was so dense so persistent the gods could not lift so much as a feather but he a mere human might pick up this ancient unchanging object and place it wherever he wished even into his pocket he wondered why he had never appreciated the stubborn fidelity of matter a dried leaf lay nearby even more stunning in its complexity matter invented so many forms and then went on to generate beauty beyond itself minds and souls rising up out of it like melody from an instrument matter was an amazement to the gods matter remembered itself so very clearly he could not think why he had failed to notice it before his own shaking hand was a miracle as was the fine metal sword in his belly and the orange trees in the tubsone was tipped over now wonderfully fractured and spillingand the tubs and the birdsong starting in the morning and the waterwater five gods waterin the fountain and the morning light filtering into the sky lord cazaril came a faint voice from his elbow he glanced aside to find that dy cembuer had crept up to him what was that dy cembuer sounded very close to tears some miracles too many in one place at one time he was overwhelmed with miracles they filled his eyes in every direction speaking was a mistake for the vibration stirred the pain in his gut though he could speak the sword did not appear to have pierced his lung he imagined how much it would hurt to cough blood just now gut wound then i will be dead again in three days he could smell a faint scent of shit mixed with the scorched meat and the goddesss perfume and sobbing no wait the deadly fecal smell was not coming from him yet the baocian captain was curled up in a tight ball on his side a little way off his arms locked around his head weeping he did not seem to have any wound ah yes he had been the nearest living witness the goddess must have brushed against him in her passage cazaril risked another breath what did you see he asked dy cembuer that manwas that dy jironal cazaril nodded a tiny careful nod when he stabbed you there was a hellish crack and he burst into blue fire he is what did did the gods strike him down not exactly it was a little more complicated than that it seemed strangely quiet in the courtyard cazaril risked turning his head about half of the bravos and a few servants of iselles household were laid flat on the ground some were mumbling rapidly under their breaths others were crying like the baocian captain the rest had vanished cazaril thought he could see now why a man had to lay down his life three times to do this and here hed imagined the gods were being arbitrary and difficult for the sake of some arcane punishment hed needed the first two deaths just for the practice the first to learn how to accept death in the bodyhis flogging on the galley that had been he had not miscountedthat death had not been for the house of chalion at the time but it had become so with iselles marriage to bergon and its consummation the joining of two into one that had shared the curse so horrifyingly between them had apparently also portioned out this sacrifice bergons secret dowry eh cazaril hoped he might live long enough to tell him and that the royse would be pleased his second acceptance of death of the soul had been in the lonely company of crows in fonsas tower so that when he came at last to this one he could offer the goddess a smooth and steady partnering humbling parallels involving the training of mules offered themselves to his mind footsteps sounded cazaril glanced up to see dy tagille winded and disheveled but with his sword sheathed running into the courtyard he dashed up to them and stopped abruptly bastards hell he glanced aside at his ibran comrade are you all right dy cembuer sons of bitches broke my arm again hes the scary one whats happening out there dy baocia rallied his men and has driven the invaders out of the palace its all very confused right now but the rest of them seem to be running through town trying to get to the temple to assail it dy cembuer asked in alarm he tried to struggle to his feet again no to surrender to armed men who will not try to tear them limb from limb it seems every citizen of taryoon has taken to the streets after them the women are the worst bastards hell he repeated staring at dy jironals smoking corpse some chalionese soldier was screaming and babbling that hed seen dy jironal struck by lightning from a clear blue sky for the sacrilege of offering battle on the daughters day and i scarcely believed him i saw it too said dy cembuer there was a horrible noise he didnt even have time to cry out dy tagille dragged the corpse a little way off and knelt in front of cazaril staring fearfully at his skewered stomach and then into his face lord cazaril we must try to draw this sword from you best we do it at once no wait cazaril had once seen a man plugged with a crossbow bolt live for half an hour until the bolt was drawn out his blood had gushed forth then and hed died i want to see lady betriz first my lord you cannot sit there with a sword stuck through you well said cazaril reasonably i surely cannot move trying to talk made him pant not good he was shivering and very cold but the throbbing pain was not as devastating as hed expected probably because hed managed to hold so still as long as he held very still it wasnt much worse than dondos clawings other men arrived in the courtyard babble and noise and cries from the wounded washed between the walls and tales repeated over and over in rising voices cazaril ignored it all taken up with his pebble again he wondered where it had come from how it had arrived there what it had been before it was a pebble a rock a mountain where for how many years it filled his mind and if a pebble could fill his mind what might a mountain do the gods held mountains in their minds and all else besides all at once everything with the same attention he gave to one thing he had seen that through the ladys eyes if it had endured for longer than that infinitesimal blink he thought his soul would have burst as it was he felt strangely stretched had that glimpse been a gift or just a careless chance cazaril a trembling voice the voice he had been waiting for he looked up if the pebble was amazing betrizs face was astounding the structure of her nose alone could have held him entranced for hours he abandoned the pebble at once for this better entertainment but water welled up shimmering in her brown eyes and her face was drained of color that wasnt right worst of all her dimples had gone into hiding there you are he said happily his voice was a muzzy croak kiss me now she gulped knelt shuffled up to him on her knees and stretched her neck her lips were warm the perfume of her mouth was nothing at all like a goddesss but like a human womans and very good withal his lips were cold and he pressed them to hers as much to borrow her heat and youth as anything so hed been swimming in miracle every day of his life and hadnt even known it he eased his head back all right he did not add thats enough because it wasnt you can draw the sword out now men moved around him mostly worriedlooking strangers betriz rubbed her face undid the frogs of his tunic and stood and hovered someone gripped his shoulders a page proffered a folded pad to clap to his wound and someone else held lengths of bandages ready to wrap his torso cazaril squinted in uncertainty betriz was here therefore iselle must be must be iselle bergon im here lord caz iselles voice came off to his side she moved around in front of him staring at him in extreme dismay she had shed her heavily embroidered outer robes in her flight and still seemed a trifle breathless she had also shed the black cloak of the curse had she not yes he decided his inner vision was darkening but he did not mistake this bergon is with my uncle she continued helping to clear dy jironals remaining men from the area her voice was firm in its disregard of the tears running down her face the black shadow is lifted he told her from you and bergon from everyone how ill tell you all about it if i live cazaril he grinned briefly at the familiar exasperated cadences around his name you live then her voice wavered ii command you dy tagille knelt in front of cazaril cazaril gave him a short nod draw it very straight and smoothly lord dy tagille iselle instructed tensely so as not to cut him any worse aye my lady dy tagille licked his lips in apprehension and grasped the swords hilt carefully gasped cazaril but not quite so slowly please the blade left him a warm gush of liquid spurted from the mouth of his wound after it cazaril had hoped to pass out but he only swayed as pads were clapped to him and held hard fore and aft he stared down expecting to see his lap awash in blood but no flood of red met his sight it was a clear liquid merely tinged with pink sword must have lanced my tumor which was not it appeared and the bastard fry rojeras for inflicting that nightmare upon him stuffed with some grotesque demon fetus after all he tried not to think at least not anymore a murmur of astonishment passed among the ring of watchers as the scent of celestial flowers from this exudation filled the air he let himself fall boneless and unresisting into his eager helpers arms he did manage to surreptitiously scoop up his pebble before the willing hands bore him off up the stairs to his bedchamber they were excited and frightened but he was growing delightfully relaxed it seemed he was to be fussed over lovely when betriz held his hand as he was eased into his bed he gripped hers and did not let go a tapping and low voices at his chamber door drew cazaril from his doze the room was dim a single candle flame pushing back a deep dark told him night was fallen he heard the physician who had been sitting with him murmuring he is sleeping royroyina no im not cazaril called eagerly come in he tensed his arms to push himself upright then thought better of it he added make more light a deal more light i want to see you a great party of persons shuffled into his chamber attempting to make themselves quiet and gentle like a parade gone suddenly shy iselle and bergon with betriz and palli attendant upon them the archdivine of taryoon with the little judge of the father staring around in his wake they quite filled the room cazaril smiled up amiably at them from his horizontal paradise of clean linens and stillness as candle was held to candle and the flames multiplied bergon looked down at him in apprehension and whispered hoarsely to the physician how is he he passed a deal of blood in his water earlier but less tonight he has no fever yet i darent let him have more than a few sips of tea till we know how his gut wound progresses i dont know how much pain he bears cazaril decided he preferred to speak for himself i hurt no doubt of that he made another feeble attempt to roll up and winced i would sit up a little i cannot talk looking up all your noses like this palli and bergon rushed to help gently raise him plumping pillows behind him thank you said iselle to the physician who bowed and taking the royal hint stepped out of the way cazaril eased back with a sigh and said what has transpired is taryoon under attack and dont talk in those funereal whispers either iselle smiled from the foot of his bed much has happened she told him her voice reverting to its normal firm timbre dy jironal had men advancing as fast as they could march from both his soninlaw in thistan and from valenda to follow up in support of his spies and abductors got in at the festival late last night the column coming down the road from valenda met the delegation carrying our letter to orico in cardegoss and captured them alive yes said cazaril in alarm there was some scuffle but none killed thank the gods much debate followed in their camp well he had sent the most sensible persuasive men of weight and worth that taryoon could muster for that embassy later in the afternoon we sent out parties of parley we included some of dy jironals men who had witnessed the fight in the courtyard and and whatever that miraculous blue fire was that killed him to explain and to testify they cried and gibbered a lot but they were very convincing cazaril what reallyoh and they say orico is dead cazaril sighed i knew that when the archdivine of taryoon replied theres some confusion about that a temple courier rode through to us this afternoon with the news she bore me a letter from archdivine mendenal in cardegoss saying it was the night after the royessesthe royinas wedding but dy jironals men all say he told them orico had died the night before it and so he was now rightful regent of chalion i suppose he was lying im not sure it matters now but it might have mattered had events taken a different path cazaril frowned in curious speculation in any case put in bergon between the news of dy jironals startling takingoff and the failure and capture of their infiltrators and the realization that they marched not against a rebellious heiress but their rightful royina the columns have broken up the men are returning to their homes im just back from overseeing that indeed he was mudsplashed brighteyed with the exuberance of successand relief do you think the truce will hold asked cazaril dy jironal held the strings of a very considerable network of power and relations all of whom still have their interests at risk palli grunted and shook his head they have not the backing of forces from the order of the son now its headlessworse theyve the near certainty that control of the order will pass out of their faction now i think the jironal clan will learn caution the provincar of thistan has already sent us a letter of submission put in iselle just arrived it looks to have been hastily penned we plan to wait one more day to be sure the roads are clear and to give thanks to the gods in the temple of taryoon then bergon and i will ride for cardegoss with a contingent of my uncles cavalry for oricos funeral and my coronation her mouth turned down i fear we will have to leave you here for a time lord caz he glanced at betriz watching him her eyes dark with concern where iselle rode betriz her first courtier must needs follow iselle went on dont speak if it pains you too much but cazaril what happened in the courtyard did the daughter truly strike dy jironal dead with a bolt of lightning his body looked it i must say said bergon all cooked ive never seen anything like it that is a good story said cazaril slowly and will do for most men you here should know the truth but i think this truth should go no further eh iselle quietly bade the physician excuse himself she glanced curiously at the little judge and this gentleman cazaril the honorable paginine is is in the way of being a colleague of mine he should stay and the archdivine as well cazaril found his audience ranged around his bed staring at him rather breathlessly neither paginine nor the archdivine nor palli knew the preamble about dondo and the death demon cazaril realized and so he found himself compelled to revert to that beginning though in as few words as he could make come out sensibly at least he hoped it sounded coherent and not like the ravings of a madman archdivine mendenal in cardegoss knows all this tale he assured the shockedlooking pair from taryoon pallis mouth was twisted in something between astonishment and indignation cazaril evaded his eye a trifle guiltily but when dy jironal bade his men hold me unarmed and ran me throughwhen he murdered me the death demon bore us all off in an unbalanced confusion of killers and victims that is the demon bore the pair of them but somehow my soul was attached and followed what i saw then the goddess his voice faltered i dont know how to open my mouth and push out the universe in words it wont fit if i had all the words in all the languages in the world that ever were or will be and spoke till the end of time it still couldnt he was shivering suddenly his eyes blurred with tears but you werent really dead were you said palli uneasily oh yes just for a little while for an odd angle of little that came out um very large if i had not died in truth i could not have ripped open the wall between the worlds and the goddess could not have reached in to take back the curse which was a drop of the fathers blood as nearly as i could tell though how the golden general came by such a gift i know not thats a metaphor by the way im sorry i have not i have not the words for what i saw talking about it is like trying to weave a box of shadows in which to carry water and our souls are parched the lady of spring let me look through her eyes and though my second sight is taken backi thinkmy eyes do not seem to work quite the same as they did the archdivine signed himself paginine cleared his throat and said diffidently indeed my lord you do not make that great roaring light about you anymore do i not oh good cazaril added eagerly but the black cloak about iselle and bergon it is gone as well yes yes my lord royse royina if it please you the shadow seems to be lifted altogether so all is well gods demons ghosts the whole company all gone theres nothing odd left about me now said cazaril happily paginine screwed up his face in an expression that was not quite appalled not quite a laugh i would not go so far as to say that my lord he murmured the archdivine nudged paginine and whispered but he speaks the truth yes wild as it seems oh yes your reverence i have no doubt of that the bland stare he traded cazaril bore rather more understanding than that of the archdivines who was looking astonished and overawed tomorrow iselle announced bergon and i shall make a thanksgiving procession to the temple walking barefoot to sign our gratitude to the gods cazaril said in muzzy worry oh oh do be careful then dont step on any broken glass or old nails now we shall watch out for each others steps the whole way bergon promised him cazaril added aside to betriz his hand creeping across the coverlet to touch hers you know i am not haunted anymore quite a load off my mind in more ways than one very liberating to a man that sort of thing his voice was dropping in volume raspy with fatigue her hand turned under his and gave a secret squeeze we should withdraw and let you rest said iselle frowning in renewed worry is there anything you desire cazaril anything at all about to reply no nothing he said instead oh yes i want music music perhaps some very quiet music betriz ventured to lull him to sleep bergon smiled if it please you then see to it lady betriz the mob withdrew tiptoeing loudly the physician returned he let cazaril drink tea in trade for making more bloodtinted piss for him to examine suspiciously by candlelight and growl at in an unsettling fashion at length betriz came back with a nervouslooking young lutenist who appeared to have been wakened out of a sound sleep for this command performance but he worked his fingers tuned up and played seven short pieces none of them was the right one none evoked the lady and her soulflowers till he played an eighth an interlaced counterpoint of surpassing sweetness that one had a faint echo of heaven in it cazaril had him play it through twice more and cried a little upon which betriz insisted that he was too tired and must sleep now and bore the young man off again and cazaril still hadnt had a chance to tell her about her nose when he tried to explain this miracle to the physician the man responded by giving him a large spoonful of syrup of poppies after which they ceased to alarm each other for the rest of the night in three days time his wounds stopped leaking scented fluid closing cleanly and the physician permitted cazaril thin gruel for breakfast this revived him enough to insist on being allowed out to sit in the spring sun of the courtyard the expedition seemed to require an inordinate number of servants and helpers but at last he was guided carefully down the stairs and into a chair lined with woolpadded and featherstuffed cushions with his feet propped up on another cushioned chair he shooed away his helpers and gave himself over to a most delicious idleness the fountain burbled soothingly the trees in the tubs unfurled more fragrant flowers a pair of little orangeandblack birds stitched the air bringing dry grass and twigs to build a nest tucked up in the carvings on one of the gallerys supporting posts an ambitious litter of paper and pens lay forgotten on the small table at cazarils elbow as he watched them flit back and forth dy baocias palace was very quiet with its royal guests and its lord and lady all gone to cardegoss cazaril therefore smiled with lazy delight when the wroughtiron gate under the end archway swung aside to admit palli the march had been assigned by his new royina the dull task of keeping watch over her convalescent secretary while everyone else went off to the grand events in the capital which seemed to cazaril rather an unfair reward for pallis valiant service palli had attended upon him so faithfully cazaril felt quite guilty for wishing iselle might have spared lady betriz instead palli grinning gave him a mock salute and seated himself on the fountains edge well castillar you look better very vertical indeed but whats thishe gestured to the tablework before they left yesterday your ladies charged me to enforce a very long list of things you were not to do most of which you will be glad to know i have forgotten but im sure work was high on it no such thing said cazaril i was going to attempt some poetry after the manner of behar but then there were these birds there goes one now he paused to mark the orangeandblack flash people compliment birds for being great builders but really these two seem terribly clumsy perhaps they are young birds and this is their first try persistent though although i suppose if i was to attempt to build a hut using only my mouth i would do no better i should write a poem in praise of birds if matter that gets up and walks about like you is miraculous how much more marvelous is matter that gets up and flies pallis mouth quirked in bemusement is this poetry or fever caz oh it is a great infection of poetry a contagion of hymns the gods delight in poets you know songs and poetry being of the same stuff as souls can cross into their world almost unimpeded stone carvers now even the gods are in awe of stone carvers he squinted in the sun and grinned back at palli nevertheless murmured palli dryly one feels that your quatrain yesterday morning to lady betrizs nose was a tactical mistake i was not making fun of her cazaril protested indignantly was she still angry at me when she left no no she wasnt angry she was persuaded it was fever and was very worried withal if i were you id claim it for fever i could not write a poem to all of her just yet i tried too overwhelming well if you must scribble paeans to her body parts pick lips lips are more romantic than noses why asked cazaril isnt every part of her an amazement yes but we kiss lips we dont kiss noses normally men write poems to the objects of our desire in order to lure them closer how practical in that case youd think men would write more poems to ladies private parts the ladies would hit us lips are a safe compromise being as it were a standin or steppingstone to the greater mysteries hah anyway i desire all of her nose and lips and feet and all the parts between and her soul without which her mere body would be all still and cold and claylike and start to rot and be not an object of desire at all agh palli ran his hand through his hair my friend you do not understand romance i promise you i do not understand anything anymore i am gloriously bewildered he lay back in his cushions and laughed softly palli snorted and bent forward to pick up the paper from the top of the pile the only one so far with writing on it he glanced down it and his brows rose whats this this isnt about ladies noses his face sobered his gaze traveled back to the top of the page and down once more in fact im not just sure what its about although it makes the hairs stand up on the backs of my arms oh that its nothing i fear i was tryingbut it wasntcazarils hands waved helplessly and came back to touch his browit wasnt what i saw he added in explanation i thought in poetry the words might bear more freight exist on both sides of the wall between the worlds as people do so far im just creating waste paper fit only for lighting a fire hm said palli unobtrusively he folded up the paper and tucked it inside his vestcloak ill try again sighed cazaril maybe i can get it right someday i must write some hymns to matter too birds stones that would please the lady i think palli blinked to lure her closer might dangerous stuff this poetry i think ill stick to action myself cazaril grinned at him watch out my lord dedicat action can be prayer too whispers and muffled giggles sounded from the end of the gallery cazaril looked up to see some servant women and boys crouched behind the carved railings peeking through at him palli followed his glance one girl popped up boldly and waved at them amiably cazaril waved back the giggles rose to a crescendo and the women scurried off palli scratched his ear and regarded cazaril with wry inquiry cazaril explained people have been sneaking in all morning to see the spot where poor dy jironal was struck down if hes not careful lord dy baocia will lose his nice new courtyard to a shrine palli cleared his throat actually caz theyre sneaking in to peek at you a couple of dy baocias servants are charging admission to conduct the curious in and out of the palace i was of two minds whether to quash the enterprise but if theyre bothering you i will he shifted as if to rise oh oh no dont trouble them i have made a great deal of extra work for the palace servants let them profit a bit palli snorted but shrugged acquiescence and you still have no fever i wasnt sure at first but no that physician finally let me eat although not enough i am healing i think thats a miracle in itself worth a vaida to see yes im not quite sure if putting me back into the world this way was a parting gift of the lady or just a chance benefit of her need to have someone on this side to hold open the gate for her ordol was right about the gods being parsimonious well its all right either way we shall surely meet again someday he leaned back staring into the sky the ladys own blue his lips curled up unwilled you were the soberest fellow i ever met and now you grin all the time caz are you sure she got your soul back in right way round cazaril laughed out loud maybe not you know how it is when you travel you pack all your things in your saddlebags and by the journeys end they seem to have doubled in volume and are hanging out every which way even though youd swear you added nothing he patted his thigh perhaps i am just not packed into this battered old case as neatly as i used to be palli shook his head in wonder and so now you leak poetry huh ten more days of healing left cazaril not at all bored with resting if only his ease were not so empty of the people he desired at last his longing for them overcame his revulsion at the prospect of getting on a horse again and he set palli to arranging their journey pallis protests at this premature exercise were perfunctory easily overborne as he was no less anxious than cazaril to see how events in cardegoss went on cazaril and his escort including the everfaithful ferda and foix traveled up the road in the fine weather in gentle easy stages a world apart from winters desperate ride each evening cazaril was helped from his horse swearing that tomorrow they would go more slowly and each morning he found himself even more eager to push on at length the distant zangre again rose before his eyes against the backdrop of puffy white clouds blue sky and green fields it seemed a rich ornament to the landscape a few miles out of cardegoss they encountered another procession on the road men in the livery of the provincar of labran escorted three carts and a trailing tail of mules and servants two of the carts were piled with baggage the third carts canvas top rolled up to open the sides to the spring scenery shaded several ladies the ladies cart pulled to the side of the road and a servingwoman leaned out to call to one of the outriders the labran sergeant bent his head to her rode up in turn to palli and cazaril and saluted if it please you sirs if one of you is the castillar dy cazaril my lady the dowager royina sara bidbegs he corrected himself you to wait upon her the present provincar of labran cazaril was reminded was royina saras nephew he gathered that he was witnessing her removalor retreatto her family estates there he returned the salute i am entirely at the royinas service foix helped cazaril from his horse steps were let down from the back of the cart and the ladies and maidservants descended to stroll together about the fallow field nearby and examine the spring wildflowers sara remained seated in the shadow of the canvas please you castillar she called softly i am glad for this chance crossing can you bide with me a moment i am honored lady he ducked his head and climbed into the cart seating himself on the padded bench opposite hers the baggage mules plodded on past them a peaceful distant murmur enveloped the scene of birdsong low voices the bridlejingle and champing of the horses let to graze by the roadside and the occasional trill of laugher from the maidservants sara was dressed now in a simply cut gown and vestcloak of lavender and black mourning for poor doomed orico presumably my apologies said cazaril with an acknowledging nod at her garb for not attending the royas funeral i was not yet recovered enough to travel she waved this away from what iselle and bergon and lady betriz have told me it is a miracle you survived your wounds yes well precisely she gave him an oddly sympathetic look orico was taken up safely then cazaril asked yes by the bastard as godsrejected in death as he was in life it stirred a bit of unpleasant speculation about his parentage alas not so lady he was surely iass child i think the bastard has been special guardian of his house since fonsas reign and so this time the god picked first not last she shrugged her thin shoulders a sorry guardianship if so on the day before he died orico said to me that he wished hed been born the son of a woodcutter and not the son of the roya of chalion of all the epitaphs on his death his own seems the most apposite to me her voice grew a shade more sour martou dy jironal they say was taken up by the father so i had heard they sent his body to his daughter in thistan to take charge of well he too had his part to play and little enough joy it brought him in the end he offered after a moment i can personally guarantee you though his brother dondo was carried to the bastards hell a small grim smile curved her lips perchance he may learn better manners there there seemed nothing to add to this as epitaphs went cazaril was reminded of a curiosity and diffidently cleared his throat the day before orico died and which day would that have been my lady her eyes flew to his and her dark brows went up after a moment she said why the day after iselles wedding of course not the day before martou dy jironal seemed strangely misinformed then not to mention premature in certain of his actions and it seems to me very like a certain cursed luck to die just a day before ones rescue i and oricos physician and archdivine mendenal who all attended on him together will all swear that orico yet lived to speak to us that afternoon and evening and did not breathe his sad last until early the next morning she met his gaze very directly indeed her lips still set in that same grim curve and so iselles marriage to royse bergon is unassailably valid and thus a legal quibble was rendered unavailable to disaffected lords as a pretext for defiance cazaril imagined it her daylong secret deathwatch beside the gelid bloated corpse of her husband what had she thought about what had she reflected upon as the hours crept by in that sealed chamber and yet she had made of that horror a pragmatic gift for iselle and bergon for the house of chalion that she was departing he pictured her suddenly as a tidy housewife sweeping out her old familiar rooms for the last time and leaving a vase of flowers on the hearth for the new owners i think i see i think you do you always had very seeing eyes castillar she added after a moment and a discreet tongue a condition of my service royina you have served the house of chalion well better perhaps than it deserved but not half so well as it needed she sighed agreement he made polite inquiry after her plans she was indeed returning to her home province to take residence at a country estate happily to be entirely under her own direction she seemed not just resigned but eager to escape cardegoss and leave it to her successors cazaril rising wished her well and a safe journey with all his heart he kissed her hands she in turn kissed his and briefly touched her fingertips to his forehead as he bent to her he watched her train of carts rumble away wincing in sympathy as they jounced over the ruts the roads of chalion could use improvement cazaril decided and he had ridden over enough of them to know hed seen roads in the archipelago made wide and smooth for all weathersperhaps iselle and bergon needed to import some roknari masons better roads with fewer bandits on them would do a world of good for chalion chalionibra he corrected this thought and smiled as foix gave him a leg up onto his horse palli had sent ferda galloping ahead while cazaril lingered by the roadside to speak with royina sara as a result the zangres castle warder and an array of servants were waiting to greet the party from taryoon when they rode at last into the castle courtyard the castle warder bowed to cazaril as the grooms helped him down from his horse cazaril stretched carefully and asked in an eager voice are royina iselle and royse bergon within no my lord they are just this hour gone to the temple for the ceremonies of investiture for lord dy yarrin and royse bergon the new royina had as anticipated selected dy yarrin for the new holy general of the daughters order the appointment of bergon to the sons generalship was in cazarils view a brilliant stroke to recover direct control of that important military arm for the royacy and remove it as a bone of contention among the high lords of chalion it had been iselles own idea too when they had discussed the matter before she and bergon had left taryoon cazaril had pointed out that while she could not in honor fail to reward dy yarrins loyalty with the appointment hed so ardently desired dy yarrin was not a young man in time the generalship of the daughter too must revert to the royacy ah cried palli today is it is the ceremony still going forward then i believe so march if i hurry perhaps i can see some of it cazaril may i leave you to the good care of this gentleman my lord warder see that he takes his rest he is not nearly so recovered from his late wounds as he will try to make you believe palli reined his horse around and gave cazaril a cheery salute i shall return with all the tale for you when its done followed by his little company he trotted back out the gate grooms and servants whisked away horses and baggage cazaril refused in what he hoped was a dignified manner the support of the castle warders proffered arm at least until they should have reached the stairs the castle warder called him back as he started toward the main block your room has been moved by order of the royina to iass tower the castle warder explained that you may be near her and the royse oh that had a pleasing sound to it agreeably cazaril followed the man up to the third floor where royse bergon and his ibran courtiers had taken their new residence although bergon had evidently chosen another official bedchamber for himself than the one orico had lately died in not cazaril was given to understand that the royse slept there iselle had just moved into the old royinas suite above the castle warder showed cazaril to the room near bergons that was to be his someone had moved his trunk and few possessions over from his old chamber and entirely new clothing for tonights banquet was already laid out waiting cazaril let the servants bring him wash water but then shooed them away and lay down obediently to rest this lasted about ten minutes he rose again and prowled up one flight to examine his new office arrangements a maidservant recognizing him curtsied him past he poked his nose into the chamber sara had kept for her secretary as he expected it was now filled with his records books and ledgers from the royesses former household with a great many more added unexpectedly a neat darkhaired fellow who looked to be about thirty years old manned his broad desk he wore the gray robe and carmine shoulder braid of a divine of the father and was scratching figures into one of cazarils own account books opened correspondence lay fanned out at his left hand and a larger stack of finished letters rose at his right he glanced up at cazaril in polite but cool inquiry may i help you sir iexcuse me i do not believe we have met who are you i am learned bonneret royina iselles private secretary cazarils mouth opened and shut but im royina iselles private secretary a temporary appointment is it bonnerets eyebrows went up well i trust it shall be permanent how came you by the post archdivine mendenal was kind enough to recommend me to the royina lately excuse me you are lately appointed these two weeks past sir bonneret frowned in faint annoyance ahyou have the advantage of me i believe quite the reverse the royina didnt tell me said cazaril was he discarded shunted from his position of trust granted the avalanche of tasks attendant upon iselles ascension to the royacy was hardly going to halt while cazaril slowly recovered someone had to attend to them and cazaril noted by the outgoing inscriptions bonneret had beautiful handwriting the divine was frowning more deeply at him he supplied my name is cazaril bonnerets frown evaporated to be replaced with an even more alarming awed smile he dropped his quill spattering ink and scrambled abruptly to his feet my lord dy cazaril i am honored he bowed low what may i do to help you my lord he repeated in a very different tone this eager courtesy daunted cazaril far more than bonnerets former superciliousness he mumbled some incoherent excuse for his intrusion pleaded weariness from the road and fled back downstairs he filled a little time inventorying his clothing and toofew books and arranging them in his new chamber amazingly nothing seemed to be missing from his possessions he wandered to his narrow window which looked down over the town he swung his casement wide and craned his neck out but no sacred crows flew in to visit him with the curse broken the menagerie gone did they still roost in fonsas tower he studied the temple domes and made plans to seek out umegat at his first opportunity then he sat in bewilderment he was shaken and knew it partly for an effect of fatigue his energy was still fragile spasmodic his healing gut wound ached from the mornings riding although not as much as when dondo had used to claw him from the inside he was gloriously unoccupied a fact that alone had been enough to keep him ecstatically happy for days it didnt seem to be working this afternoon though all his urgent push to arrive here made this quiet rest that everybody thought he ought to be having feel rather a letdown his mood darkened maybe there was no use for him in this new chalionibra iselle would need more learned smoother men now to help manage her vastly enlarged affairs than a battered and well strange exsoldier with a weakness for poetry worseto be culled from iselles service was to be exiled from betrizs daily presence no one would light his reading candles at dusk or make him wear warm unfashionable hats or notice if he fell ill and bring him frightening physicians or pray for his safety when he was far from home he heard the clatter and noise of what he presumed was iselle and bergons party returning from the ceremonies at the temple but even at an angle his window did not give a view onto the courtyard he ought to rush out to greet them no im resting that sounded mulish and petulant even to his own inward ear dont be a fool but a dreary fatigue anchored him in his chair before he could overcome his wash of melancholy bergon himself bustled into his chamber and then it became impossible to stay downatthemouth the royse was still wearing the brown orange and yellow robes of the holy general of the sons order with its broad sword belt ornamented with the symbols of autumn all looking a lot better on him than they ever had on old gray dy jironal if bergon was not a joy to the god there was no pleasing him at all cazaril rose and bergon embraced him inquired after his trip from taryoon and his healing barely waited for the answer tried to tell him in turn of eight things at once then burst out laughing at himself there will be time for all this shortly right now i am on a mission from my wife the royina of chalion but tell me first and privately lord cazdo you love the lady betriz cazaril blinked i she very fond royse good i mean i was sure of it but iselle insisted i ask first now and very importantare you willing to be shaved iwhat cazarils hand went to his beard it was not at all as scraggly as it had started out it had filled in nicely he thought and besides he kept it neatly trimmed is there some reason you ask me this not that it matters greatly beards grow back i suppose but youre not madly attached to it or anything right not madly no my hand was shaky for a time after the galleys and i did not care to carve myself bloody but i could not afford a barber then i just became used to it good bergon returned to the doorway and thrust his head through to the corridor all right come in a barber and a servant holding a can of hot water trooped in at the royses command the barber made cazaril sit and whipped his cloth around him cazaril found himself soaped up before he could make remark the servant held the basin beneath his chin as the barber humming under his breath went to work with his steel cazaril stared down crosseyed over his nose as blobs of soapy gray and black hair splatted into the tin basin the barber made unsettling little chirping noises but at last smiled in satisfaction and grandly gestured the basin away there my lord some work with a hot towel and a cold lavenderscented tincture that stung completed his artistic effort the royse dropped a coin into the barbers hand that made him bow low and murmuring compliments retreat backwards through the door again feminine giggles sounded from the hallway a voice not quite low enough whispered see iselle he does too have a chin told you yes you were right quite a nice one iselle stalked in with her back straight trying to be very royal in her elaborate gown from the investiture but couldnt keep her gravity she looked at cazaril and burst into laughter at her shoulder betriz almost as finely dressed was all dimples and bright brown eyes and a complex hairstyle that seemed to involve a lot of black ringlets framing her face bouncing in a fascinating manner as she moved iselles hand went to her lips five gods cazaril once youre fetched out from behind that gray hedge youre not so old after all not old at all corrected betriz sturdily he had risen at the royesses entry and swept them a courtly bow his hand unwilled went to touch his unaccustomedly naked and cool chin no one had offered him a mirror by which to examine the cause of all this female hilarity all ready reported bergon mysteriously iselle smiling took betrizs hand bergon grasped cazarils iselle struck a pose and announced in a voice suited to a throne room my bestbeloved and most loyal lady betriz dy ferrej has begged a boon of me which i grant with all the gladness of my heart and as you have no father now lord cazaril bergon and i shall take his place as your liege lords she has asked for your hand as it pleases us greatly that our two most beloved servants should also love each other be you betrothed with our goodwill bergon turned up his hand with cazarils in it betrizs descended upon it capped by iselles the royse and royina pressed their hands together and stood back both grinning but but but stammered cazaril but this is very wrong isellebergonto sacrifice this maiden to reward my gray hairs is a repugnant thing he did not let go of betrizs hand we just got rid of your gray hairs pointed out iselle she looked him over judiciously its a vast improvement i have to agree bergon observed and i must say she doesnt look very repulsed betrizs dimples were as deep as ever cazaril had seen them and her merry eyes gleamed up at him through her demurely sweeping lashes but but and anyway iselle continued briskly im not sacrificing her to you as a reward for your loyalty im bestowing you on her as a reward for her loyalty so there oh oh well thats better then cazaril squinted trying to reorient his spinning mind but surely there are greater lords richer younger handsomer more worthy yes well she didnt ask for them she asked for you no accounting for taste eh said bergon eyes alight and i must quibble with at least part of your estimate cazaril betriz said breathlessly there are no more worthy lords than you in chalion her grip in his tightened wait said cazaril feeling he was sliding down a slope of snow tractionless soft warm snow i have no lands no money how can i support a wife i plan to make the chancellorship a salaried position said iselle as the fox has done in ibra very wise royina to have your principal servants principal loyalties be to the royacy and not divided between crown and clan as dy jironals was who shall you appoint to replace him i have a few ideas cazaril her fond exasperation made familiar cadence with his name of course its you who did you think i should appoint surely that went without saying the duty must be yours cazaril sat down heavily in his late barber chair still not releasing his clutch on betrizs hand right now he said faintly her chin came up no no of course not tonight we feast tomorrow will do if youre feeling up to it by then bergon put in hastily its a vast task wish for bread and be handed a banquet between those who sought to overprotect him and those who sacrificed his comfort mercilessly to their aims without a second thought cazaril decided he rather preferred the latter chancellor dy cazaril my lord chancellor his lips moved as he shaped the syllables and crooked up we shall do these announcements all over again publicly tonight after dinner said iselle so dress yourself suitably cazaril bergon and i shall present the chain of office to you then before the court betriz attend upon meher lips curvedin a little while she tucked her hand through bergons arm and drew the royse out after her the door swung shut cazaril snaked his arm around betrizs waist and pulled her ruthlessly and not at all shyly down upon his lap she squeaked in surprise lips eh he murmured and fastened his to hers pausing for breath some time later she pulled her head back and happily rubbed her chin then his and now your kisses do not make me itch it was late the following morning before cazaril was at last able to seek out umegat at the bastards house a respectful acolyte ushered him to a pair of rooms on the third floor the tongueless groom daris answered the knock and bowed cazaril inside cazaril was not surprised to find him wearing the garb of a lay dedicat of the order tidy and white daris rubbed his chin and gestured at cazarils bare face uttering some smiling remark that cazaril was just as glad he could not make out the thumbless man beckoned him through the chamber furnished up as a sitting room and out to a little wooden balcony festooned with twining vines and rose geraniums in pots overlooking the temple square umegat also dressed in clean white sat at a tiny table in the cool shade and cazaril was thrilled to see paper and quill and ink before him daris hastily brought a chair that cazaril might sit before umegat could try to rise daris mouthed an inviting hum umegat interpreted an offer of hospitality and cazaril agreed to tea which daris bustled away to fetch whats this cazaril waved eagerly at the papers have you your writing back umegat grimaced so far i seem to be back to age five would that some of the rest of me was so rejuvenated he tilted the page to show a labored exercise of crudely drawn letters i keep putting them back in my mind and they keep falling out again my hand has lost its cleverness for the quilland yet i can still play the lute nearly as badly as ever the physician insists that i am improving and i suppose it is so for i could not do so little as this a month ago the words scuttle about on the page like crabs but every so often i catch one he glanced up and shrugged away his struggles but you great doings in taryoon were they not mendenal says you had a sword stuck through you punctured front to back admitted cazaril but it carved out lord dondo and the demon which made it altogether worth the pain the lady spared me from the killing fever after umegat glanced after daris then you got off lightly miraculously so umegat leaned a little forward across the table and gazed closely into his face hm hm youve been keeping high company i see have you your second sight back asked cazaril startled no its just a look a man gets that one learns to recognize indeed umegat had it too it seemed that if a man was godtouched and yet not pushed altogether offbalance it left him mysteriously centered thereafter you have seen your god too it was not a question once or twice umegat admitted how long does it take to recover im not sure yet umegat rubbed his lips thoughtfully studying cazaril tell meif you canwhat you saw it was not just the learned theologian talking shop cazaril saw the flash of fathomless godhunger in the roknaris gray eyes do i look like that when i speak of her no wonder men look at me strangely cazaril told the tale starting from his precipitate departure from cardegoss riding to the royesses ordering tea arrived was consumed and the cups refilled before he came to the end of it daris hunkered in the doorway listening cazaril supposed he need not ask after the exgrooms discretion when he tried to describe his gatheringin by the lady he became tonguetangled umegat hung on his halting words lips parted poetrypoetry might do it said cazaril i need words that mean more than they mean words not just with height and width but depth and weight and and other dimensions that i cannot even name hm said umegat i tried to recapture the god with music for a time after my first experience i had not the gift alas cazaril nodded he asked diffidently is there anything youeither of youneed that i can command iselle has yesterday made me chancellor of chalion so i suppose i can command well rather a lot umegats brows flicked up he favored cazaril with a little congratulatory bow from his seat that was well done of the young royina cazaril grimaced i keep thinking about dead mens boots actually umegats smile glimmered i understand as for us the temple cares for its exsaints reasonably well and supplies us all that we can presently use i like these rooms this city this spring air my company i hope the god will yet grant me an interesting task or two before im done although by preference not with animals or royalty cazaril made a motion of sympathy i suppose you knew poor orico as well as almost anyone except perhaps sara i saw him nearly every day for six years he spoke to me most frankly toward the end i hope i was a consolation to him cazaril hesitated for what its worth i came to the conclusion that he was something of a hero umegat nodded briefly so did i in a frustrating sort of way he was a sacrifice surely he sighed well it is a particular sin to permit grief for what is gone to poison the praise for what blessings remain to us the tongueless man rose from his silent spot to take away the tea things thank you daris said umegat and patted the hand that touched him briefly on the shoulder daris gathered up the cups and plates and padded off cazaril stared curiously after him have you known him long about twenty years then he was not just your assistant in the menagerie cazaril lowered his voice was he martyred back then no not yet oh umegat smiled dont look so glum lord cazaril we get better that was yesterday this is today i shall ask his permission to tell you the tale of it sometime i should be honored with his confidence all is well and if its not then at least each day brings us closer to our god i had noticed that i had a little trouble tracking time the first few days after after i saw the lady time and scale both altered out of reckoning a light knock sounded upon the chamber door daris emerged from the other room and went to admit a whitesmocked young dedicat who held a book in her hand ah umegat brightened it is my reader make your bow to the lord chancellor dedicat he added in explanation they send a delinquent dedicat to read to me for an hour a day as a light punishment for small infractions of the house rules have you decided what rule you mean to break tomorrow girl the dedicat grinned sheepishly im thinking learned umegat well if you run out of ideas i will harken back to my youth and see if i cant remember a few more the dedicat tipped the book toward cazaril i thought i would be sent to read dull theology to the divine but instead he wanted this book of tales cazaril glanced over the volume an ibran import judging by the printers mark with interest its a fine conceit said umegat the author follows a group of travelers to a pilgrimage shrine and has each one tell his or her tale in turn very ah holy actually my lord the dedicat whispered some of them are very lewd i see i must dust off ordols sermon on the lessons of the flesh i have promised the dedicat time off from the bastards penances for her blushes i fear she believes me umegat smiled i ah should be very pleased to borrow that book when youre finished with it cazaril said hopefully ill have it sent up to you my lord cazaril made his farewells he recrossed the fivesided temple square and headed uphill but turned aside before the zangre came in sight and made his way to provincar dy baocias town palace the blocky old stone building resembled jironal palace though much smaller with no windows on its lower floor and its next floors casements protected by wroughtiron grilles it had been reopened not only for its lord and lady but also the old provincara and lady ista who had arrived from valenda full to bursting its former sullen empty silence was turned to bustle cazaril stated his rank and business to a bowing porter and was whisked inside without question or delay the porter led him to a high sunny chamber at the back of the house here he found dowager royina ista sitting out on a little ironrailed balcony overlooking the small herb garden and stable mews she dismissed her attendant woman and gestured cazaril to the vacated chair almost knee to knee with her istas dun hair was neatly braided today wreathing her head both her face and her dress seemed somehow crisper more clearly defined than cazaril had ever seen them before this is a pleasant place cazaril observed easing himself down in the chair yes i like this room it is the one i had when i was a girl when my father brought us up to the capital with him which was not often best of all i cannot see the zangre from it she gazed down into the domestic square of garden embroidered with green protected and contained you came to the banquet there last night he had only been able to exchange a few formal words with her in that company ista merely congratulating him on his chancellorship and his betrothal and departing early you looked very well too i must say i could see iselle was gratified she inclined her head i eat there to please her i do not care to sleep there i suppose the ghosts are still about i cannot see them now to my great relief nor i with sight or second sight but i feel them as a chill in the walls or perhaps its just the memory of them that chills me she rubbed her arms as if to warm them i abhor the zangre i understand the poor ghosts much better now than when they first terrified me said cazaril diffidently i thought their exile and erosion was a rejection by the gods at first a damnation but now i know it for a mercy when the souls are taken up they remember themselves the minds possess their lives all whole all at once as the gods do with nearly the terrible clarity that matter remembers itself for some for some that heaven would be as unbearable as any hell and so the gods release them to forgetfulness forgetfulness that smudged oblivion seems a very heaven to me now i pray to be such a ghost i think i fear it is a mercy you shall be denied cazaril cleared his throat you know the curse is lifted off of iselle and bergon and all and banished out of chalion yes iselle has told me of it to the limit of her understanding but i knew it when it happened my ladies were dressing me to go down to the daughters day morning prayers there was nothing to see nothing to hear or feel but it was as though a fog had lifted from my mind i did not realize how closely it had cloaked me round like a clammy mist on the skin of my soul till it was lifted i was sorry then for i thought it meant you had died died indeed but the lady put me back into the world well into my body my friend palli would have it that she put me back in upside down his smile flickered ista looked away the curses lifting made my pain more clear and yet more distant it felt very strange he cleared his throat you were right lady ista about the prophecy the three deaths i was wrong with my marriage scheme wrong and determined to be so because i was afraid your way seemed too hard and yet it came right despite myself in the end by the ladys grace she nodded i would have done it myself if i could have my sacrifice was evidently not deemed acceptable bitterness tinged her voice it was not a matter ofthats not the reason protested cazaril well it is but it isnt it has to do with the shape of your soul not its worthiness you have to make a cup of yourself to receive that pouring out you are a sword you were always a sword like your mother and your daughter toosteel spines run in the women of your family i realize now why i never saw saints before the world does not crash upon their wills like waves upon a rock or part around them like the wake of a ship instead they are supple and swim through the world as silently as fishes her brows rose at him though whether in agreement disagreement or some polite irony he was not sure where will you go now he asked her now that you are better that is she shrugged my mother grows frail i suppose we shall reverse chairs and i shall attend upon her in the castle of valenda as she attended upon me i should prefer to go somewhere that i have never been before not valenda not cardegoss someplace with no memories he could not argue with this he thought on umegat not exactly her spiritual superior but so experienced in loss and woe as to have recovery down to nearly a routine ista had yet another twenty years to find her way to a balance like that at about the age ista was now retrieving the broken body of his friend from whatever episode of horrors had shattered him perhaps umegat had railed and wailed as heartrendingly as she had or cursed the gods as coldly as her frozen silences i shall have to have you meet my friend umegat he told ista he was the saint given to preserve orico exsaint now as you and i are too i think i think you and he could have some interesting conversations she opened her hand warily neither encouraging this idea nor denying its possibility cazaril resolved to pursue their introduction later attempting to turn her thoughts to happier matters he asked after iselles coronation which ista and the proud and eager provincara had arrived in cardegoss just in time to attend hed so far asked some four or five people to describe it to him but he hadnt grown tired of the accounts yet she grew animated for a little her delight in her daughters victory softening her face and illuminating her eyes the fate of teidez lay between them untouched as if by mutual assent this was not the day to press those tender wounds lest they break and bleed anew some later stronger hour would be time enough to speak of the lost boy at length he bowed his head and made to bid her good day ista suddenly urgent leaned forward to touch him for the first time upon his hand bless me cazaril before you go he was taken aback lady i am no more saint now than you are and surely not a god to call down blessings at my will and yet he wasnt a royesse either but he had borne the proxy for one to ibra and made binding contract in her name lady of spring if ever i served you redeem your debt to me now he licked his lips but i will try he leaned forward and placed his hand on istas white brow he did not know where the words came from but they rose to his lips nonetheless this is a true prophecy as true as yours ever were when the souls rise up in glory yours shall not be shunned nor sundered but shall be the prize of the gods gardens even your darkness shall be treasured then and all your pain made holy he sat back and shut his mouth abruptly as a surge of terror ran through him is it well is it ill am i a fool istas eyes filled with tears that did not fall her hand cupped upward upon her knee grew still she ducked her head in clumsy acceptance as awkwardly as a child taking its first step in a shaken voice she said you do that very well cazaril for a man who claims to be an amateur he swallowed nodded back smiled took his leave and fled into the street as he turned up the hill his stride lengthened despite the slope his ladies would be waiting
