present afternoon sunlight slanted through the open window warming the skin of the old mans face throwing into bright relief the twoday gray stubble salvatore russo reclined in an ancient barcalounger that hed pulled over to catch the rays god knows balmy weather was rare enough in san francisco you took it when you could he had his eyes closed remembering another sundappled day but to sal it didnt feel as though he were remembering it it was more immediate than that he was living that longago moment all over again helen raessler was nineteen and the light shone off her honeycolored hair she was lying on her back on the sand in a dune at ocean beach even now he could feel the warm sand they were sheltered by the contours of the land by the surrounding sedge in spite of the difference in their backgrounds sal knew that helen loved him she loved his big hands already heavily calloused from work and from baseball and his thick hair and powerful chest he was twentyfive no he is twentyfive he pulls away from their kiss so that he can see her perfect face he traces the line of her jaw with his workmans hand and she takes it and brings it down over her sweater to her breast theyve been seeing each other for a little more than a month and the heat between them has scared him hes been afraid to push her physically in any way they havent done even this yet they are kissing again and a sound escapes her throat it is hunger he can feel the swollen nipple under the fabric of the sweater he realizes that she has purposely worn no bra a gull screeches high overhead the waves pound off in the distance over the dunes the sun is hot on him and then his shirt is open and her smooth hand is under it pinching at his nipple drawing her nails down his side his belly he pulls away again to see her its okay he says ill stop no his hand has found her and she nods hurry she pulls at his belt and gets it undone she wears only a short skirt and it is up near her waist now and he is on top of her her panties moved to one side she arches once into him there is a moment of resistance but she pushes violently then once with a small cry and he is in her and she sets him and the world explodes in sensation opening his eyes he looked down surprised and absurdly pleased with his erection well what do you know he thought aint dead yet but the thought as they all seemed to fled as did the tumescence his headache returnedthe sharp blinding pain frowning he brought his hands to his temples and pressed with all his might there better but lord he could certainly do without that he looked around the room was furnished in salvation army sals lounger had bad springs and canted slightly to one side but it was comfortable enough over the sagging green couch hung a piece of plywood upon which sixteen years ago sal had watercolored his old fishing boat the signing bonus the grain of the wood showed through the faded paint but in the right light now for instance he could make out what hed done there was a coffee table in front of the couch and a couple of pine endtables scarred with cigarette burns and water stains on either side of it the walltowall carpeting was worn to its threads but sal didnt need much and he had more than most of the other people who lived in this building a corner that got some sun the place was small okay but had three legitimate rooms this one and the kitchen and bedroom plus its own bathroom what the hell more did anybody need there was still most of a bottle of old crow next to a halffilled tumbler on the low table and sal leaned forward picked up the glass and smelled to see what was in it he didnt remember pouring any of the booze but thats what it was all right he drank it off a mouthful something was nagging at him what day was it he ought to get up check the calendar in the kitchen he was supposed to be somewhere but damned if he could remember he closed his eyes again the sun on his face making him squint against it hes on the thirdbase side a weekend day game at candlestick and everybodys shocked its so nice out where s the wind the whole family s down on the field helens holding his hand and smiling proud of their oldest graham out in the middle of the diamond now by the mound getting his fiftydollar us savings bond for winning his age in the finals of the citys hitandthrow contest kids only eight and hits a hardball a hundred and fifty feet off a tee he s gonna be another dimag you wait and see sixyearold deb holds her moms other hand and embarrassed at being out in front of thirty thousand fans holds on to her old mans leg at the same time her little brother georgie begs himself a shoulder ride and now bounces up there bumping his heels against his dads chest holds on to his hair with both hands pulling but it doesnt hurt nothing hurts sals got helen and hes got the kids his own boat hes his own boss the sun is shining on him but its gotten cold he should get up dusk was coming on and wheres the day gone he walked over to the window and pulled it down against the breeze sharp now he could see the fog curling around twin peaks straightening up he stopped still his head cocked to one side god damn it he yelled it aloud and raced into the kitchen the day was circled on his calendar friday friday you fool he told himself business day customer day makeyourrent day keep your life together the one day youve got to no no no yelling at himself stomping on the floor furious he swore again violently then kicked at the chair near the table but it just sat there obstinate so he grabbed the back of it and sent it flying across the room where it slammed into the cabinets cutting new gouges into the pitted wood he left the chair where it was on the floor then stood a long moment forcing himself to calm down to think this was one of the signs wasnt it hed warned himself to be sure to recognize them when they got here and now he wasnt going to go denying them his mind was going to leave him someday inevitably and in the lucid moments he was clear on his strategy he wasnt going to go out mumbling with shit in his diapers he was going to die like a man he had the syringes the morphine he still knew where they were thank god for graham his one good son the one good thing when he looked back over it all he would call graham thats what hed do he walked back through the living room how had the window gotten closed he was sure hed been sitting in the chair and then hed remembered it was friday and hed gone into the kitchen all right the syringe he remembered he could still remember god damn it but then he saw his watercolor and stopped again lost in the lines hed painted so long ago trying to render his old boat a foghorn sounded and he stared at the window again the closed window he stood in the center of the room unmoving he had been going somewhere specific it would come to him another minute standing there trying to remember and another blinding stab of pain in his head tears ran down his face the vials the supply of morphine were in the medicine cabinet with a couple of syringes and he took the stuff out and laid it on the dresser next to his bed he went back to the kitchen somebody had knocked the chair over but hed get that in a minute or not that wasnt what hed come in here for hed come in to check something oh there it was the fluorescent orange sticker taped to the front of the refrigerator opening the freezer he found the aluminum tube where he kept the doctors do not resuscitate form it was still inside the tube where it should be where the paramedics would look for it the form told whoever found him to let him alone dont try to help him dont hook him up to any damn machines he left the form in the freezer in his bedroom again he gathered the other paraphernalia and went back into the living room where he laid it all out on the coffee table next to his bottle of old crow the window drew him to it the thin ribbon of light over the fog he sat himself on the couch and poured himself another couple of fingers of bourbon for courage he hadnt heard any approaching footsteps out in the hallway but now someone was knocking on his door suddenly he realized he must have called graham after all to save his life for this moment it wasnt time for him to die yet it was close maybe but it wasnt time he had called graham he remembered now and his boy had come and they would find some way to work it all out until it really was time dignity that was all he wanted anymore a little dignity and perhaps a few more good days he got up to answer the door part one dismas hardy was enjoying a superb round of darts closing in on what might become a personal best he was in his office on a monday morning throwing his gram handtooled customflighted tungsten beauties he called the game down although it wasnt any kind of sanctioned affair it had begun as simple practice once around and down the board from to bullseye hed turned the practice rounds into a game against himself his record was twentyfive throws the best possible round was twentyone and now he was shooting at the with his nineteenth dart a twentytwo was still possible beating twentyfive was going to be a lock assuming his concentration didnt get interrupted on his desk the telephone buzzed hed worked downtown at an office on sutter street for nearly six years the rest of the building was home to david freeman associates a law firm specializing in plaintiffs personal injury and criminal defense work but hardy wasnt one of freemans associates technically he didnt work for freeman at all although lately almost all of his billable hours had come from a client his landlord had farmed out to him hardy occupied the only office on the top floor of the building both literally and figuratively he was on his own he held on to his dart and threw an evil eye at the telephone behind him which buzzed again to throw now would be to miss he sat back on the desk punched a button yo freemans receptionist phyllis had grown to tolerate perhaps even like hardy although it was plain that she disapproved of his casual attitude this was a law firm lawyers should answer their phone crisply with authority and dignity they shouldnt just pick up and say yo he took an instants pleasure in her sigh she lowered her voice theres a man down here to see you he doesnt have an appointment it was the same tone she would have used if the guest had stepped in something on the sidewalk he says he knows you from a pause while she sought a suitable euphemism she finally failed and had to come out with the hated truth your bar his name is graham russo hardy knew half a dozen russos it was a common name in san francisco but hearing that graham from the little shamrock was downstairs presumably in need of a lawyers services narrowed it down hardy glanced at his wall calendar it was monday may sighing he put his precious dart down on his desk and told phyllis to send mr russo right on up hardy was standing at his door as graham trudged up the stairs a handsome athletic young guy with the weight of this world on his shoulders and at least one other world hardy knew that had crashed and burned all around him they had met when graham showed up for a beer at the shamrock over the course of the night hardy moonlighting behind the bar found out a lot about him graham too was an attorney although he wasnt practicing right at the moment the community had blackballed him hardy had had his own runins with the legal bureaucracy and knew how devastating the ostracism could be hell even when you were solidly within it the law life itself was so unrelentingly adversarial that the whole world sometimes took on a hostile aspect so the two men had hit it off both men were estranged from the law in their own ways graham had stayed after last call helped clean up he was a sweet kid maybe a little naive and idealistic but his head seemed to be on straight hardy liked him before the law grahams world had been baseball an allamerican center fielder at usf during the late eighties hed batted and had been drafted in the sixth round by the dodgers he then played two years in the minor leagues making it to doublea san antonio before hed fouled a ball into his own left eye that injury had hospitalized him for three weeks and when he got out his vision didnt come with him and so with a lifetime pro average of well on the way to the bigs hed had to give it all up rootless and disheartened he had enrolled in law school at boalt hall in berkeley graduating at the top of his class he beat out intense competition and got hired for a oneyear term as a clerk with the ninth circuit court of appeals but he only stayed six months in early the year of the baseball strike about two months after he passed the bar he quit he wanted after all to play baseball so he went to vero beach florida to try out as a replacement player for the dodgers and he made the team at the shamrock hed made it clear to hardy that hed never have played as a scab all along all hed wanted out of the deal was for the dodgers to take another look at him the fuzziness had disappeared from his vision he was still in great shape he thought he could shine in spring training get cut as a replacement when they all did but at least have a shot at the minors again and thats what happened he started the season with the albuquerque dukes triple a farther along the path to the major leagues than hed been seven years earlier but he couldnt find the damn curveball and the new shot at his baseball career upon which hed risked everything lasted only six weeks his average was when he got cut outright he hadnt had a hit in his last seven games hell he told hardy he would have cut himself graham had a lumberjacks shoulders and the long legs of a high hurdler under a wave of golden hair his squarejawed face was clean shaven today he wore a grayblue sport coat over a royalblue dress shirt stonewashed jeans cowboy boots he was leaning forward on the front of the upholstered chair in front of hardys desk elbows on his knees hardy noticed the hands clasped in front of him the kind of hands that when he got older people would call gnarled workingmans hands huge and somehow expressive graham essayed a smile i dont even know why im here tell you the truth hardys face creased i often feel the same way myself he was sitting on the corner of his desk your dad graham nodded salvatore russo herb caen s column had dubbed him salmon sal and the name had stuck was recent news despondent over poor health his aging body and financial ruin sal had apparently killed himself last friday by having a few cocktails then injecting himself with morphine hed left a do not resuscitate form for the paramedics but he was already dead when theyd arrived to the public at large sal was mostly unknown but he was well known in san francisco s legal community every friday sal would make the rounds of the citys law workshops in an old ford pickup behind the hall of justice where hardy would see him hed park by the hydrant and sell salmon abalone sturgeon caviar and any other produce of the sea he happened to get his hands on his customers included cops federal municipal and superiorcourt judges attorneys federal marshals sheriffs and the staffs at both halls justice and city and at the federal courthouse the truck appeared only one day a week but since sals seafood was always fresher and a lot cheaper than at the markets he apparently made enough to survive notwithstanding the fact that he did it all illegally his salmon had their tails clipped which meant they had been caught for sport and couldnt be sold abalone was the same story private parties taking abalone for commercial sale had been outlawed for years his winterrun chinooks had probably been harvested by native americans using gill nets and yet year after year this stuff would appear in sals truckbed salmon sal had no retail license but it didnt matter because he was connected his childhood pals knew him from the days when fishermans wharf was a place where men went down to the sea in boats now these boys were judges and police lieutenants and heads of departments they were not going to bust him sal might live on the edge of the law but the establishment considered him one of the good guys a character in his yellow scarves and hip boots the unlit stogie chomped down to its last inch the gallon bottles from which he dispensed red and white plonk in dixie cups along with a steady stream of the most politically incorrect jokes to be found in san francisco the day hardy had met sal over a decade ago hed been with abe glitsky glitsky was half black and half jewish and every inch of him scary looking a hatchet face and a glowing scar through his lips top to bottom sal had seen him raised his voice hey abe theres this black guy and this jew sitting on the top of this building and they both fall off at the same time which one hits the ground first i dont know sal glitsky answered which one who cares now sal was dead and the newspapers had been rife with conjecture early evidence indicated that someone had been in the room with him when hed died a chair knocked over in the kitchen angry sounds other evidence of struggle the police were calling the death suspicious maybe someone had helped sal die put him on an early flight i didnt know sal was your father hardy said not until just now yeah well i didnt exactly brag about him graham took a breath and looked beyond hardy out the window the funerals tomorrow when no more words came hardy prompted him are you in trouble no a little too quickly too loud graham toned it down some no i dont think so i dont know why i would be hardy waited some more i mean theres a lot happening all at once the estate although the word estate is a joke dad asked me to be his executor although we never got around to drawing up the will so where does that leave it your guess is as good as mine you werent close you and your dad graham took a beat before he answered not very hardy thought the eye contact was a little overdone but he let it go hed see where this all was leading so you need help with the estate what kind of help thats just it i dont know what i need i need help in general graham hung his head and shook it then looked back up the cops have been around asking questions what kind of questions where was i on friday did i know about my dads condition like that it was obvious where they were going grahams blue eyes flashed briefly in anger maybe frustration how can they think i know anything about this my dad killed himself for a lot of good reasons the guys disoriented losing his mind hes in awesome pain idve done the same thing and what do the police think i dont know what they can be thinking another pause i hadnt seen him in a week first i heard of it was saturday night some homicide cop is at my place when i get home whered you get home from ball game he raised his eyes again spit out the next word softball we had a tournament in santa clara got eliminated in the fourth game so i got home early around six so where were you friday night graham spread his rodin hands i didnt kill my dad i didnt ask that i asked about friday night he let out a breath calming down after work home alone he smiled just like the movie home alone i love that answer the cop liked it too but for different reasons i could tell hardy nodded cops can be tough to please i worked till ninethirty what do you do besides baseball graham corrected him softball a shrug ive been working as a paramedic since well lately okay so you were riding in an ambulance friday night a nod i got home around tenfifteen i knew i had some games the next day five if we went all the way wanted to get some rest went to sleep what time did you go in to work around three threethirty i punched in theyll have a record of it and what time did they find your dad around ten at night graham didnt seem to have a problem with the timing although to hardy it invited some questions if his memory served him and it always did sal had apparently died between one and four oclock in the afternoon this was the issue graham was skirting which perhaps the police were considering if they were thinking about graham after all he would have had plenty of time between one oclock and when he checked into work near three but the young man was going on judge giotti you know judge giotti found him i read what was he doing there graham shrugged i just know what everybody knows hed finished having dinner downtown he had a fish order in and sal didnt show so he thought hed check the apartment see if he was okay and why would the judge do that the answer was unforced graham recounting old family history they were friends used to be anyway in high school then college they played ball together your father went to college graham nodded its weird isnt it salmon sal the college grad classic underachiever that was sal runs in the family he forced a smile making a joke but kept his hands clamped tightly together leaning forward casually elbows resting on his knees his knuckles were white so giotti hardy asked graham cast his eyes to the floor you werent his clerk were you the head came back up graham said no hed clerked for harold draper another federal judge with the ninth circuit i guess what im asking hardy continued is whether you and giotti him being your dads old pal and all developed any kind of relationship while you were clerking graham took a moment then shook his head no giotti came by once after i got hired to say congratulations but these judges dont have a life i didnt even see him in the halls and how long did you work there six months hardy slid from the desk and crossed to his window let me be sure ive got it right he said draper hired you to become a clerk for the ninth how many clerks does he have three for a year each right thats the term hardy thought so he went on when i was getting into practice right after the civil war a federal clerkship was considered the plum job of all time right out of law school is that still the case this brought a small smile everybody seems to think so but you quit after six months so you could try out as a replacement player during the baseball strike graham sat back finally unclenched his hands spread them out arrogant ungrateful wretch that i am so now everybody in the legal community thinks youre either disloyal or brain dead no those are my friends graham took a beat draper for example hates my guts so does his wife kids dogs the other two clerks the secretaries they all really really hate me personally everybody else just wishes id die soon as slowly and painfully as possible both hardy nodded so giotti didnt call you when he found your dad graham shook his head id be the last person hed call you walk out on one of these guys youre a traitor to the whole tribe thats why i came to you youre a lawyer wholl talk to me i think youre the last one who will and youre worried about the police a shrug not really i dont know i dont know what theyre thinking i doubt theyre thinking anything graham they just like to be thorough and ask a lot of questions which tends to make people nervous this other stuff with your background might have made the rounds so they might shake your tree a little harder see if something falls out nothings going to fall out my dad killed himself well maybe he didnt after all hardy was having lunch with lieutenant abraham glitsky in a booth at lou the greeks a subterranean barrestaurant across the street from the hall of justice the place was humming with humanity today and their booth was littered with the remains of their bowls and the fortune cookies that had come with their lunch special of tsatsikicovered hunan noodles yogurt and garlic over sesame oil pita bread on the side lou the greeks wife was the cook and she was chinese so the place always served polyglot lunches many of them surprisingly edible some not today wasnt too bad when glitsky smiled it almost never reached his eyes this kept it from being the cheerful thing that smiles were often cracked up to be the effect wasnt much enhanced by the thick scar through both his lips hardy knew that the scar had come from a boyhood accident on playbars but abe the tough cop liked to leave people with the impression that it had been acquired in a knife fight the two men had been friends since theyd walked a beat as cops together twentysome years before this was their first lunch in a couple of months hardy and graham russo had spent half an hour covering questions about sals estate the old truck some personal effects thriftshop clothes a few hundred dollars this discussion had left hardy wondering what might really be going on so hed decided to call abe it was one thing to speculate about what the police might be thinking it was another and altogether preferable to get it from the source except perhaps when the information was unwelcome as it was now what do you mean maybe sal didnt kill himself glitsky kept the infuriating nonsmile in place what words didnt you understand none of them had too many letters for which hardy wasnt in the mood he was happy enough to help graham out with estate issues but that was as far as it went although he had defended two murder cases in his time and won both of them he had no intention of getting involved in another one they invariably became too consuming too personal too agonizing and now glitsky was hinting that sal might not have been a suicide it wasnt so much the words as the meaning abe did sal kill himself or didnt he glitsky took his time draining his teacup before leaning across the booth elbows on the table the autopsy isnt in yet the humor vanished mysterious as its appearance you got a client this was tricky if someone had sought hardys help in connection with a homicide then that very fact would be relevant in the investigation of the death but hardy didnt want to lie to his friend he hadnt accepted anything like criminal defense work with graham so he shrugged im helping one of the kids on the estate which one a smile the executors come on abe what do you hear glitsky spread his hands on the table what i hear is that there was trauma around the injection site meaning meaning maybe he didnt stick himself maybe he jerked pulling away something like that which would mean what you know as well as me im reserving judgment waiting for strout john strout the coroner although the investigation as they say is continuing as you know we roll on homicides until strout calls us off hardy sat back glitsky waited another moment then gave in sals got a dnr in his freezer a sticker telling about it on his coffee table he was somewhere between very sick and about to die the death itself is pretty humane booze and morphine ends the pain i didnt read about pain i thought the story was he had alzheimers although hardy knew that graham had said his dad was in pain he didnt think this was public knowledge glitskys eyes had turned inward he reached for his empty teacup sucked at it put it back on the table hardy was watching him what the two guys used a vast vocabulary of the unsaid a shorthand of connection glitsky nodded we got our first woman inspector in the detail up from vice sarah evans very sharp good solid person she got teamed with lanier and pulled the case and she doesnt think it looks like a suicide your insight never lets up does it hardy nodded genially its why people both love and fear me he said so this sarah evans is hot for a righteous murder investigation and youre afraid she might be seeing things that arent there this time glitskys smile bordered on the genuine you got it all figured out why do you need me i dont youre just such a blast to hang out with but im right lets say youre not all wrong but there was this trauma evans noticed the trauma and a couple of other things sarah evans fancied herself a nononsense professional police person and not too many people would disagree with her after a decade of hard work she had conquered the perils of the job and the myriad sexual stereotypes of her superiors finally shed attained her personal career goal and had been promoted to sergeant inspector of homicide she had spent the weekend working on the death of sal russo from the outset something hadnt felt right about it to her shed sensed that sals apartment was trying to tell her something though she knew how stupid that would sound if she verbalized it she didnt know how to convey the idea to her partner a veteran male named marcel lanier a redundancy she realized since all veteran homicide inspectors in san francisco were male still the chair in the kitchen in sal russos apartment had been overturned there were fresh chip marks in the counter other things impressions really struck her the bump under sals ear the expression on the old mans face so far removed from what she would call peaceful his position on the floor why should he be on the floor she wondered if hed decided to kill himself she thought he would probably have sat in the comfortable chair given himself the shot gone to sleep but hed been on the floor curled fetally it just didnt feel right although she wasnt completely certain how things ought to feel was feeling part of it at all or was it as lanier had already repeated too many times more cut and dried the evidence points here or doesnt point there and thats all there is to it the homicide detail was mandated to investigate any unnatural death until the coroner called them off but lanier had seen a lot more homicides than she had and he thought this one was obviously a suicide if they wanted to work the whole damn weekend lanier told her they could more productively spend their time interviewing witnesses from their other homicides they had several hed reminded her a domesticviolence homicide a poor kid whose best friends father had kept his loaded in the unlocked drawer next to his bed some gangbangers shooting each other up it wasnt as if there wasnt work to do but sarah hadnt wanted the trail with sal if there was one to go cold not until strouts decision anyway so marcel went out and interviewed the elder son graham whose name had been supplied by judge giotti sarah had spent all of her saturday with the crime scene investigations team at sals apartment going through the closets and drawers and kitchen cabinets and cardboard boxes and garbage cans finding more bits of what she was calling evidence the large rather substantial safe that lay on its back under the bed the other syringes more morphine paper records she asked the fingerprint expert to dust all of it which he was inclined to do in any event there was more paper than she would have imagined crammed under the mattress in the cardboard file boxes next to sals dresser and along one wall in the three wastebaskets this was going to be a whole days work by itself but there was one sheet of paper in the wastebasket in the bathroom that particularly caught her attention it contained a long column of numbers three to a group obvious enough she went over to where theyd pulled the safe out from under the bed and tried them all the last one worked for all the good it did her except for an old leather belt the safe was empty by sunday afternoon shed read laniers interview with graham his story was that he and his dad hadnt gotten along salmon sal had abandoned his entire family when graham had been fifteen years old it wasnt the kind of thing you forgot or forgave graham told lanier that he didnt know where the morphine had come from hed been up to the old mans dump once or twice sure his father knew he had gotten a law degree and wanted him to help with his estate such as it was but it wasnt as though they were friends lanier had gotten the names of the rest of the family from graham and sarah got lucky making some sunday phone calls debra sals daughter also hadnt seen much of her father but she volunteered that she didnt have the impression that his estate was as worthless as graham had implied she told sarah that her older brother was probably lying or hiding something graham wasnt very trustworthy debra knew for a fact that sal had had a baseball card collection from the early s he never would have gotten rid of that hadnt the cards debra asked been in the apartment sarah felt sure that there was something more debra could have said about graham but in midconversation she seemed to think better of blabbing out all of her feelings to the police which in itself was instructive the younger brother george was an officer at a downtown bank and didnt like the fact that he was involved in a police investigation on any level he hadnt seen his father in years in fact he didnt even consider sal his father his stepfather leland taylor had raised him george had formed the impression that he graham and debra might come into some money when the old man died but hed called graham when he got word of sals death and graham told him there wasnt any money evans thought it interesting that george like his sister conveyed the impression that graham was lying hardy was serious about not wanting to handle any more murder cases hed never bought into the ethic of his landlord david freeman a truly professional defense attorney hardy did it for the money freemans vision of life and the law accepted the necessity and even the rightness of defending bad people for heinous acts they had actually committed hardy had been a cop for a couple of years after college and a hitch in vietnam after that he spent a few years as a prosecutor for the district attorneys office when his first marriage broke up in the wake of the accidental death of his son he took close to a dozen years off to tend bar and contemplate the universe through a haze of guinness stout eventually the haze lifted he became part owner of the little shamrock he married again frannie was the younger sister of moses his partner in the shamrock he returned to the law again as a prosecutor office politics not a philosophical change of heart had driven him from the das office and a benevolent fate had delivered him to defense work he had believed in the innocence of his first two clients and his instincts had been right after that there were opportunities to get not guilty verdicts for other clients but this was not the same thing as the clients themselves being innocent hardy wasnt going to defend criminals and use his glib irish tongue to get them off on legerdemain on legal technicalities he did not feel any kinship with criminals and didnt much care what societal influences had made them go bad he didnt want to help keep them out of jail even if it put bread on his table not that he didnt believe that defendants were entitled to the best defense the law allowed personally though he just wasnt going to provide it so his professional life had devolved into estate planning business contracts litigation occasionally hed take a fee for walking a client through the administrative maze of a dui or shoplifting charge he often dreamed of dropping the pretense altogether go back to his bar and pour drinks fulltime but that was another problem the world was a different place than it had been before the kids in those days he and frannie felt rich they had money in the bank hardys house was tiny but paid off every six months they got a profitsharing check from the shamrock in the fivethousanddollar range that cleared their credit cards hed made some money on those first two murder cases theyd been able to get by comfortably on three grand a month now they needed nearly three times that home insurance medical insurance life insurance saving for college assuming his kids went the loan payment for the house addition theyd built food clothing the occasional sortie into the nonchild world of restaurants and nightlife he couldnt afford to stop working at the law loving what you did was a luxury he couldnt permit himself anymore frannie was talking about going back to work next year when vincent started first grade this was an issue they both knew shed be lucky to break even on the day care theyd need of course there was a second option she could go back to school in family counseling incur another mound of debt possibly position herself to make more money in family counseling hardy would ask so that in ten years this was the downsized american nineties you tightened the belt and everybody pitched in and worked all the time and maybe someday your kids would have it only a little worse than you did now hardy knew he wasnt ever going back to his little bar where he could get by on tips he was going to keep his nose at his desk and bill a hundred and fifty hours every month which meant he actually worked two hundred until he died adulthood he was developing a theory that it might be one of the countrys leading causes of death someone he thought ought to do a study life was too short as it was he wasnt doing any more murder cases he did however follow glitsky back across bryant street and into the familiar unpleasantness of the hall of justice a huge square faceless bluegray monstrosity its address seven increasingly depressing blocks south of market did not begin to convey the lightyears of distance between the hall and the sophisticated center of culture that it served since hardys last visit the huge glassfront doors had been backed by graffitied plywood a lessthaninspired design solution if part of the buildings visual statement was to make the citizenry feel safe a cattle chute led through a metal detector into the lobby at the elevator banks frothing with vulgarity glitsky was stopped by a young hispanic man who started talking to him about a case the kid seemed to be an assistant da as hardy had once been had he been that young hardy contemplated as the elevators came and went the das office had truly undergone a sea change if this youngster had made it to prosecuting homicides already but he was talking to glitsky so thats what it had to be about glitsky wasnt exactly mr idle chitchat abe finally got around to introductions pointing a finger around new guy eric franco old guy dismas hardy hardy doesnt work here anymore hes moved on to greener pastures private practice francos got his first one eightyseven a murder case hes a little nervous from glitsky this qualified as an oration the doors opened the elevator was empty they all moved eric took up the patter at hardy you on a homicide here talking to the lieutenant hardy shook his head social followed it with hard to believe i know the doors opened on three and hardy nearly got out from force of habit this was the floor for the das office where he once had worked glitsky and the homicide detail were on four when the doors closed on franco hardy looked over at glitsky how old is eric i dont know twentyfive thirty and hes pulled a murder a shrug probably a nobrainer still hardy persisted how many trials can he have done the doors opened i dont know diz i didnt hire him the da hired him you want his resumé its downstairs check it out without looking back he led the way down the hallway to the homicide detail hardy followed wondering how a man of eric francos age and experience could have been assigned to try a murder case in superior court and be expected to win even a nobrainer hes not is the simple answer glitsky said its politics hardy was standing in the doorless cubicle glitsky used for an office outside in the detail fourteen paired desks vied for floor space in the big open room there were a couple of structural columns poking up here and there festooned with wanted posters and yellowing memos joined to watercoolers or coffee machines years before forty square feet in the corner had been drywalled off and an office created for the lieutenant some years after that the door had been removed for painting and never replaced glitsky was behind his big cluttered desk catching up on paperwork hed had no objection to hardy coming up to the detail to talk to inspectors sarah evans or marcel lanier the sal russo investigating team if theyd let him if they didnt want to talk they wouldnt be shy about letting him know if they did hardy might get a hint about what evans had found at the old fishermans apartment that had set off her warning bells sal might not have been a suicide but both inspectors had been out in the field so hardy went down to the bathroom then wandered back into glitskys space and asked again about the kid franco and got told it was politics losing trials is politics you really ought to go down there meaning the das offices its a whole new world glitsky put down his report youre not going to leave me alone are you let me get back to my work hardy clucked i want to i really do im trying even im confident you can do it the lieutenant picked up his report again get the door on the way out would you david freeman was in his trademark brown rumpled suit and wrinkled rep tie sitting in the low leather couch in hardys office smoking a cigar his tattered brogues crossed over the rattanandglass coffee table freeman the wealthy famous landlord of the building could have been mistaken for a destitute client the man was retirement age or better and sported tufts of white hair from the tops of his earlobes and eyebrows bald on top round in the middle liver spots wherever skin showed he was still a force in the courtrooms of the city the reason its politics he was saying hardy had worried it all the way back to his office is sharron pratt our esteemed da hardy knew the story of the election well enough pratt had beaten a reasonably popular incumbent named alan reston the preceding november although reston was a democrat as nearly all elected officials in san francisco had to be and africanamerican to boot potentially an even bigger plus he was a career prosecutor many people in the city including hardy found it ironic that what had done in reston running for the job of chief lawenforcement officer in the city was his tough stance on crime sure the da was supposed to prosecute people whod done bad things but reston seemed unable to make the leap of faith that this didnt mean they were bad people he thought they were bad people he thought people who committed crimes ought to be punished and punished hard pratt on the other hand while she agreed that many criminals indeed had done bad things murder rape burning kittens for santeria rites she did not agree that this necessarily made them bad people they were misunderstood surely but she believed that with counseling and guidance many of them could again become productive members of society also it hadnt helped that reston a black man had been a supporter of proposition the california civil rights initiative he opposed affirmative action believing that trial lawyers like brain surgeons for example ought to be hired and retained because of their ability to do their jobs getting convictions at trial and putting criminals in jail when hed come aboard reston looked around the office he ran and saw that there were a lot of women some people of color a lot of old white guys the job was getting done when there were new openings he hired the best person from a diverse pool of applicants black white male female asian hispanic he didnt care pratt did care though and pratt got elected so this relates to how eric franco pulled a murder pratt unloads all the old white guys shes still stuck with the cases so to prove her theory that anybody can do this work she hires her quotas and willynilly assigns the cases and her people lose and it doesnt matter eventually they might win freeman raised his shoulders expansively who knows it could happen almost everything happens sometimes after he threw out freeman hardy realized hed blown nearly the whole day on graham russos problems satisfying his own curiosity catching up with the bureaucracy city politics he shouldnt have done it he couldnt really spare the time but somehow it had gotten inside him but the piper would have to be paid hardy did not work within the organization of david freeman associates but freemans overload was keeping him afloat his life over the past six months had been dominated by a contractors liability lawsuit with the port of oakland over the failure of a loading transom a containerload of personal computers ten tons and over million worth fell sixtysome feet before glancing off the deck of the ship that was to take the computers to singapore for distribution to the asian market then sank into the bay the accident had caused over million in additional damages to the ship and of course delayed delivery of everything else on board as tended to happen the lawsuits proliferated the port of oakland was contending that the computer hardware manufacturing company tryptech had overloaded its container that had caused the transoms failure other shippers whod lost revenue on their own deliverables were lining up to sue both tryptech and the port one of the workmen whod been on deck at the time was claiming that hed wrenched his back trying to avoid flying metal he was seeking over a million dollars from one of the parties whichever might be found at fault in the normal course of events a private practitioner like hardy would never find himself involved in any of these lawsuits the various litigants insurance carriers would slug it out through their megalaw firms and eventually somebody would settle or win and the attorneys would make a lot of money regardless but in this case tryptechs insurance carrier had refused to pay for its loss of computers because it had come to the conclusion that tryptech had misrepresented the number of units in its transom so the companys president a silverhaired los altos smoothie named dyson brunei had come to david freeman he needed his own personal lawyer representing his own interests outside of the insurance chain there was a potentially large settlement down the road he believed and freeman stood to collect a third of it deciding that brunei s lawsuit against the port had reasonable merit freeman accepted the case on a contingency basis plus expenses and had farmed it out to hardy paying him by the hour it was a good fit all around so hardy spent the rest of the afternoon and into the early evening crunching numbers now tryptech seemed to be playing a game with him its own attorney on the number of computers that had actually been in the container which was still sitting under fortyfive feet of water at pier in oakland it was beginning to appear to him that his clients had in fact overloaded their container but tryptech would contend and hardy would have to argue if he wanted to keep getting paid that this even if true didnt matter because the containers still weighed far less overloaded than the threshold strength of the transom and so on at eight oclock hardy packed it in and it was dark by the time he finally found a parking space four blocks from his house he was going to have to tear out his beautiful tiny front lawn one day and put in some kind of parking structure he could see it coming the day hed be getting home at tenthirty unable to find parking within a mile of his front door instead maybe he should give up his car but that left the muni which was unthinkable even if the city bus system had worked it wouldnt fit his haphazard schedule and it didnt work anyway so the point was moot urban living maybe theyd have to move out of the city that was it cash their little place in move to the suburbs spend half a million dollars on a threebedroom twobath in millbrae be the proud owner of his own garage sighing beat lugging his fat lawyers briefcase and feeling a hundred years old he arrived at his gate and stopped to take in the feel the look of his home there was no denying it he loved the place it was the only freestanding house on a street that was otherwise crammed to the lot lines with three and fourstory apartments he was irrationally taken with the postagestamp lawn the white picket fence the little stoop where on evenings when he had gotten home before dusk almost never anymore frannie and the kids would be out waiting for him now the lights were on inviting he picked up the faint strains of music coming from inside pushed open the gate abe glitsky was a surprise sitting on his kitchen counter carefully picking nuts out of the bowl next to him what are you doing here you better have saved me some cashews hardys wife frannie came up against him long red hair and green eyes that were shining with good humor and perhaps a little chardonnay she was wearing black lycra running shorts tennis shoes and a greenandwhite oregon sweatshirt as she pecked at his cheek slipped an arm around his waist he gave her a hug and felt the quick reassuring pressure of her thigh against him abe was in the neighborhood with orel she said soccer at lincoln park i said i expected you any minute he should wait orel s back with the kids hardy heard the unmistakable child noise from the back of the house orel was glitskys youngest son a twelveyearold and hardys two kids nine and seven worshiped him glitsky digging at the bottom of the nut bowl looked up im afraid the cashews have vanished i dont know where they could have gone to i asked them to stay for dinner frannie said hes already had it hardy went over to the refrigerator did he drink all my beer too glitsky slid off the counter i dont drink beer in fact i dont drink at all frannie was smiling at glitsky we know you dont drink abe thats all right we still like you hardy wheeled how can you like a guy who eats all your cashews he opened a bottle of sierra nevada pale ale took a sip faced his friend so whats up as though theyd been discussing it all along glitsky reported we got the autopsy back on sal i thought youd want to hear strouts going with homicidesuicide equivocal frannie didnt like how this sounded she put her wineglass on the counter and crossed her arms in front of her whats this what homicide just a case glitsky said getting a pained glance from hardy for his troubles abes hardy said not mine thats funny frannie wasnt buying it it seemed like it had something to do with you no a client of mine thats all his dad estate case and thats why abe was telling you about it abe the homicide cop hardy had another pull of his beer he shrugged one of lifes little coincidences my clients dad it looked like he killed himself but maybe somebody else did it doesnt have anything to do with my client necessarily right abe a straightfaced nod right not necessarily taking a beat frannie reached for her wineglass again not necessarily thats good thats a nice show of solidarity im impressed frannie doesnt want me to take on any more murders i gathered that she thinks homicide equivocal can mean murder well shes not all wrong there hardy came back to his wife gave her his biggest phony grin so whats on for dinner glitsky was gone as it turned out frannie had cooked a delicious chicken breast entrée with white wine and cream and artichoke hearts over rice the kids had dominated the table talk with grossout jokes whats green and goes backwards snot that kind of stuff until the adults told the little darlings they could be excused abes homicide equivocal didnt get a chance to raise its head again but now almost eleven oclock the kids finally in their beds hardy and frannie stood in the center of the kitchen surveying the wreckage of the dinner the pans and dishes hardy grabbed a sponge and turned on the hot water started washing up this is why when i die ill be welcomed into heaven with fanfare and trumpets he said but singing her husbands praises wasnt on frannies agenda at the moment she went back out into the dining room brought in a load of dessert dishes put them on the drain then she stopped and leaned against the counter okay what about this client what client graham russo ive never heard you mention him when did he become your client is it a big estate not really and pretty recently come to think of it hardy said roughly this morning in fact and his dad was murdered hardy turned the water off hes not charged with the murder if it was a murder im just helping the guy frannie hes a good kid i know him from the shamrock he thinks the cops are hassling him he thinks abes hassling him abe doesnt hassle people hardy shook his head no not abe abes just pushing paper anymore its one of the new inspectors maybe so your client is under suspicion that may be a little strong hes worried that it may get there he needs his hand held thats all its no big deal she was silent arms crossed again after a minute she said its no big deal but the head of the homicide department came by here especially to tell you about it as soon as the autopsy was finished hardy put the sponge all the way down he turned to face her i dont want another murder case frannie id probably turn it down if it got to that i dont have the time anyway it just got my interest thats all there are some elements that might be slightly more fascinating than tryptechs transom accident if you can believe that grahams dad evidently had alzheimers it looks like he killed himself but it might have been an assisted suicide so maybe graham did do it he says not he wants help with the estate thats all and you believe that hardy averted his eyes i dont disbelieve it not yet frannie nodded very strong she said her arms were still crossed she sighed hes going to get charged and youre going to wind up defending him arent you no you promise frannie i couldnt defend him first ive got tryptech which is pretty fulltime you might have noticed next grahams got no money certainly not close to what hed need for a murder defense even at my rockbottom rates if he gets charged hell take a public defender itd be a highprofile case other defense sharks are going to swarm all around it i didnt hear a promise that you wouldnt take it it wont get to there she sighed again famous last words the autopsy report had been on sarahs desk when she and lanier had come in from the field at the end of the day that made it official she remained late at the office catching up on paperwork and was there when the fingerprint expert checked in with his report graham russos fingerprints were all over his fathers apartment on the safe on the morphine vials on the syringes graham had told lanier that he didnt know how his father had come upon the morphine had only been to the apartment once or twice sarahs suspicions took a quantum leap forward if the coroner was saying it wasnt a definite suicide then she and her partner would find out what it definitely was and sarah knew where theyd start she figured they had probable cause to search grahams residence see what else they could turn up the judge who signed the search warrant agreed with her next to hardys bed the world began jangling all at once he pulled himself up with a moan from what felt like worldrecord rem sleep and slapped at the alarm there was a moments silence then another jangle the phone too frannie said hardy grabbed at the receiver and noted the time on the digital clock seven oclock grand central station they just woke me up with a search warrant what am i supposed to do now theyve got a warrant i just said that take it easy graham youve got to let them in i already have hardy threw a glance out his bedroom window a heavy fog had rolled in during the night what are they looking for just a second graham sounded like he was reading from some official paper morphine vials used or unused syringes baseball cards sports memorabilia documents reflecting number combinations of safe or safety deposit box why do they think you might have any of that stuff they wont tell me they just showed me the warrant not the affidavit theyre doing me a favor letting me call you hardy knew this was true so it couldnt be too bad not yet he hoped the police had rung grahams doorbell at exactly seven oclock the earliest possible moment because it tended to bring to mind visions of jackbooted nazis breaking down doors in the middle of the night the police were prohibited from serving search warrants between ten pm and seven am unless there was immediate danger that evidence would be destroyed or the suspect would disappear or something specific of that nature so the fact that they hadnt come in the middle of the night meant that this was probably a relatively routine search on the other hand ringing grahams bell at the first allowable second was not a good sign hardy let out a breath okay you hang in there dont be hostile give me your address ill be right over he swung out of bed as he was pulling on his pants frannie spoke that would be graham russo she was sitting up in bed arms crossed over her chest childrens sounds came from the rooms farther back my psychic wife the one who has nothing to do with a murder case hardy smiled thats him theyre hassling him thats all hes got some enemies downtown evidently ive got to go be there for him keep him calm i know you do dont worry about the kids ill get them fed and clothed and off to school he gave her a look ill do it tomorrow itll be a trade sharing those special parental moments but i do have a real idea she said my favorite kind lets hear it on the way to his place start thinking about a defense attorney you can recommend for him david freeman maybe maybe a pause if he needs one hardy had his map out he stopped for a minute to consult it at the corner of stanyan and parnassus grahams street was well hidden he turned right went a block then hung a left onto a nearly vertical lane that he thought was the equal of any incline in the city street signs warned off trucks and delivery vehicles too steep another sign informed him that this was not a through street whoever lived up here hardy thought didnt want anybody else to know about it he checked his map again with the fog he couldnt see more than a hundred feet up the hill he wished hed gotten directions to grahams place instead of simply the address but he was stuck now nothing to do but keep going if he was lost hed find a phone he nosed his old honda up the steep hill ran into another not a through street that snaked off to the right and took it and then suddenly miraculously the fog was gone hed climbed right out of it into it seemed a wonderland edgewood avenue was paved with red bricks lined with custom gingerbread houses bathed in bright morning sunlight on either side of the street a variety of trees were in full white and pink blossom he rolled down his window and heard birds chirping what was this place hardy had lived in san francisco for nearly all of his adult life and hed never been here never heard anyone mention it although it was less than half a mile from the little shamrock he pulled over at an open space at the curb farther up the hill just about to the copse of pine and eucalyptus that marked the end of the amazing deadend street he stood a moment outside his car marveling at the red bricks at the scented air the fog below was a blanket of thick billowing cotton the red spires of the golden gate jabbed through it but beyond the fog to the east the downtown skyscrapers windows twinkled in the morning sun ships were moving on the bay across the water treasure island seemed close enough to touch a ribbon of traffic was moving on the freeways coming in over the oakland bay bridge he found the address at the end of a driveway a front door cut into stucco where once obviously there had been a garage standing at the door he paused a moment as soon as he knocked and entered grahams convertedgarage motherinlaw flat he was going to fall into the role representing the rights of his client and then if the police did find anything he would be hip deep in grahams defense could he extricate himself after that even if he wanted to all his protestations to the contrary would he really want to get out he was aware that his pulse had quickened it never did that when he contemplated the mounds of paperwork and number crunching with tryptech that awaited him in the office but he couldnt afford the luxury of loving his work he told himself again he had other priorities now he was a grownup then there was some noise from inside and he took in a breath and rapped on the door your client isnt cooperating so we dont either hardy wasnt through the door yet inspector marcel lanier whom hed known for years wasnt letting him in were conducting a search youre not entitled to be in here its simple hardy lowered his voice hows he not cooperating lanier shrugged my partners got some questions he said if hes a suspect hed like his lawyer present hes smart thats why thats his right absolutely i couldnt agree with you more but its not his right to have anybody present while we look around here people have been known to take things you wouldnt believe so as soon as we finish up here you can come on in and well all have a nice talk on the record hardy could see graham barefoot in running shorts and tank top sitting at the huge country table by the floortoceiling window louvered shades blocking most of the sun and view in the back of the long narrow oneroom apartment laniers female partner was back talking with him it was a beautiful street all right but hardy didnt want to stand out in it for the better part of the day lanier wasnt a bad guy hed just gotten his feathers ruffled hardy would have to talk to graham about his behavior around the police they could make life very difficult if you made them dislike you even if youd done nothing wrong is he under arrest hardy asked hes being detained hardy kept his patience let me talk to my client you guys being here freaked him out thats all ill calm him down maybe hell have something to say something you can use hardys face cracked come on marcel if you do find something youre not going to want to tell glitsky you had a chance to talk to your suspect and didnt take it when it was easy lanier took a beat then stepped back and motioned hardy in all right sit at the table and dont touch anything grahams apartment was spotless and orderly hardy thought it was a fantastic living space there was the huge picture window that dominated the back wall graham had adjusted the shades and over the fog the view of downtown and points east was world class there was a dark hardwood floor oriental carpets the furniture was a mix of danish and antique heavy woods and teak that somehow achieved a balance the wall to hardys right was lined nearly to the ceiling with books there was a tall wine rack nearly filled with expensive wines three tiny vertical windows above the shelves the rest of the right wall near the back of the house was given over to a kitchen area stove overhead racks good cookware the apartment radiated good taste graham russo might be a jock but there appeared to be a lot more to him than that a further consideration raised its ugly head though and hardy couldnt put it aside a place like this and the lifestyle that went with it the wine alone for example cost some serious money and graham was at best underemployed he wondered how his young client could afford to keep all this up but hed find that out on his own time for now he was here to hold hands and thats what hed do he asked permission to put on a pot of coffee and another peace offering offered it around he and graham found themselves talking baseball at the table lanier was on the low leather couch on the left side of room going through a stack of magazines seeking stuff that might be tucked into them in her search for syringes and vials of morphine sarah evans had been looking through things in the bathroom a small cubicle with a sink shower and toilet that had been patched onto the back corner of the room hardy thought that evans had a really wonderful sincere smile like the hispanic da hed met with glitsky yesterday she barely seemed old enough in his eyes to be a girl scout much less a homicide inspector when hardy poured the coffee she came out and sat down with the men smiled and placed her pocket tape recorder on the table between them shoulderlength dark hair framed a freckled oval face set off by widely spaced green eyes a compact and athletic very attractive body was evident under the utilitarian workclothes you dont mind she said still smiling two birds with one stone graham knew the law he knew that talking to a police officer during an official investigation was a very serious matter he had called his attorney first thing because he hadnt wanted to be tricked but then after hed admitted the two officers into his apartment hed really seen sergeant evans he fancied that shed noticed him as well they were about the same age the law was one thing he knew but this was a pretty woman and he had had some experience with them he had no doubt that he could charm her and get her on his side in spite of what her job might be her professional role this went beyond the law it was only common sense to take advantage of the way people worked he would be in control talking to her would be a smart move although the book recommended against it sometimes you just had to go on what you felt hardy began no im sorry but my client doesnt its all right graham held out his hand stopping him you said it didnt you diz i might as well cooperate i dont have anything to hide he shrugged casually looked over at evans shoot inspector a broad smile not literally of course sarah returned the smile and took a sip of her coffee she appraised him for another longish moment then looked down gathering herself tucking away the last hint of the smile all right she launched into the standard police interview intro for the transcriber then began when you talked to inspector lanier on saturday you said you didnt know your father had morphine at his apartment wait a minute hardy said again i really have to object to this you shouldnt answer that graham but the boy had gotten himself relaxed diz i want to explain he focused on inspector evans thats not exactly what i said i said i didnt know how it got there lanier abruptly closed the magazine he was leafing through shifted on the couch said wait a minute his face clouded no all right he grabbed the next magazine on the pile evans asked but you knew it was there the morphine graham hardy might be upsetting his client but he had to speak up again he really didnt want graham saying any of this it could not help him as a lawyer graham must know this what was he thinking didnt graham understand that this wasnt casual conversation it was being recorded and would be transcribed and perhaps used against him maybe hardys getting inside wasnt going to be worth the cost and that worried him even more we can talk about this later when were alone graham ignored him smiled at the pretty inspector the morphine i showed him how to give himself shots he was in a lot of pain the pain again graham kept bringing up the pain what from i dont know you didnt ask no my father wouldnt have told me he would have said mind your own business he didnt want anybody to pity him so you went up to your fathers apartment and showed him how to administer these morphine injections to himself thats right even though you werent particularly close graham cast a glance at hardy looking for approval hardy couldnt say the horse was already a couple of acres from the barn and still running hardy had tried to stop graham when it might have done some good if his client reined himself in now he would just look worse so hardy sipped his coffee and waited just because we werent close i didnt want the guy to suffer graham shrugged he asked me to show him i showed him but i didnt shoot him up i knew what he was going to do and what was that graham wasnt blinking in the face of the questions he leveled his gaze at her what he did do kill himself hardy thought hed convey a little relevant information that his client might not know the autopsy came in last night graham he said it didnt rule out homicide graham stopped his cup halfway to his mouth put it down on the table sat all the way back in his chair well thats bullshit hardy nodded maybe but its why these guys are here graham leaned forward elbow on the table and looked right at evans again the expression struck hardy as a little much the old eyetoeye for sincerity was he suspected no guarantee that the truth was next up i didnt kill my father he killed himself sarah evans wasnt giving anything away she nodded moved the tape recorder slightly sipped from her mug so how often would you say you saw your father in the last six months i dont know six eight times more than once a month then he was getting senile he had alzheimers you know hed call me then forget he called me he didnt remember where hed put things id come up and find them the morphine a pause sure yeah what was the pain from she asked again who gave him the morphine he smiled broadly this time you already asked that and you said you didnt know thats right still dont she shifted gears on him dont you work for an ambulance company im a paramedic i ride in ambulances and you carry syringes and hardy couldnt sit still any longer excuse me but graham already said he didnt know where the morphine came from i know she said but im asking now about the syringes its the same but graham put a hand over hardys arm stopping him i may have brought some syringes left some there i wanted to make sure he had clean needles in the silence that followed lanier turned another page of his magazine graham leaned across the table and adjusted the louvered blinds the room lightened up by half again it was a great day above the fog here on edgewood evans took another tack youre the executor for your father what do you know about the safe graham got to the bottom of his coffee mug his eyes shifted out to the view then back not much he said what did your dad keep in it i doubt anything graham said he didnt have anything worth saving what about his baseball cards where did he keep them i dont know dont you want to ask what baseball cards no i know he had a collection once i dont know what happened to it maybe it was in the safe i dont know but evans was closing in on something and hardy wanted to get there first and head her off if he could the questions were rattling graham anybody want another cup he said no takers hardy got up and went to the machine but evans kept right on but you never personally saw inside the safe or opened it or anything like that no i think the safe was just a prop sal liked to pretend he was doing great he didnt need anybody he had lots of money but you saw where he lived lanier was leafing through the swimsuit edition of sports illustrated suddenly he held up a piece of paper stationery from a motel and said hey dear graham whatever anybody else thinks i am proud of you i dont know what that means after all this time but i am ive been following you as best i could the one hope i had left among my kids your mother doesnt make it any too easy and you all made it clear enough you didnt want me around your mom i guess what she told you but i did keep an eye out your career in the minors you know and then law school i know where deb lives with that husband of hers and georgie howd they get so messed up me leaving i suppose that was it did your mom ever let on that i would call and ask about you no i guess not every three months four i would though you ought to know that thats how i found out about you quitting the law job trying for baseball one last time i saw you play today two triples remember how we used to say youd rather hit a triple than a homer any day most exciting offensive play in the game am i right so anyway plus you started that beautiful double play you owned the field son and i am so proud of you for trying baseball again thats all any of us can do and few enough try and i just wanted whether it means anything i just wanted to say good on you doing what you were born to do somebody appreciated it while hardy looked over the letter a heavy silence hung in the room then lanier took the page out of hardys hand he looked down at it again showing it to evans this last is in a different handwriting sixteen eight twentyseven whats that hardy asked he felt sick that this was going on and really it was his fault his stupid mistake you simply dont let your client talk to the police and hed not only done that hed facilitated it the fact that graham wasnt telling them anything they couldnt find out for themselves mitigated his selfloathing but only slightly evans knew what the numbers were right away thats the combination to sals safe the one graham here says he knows nothing about it was after eleven oclock evans and lanier werent about to let graham go into the bathroom and close the door behind him to take a shower so he was still in the clothes hed slept in graham and hardy still sat mostly in silence at the large table by the back window the blinds were completely open by now and the city outside with the fog gone shimmered in the sunlight graham had slid open the window a few inches and a light breeze freshened the air from time to time but it was mostly quiet and unpleasant from hardys perspective the two inspectors buoyed by their discovery that graham had a means of knowing the combination to sals safe had increased the intensity of their search working as a team they had begun again at the front door working slowly opening every book and drawer lifting everything that wasnt nailed down checking pockets of clothes in the closet canisters in the kitchen they had to be getting near the end hardy thought and if the letter was all they wound up finding it wouldnt be too bad graham had even made the argument as soon as theyd found the letter so what if he might at one time have known the combination to the safe he didnt even remember the letter from his father had been stuck in the magazine did they honestly think he cared about the combination to the safe he didnt even remember why hed written it down he just didnt know hardy wished his client hadnt talked so much but it appeared to be over now and little real damage had been done the two inspectors were back by the dining table with graham and hardy having thoroughly searched from stern to nearly stem lanier had just pulled up a chair and opened the drawer to a small desk table next to the murphy bed when evans lifted a skoal chewing tobacco can from the utensil drawer and shook then opened it six keys she said raising her eyes to her partner she lifted the plain metal ring and jingled the keys suddenly graham was a deer caught in headlights the moment passed as quickly as it had come but to hardy it was worrisome there was real fear in his eyes hed been hiding something in plain view that he hadnt expected them to notice or if they did notice he hadnt expected them to connect it to anything and now they had sarah evans turned back to graham and dropped the ring onto the table lets play name the keys what do you say he raised his shoulders drummed his hands da da dum on the edge of the table he gave her his big smile i really dont have a clue theyre just keys everybodys got a container full of keys he reached over and picked up the ring these two are duplicates for my car i guess this one is the dead bolt for here evans held up one of them you got a safe deposit box thats what this looks like what bank are you with the smile faded from his seat at the small table across the room lanier turned and looked over at the silence just as hardy put his hand up to warn graham not to answer he blurted out i dont know lanier tapped on the desk with something hed extracted from the drawer checkbook here is from wells fargo the branch isnt five blocks away we get done here we ride down and take a look maybe get a brandnew warrant inspector sergeant sarah evans pulled a chair up and sat upon it graham she said youre telling me you dont know if you have a safe deposit box is that what youre saying graham just didnt seem to get it he was making some bantering noises at evans trying to make light of the situation here keep things casual apparently unable to envision himself as a man with handcuffs in his future hardy had no idea what was in the safety deposit box but judging from grahams reaction when he found out it was going to be ugly hardy put a hand on grahams shoulder and stood up the interview was over he was thoroughly disheartened it had been a long and wasted morning he hadnt done much for graham russo up until now and he knew there wasnt anything hed be able to do until this chapter had played itself out mario giotti sat at his regular table at stagnolas on the wharf he sipped his iced tea and gazed with a studiedly placid expression down to the fishing boats moored outside his window he was a wellknown man in the city and he thought it important to maintain a dignified serene persona in public in any event it was a gorgeous may morning a tuesday and when hed arrived at the restaurant hed apparently been in fine spirits and why not he was a us federal judge appointed for life and he lived in the best city in the world a vibrant sixtyyearold he kept his sparkplug of a body in terrific shape by either jogging or spending an hour a day at the workout room in the basement of the federal courthouse with his steelgray eyes his unlined face the prominent nose he knew he cut a dignified figure although just at this moment he was struggling to control his expression the judges wife was late he was peeved with her and didnt want to show it he hated to wait always had fortunately in his life nowadays people most often waited for him waited on him he never had to stand in a line he came into his courtroom and he had a staff that made damn sure that the days business was ready to proceed upon his entrance but he still had to wait for his wife always had probably always would as he looked down at the fishing boats a sigh escaped him he wasnt even aware of it coming here to stagnolas which he did at least once a week when he wasnt traveling wasnt so much a nostalgic experience as it was a return to his roots thats how he felt about the place it was his true home his psychic touchstone for sixtyfive years over three generations the building had been giottis grotto the judges greatgrandfather had opened the first cioppino stand here in the middle of the depression and it had stayed within the family adding onto itself growing into a fishermans wharf landmark until joey stagnola had bought it from marios father bruno in mario was the last male of the giotti line but hed been a lawyer with dreams of becoming a judge he wasnt going to run a dago restaurant on the wharf his father bruno understood if he himself were young again and college educated if hed had the same options as his son hed do the same thing but mario knew that secretly it had broken the old mans heart he sold the restaurant to stagnola and six months later sitting in a red booth by one of these back windows had died here he had just finished an afterlunch sambuca and the coroner found three coffee beans good italian restaurants served them floating in the aperitif for luck in his mouth unchewed more iced tea your honor mauritio the maitred had sent the youngster over to check the judges glass mauritio always took good care of him giotti gave his practiced friendly nod to the whitejacketed waiter and the young man poured the boy could have been him fortyfive years before earnest and efficient making sure the patrons were happy he moved on to the next table and the judge sighed again you dont look very cheerful is something wrong giotti hadnt even noticed his wifes approach pat giotti was still a finelooking woman with an unlined ageless face high cheekbones a graceful figure he raised his face and she kissed him then seated herself across the table immediately reaching over and taking his hand squeezing it sorry im late are you all right his face animated itself just feeling old for a minute youre not old for a minute i said he squeezed her hand they had made love the night before and he was telling her he remembered very well she was right he wasnt old are you thinking about sal he shook his head actually no the waiter just reminded me of when i used to work here the judge looked down at the boats for a second maybe a little she eyed him carefully seemed satisfied then reached for a roll and broke it im sure it was for the best she said sal i mean im sure it was he agreed its just his voice trailed off i look down there at the moorings i can almost see the signing bonus see sal waving up at me its hard to imagine him gone hed lived his life hon he was my age i think thats part of it he was sick remember he was dying anyway it just would have gotten worse his sufferings over now i suppose so it isnt all bad its much better this way i know youre right he looked out the window this was probably just the wrong table for today being able to see down there it brings back those memories but this is our table mario they hold it for you the judges table he squeezed her hand again im just saying he was my friend i miss him thats all the idea of him love the idea he wasnt the same friend at the end you know that dont you of course she met his eyes again squeezed his hand you must know that she said i do know it pat its better all around its just not easy the waiter came by and took their orders pat ordered a glass of pinot grigio to go with her scallops the judge was having a crab louis and his iced tea of course no wine he was going back to court in the afternoon they sat in silence for a while until her wine arrived she took a taste then put her glass down did you read this mornings paper theyre saying maybe it wasnt a suicide maybe it wasnt the judge said flatly the wine seemed to stick in pat giottis throat she took another sip to clear it why do you say that the judge shrugged its got all the earmarks of an assisted suicide look at the morphine vials the labels removed some medical person was there helped him along i had annie his secretary stop by at the hall of justice and pick up a copy of the autopsy this morning and the judge thoughtfully tore a piece of his sourdough then seemed to forget about it the morphine dose wasnt that large acting alone sal would have probably done lots more to be sure he had three more vials at his place he could have used but whoever helped him put it right in the vein which would not have been enough in the muscle giotti nodded so it was a medical professional at any rate somebody whod know that in spite of the topic the judge had to smile in admiration you dont forget anything do you what was that ellison his wife looked pleased at the compliment giotti was referring to a medical malpractice case hed heard on appeal a few years back us v ellison pharmaceuticals where the doctors decision to administer one of ellisons drugs intravenously iv rather than intramuscularly im had proved fatal to a patient the doctor had tried to place the blame on the drug company but the strategy hadnt worked drugs injected directly into a vein had a great deal more effective potency than drugs administered im and giotti had ruled that every doctor on the planet knew that or ought to pat giotti whose life revolved around her husbands made it a point to read as many of his cases as she could she didnt have a profession hadnt worked since the earliest days of their marriage she harbored a lingering fear that she and her husband might someday have nothing to talk about so she kept up on the law as well as the trivia that each case provided giotti sat back letting go of his wifes hand as the waiter set their plates in front of them one thing im sure of he said we havent heard the end of it especially now theyre saying it might not be a suicide pat giotti put her fork down they havent done that have they if its not a suicide its some kind of murder and murder means it gets investigated that may be the law but they shouldnt do that they ought to just leave it alone he reached across the table and took her hand again who can say how much pain he was in and even if he was what if he wanted to endure it for some reason what if it wasnt his decision to die just then at that moment thats the issue that was her mario she thought ever the judge always considering the issues the law thats why they want to find out who was there he said hardy figured out how much time hed spent outdoors on this beautiful day hed walked through the fog near his house this morning at a little after seven call it four minutes to get to where hed parked the night before then hed stood outside grahams house for a total of about two minutes taking in the sunlight birdsong smell of blossoms talking to lanier thirty seconds walking back to his car at onefifteen two minutes getting from the downtown garage to his office now it was seven fortyfive and the sun was a recent memory the dusk just settling on the buildings around the office hardy stood at his window overlooking sutter street his tie undone coat off eyes burning between graham russo and tryptech hed already put in a thirteenhour day and in that time hed spent all but eight and a half minutes indoors the deposition with terry lowitz of the port of oakland had ended fifteen minutes ago theyd had sandwiches brought up at fivethirty when it looked as though it was going to go on for another couple of hours hed called frannie and told her he was going to be late she was less than thrilled lowitz was a maintenance supervisor whose skills as a raconteur were hardy thought woefully inadequate it had taken hardy three tries to get the guy to put his name on the record properly mr lowitz was of the general opinion that the port of oakland had never in its history allowed one machine of any kind to run for an instant without being in perfect repair especially the loading transoms over the course of five hours hardy had brought up perhaps thirty examples of accidents at the port large or small that might have been attributed to faulty equipment but mr lowitz when he answered intelligibly at all had an alternate interpretation for every mishap he was not going to lose his job by criticizing his employer ever hardy walked back to his desk and without thinking picked up one of the three darts that lay upon it and flung it at the dartboard across the room a nanosecond after he released it he remembered that he was theoretically in the middle of a record round and was shooting for the the dart hit smack in the middle of the david freeman appeared in his doorway with a bottle of wine and some glasses and the telephone rang he threw up his hands life he said it happens all at once freeman would wait and the phone wouldnt so he grabbed at it yo hardy abe by god i think it is you sound just like yourself its a disguise for people who think im somebody else so whats up youre going to say graham russo freeman came over and put the glasses down on hardys desk then lifted a haunch onto the corner of it over the phone hardy heard his prediction come true im calling about graham russo im listening this is a courtesy call you must have impressed lanier and evans with your manners i asked them if they minded if i call you and they said no theyre really quite perceptive individuals hardy said for police persons so what about graham glitsky told him freeman repeated it making sure hed heard it right fifty thousand dollars in wrapped bills four complete sets of earlyfifties baseball cards thats it the old man drank off most of his glass of red wine hardy noticed the world outside his window that night had completely fallen he looked at his watch eightfourteen he had to stop now call it a day get home hed get a call later if graham got booked tonight and hed have to come down to the jail he didnt feel he would survive without a little time off david freeman on the other hand had no family or consuming interests outside of the law he had lived this way for all of his adult life and now after his own full day in court he was settling down with a newly filled glass enthralled with the details of yet another case it never ended for freeman he never wanted it to so its not an assisted suicide after all what do you mean i mean fifty grand plus the cards taken from the old mans safe this is not what we call altruism he offed the guy to get the money hardy waved that off i dont think that happened david youve got to know him i dont need to know him if ive got the evidence if the evidence says he did it then he did it you always say that thats because its always true freeman had settled himself on the couch hed brought the bottle over and put it on the coffee table in front of him he poured himself more wine swirled it in his glass sloshed it around in his mouth the connoisseur why dont you take off your coat and stay awhile share this excellent claret with me take a break for christs sake youve been at it all day this new case of yours has all the makings hardy threw another dart the hell with the personal best game he thought hed get it some other time believe it or not spending another hour or two here in the middle of the night discussing a case im not even taking is not my idea of a break im thinking about going home saying hello to my wife before she leaves me maybe kissing my kids goodnight freeman pursed his lips with distaste arent you curious about the money theres an explanation for the money thats my point dont you want to know what it is ill catch it on the news he had walked around his desk and grabbed his suit coat from the back of his chair where hed hung it and now on his way to the door he was pulling it on he stopped at the doorway and picked up his briefcase you want to lock up and get the lights when you leave the landlord heres a real tyrant freeman picked up his bottle and got himself to his feet no ill go down to my office his brown suit looked like hed taken a shower with it on then slept in it there were half a dozen rusted dots around his shirt collar where hed cut himself shaving the tie could have been cut froma tablecloth at an italian restaurant he was half a head shorter than hardy and thirty pounds heavier all of it in the gut nevertheless david freeman the eyes the manic energy was impressive even intimidating he came to a halt abruptly in front of hardy seemed to consider for a moment then poked a finger into his chest you know this life isnt dress rehearsal if youve got a vision of what really happened with sal russo the boys got a right to hear it you took him on so you owe him that however busy you think you are and heres a free tip you might try fitting in a little fun like you do exactly like i do i have fun all the time you work all the time freeman lit up histrionically i love my work i dont do anything i dont want to do i hate to say this david but you dont have kids the old man squinted up at him well you do so what so i dont do what i want to do anymore i do what i have to do thats my life thats reality i dont even think about what i want to do freeman remembered his glass of wine and took a hit of it it was your choice having the kids am i right sure so its your choice how you want to live with them hardy found himself getting a little hot thats a fine and learned opinion david but you dont know what youre talking about you need this case a murder case something you can care about freeman said youre burning out hardy didnt need to hear this it was too close to the truth he hit the lights and closed the door behind them well thanks for the input the short corridor was dark and ended in a stairwell down which the two men walked in silence on the second floor phyllis the receptionist had her station deserted now in the center of a spacious and extravagantly appointed lobby the main lights had been turned down dim recessed pinpoints in the ceiling kept the space from blackness but only just freeman grumbled a goodnight and was nearly to his office when hardy stopped at the top of the main circular stairwell he sighed and put down his briefcase david yeah you ought to take this russo case ill be honest with you i would kill for this case hardy smiled in the gloom you dont have to kill anybody its yours i mean it from right now grahams your client you can introduce yourself when they book him which could happen in the next five minutes if you hurry you can beat him down to the jail the old man wrestled with it for a few seconds its tempting but i cant take it he cant afford me do it pro bono he cant afford anybody and it would be great advertising its your case diz hes your client i dont want him david forget hum not being able to afford me i cant afford him freemans voice cut into the darkness you want my opinion or probably you dont you cant afford not all ive heard from you for years now is how my clients my guilty clients theyre the scum of the earth they deserve the best defense the law allows but its not going to be dismas hardy who gives it to them no sir youve got higher standards right youve got to believe in your clients in their essential goodness but you know ive got news for you about the nature of humanity it fails all the time good people do bad things thats why we have the beautiful law the old attorney moved a step closer all wound up now you think the work youre doing with tryptech is cleaner than what i do well my ass dyson brunei is at best a liar and at worst a crook and you dont seem to have any problem doing his grunt work for a fee freeman lowered his voice even further his anger building graham russo walks in because he needs you and you tell me he didnt kill his father for his money you believe in him dont you but you wont help him you cant afford to all right but spare me the rationalizations and the selfrighteous bullshit from now on would you i dont have the time freeman whirled and stalked into his office slamming the door closed behind him in his living room a line of tiny elephants marched tail to trunk in a caravan across the mantel above his fireplace they were made of blown venetian glass frannie had seen them at gumps and fallen in love though she knew there was no way she would ever have them they were too expensive too fragile an unnecessary luxury back when theyd had nothing but hardy had bought six of them for her and then one each year on their anniversary now finally home a little after nine oclock he stood in front of them wondering if he could hear what they might be saying to him the elephants were part of their history when they had decided to get married he and frannie had had many discussions about where they would live together finally she said shed move out of her duplex into this house hardys house he thought the gift would begin to make the place her own home and hed been right she rearranged the elephants every couple of days circling them lining them up facing them all in one direction or another mood stones her brother moses did the same thing rearranged the elephants almost every time he came to visit hardy thought it must be genetic it was a night for shadows the living room as the lobby in his building had been was dimly lit in this case from one light over the telephone in the tiny sitting area off the dining room the house was eerily quiet it was a railroadstyle victorian with a long hallway living and dining rooms up front in the back the house widened with the kitchen and behind that three bedrooms j the kids were asleep and frannie had gone to bed apparentlyto sleep he microwaved the leftovers of macaroni and cheese mixing in a can of tuna for the protein or taste or something at the diningroom table he started to review some of the tryptech pages from his briefcase but he didnt have the energy he poured an inch of bushmills into one of the jelly glasses the kids used returning to the living room he lit a fire and drank his drink when it was finished he showered and slid in beside his wifes possibly sleeping form the elephants were dancing in an amber glow a naked man stood in front of the dying embers watching the beasts there were fourteen of them in a line perhaps preparing to caravan the wind howled outside outside the fires perimeter the night was pitch and out of its shadow a woman appeared she was dressed in something white and flowing red highlights shimmered in long hair worn down she was barefoot the man half turned afraid to step toward her lest he stumble twice already he had freepoured irish whiskey into the tom and jerry drinking glass too thick to break are you coming back to bed i couldnt sleep i guessed that she laid a hand lightly on his shoulder dont hurt yourself a reference to the drinking when hed been younger before this marriage or their children he had a personal rule forbidding hard spirits in his house now he sometimes thought they could open a liquor store i love these elephants he said it appealed to him to see one of the strongest animals in the world rendered in the most fragile of substances they look like theyre dancing dont they excited about going somewhere doing something come on back to bed she said ill rub your back what time is it he asked two the kidsll be up in five hours dismas its going to seem like five minutes his hand was around the glass on the mantel over the fire he was aware that he was leaning on it for balance frannie was right tomorrow another in the seemingly endless procession of them would come too soon freeman was right too he was burning out he sighed left the halfempty glass where it was on the mantel let her lead him back down the long hallway to their bedroom hardy wasnt going to acknowledge the fatigue the slight headache the buzz behind his eyes he had set his internal alarm for sixthirty and it didnt fail him of david freemans words the night before the ones that had the most impact were those concerning the children hardy had chosen to have them and he could choose how he lived with them he was failing there with his kids lost in some downward spiral he didnt quite understand he wasnt taking any joy in them in frannie in his life certainly not in his work he didnt know if it was only a function of attitude but he knew hed recognized it at last maybe all of that wasnt too far gone to reclaim he didnt even know any longer where his black pan was the castiron fryer weighed ten pounds and was the only physical legacy of hardys parents joe and tola whod died in a plane crash when he was nineteen for years all through his first marriage and second bachelorhood he had cooked almost everything he ate in that pan hed kept it perennially on his stove shined until it looked more like hematite than iron he never put any water in it just scraped it with a spatula wiped it down with salt then rubbed it with a rag even when he used neither oil nor butter nothing stuck to it the pan had been one of his treasures he told frannie when they first got together that it was the symbol of who he was if that was true now he thought he was in trouble he didnt know where it had gone he had searched the kitchen and finally found the pan under his workbench on the landing that led down the stairs and out to their backyard sometime in the past few years and he hadnt even noticed frannie had moved it out of the kitchen he didnt cook at home anymore he was always working and the damn thing was too heavy for her to lift shed essentially thrown it out this morning hardy didnt go through his routine shower dress in his suit and tie coffee instead he pulled on his old jeans and a faded cal poly sweatshirt slipped into his topsiders and keeping quiet first went in search of the black pan twenty minutes later he had the french crepe batter made and the table set for breakfast at the kitchen table he fixed a cup of coffee the way frannie liked it with real cream and two thirds of a spoonful of brown sugar and brought it in to her placing it beside the bed waking her with a kiss on her cheek rebecca they called her the beck was frannies child by her first husband but hardy had adopted her as his own now the nineyearold lay on her back covers off mouth open her brother vincent was seven and had his own room at the very back of the house but for the past several months hed been sleeping on a futon on the floor of becks room he was entirely covered by his comforter hardy stepped over him sat on the side of the becks bed and leaned over hugging her maple syrup he whispered crepes crepes she was immediately awake her arms came up around him and squeezed and then she squiggled free vincent she yelled daddys making crepes vincent was up and on him before he knew what hit him he was knocked backward wrestled down onto the futon in a jumble of arms and legs and tumbling kidsmell and laughter with a roar he grabbed at both of them holding them to him tickling whenever he could get a finger free he caught a knee in the groin a constant and groaned which the kids ignored as a matter of course finally it stopped his back was against the becks bed and the kids settled against him one on each side he heard the shower start in the bathroom and the alarm went off next to his bed he patted the kids on their backs lets get some clothes on he said breakfast in five four the beck was up moving for the bathroom three vincent was right behind her but not fast enough hardy heard the door slam then a crash as vincent skidded into it dad beck slammed the door more pounding dad hardy got up crisis number one he took a breath preparing to mediate his groin didnt hurt anymore and his headache was gone when he got in to work there was a call on his answering machine graham had called from jail evans and lanier had shown up at his place again at seven am this time they arrested him for murder her partner was interviewing people in another homicide that had occurred long before sarah had made it to the detail so she drew the solo assignment to sals place the apartment was still sealed off it might have been the lowest of drudge work but for some reason sarah didnt mind there was something compelling about this old man who sold fish and his family who hated him she let herself in and closed the door behind her in the living room the venetian blinds were up the glass in the windows opaque with grime although the sun had been shining outside inside there was little sense of it she flicked the switch by the front door the sixbulb chandelier that hung from the center of the ceiling made almost no difference four of its lights were burned out she took a couple of steps over to the sagging couch and sat on the front inches of it before her on the stained pine coffee table the fingerprinting powder was still visible a thin film beyond the table was the lounge chair she leaned forward elbows on knees templed her fingers in front of her mouth and blew through them the profound stillness bored into her only gradually did she even become aware of the traffic sounds through the windows over seventh street the air didnt move at all what must it have been like she wondered to have lived here to be dying here murder cases she was beginning to realize were of a different quality from the other crimes shed been working on over the years the robberies assaults vandalisms frauds the act of course the murder itself might have been as considered as violent as brutish or as passionate as any of the other crimes but its consequence struck a far more resonant chord here was where a life story had ended the consciousness that had once impressed its features on this inanimate stuff furniture walls kitchen appliances the air itself had been replaced now with a vacuum finally she got up crossed the living room threw open a westfacing window there was a breeze outside she could sense it before it breached the window and the sun did shine but it was as though the room conspired to keep these elements out at least for another few seconds sarah turning to take in the place where sal russo had lived and died suddenly and clearly experienced sals presence hovering here his ghost almost as though it were a physical thing who had he been after all finally the breeze stirred a dust ball that had formed on one of the end tables blowing it to the floor she opened another window on another wall moving to be moving maybe the answer to her question was somewhere among all the paper ridiculous though it was she couldnt shake the feeling that sal russo was trying somehow to communicate with her if she could only hear what he might be saying on the first pass she went through every scrap of paper that wasnt in some kind of a box there was paper between the mattresses on his bed in the kitchen cabinets in the drawers of the end tables shed already discovered the paper with the safe combinations in the wastebasket in the bathroom but there was more in the garbage in the kitchen under the threadbare livingroom rug some of it was brown paper bag material some was lined invoice paper plain sheets of copy paper anything that would hold an imprint pencil or ink almost every piece contained a first or last name or both telephone numbers or parts of them addresses evans figured a lot of legwork there a ton of followup but some of it possibly fruitful she didnt mind work thats what they paid her for but this collection of paper wasnt getting her any closer to the man shed been sitting on the couch going through it all piece by piece placing it in one of the oversized yellow envelopes shed brought along now the envelope bulging she dropped it on the table and stood again the chalked outline where his body had lain crumpled was still visible on the rug somehow shed avoided even seeing it when shed come in now she squatted over it trying to fill in the picture her finger dragged over the rug come on old man she whispered talk to me most of the boxes she knew were in the bedroom which was behind the kitchen off to her right but there was one here in the living room in the corner along the wall that held the couch crouching there on the floor she saw it and again it was as though it were for the first time what else she wondered had she missed her eyes came to rest on the piece of plywood that hung over the couch shed noticed the painting before but had assumed it was just an el cheapo massproduced rendering that had come with the furnished apartment it hadnt been varnished and the paint had bleached out to the point where the grain of the plywood showed more than anything else but here from her angle in the early afternoon light the sun had deposited a rectangle of light onto the floor the lines of the painting stood out the depiction was recognizably fishermans wharf but without the postcard patina she squinted up at it then stood and moved closer if sal had done this as the rusted i brown initials sr in the lower right corner indicated he had i had talent the fishing boat in the foreground the signing bonus was obviously abandoned crab pots lay in disarray around it both on its deck and the nearby pier the portholes were all hollows of jagged glass the railing had caved on itself there were no people anywhere no there was one she imagined she saw a lone figure what appeared to be a child sitting with hunched shoulders on the flying bridge holding a broken fishing pole behind the boat the charred skeleton of a building smoldered on the wharf she stood back and stared for another minute realizing that i what disturbed her more than anything the painting showed was the sensibility behind it if hed painted this sal russo wasnt your typical fleabag derelict he had a tortured soul or had had one at one time then shaking herself from her reverie she went over to the corner got the heavy cardboard box put it on the table and folded back the flaps that had been interlocked something that clearly had been done many many times she supposed shed been expecting more debris the same mishmash of receipts and scribblings except older that shed already gone through and bagged instead she found two battered threering binders and four hardcover books taking out the books first she placed them to one side bernard malamuds the natural a wellthumbed chapmans technical handbook for sailors called piloting an ancient bookclub edition leather bound gold trimmed of moby dick and albert camuss the fall the binders were another surprise they were photo albums organized and cared for sal had kept them out here in the living room where he could get to them and sarah would have bet a lot that he got them out often feeling a bit like an intruder she opened the first one pictures of a young man very handsome with a beautiful young woman progressively pregnant she knew the man must have been sal but couldnt very well reconcile it with the old man she had seen here on friday then the first baby picture graham joseph russo written under it in a strong male hand she flipped through the pages more quickly here was the fishing boat from the painting on the wall but new and trimmed a beaming sal russo at the helm then there were two more children a smallish house typical for the sunset district graham growing up playing baseball sal playing accordion at parties more fishing boat pictures on the bay at the wharf another child a girl debra george the wife appearing less and less then suddenly halfway through the binder a mansion after that the binder was empty the sunlight rectangle on the floor had grown and sarah stood and stretched her back in the kitchen she walked around the chair which still lay on its side left there by the investigations team she poured herself a glass of water the sun was very much a presence in here the one window much cleaner than those in the living room and with no blinds or drapes covering it there were three mugs on the drain dark liquid still in the bottom of two of them an unwashed plate was on the table knife and fork on it these artifacts bothered her if there had been any kind of real struggle in here wouldnt something else have been disturbed back in the living room she made a note to bring this up with lanier and reached for the second binder baseball baseball and more baseball despite herself sarah sat back she was going to enjoy this baseball was her game she still played on her womens team once a week year round as an only child and a girl baseball had been the bond with her father whom she still adored her parents had now retired and moved to palm springs so she didnt see them often but every time they talked they still joked about their giantdodger rivalry sarah was giants all the way her dad and mom had both been raised in brooklyn before moving to california and the blood in their veins they said ran dodger blue shed have to tell them about graham russo she decided making their team as a replacement player thats the kind of team the dodgers were shed say they hired murderers her dad would love that this album started way farther back here were blackandwhite pictures of a very young sal russo she doublechecked to make sure this wasnt graham but no it was his father in his own youth always in uniform always with a mitt or a bat the first press clippings sal russo throws nohitter and hits two home runs in little league opener freshman makes varsity at balboa high allcity high school team allstate at usf she turned the photo of the college team sideways there was sal in the second row next to mario giotti the judge whod found him on friday amazing she thought the ties after the story of sals bonussigning with the orioles there were two blank pages then the stories about graham began the same kind of stuff theyd written about his father little league pony league high school college the dodgers farms finally abruptly the yellowing newsprint ended and the paper turned white these were the recent articles from grahams aborted return even down to the box scores from spring training in vero beach sal seemed to have recorded everything about the baseball career of the son she had arrested for his murder this morning closing the binder on her lap she was still sitting back in the couch her eyes stinging all right she thought maybe sal had spoken to her but she wasnt at all sure what it was shed heard above all she couldnt figure out how someone who had begun with such promise as sal had blessed with musical artistic and athletic talent with a personality a beautiful wife a healthy and attractive family how could that have all gone away how did he end up here could it all have been economics she didnt believe it sure business failure could destroy a persons soul shed seen that often enough but this wasnt any simple bankruptcy sal wasnt broke by any means he paid his rent had a going business that supported him even if it was illegal he was a survivor plus he had money stashed away lots of money and the bills were wrapped and bankstamped dated seventeen years before what did that mean something cataclysmic must have happened whatever it was had destroyed him and now she couldnt help but wonder if it had finally killed him as well and what did that mean about his son who was now in jail because of her maybe the answer was somewhere in the boxes back in the bedroom she put the second binder next to its mate on the table and stretched again shed been here an hour and a half and had done almost no real police work shed better get on it but she was at eye level with that painting once again it reeled her in and held her for another moment could that be a baseball mitt that smudge next to the fishing boy if it was in fact a boy fishing was there something else she was missing was she missing anything at all she didnt know the other boxes werent going away shed better get to them with a last glance at the painting she headed back to the bedroom at onethirty that afternoon just as sarah was getting to sal russos place hardy waited for the guard to open the door to visiting room b in san franciscos jail it was a relatively new building directly behind the hall of justice only open for business for the past year or so the new attorney visiting rooms were a good deal larger than those in the old jail had been but the size didnt make much difference in spite of its nickname among law enforcement personnel the glamour slammer it still wasnt anyplace you wanted to be they hadnt brought graham down yet hardy asked the guard to leave the door open and walked the six steps over to the window six whole steps the place was extravagant in its roominess and the window though glass block was a definite improvement in the old jail the visiting rooms had essentially been closets six by eight feet with no ventilation and one overhead light bulb a table and three wooden chairs took up all the space through a square pane of wirereinforced glass set into the wall you could see inmates and guards passing in the jails corridor the inmates would slam the window every once in a while as you talked to your client hardy didnt think that could happen here no prisoners walked down this hallway the corridor outside was a kind of catwalk around the administrative rooms and holding cells and with the glass block there was a lot of light especially on a sunny day like this one it wasnt exactly cheery but it wasnt a dungeon either he turned away from the window preparing himself it was always a jolt the initial meeting behind bars of a person youd known in civilian life in a couple of minutes graham russo was going to walk in here and he wasnt going to look the same he was going to be in an orange jumpsuit perhaps shackled some small piece of his soul was going to be gone that would make graham different in some fundamental way and hardy didnt want to see it he put his hands in his pockets and waited theyd started out sitting across the table from each other but hardy was up and pacing now grahams story had changed in another and particularly unsettling way he seemed to be having trouble believing that sergeant evans had actually arrested him i never thought shed do that why not shes a cop thats what they do yeah but he paused considering his words but what coming out with it i was playing a little head game with her i thought shed bought it i didnt think shed keep looking not at me not after i opened up and cooperated but you didnt tell the truth graham shrugged i guessed wrong about what about whether she cared about the truth i guess i thought shed believe me not the words so much this was close enough to how hardy felt to make him feel uncomfortable so what about now what about now you and me the truth all that silly stuff i havent lied to you as a matter of fact you did you said you werent close to your father but id already told the police that i it didnt seem like a big thing i wanted you to help me out and if i came across as inconsistent youd doubt me from the gitgo i screwed up i guess im sorry hardy closed his eyes for a moment okay so lets get clear on this despite what you told me and the police the police two times you were close to your father graham nodded i figured it would be easier to just say i wasnt easier how thats obvious isnt it what everyone would think hardy stopped pacing you know what mark twain said he said the best part about telling the truth is you dont have to remember when you lied i know all this just came at me diz i didnt have any time to think about it i said im sorry im sorry too hardy wanted to get it straight so you were afraid that if you admitted you and your father had reconciled people would draw the conclusion that you helped him kill himself yeah but you didnt help him kill himself graham had his huge hands folded on the table he looked down at them then back up at hardy no ive told you that hardy came up to the table laid a palm down on it okay you told me that but at this point how am i supposed to know when youre telling the truth this one isnt a lie you didnt kill your father no you didnt help him kill himself talk him through it sit there with him any of that because if you did its going to make a big difference weve got a whole nother ball game no i didnt do that you werent there on friday at all again the maddening hesitation graham hardy slammed the table and his client jerked backward jesus whats to think about you were there or you werent i was thinking about something else dont keep your mind on what im asking you about you think you can do that hardy pulled his chair out again and sat in it okay he modulated his voice he wasnt here to rebuke his client but he had to get a handle on the truth okay graham lets talk a minute about you and me youre a lawyer so you know this stuff but when you hired me the other day i became your attorney after that anything we say to each other is privileged like now clear right so ive got to know what happened with you and your dad all of it ill take it with me to my grave but ive got to know so i can help you graham slid his chair back a few inches and folded his arms across his chest his sculpted face impassive his eyes scanned the room came back to hardy how long am i going to be here he finally asked the abrupt segue frustrating as it might be was no surprise hardys experience with people who unexpectedly found themselves in jail was that their attention span lost a lot of linkage i dont know this was the exact truth in spite of glitskys warning the previous evening nobody had arrested graham until this morning evans and lanier had discovered the safedeposit money late in the afternoon too late according to glitsky to go to the district attorney and get an arrest warrant then last night graham had neither been home nor at his paramedic job concerned that he might flee the two inspectors had arrested him without a warrant when he opened his door to say hello so the da wasnt yet involved in the case and this meant that the exact charge beyond simple murder had yet to be determined hardy went on with the explanation your arraignment is tomorrow and we cant get bail set until then so youre here at least overnight assuming i can get you reasonable bail which maybe i cant you could be out tomorrow he paused and if theyre not going for special circumstances this got grahams complete attention what do you mean the fingers spiked at his hair jesus christ what are you talking about im talking about murder for profit or during a robbery thats specials i didnt he stopped what robbery keeping it matteroffact hardy told him fifty thousand dollars in cash another twenty or thirty in mintcondition baseball cards thats a lot of money graham you kill somebody you take their stuff or their money thats robbery arms crossed again graham was chewing his cheek so from an outsiders point of view including the inspectors who arrested you and not to mention yours truly lets see how it looks you make what fifteen bucks an hour as a paramedic give or take and you live in the nicest neighborhood in the city whats your rent up there graham sighed deeply answered reluctantly fifteen okay your rent is fifteen hundred dollars in this place a judge would probably salivate over youve got beautiful furniture more fine wine than you can drink in a month what kind of car do you drive beemer another fifty grand hardy thought he should have guessed i dont suppose its paid for youre kidding right so whats the hit on that six hundred eighty the hard numbers didnt matter so much of course there would be other expenses probably moving grahams monthly nut up into the range of four to five thousand dollars he wasnt making this riding in an ambulance so the picture graham is that you quit your incredible job as a federal law clerk then you got laid off by the dodgers now you work part time you see a question developing here graham came forward elbows on the table he pulled at the neck of his jumpsuit i get at least fifty a game thats if we lose a hundred if we win bonuses in tournaments for home runs like that last saturday i made four hundred he must have read hardys blank look for softball he explained who pays you to play softball craig ising who is some rich guy he owns the hornets thats my team hardy still wasnt seeing it graham went on patiently when i made the big club during the strike there were a couple of articles in the papers about us the replacement players and ising kept his eyes open and waited when the dodgers cut me and i got back home he looked me up hardy heard the words but felt he was missing some crucial point were talking slopitch softball youre saying theres a professional league no its all under the table its all gambling these rich guys stack the teams and bet on the games how much do they bet graham shrugged i dont know for sure i hear numbers ten grand twenty per game hardy was shaking his head youre kidding me i dont think so its big business the hitch is i cant declare any of the money no taxes no nothing so how much do you really make attorneyclient privilege or not graham didnt want to say i dont know some weeks i play three games tournaments on weekends and how many games are in a tournament usually five if you go all the way hardy was scribbling some numbers on his legal pad a grand a week he asked another shrug sometimes then suddenly he spoke with the first real urgency hardy had heard but this cant come out they get me for tax evasion theyll yank my bar card ill really never work again they get you for murder thatll be the least of your problems this was inarguable but graham leaned back in his chair pondering it i thought you didnt want to be a lawyer anyway come on diz why do you think i went to law school of course i want to be a lawyer but you i just wanted one last chance to play ball i figured id play a few years make my millions then go back and practice law then imagine my surprise when i came back to the city and found i wasnt hirable good old judge draper had blackballed me called everybody he knew though of course he denies it you asked him i didnt have to the word got out im untouchable another scan of the room and now this couldnt giotti help you he was a friend of your fathers wouldnt he but graham was shaking his head before hardy could finish no chance federal judges hang together youve got to understand that i quit these guys quit the court rejected their whole lives theyre never going to forgive me maybe i could find some work in alaska but im dead in this town ive looked believe me i must have sent out five hundred resumes im in the top of my class at boalt not even an interview so why didnt you move to alaska the maddening hesitation suddenly reappeared i might he said at last the ambiguity seemed intentional whether he meant i might have except for or i might now someday hardy couldnt say but either way for hardy the light came on your father he needed you thats why you came back and stayed on but immediately hardy regretted what hed said he might have given his client an idea graham stood up got to the wall and stood facing the window finally he spoke without turning i dont know i really dont know i didnt plan it it just happened he wrote me the letter the one you saw yesterday and i got in touch with him and we just a pause i just graham was silent so long that hardy rose and crossed over to him it shocked him to see tears but in spite of himself or wanting to he wasnt sure he believed them not anymore graham had already been too duplicitous his admission about trying to charm sarah maybe now he was playing for his attorneys sympathy hardy put a hand on his clients shoulder and felt the tension break the shoulders give graham hung his head the weight of holding it up apparently too much to bear i loved him he was my dad he needed me his voice went down a notch i needed him too there was still the money ten minutes later they were both back at the table hardy had been there for over an hour and had nothing substantive to show for it he had to find out about the money my dad wanted me to take it to give it to somebody else he didnt want anybody in the family to have it didnt want it to be part of the estate hardy took that in like nearly everything else to come from the mouth of graham russo the response raised more questions than it answered who did he want to give it to the children of a woman named joan singleterry okay hardy said ill bite whos she i dont know didnt your father tell you he started then the phone rang when i brought it up again when he came back he looks at me like im from mars no memory just not there thats the way he got and you didnt press him graham spread his palms that was my dad he wouldnt tell me even if he remembered that he wanted me to know the time he did mention her what was that story he shrugged he didnt know where she lived but he wanted me to find her after he was dead and give her the money so he knew he was going to be dead he knew he was going to kill himself sure graham held up a hand i know what that sounds like but its the truth why wouldnt i believe its the truth hardy asked with heavy irony this happens all the time some guys father gives him fifty grand to give to somebody he doesnt know hardy leaned across the table punched up his voice listen up graham youve got to start telling me something i can believe pretty soon or im going to be out of here this is the truth diz i dont know maybe he had some kids with this woman a long time ago and whered he get the money i dont know that either hardy slapped the table shouted jesus what about the baseball cards what did he want you to do with them put em in a fucking time capsule it was the moment to leave this anger wasnt going anywhere productive hardy got his voice back under control gathered his pen and his legal pad stood up let me tell you what this looks like graham this looks like you killed your dad and stole fifty thousand dollars from him and you just didnt have the chance yet to launder the money or do whatever it is you do with that much cash and cash seems to be your thing im not saying that this is what i think although hardy was perilously close to believing just that but this is what its going to look and sound like to everybody who hears it and if it looks smells and tastes like it guess what no reply hardy took a breath now im still your lawyer and im going to listen to what you say and if you want to change your mind im not going to hold it against you and well go on from there but these are losing cards this is a terrible hand graham looked up its what happened well if thats true graham hardy replied this has not been your lucky week when the da sharron pratt got the news that graham russo had been arrested without a warrant issued by her office she angrily demanded that glitsky report to her she thought the police had seriously overstepped their bounds particularly in this case where the larger issues surrounding assisted suicide needed to be thoroughly aired and debated i dont understand pratt was saying why you didnt come to me first lieutenant why did you just arrest him we think hes committed a murder glitsky didnt yet understand pratts anger for while it was true that the police often came to the da to get a warrant for an arrest it was nearly as common to have inspectors make the arrest first this tended to keep suspects from disappearing but look maam if you want you can just dismiss the case thats what youd like isnt it lieutenant no maam but its your right dont try to con me lieutenant thats just what you want if youd come for a warrant for this boys arrest you knew i would have turned you down but now that youve arrested him first youve focused the issue putting me on the spot hands clamped behind her back pratt wore her halfmoon glasses midway down her aristocratic nose she looked over them pratt was not glitskys boss and he didnt much care how she felt about him but he was trying to do his job and considered his reply carefully before he gave it it was a timing issue glitsky said there was plenty of evidence to arrest but if you want to play political football pratts eyes glared her nostrils flared dont you dare accuse me of playing politics with a mans life your people made a mistake arresting this man glitsky couldnt stop himself you know that the arresting inspector was a woman dont you it slowed her for a moment thats not the issue she snapped i dont care who arrested him the point is we this office had not made a decision to prosecute you knew we werent ready to issue a warrant so you went ahead without one i didnt know that why would i even think it your office prosecutes homicides whats to know pratt nodded as though glitsky had confirmed something for her she moved over to her desk where the russo file sat in its manila folder im going to bring this up with the mayor and the board of supervisors lieutenant this police vendetta to discredit me it has to stop and why are we having this vendetta again glitsky asked i forget because i believe and im right that some of the things that you call crimes are simply not wrong and im not going to prosecute them i dont call them crimes the legislature does pratt was shaking her head i dont care whats on the books the books are wrong people are being hounded by you police the citys resources are being squandered by your harassment of prostitutes casual marijuana users murderers she leveled a finger at him thats exactly my point based on the evidence ive seen here the finger went down to the folder i dont think graham russo is a murderer you dont think he killed his father no i do think he killed his father she slapped her palm down on the desk of course he killed his father technically speaking she said do you think im stupid deciding it would be wiser to sidestep a direct answer to that glitsky took a beat tilted his head ladled on the sincerity then i really am missing something here whats the problem with us arresting him if you think he did it sighing heavily pratt pulled her chair over and sat down what im saying lieutenant is that though technically this could have been a homicide glitsky interrupted strout called it a homicide he said so its a homicide but she was shaking her head regardless of that it wasnt a murder no then what was it an assisted suicide which is illegal but not wrong in fact it was right the boy did the humane thing and it was probably the most difficult decision of his life and you want to try him for murder no i arrested him for breaking a law thats my job thats not true your job is to process warrants through this office we make the decision as to whether were going to charge a crime all the way back in her chair she pointed again up at him eyes flashing you police knew this office would make that distinction so you circumvented me youve been doing this kind of thing ever since i came on here can it be that you really think i dont see it glitsky stepped over to a grouping of wing chairs at the side of the room and pulled one around sitting on it he pointed at the file adopted a conversational tone you said you read this so im curious how do you rule out murder i start with the constitution lieutenant by presuming the man innocent when he didnt comment she continued with her own perfectly plausible theory on sal russos death it was a mercy killing so youre saying that from now on in cases like this the da decides we dont need a jury trial to get at the facts and what do we call this the mercy rule pratt glared at him it was no use arguing legal theory with her he decided to return to the evidence okay then what about the money his father gave it to him he loved him he was still estranged from his other children apparently they hated him why would he want them to share his money then why didnt graham just admit it why did he lie about everything we asked him he was cornered he didnt see a way to get out so he panicked people do it all the time all right how about the trauma to the head he could have fallen down and knocked his head anytime before he died glitsky fell silent there were many other evidentiary points but he knew that pratt would have an explanation for how each of them fit her own theory and in fact she might be right the truth might be exactly what pratt thought it was but glitsky believed that it shouldnt be her call it should go to trial to a jury that was how the system worked the da sat back in her chair fingers at her lips you know abe i would think youd be a little more sensitive to this issue didnt your wife suffer terribly his scar tightened through his lips i didnt kill my wife i didnt help kill her she came forward in her chair i didnt say that but she must have been in great pain glitsky too was on the front six inches of his chair she was taking drugs she said they helped she wanted to live as long as she could she didnt want to die but what if she had wanted to die abe wouldnt you have helped her wouldnt you have wanted to of course i would have wanted to i probably would have and yet you dont believe thats what happened here with graham russo and his father you think what he did was wrong he hung his head arguing with pratt was like trying to move a cloud by pushing on it no he said with all the patience he could muster i think what he did was illegal she must have thought shed convinced him she put her elbows on the desk and spread her palms as though releasing a little bird she had between them then the law should be changed david freemans associates called his conference room the solarium under a glassandsteel enclosure rubber trees ficus lemons proliferated visible through the forest outside was an enclosed and landscaped courtyard and this added to the greenhouse feel dismas hardy sat under the foliage at an elliptical mahogany table with michelle tinker demure to the point of shyness michelle possessed what hardy knew to be a brilliant legal mind far more focused he thought than his own freeman kept her on because even though she was tongue tied before juries she had a seemingly boundless aptitude for work and minutiae and thats exactly what hardy had told freeman he needed after hed come in this morning he was going to be working with graham russo and that case was going to take some significant portion of the time he was now giving to tryptech would freeman mind letting him borrow a workhorse who would take off some of the tryptech load freeman not very convincing hiding his pleasure at hardys decision to take the criminal case had been glad to comply michelle had both an accounting and a law degree in her midthirties she was married with no children once you got beyond the shyness she was friendly and well spoken totally professional hardy knew dyson brunei would get along well with her and she jumped at the invitation to assist with tryptech the lawsuit was all numbers and paper shed never see a jury possibly not even a judge it was nearly five oclock and hardy had been getting her up to speed for the better part of two hours outlining the issues trying to acquaint her with the players if michelles questions were any indication she seemed to have absorbed most of it his files were in cardboard boxes that hed carried with him down to the solarium michelle was going to be reading them over the next several days this was authorized fulltime billing so what about your role hardy smiled ill keep my finger in but ive got other commitments and this thing has been eating up all my time its way too much for one person to handle but youll still be on it im reporting to you not david hardy nodded the buck still stops here where they turned to see freeman just back from court a sartorial mess as usual standing in the doorway where does the buck stop with you you stealing my associates hardy nodded as we discussed michelles going to help me out with tryptech she said she had the time out of force of habit freeman glared at them both but then he focused on michelle and his look softened watch this man he said hes unorthodox and dangerous freeman reached into his breast pocket and extracted a cigar thoughtfully he bit off the end spit the tip into his hand and deposited it into one of the potted plants finally he spoke to hardy whens the last time you saw graham russo after lunch hardy replied couple of hours ago in jail why freeman was famous for his dramatic flair in the courtroom he played it out now lighting his cigar taking his time exhaling a long plume nobodys called you hardy didnt like the sound of this no nobodys called me quit the games david whats going on is graham all right he was up out of his chair id say hes probably better than the last time you saw him the word at the hall was they were letting him go idve thought somebody wouldve called you in a startling development today district attorney sharron pratt has announced in a special press briefing that she has declined to file charges against graham russo the lawyer and former federal court clerk whod been arrested in the apparent assisted suicide of his father sal hardy sat in the little shamrock at the far end of the bar watching the television above it it was still light outside the wide front windows though traffic had thinned out on lincoln boulevard frannie would be here soon to meet him for the sacred and traditional date night nearly every wednesday since theyd been married they would most often meet at the shamrock hardy would drive halfway home frannie would cab it halfway downtown and go someplace for dinner maybe a movie some live music hardy sipped his stout and glanced up again at the tube pratts face filled the screen the sixsecond sound bite all the pols lived for ive read the file on this case and the autopsy revealed an advanced irreversible brain tumor mr russo was in great pain with no hope of recovery and whoever helped ease him from this mortal coil should be congratulated not prosecuted frannie was suddenly at his elbow a married kiss on the cheek pulling up the stool next to him as the television reeled her in the pretty young newscaster was continuing righttodie groups across the country have already begun applauding the das action while police officials here in the city refused to comment on graham russos arrest or subsequent release russos attorney dismas hardy who denied his client had killed anybody said mr russo had no plans to sue the city for false arrest so that may be the end of this episode but sources at the hall of justice say they wouldnt be too sure of that that would be you frannie said dismas hardy not the sources at the hall of justice thats me he agreed fame and glory but the story wasnt over the screen widened to include the serious anchor one thing seems certain though donna the district attorneys controversial decision will inflame the already heated national debate over assisted suicide thats a good bet phil this was a political broadside by sharron pratt no doubt of it its going to have ripple effect phil nodded sagely and met the cameras eye and meanwhile our bay area action news team has learned that the state attorney generals office has not ruled out its own investigation into sal russos death graham russo is a free man tonight but who can say for how long who indeed phil hardy stood and went around behind the bar he reached up and turned off the television how can there be so many idiots where do they come from howd you get graham out of jail so fast frannie asked so it didnt look as though the old tvasculturalnemesis distraction was going to work with his wife tonight hed have to develop a new technique i didnt hardy replied he just got out pratt let him go what are you drinking frannie was whitewining and hardy waved alan off and poured it himself while he was behind the bar he went to the jukebox and put on van morrison moondance was thirty years old and still sounded to hardy as though it had been recorded yesterday he pulled up next to frannie a better kiss okay he said looking at his watch it is seven oh four and we are officially on a date now for the record i didnt do anything with graham russo well thats not true i talked to him in jail how were the kids today notice the clever way he tries to change the subject frannie sipped her wine he had to admit it she was good sticking right to the subject at hand the kids were fine nobody broke any bones they had two fights after school one less than usual do you think you and i ought to talk about graham russo i thought if he went to jail you were out of it i did too hardy tipped his glass up then he went to jail a shrug i couldnt just drop him no you wouldnt be able to do that frannie sighed so how did he get out you really had nothing to do with it nada pratt just let him go you heard donna and phil so its got to be true it was political i also heard the case wasnt over that may also be true in fact im pretty sure of it but im not certain he killed his father at all frannie put her glass down i thought he did i thought that was a given youre not alone so what did happen i dont know i get the impression he might be protecting some doctor somebody he knows maybe one of his family hes adamant he didnt kill his dad or help him kill himself she reached over and covered his hand with hers but dismas dont all clients say that especially at first yeah he admitted still still you want to believe him he shrugged i dont know im intrigued i guess suddenly he snapped his fingers and jumped up what frannie asked he was behind the bar rummaging something i just remembered he said pulling out the phone book opening it on the bar who are you looking for he ran a finger down the page singleterry he said theres only four of them no joan though he told frannie about the money about grahams explanation where sal had wanted it to go do you mind if i make a call or two you have another glass of wine the phones right up front there you can watch me the whole time a thrill a minute she said dismas are we on a date are you working now but she touched his hand again its all right go in five minutes he was back frowning what two of them were home and both of them said i was the second person asking about joan in the last three days they didnt know any joan okay which means that graham had called looking for her which means maybe he didnt make up the story about the money and what does that mean i dont know fran it might mean he was telling the truth sarah evans gave herself an hour to sulk about graham russos release it bothered her that shed gone to all the trouble of investigating and then arresting him and then the da had simply let him go she could fume for the rest of her life if she wanted but she reminded herself it was only one case in what she hoped would be her long career and she had done her job no one had found any fault with her the rest of it pratts decision the ags response all of that was out of her control it wasnt going to ruin her life or even her night in fact part of her was almost relieved shed thought graham russo was about the most attractive man shed ever met and she hated to think that someone so good looking could be evil inside that was superficial of her she knew and there were a million examples to the contrary but before she and marcel had started finding things at grahams apartment she almost allowed herself to feel some kind of connection with the suspect they were about the same age he was a lawyer and like her a jock she had felt his eyes on her stupid but it had been there it was the first time shed felt that kind of easy attraction in five years or more more but a cop to her bones she wasnt above using that attraction to get graham to open up to her as shed done at his place she could smile and feign enthrallment with his every word and what made it work was that it wasnt all acting and maybe when she thought about it it had been as pratt had thought graham helping his father out of his misery if that had been the case sarah didnt necessarily have a problem with it she had doctor friends whod told her about pulling the plug at the request of anguished relatives of suffering patients she didnt think the practice ought to be institutionalized lest it be abused but she understood it privately or maybe graham hadnt been any part of it even strouts autopsy she had to admit called the death suicidehomicide equivocal in other words sal might have killed himself the forensic evidence didnt rule out that possibility in any event it was behind her now and she wasnt going to think about it not tonight her softball team had a game she lived alone in a twobedroom over a grocery store on the corner of balboa and fifteenth avenue when she opened the door she stopped on her landing loving the unusual in san francisco almost unheard of feel of a warm night it was great to be in the yellow nylon blazers shirt the darkgreen shorts the yellow knee socks she yanked the gold baseball cap with the green b down over her hair pulled her ponytail through the adjusting slot in the back forget the cop world she was thirtytwo years old in great shape she had the job she wanted and had worked for but it didnt rule her every waking moment she knew it might though if she didnt have other interests that was one of the reasons she played serious organized womens softball it relieved the stress it also guaranteed that she maintained her separate existence outside of the world defined by the hall of justice she caught a glimpse of herself in the grocery window as she passed it on the way to her car she looked about eighteen life was good the ball was going to carry a mile oh graham thank god youre all right his mother helen rushed down the steps of the manor in the exclusive seacliff neighborhood on the northwest rim of san francisco he was only halfway up the slate walkway that bisected the enormous sloping lawn and she ran down to greet him in the warm evening she barely came up to his neck but held his shoulders in her hands and pressed her cheek against his chest a hug he put his arms around her and waited the door to the manor still hung open but no one else appeared the skin on his mothers face was as smooth as marble though he knew that several cosmetic surgeries stretched it to its limits the results so far were seamless she looked a decade younger than her age this graham knew was fortunate given the person she was married to the role she played helen had always attracted men with her wideset blue eyes high cheekbones cornsilk hair now in the warm dusk dressed in tailored pants and a scoopnecked blue cotton blouse she could have been grahams girlfriend not his mother beyond a doubt on the outside she was a beautiful woman as befitted leland taylors trophy wife he wondered if the mom she used to be when she was with sal when hed adored her before their lives had changed he wondered if she had looked the same in his memory her face had had a different quality back then a softness it wasnt the one he was looking at now she pulled away and gazed up at him a hand softly up to his cheek you look tired graham they didnt hurt you down there did they it wasnt even a day mom in and out we would have come to see you to the jail i mean but we didnt know how you we thought your lawyer would tell us something but we never heard from him at all i dont think we know him dismas hardy do we what kind of name is that dismas but it was a mistake after all wasnt it he leaned over and kissed her it was all a mistake he said he met her eyes all of it mom every bit i didnt kill sal i didnt help him die a brief flash of perfect teeth she took his arm and started steering him up the walkway of course you didnt now come on up the family needs to talk about this im so glad you could come right over after hardy had dropped graham back at his apartment hed played back his mothers message it was the last of a half dozen on his answering machine shed called after his release had made the news hed taken a quick shower to wash away the jail within twenty minutes hed been on his way to the manor but the message had given him the impression only that his mother had been worried about him she wanted to see him to make sure he was all right apparently though this was a misreading the whole familys here so his mothers real purpose in running out to greet him he realized was to warn him what to expect when he entered the house calm him down if he exploded this was how it had always worked he was the hothead the emotional one most of the time mom could neutralize him before he raised his voice or caused anyone to feel any embarrassment the two cardinal sins in leland taylors home we decided earlier today to get together graham after theyd arrested you holding his arm protectively to restrain him she stopped walking and looked up at him we thought we needed a strategy on how to deal with this this whole situation graham recognized his stepfathers involvement in this move leland taylor probably strategized before he washed his hands present a united front you know to who but his mother continued ignoring the question and then when you got out you were all naturally so relieved graham of course we were dont be like that i hope leland didnt lose any business over the scandal but oh thats right then why would he my last names different nobody would have to know thats what this meetings about isnt it keeping a lid on it no his mother had been given her marching orders and she was a soldier no wavering emphatically not graham we were worried about you which explains why everybody rushed on down to jail to see how they could help exasperated his mother shook his head ive already explained that she stopped one last time at the foot of the stairs that led up to the grand doubledoored entrance please dont be difficult graham try to understand he looked down at his mothers face was it ravished or ravishing beauty he could no longer tell of course there were no worry lines lasers had erased them he did think hope he read some concern in her eyes but he couldnt tell for sure if it was for him or the mission upon which she had been dispatched and which seemed now to be tottering on the brink of failure helen taylors husbands family money came from banking roland taylor had founded baywest bank in the late forties leland senior carried the torch for three decades through the late fifties and had passed it to his only son by the early eighties over the years the bank had merged and gobbled and steadily grown for a san francisco entity it was remarkably conservative the bank did not prefer to lend money to new or small businesses it did not have a woman or person of color beyond middle management it did not run touchyfeely ads on the television and had an all but open disdain for as george called it the passbook crowd no baywest was most comfortable with institutional lending financing deals cut by men who wore suits at all times during the business day belonged to exclusive country clubs traded secrets behind closed doors the bank knew a lot of secrets and now leland junior was at the helm his stepson george russo though only twentyseven years old was a first vicepresident through french doors the formal dining room at the manor was a couple of elegant steps down from the music room neither leland nor helen played but this hadnt stopped them from purchasing the ninefoot steinway grand and customizing it with a digital box that played classical music at the flip of a switch after it had been installed the couple had discovered that the natural sound of the piano was a little loud for dinner music so theyd added the french doors to muffle it somewhat now the piano was silent but the doors were closed anyway leland taylor did not want any staff to be privy to family discussions knowledge might be power hed often say but secrecy thrills the soul the dining room was round as a plate the cherry table within it an elongated oval that easily seated eighteen tonight with the unusually beautiful weather leland ordered the drapes pulled back through the wraparound windows this afforded a view that extended from the farallon islands clearly visible twentyseven nautical miles off the golden gate all the way around the city to the bay bridge and the coast range beyond only a few degrees to the right of due north the spires of the golden gate bridge seemed to float over the headland but no one in the room showed any interest in the view at the end of the table closest to the music room leland taylor sat next to his wife they werent after all having dinner although coffee had been set out some cookies leland was dressed in a dark charcoal suit a redandblue rep tie he always wore a plain white dress shirt a white shirt says youre the boss graham thought of him as six generations of british inbreeding and this wasnt too inaccurate he was tall and lean with watery blue eyes a thickish upper lip skin reminiscent of pink crepe a couple of chairs down to lelands right not god forbid directly next to anyone grahams sister debra and her husband brendan mccoury tried and pretty much failed to act nonchalant in the face of all this opulence debra had grown up here but her life situation had changed this was nothing like home anymore brendan had what a portion of the world although not lelands would call a good job as an electrical contractor debra was a veterinarians assistant because she was a woman not a particularly stunning or charismatic one at that to leland she essentially did not exist her presence and especially brendans was suffered because in lelands view this qualified as family business and debra technically belonged george like his older brother graham was a big man well put together in his threepiece gabardine he commanded the far end of the table drinking heineken from a chilled pilsner glass two more bottles were on ice in a small designer cooler on the table next to him the entire lefthand side of the table was grahams as a matter of fact he was answering lelands opening question it must be pretty obvious that i didnt know this arrest was coming otherwise i would have called you all and set up something like this to go over the estate yes the estate leland kept a sneer off his face but graham heard it we were surprised to learn of the fifty thousand dollars graham how did sal get that kind of money surely not selling fish thats what id be interested to know its not coming to any of us so what difference does it make what are you talking about not coming to us this was george he spoke quietly but nobody was fooled it gets divided three ways if theres no will i looked it up and there wasnt a will was there graham had resolved to stay calm he picked up one of the cookies and took a bite to slow himself down not as such but there excuse me leland interrupted mildly but if there was no will graham how is it that you are the executor debra interrupted him i read it was wrapped debra was holding her husbands hand out on the table living in the shadow of her stunning socialclimbing mother she had long ago decided not to compete and now at twentynine was not so much unattractive as unadorned she wore no makeup of any kind her hair had once shone like helens but shed elected not to dye it and now it was a drab strawberryblond she was also five months pregnant and her face had broken out what does that mean wrapped where did sal get wrapped bills and what were you planning to do with the baseball cards steal them too graham nodded across the table at his sister yeah deb i was going to steal them i was trying to screw everybody just like usual george said graham turned down the table a dangerous smile in place fuck you leland tapped the table for order now now lets keep it civil can we sure graham said his hand was shaking and the coffee threatened to overspill the rim of his cup he carefully put it down in the saucer you know guys i havent had my alltime best day spending it as i did in jail accused of murdering my father then i come here and we play dump on graham but ill tell you what you can all go to hell i dont need this abuse from the time hed been a child when graham got angry enough tears came to his eyes he wasnt going to have that happen now or at least he wasnt going to let his siblings see it trying to maintain some dignity though he wasnt about to bolt from the table either focusing on the ceiling he was blinking hard pushing back his chair when his mother suddenly spoke sharply stopping him for gods sake children stop sit down graham please sit down youre right were all just a little overwrought you know that its been a very emotional time an uneasy silence leland took over again the voice of reason your mothers right all of you its been a difficult week all around he cast harsh glances at debra and george shutting them up no one means to accuse you of anything graham but we have some questions and im sure that you have answers we dont mean to grill you but they do seem important dont they graham had moved back up to the table hed folded his hands in front of him he was unaware of it but his knuckles burned white from the pressure you know leland frankly they dont frankly he repeated i cant understand why georgie here george his younger brother corrected him sure graham said george why george here cares at all about fifty thousand dollars or even a third of it which hes not going to get anyway because dad wanted it to go to someone else well thats one of the questions leland retorted who did your father want this money to go to down at his end george did his leland impression slapping the table three times first i think id rather talk about why i shouldnt care about seventeen thousand dollars thats a lot of money graham threw him a withering look what do you make a year george one thirty one fifty what difference does that make it makes a difference how much you need seventeen thousand dollars yeah thats the way you think all right but its not a question of how much i need it thats completely irrelevant the issue is that its mine whether i need it or not graham had that dangerous smile again you know georgie youre turning into a fine banker and its not yours anyway petulantly his sister spoke up again well regardless of george we need it its a lot of money to us next to debra brendan stiffened if there was one thing graham knew about debras husband and he knew more than he wanted to it was that brendan didnt want or need anybodys help financial or otherwise ever he was a man and he did it his way on his own no matter what were doing all right he insisted we dont need it we do too bren dont argue with me mccoury said he appeared to be fighting the urge to strike her but leland wasnt going to referee marital disputes he tapped the table again excuse me debra i dont think graham has given us sals intentions here regarding this money excuse me leland george again the mimic but sals intentions dont matter if he didnt write a will graham can do whatever he wants with his third but debra and i get ours thats the law and he knows it outside the sun had gone down and a motherofpearl sky was fast going dark grahams patience not his strong suit to begin with was at an end he couldnt imagine that his fathers money would make even the slightest difference to georges life debras perhaps for a short time his eyes swept the table quickly this was his nuclear family more after sals death it was every relative he knew on earth and he felt no connection to any of them how had they all come to this he wondered what had made the family go so wrong maybe there had never been any hope for them he thought maybe the incompatibility ran so deep it was structural for as long as he could remember the conflict between sal and helen had been apparent when hed been very young graham hadnt been able to understand the causes of it but even to the young boy there had been an obvious discrepancy simply in the way his mother and father were in their very natures it seemed fundamental problems that went deeper than mere differences in the way they did things sal was a secondgeneration italian who grew up speaking the language in his home he loved working with his hands painting fixing things drinking fishing being with the guys telling dirty jokes and laughing out loud he played party songs on his accordion darkly handsome with a wicked smile sal exuded physical confidence he hugged even his male friends kissed his wife in public pinched her ass from time to time he was also a talented athlete like his son graham after him he had been signed to play baseball out of college the baltimore orioles had given him a signing bonus of like his son as with the great majority of players he never made the big leagues at helens urging though hed saved his bonus and had used it to buy his boat helen had been raised on a different cultural plane her parents richard and elizabeth emphatically not dick and betsy raessler were wellknown jewelers helen had gone to town school the most prestigious private school in the city she grew up in fine restaurants at the opera theater symphonies museums she was a fine equestrienne british style and an outstanding cook by the time she was eighteen shed been to europe with her parents five times to the far east twice she met leland taylor while they both were in high school and her parents considered him the perfect match for her although believing they both should wait until a more seemly age richard and elizabeth had been torn by helens desire to attend lone mountain college an independent institution but informally the womens adjunct to the university of san francisco they would have much preferred one of the eastern womens colleges vassar brown for cultural as well as protective reasons lone mountain was run by nuns and the raesslers suspected those crafty jesuits plus catholics were a much more rowdy group than helen was used to on the other hand lone mountain was close by their girl would be at hand and they could keep an eye on her they would just have to keep her insulated from the riffraff some of the workingclass young men from across the street at usf and of course helen went and fell in love with one of them it was and helen was a freshman sal was finishing his senior year after a hitch in vietnam so to helen he also possessed that indefinable cachet of the older man she was eighteen to his twentyfive to say that richard and elizabeth were not pleased would be a considerable understatement when she became pregnant at the end of that first summer before she and sal were even officially engaged they counseled their daughter to get an abortion but helen and sal wouldnt have that they were in love they would get married and raise their family when she eloped with the jock fisherman the raesslers cut their daughter off the slow thaw in relations between the families began at the birth of graham a name that like george and debra did not exactly sing with sals italian heritage it had been richards fathers name and helen persuaded sal that they should present it their first childs name to her parents as a type of peace offering reluctantly hed agreed although the peace never really extended to sal a creeping bribery began elizabeth would buy nice clothes for the children and deliver them during the day when she wouldnt have to see their father clothes shoes christmas gifts bicycles finally richard and elizabeth wanted their grandchildren to grow up in a safe neighborhood with the right kind of playmates they werent trying to influence their daughter against her husband no it wasnt anything like that sal would grow to be comfortable in seacliff they would put the down payment on a suitable place and sal and helen would make the monthly payments it wasnt a loan or charity they were sharing equity that was all it was a partnership sal hated all of this but he told himself he couldnt blame helen if her parents remained important to her he let it go on thinking it a compromise he was being reasonable forgiving it wasnt so divisive sal was wrong by the time graham was old enough to notice the difference in his parents was pronounced six days a week before the sun was up sal was off fishing in the signing bonus on sundays hed play some kind of sports with graham and georgie except when the weather was prohibitive on those days hed go out to the garage and paint or drink or both in the meanwhile helen had begun to see her parents more often the clothes and other gifts had become a way of life she would often meet her mother for lunch sometimes a childhood girlfriend of helens would be invited always a fashionable young woman married to her doctor or lawyer or accountant or banker leland taylor might show up and say hello might inquire after her children sal drew the line at accepting cash money from the raesslers but the pressure never let up he kept thinking that if he could just get ahead on his own hed have the legs on which to take a stand as it was though times were always tight proud and house poor sal could barely keep up with the monthly payments on the manor by the time graham was thirteen the foundations of the marriage had begun to erode but the collapse of the whole structure when he was fifteen happened with a jarring suddenness from grahams perspective one day sal stopped going to work and the next he was gone from their lives completely cut off as though hed died in less than a year helen had married again to spare the children the trauma of another relocation of more changes and domestic upheaval leland taylor had moved into the manor perhaps finally graham thought any real reconciliation between the russo and the raessler genes was hopeless the schism was too profound he was a russo all the way sals kid debra and george were helens frustrated and angry graham pushed his coffee cup away from him sharply blew out a breath id like a show of hands he said does anybody here care at all that sal russo died last friday that your father is dead has that made an impression on anybody here across the table debras lip trembled at the question while down at the far end george leaned forward oh please yeah were heartbroken cant you see he was such a great dad always there when you needed him shut up george debra said dont talk about him like that why not he raised his voice why the hell not the younger brother stood up nearly knocking his chair over behind him his eyes were bright with anger you want us to feel bad that he died ill tell you what i feel good about it relieved do you have any idea the hell hes put mom through these last few months helen held up a hand to stop george but nothing was stopping george not now you dont know anything about that do you graham all this lateintheday touchyfeely nonsense about dear old dad and you dont have a clue the torture he was putting your own mother through no i didnt know that what leland was firmer than helen had been he rapped sharply on the table we dont need to speak of that george its over now it did no lasting harm what didnt georges blood was up he sneered at his older brother as if you care i might if youd tell me what it is dad came by here thats what he was threatening mom i dont believe that thats not true leland again george but the young man couldnt be stopped you think anybody believes this deathbed conversion of yours graham you think all of us dont see right through it leland tapped the table and said son please but he might have saved his breath george was advancing toward graham who was out of his own chair now you know and i know hell we all know he was a lousy father and husband and human being he deserted us graham all of us maybe it slipped your mind what happened was you found out he had some money and after you blew off your law career you knew you werent getting any more out of leland didnt you you thought youd squeeze some cash out of old sal wasnt that it george had closed to within two feet of graham his face had gone red suddenly he was on him pushing at him backing him up shouting spittle flying from his lips tell me that wasnt it you lying son of bitch tell me it wasnt graham pushed back hard his brothers leg caught the side of a chair graham pressing his advantage pushed again and george went down everyone else was up as graham whirled around a hand out in warning no one should come any closer george was on his feet again glaring graham held them all back his breath was coming in gasps he took a last look around the table at his family then half running the tears threatening to break again he was past his mother and stepfather up the steps through the french doors and gone the blazers had formed a line in the infield sarah evans whod run in from left field after the last out was at the end of the line good game she repeated as each of the wombats came by her slapping palms and they said it back to her it was a ritual a nod to sportsmanship they played hard sure but everyone realized it was just a game you congratulated the other team on a good one and then you went home the dugout area was a bench behind a low fence and the blazers filed into it to grab their bats and equipment bags and clear out for the next team sarah recounting the highlights of the game with some of the other women suddenly stopped talking and focused on graham russo standing behind the fence in his big dog tshirt and giants hat staring at her grabbing her bag she had her gun in it she walked out of the dugout and around the fence up to him he smiled easily i thought that was you i was pretty sure actually did you follow me here the question seemed to surprise him no how did you know i was here then she wished her heart would stop its pounding she could feel the light nylon fabric of her jersey pulsing to its rhythm i didnt he said i grabbed a burger at the beach and came here to watch a few games take my mind off some things yeah ill bet he broke another smile i was cooped up inside most of the day maybe you heard it was such a nice night i thought id sit outside awhile i got a sixpack back in the stands if you feel like a beer watch the late game she shook her head i dont think so i dont think we ought to be seeing each other if you think youre scaring me showing up here youre wrong its a bad idea stalking a cop ill put you back in jail so fast youll forget you ever got out i hope youre hearing me a couple of her teammates were passing them on the way to the parking lot they heard the sharp tone and stopped everything all right sarah sure fine she turned back to graham you stay away from me she said quietly then to her teammates wait up im coming there were four softball diamonds one in each corner of the enormous field sarahs game had been on closest to the parking lot and she could sit in her car and see graham clearly in the stands ten rows of raised benches behind home plate with her windows down she watched him for twenty minutes he appeared to be engrossed in the game occasionally drinking from his can of beer at least she told herself he hadnt made any move to follow her out to the parking lot she thought his plan might have been to let her get a head start then light out after her but he hadnt even glanced after her when shed left hed gone back to watch the next games as hed said he was going to maybe he was telling the truth which didnt mean he hadnt followed her here he might have already found out what he wanted where she lived and played on the other hand she told herself his own explanation made sense hed been in jail all day and the city possibly wouldnt have a nicer night for the rest of the nineties she opened her car door and grabbed her equipment bag pulling a light warmup jacket on over her jersey she crossed the dark space between the parking lot and the stands she stood awhile longer watching him he was sitting forward hunched over his elbows on his knees his hands dwarfing the can of beer he held between them his tshirt stretched itself tightly over the muscles of his back the da had let him go he wasnt charged with anything she could go down and sit with him and there would be no grounds for any professional complaint she rationalized another halflie for herself that he might make a verbal slip with some beer inside him and say something incriminating she was still in cop mode working thats why she was staying around why it was defensible to go talk with him on the field a young man hit a ball well over three hundred feet outside the circle of the diamonds lights graham was on his feet following the trajectory his face alight with excitement lost in the moment it was a childs look unguarded simple innocent pure a doubt flashed briefly in her consciousness could someone who had committed a murder summon such an expression she didnt think so shed changed out of her cleats and now wore running shoes which made no noise as she walked down the benches she sat down next to him okay ill have that beer he glanced over his face showing nothing casually he reached under him and pulled up a can popping the top handing it to her you see that hit he asked she tipped the can that letter from your dad she said you were playing pro baseball he didnt answer right away on the field the shortstop went deep into the hole for a ground ball flipped it back to second then on to first for a double play it ended the half inning graham finished up his beer i thought i could hook on as a replacement during the strike i couldnt he risked a look at her i really didnt follow you he said this is where i come sometimes thats all then i saw you watched you play a little i figured what the hell were both here i might as well say hello it didnt occur to me youd think id followed you but i arrested you graham nodded a smile tugging at his lips i did notice that most people she said you arrest them they dont like you anymore but then they let me go theyre not charging me so you and me were both citizens i dont think so not exactly im still a cop youre still a suspect he chewed on that for a beat then shrugged it off well guess what i myself am an officer of the court and ps i didnt kill my father he indicated the field you play pretty good sergeant i saw your triple she found herself loosening up most exciting offensive play in the game so my dad said you still think so sure me too well there graham pulled another beer from underneath his seat popped the top something else weve got in common you want another one shed nearly finished the first sarah had never been much of a drinker and she was already feeling the slow warmth of even so little alcohol beginning to spread id better not she said ive got to be going work starts early i remember he said she hesitated another couple of seconds taken aback by his ready acquiescence surprised at the act of will it took for her to stand thanks for the beer she said he nodded shed gone off a couple of steps when he stopped her sergeant evans she turned whats your first name her face clouded then suddenly cleared she shook her head laughing at herself then met his eyes sarah sarah he repeated his smile seemed completely genuine endearing i love that name back in her car she checked her face in the rearview mirror she felt absurdly pleased with herself and wondered if it showed so what graham russo liked her name big deal the warmth had spread she told herself it was the alcohol shed better be careful driving home part two great rivers may begin with a tiny trickle but the creation of an avalanche does not occur in the same way where one snowflake adheres to another and the growing mass slowly coalesces until it simply begins to fall over itself no an avalanche just happens all at once the side of a mountain gives way coming loose with explosive force unstoppable and indiscriminate rearranging the landscape of everything in the path of its inanimate will by two am on thursday morning less than eight hours after graham russos release from jail the momentum of the avalanche had pushed every other issue in san francisco off the political map by that hour the earlymorning edition of the san francisco chronicle was coming off the press with the banner headline mercy killing debate rips city state offices the long story merely scratched at the surface of the many fronts on which the battle had erupted simultaneously the mayor supported the district attorney san francisco had always been in the forefront of social awareness sharron pratt had done the right thing people shouldnt be forced to live in unrelenting pain where was the quality in a life like that if a person chose to take his or her own life to end their suffering they had the right to do so and the people who helped them were not murderers they were heroes dan rigby the citys chief of police was outraged this was the latest and most serious example of the das utter disdain for the police who kept the city safe his officers had acted correctly in arresting a homicide suspect there was no evidence that the death of sal russo had been anything but a murder in the course of a robbery but even if it had been an assisted suicide the da is elected to enforce the laws not make them i shudder to wonder what other kinds of homicides ms pratt is going to decide are not crimes dean powell the state attorney general was studying the case refusing to disclose or foreclose any of his options art drysdale formerly of the das office and fired by pratt and now with the state attorney general would only comment that as a matter of law its unambiguous that we have jurisdictional responsibility were not going to let murders go unpunished in san francisco the board of supervisors called an emergency session for late in the evening and declared by a to majority that san francisco should be a righttodie haven the country needed a humanitarian city that would become a mecca for the terminally ill and hopelessly suffering the catholics and the protestants wasted no time squaring off archbishop james flaherty reiterated the stand of the catholic church on any form of euthanasia god took his children when it was his time jesus himself had suffered horribly flaherty said and that he had allowed himself to do so was meant clearly to serve as an example to all of humanity suffering was part of life it had a purpose it ennobled and strengthened the spirit especially when offered up to the glory of god the archbishop ended his remarks with a notsosubtle dig at the mayors stand on quality of life life is a sacred thing unto itself he said a quality life is a life lived in the service of god not in the pursuit of comfort at first light from the altar of grace cathedral on nob hill with the huge aids mosaic on the floor and aids blankets hung from the rafters the right reverend cecil dunsmuir fired his own broadside back at flaherty to his own bank of cameras anyone who could extol the virtue of suffering ought to spend more time with our aids community here he will find great caring great love great sacrifice and great nobility in the face of death but the end of pain is a blessing from god and administering to that end is the true meaning of christianity police had to be called to a meeting of a previously planned antiabortion protest group at an elks hall in potrero heights when differences on the morality of mercy killing erupted into a melee among the activists barbara brandt was an attractive woman in her late thirties who made her living as a sacramento lobbyist as the states chairperson of the hemlock society the national righttodie organization brandt saw graham russos picture on the front page of the sacramento bee young and moviestar handsome and after reading the story realized that here was this years poster boy for major fundraising she looked up grahams number in the telephone book and was a bit surprised when he picked up on the second ring im really not interested in talking about it he told her after a couple of minutes im a lawyer you know if i break the law theyll yank my bar card ive already had enough problems with my career but you did the right thing brandt persisted you dont know what i did yes i do she said i know just what you did im on your side but it wasnt any use he wasnt budging after he hung up she considered it for several minutes shed heard enough to know the truth grahams law career would be over before it had begun if he admitted hed helped kill his dad but hed done the right thing hed already committed his civil disobedience all he needed now brandt thought was the courage to admit what hed done and she thought she could help him find a way to do just that the public television station made a controversial decision to change their early thursdaymorning programming entitled just let me die the show later won televisions humanitas award and an emmy for best local documentary it was a grueling and poignant half hour of hastily assembled and edited file videotape of suffering hospital and nursinghome patients ai sufferers cancer victims other terminally patients of both sexes all ages creeds and colors and all conscious enough to voice their desire to die this is hank travers with bay area action news im standing outside the offices of the california state attorney generals office in san francisco and with me is assistant attorney general gil soma mr soma can you tell us whether the state has decided to bring charges against mr russo soma was a talking head we need to carefully review all the evidence of course but the law and my office believes that the deliberate killing of another human being is usually a crime there was an avid glint in his eyes that belied the apparent objectivity clearly soma wanted the head of graham russo and just as obviously hank travers recognized this is it true that you and mr russo used to work together the camera angle widened soma was the picture of the fighting young attorney the cameras were out on the street and a freshening breeze was playing with his tie messing with his hair he ignored these distractions giving all his attention to hank its a matter of record that we were both clerks for federal judge harold draper beyond that i cant comment the camera moved in for a closeup hanks voice came over gil somas intense glare but you know a different graham russo dont you the man behind the outward appearance and you believe he would have killed his father for fifty thousand dollars no comment travers tried a last time but in your opinion hes the kind of person who could have done it soma kept it straight were looking at the evidence thats all i can tell you but he continued nodding into the camera and the message came across loud and clear soma despised graham russo he was going to take him down if he could glitsky had evans and lanier in a borrowed office in the vice detail down the hallway from homicide it was important that the office have a door that could be closed and glitskys cubicle did not provide that particular amenity the situation regarding the continuing investigation into sal russos death was unusual and volatile he was taking them through the game plan when he had finished his first pass evans raised a hand and the lieutenant atypically took on an amused expression were not in school here sarah you can just speak up she folded her arms back across her chest ive got just one question what are we supposed to do that we didnt do last time when they let him go glitsky nodded it was a good question not much to tell you the truth same stuff just more of it marcel lanier had been around long enough that he got the gist of it the first time he was sitting in a comfortable chair next to his partner and he looked over at her everybody has their guards down sarah witnesses think there wont be any charges so what they saw or heard might not be so threatening people might open up the investigation is still open thats really what abes saying thats it glitsky was all agreement but russo is still our suspect especially after last night this was not welcome news best and only he did it lanier was ready to hit the streets glitsky had delivered the message time to go to work but sarah was still in her chair arms still crossed over her chest is something wrong sarah glitsky asked her she shook her head i dont know yeah something they waited i dont think he did it she said at last i think we were wrong lanier began sputtering something but glitsky stopped him with a gesture he set a haunch on the corner of the desk im listening i dont know she repeated im just not sure whats changed since yesterday glitsky asked a couple of things she hesitated then came out with it i talked to him when she told them about the meeting at the softball diamond leaving out her personal reaction he came up to me not precisely true but she thought close enough she was positive hed been about to approach her when she saw him staring at her i dont think he would have done that if hed killed his father sure he would have this was laniers territory hed interacted with a hundred murderers in his career and had not a doubt that he had the psychology down whatever it might be hed already seen it twice thats exactly the kind of shit these assholes try to run on us we let him out of jail so hes untouchable he wants to know what we know hes sucking up to you sarah trying to get under your skin she didnt believe it it wasnt like that glitsky what was it like theres wasnt any sucking up he barely mentioned it lanier leaned in toward her i bet it did sneak its clever little way into the conversation though didnt it she shrugged he just said he didnt do it an afterthought lanier had seen that too ahh the subtle approach he barely brings it up after hes been arrested and spent the day in jail the psychology of that failed marcels litmus test and he wanted his partner to know it if youd just spent your first day in jail and met the person whod put you there dont you think it might be kind of the main thing on your mind wouldnt you want to talk about it just a tiny bit marcel i think she gets the point glitsky came back to sarah you said there were a couple of things what was the other one her eyes fixed on each of the men in turn i thought about this all night reread over the file we dont really have anything that puts him there glitsky nodded this too was a valid point thats why drysdale wants the investigation to proceed he says he needs more to get a conviction you mean we shouldnt have arrested him last time now wait a minute lanier wasnt about to accept that analysis the guy had already hired a lawyer not in itself a crime glitsky pointed out sure sure but still lanier knew what cops knew and that was that innocent people if there were any didnt tend to bring their lawyers into the picture until they were charged until they finally understood that they were in trouble he continued basically we got an unemployed selfish kid with a milliondollar lifestyle who needed the money and saw an easy way to take it so its all the money absolutely he had the safe combination at his place that puts him at his old mans then why didnt he just pick up the safe deposit key while we were searching his place put it in his pocket we wouldnt ever have found it lanier shrugged i give up maybe he thought wed catch him if he tried maybe he didnt believe wed be so thorough im not saying the guys a professional hit man maybe he was just nervous if it was all about the money he would have done something to hide it she was shaking her head it would have been so easy he couldnt not have done it the old bromide that killers needed to tell somebody about what theyd done wasnt all false he wanted us to find it call it a type of confession he wouldnt feel the need to confess if it was an act of mercy if he felt hed done the right thing lanier shook his head uhuh this wasnt any assisted suicide either this was murder that bump under the ear which strout said could have happened hours before no no no our boy graham coldcocked him from behind with the whiskey bottle gave him a veinful of morphine cleaned out the safe and tiptoed home through the tulips so if sal was coldcocked lying still on the ground and graham gives shots every day of his life why was there trauma around the injection site why wasnt it a clean little poke i dont know maybe he was scared he was hurrying maybe there was an earthquake the needle was broke maybe he missed the vein my doctor does every time but glitsky had listened to enough arguing all right all right this doesnt matter i think you had plenty to arrest russo yesterday if you keep looking maybe youll find more youre authorized to keep looking thats all make it tight if the ag wants to move on him well bring in graham again if the evidence points to somebody else well go after them sarah you got anybody else youre thinking about she said she didnt but sal still might have killed himself right the autopsy didnt rule that out glitsky nodded thats true he pushed himself off the desk the meeting was over and that is precisely the reason that god in her infinite wisdom invented the jury system he spread his hands as though blessing them which fortunately never fails well at least we had a nice summer didnt we lanier had his jacket buttoned all the way up his head down in his collar next to him evans her hands tucked into her own jacket squinted into the face of the wind and the dust it was kicking up where did this come from she asked they were both walking fast it just cant be this cold after their meeting with glitsky theyd driven the half mile from the hall up seventh street and pulled into stevenson alley a narrow and grimy if schizophrenic line of asphalt and garbage a half block south of the always exotic bus station the north side of stevenson was lined with the backs and delivery doors of the ancient mediumrise buildings of retail businesses that were struggling to survive on market street of the few structures whose fronts faced the alley the most prominent was the lions no apostrophe arms apartment building where sal russo had lived and died in corner room stenciled in fading black paint onto the side of the building were the words daily weekly rates for most of the past decade the south side of stevenson had fit in with the rundown ambience of the neighborhood an open sore of a construction site while the old post office building was being renovated recently though that work had been completed the postal service now had its own new home out at rincon annex and the buildings other tenant the ninth circuit federal court of appeals had taken it over the federal courthouse now loomed fresh and imposing a massive and elegant structure between stevenson alley and mission street lanier and evans didnt notice any of it as they stepped around the homeless man camped sleeping now in one of the back doorways all they saw on the south side of the alley the courthouse side was a solid gray wall already sprayed with graffiti topped with coils of razor wire it wouldnt have mattered to the two inspectors if the taj mahal had been across the way the lions arms didnt pick up any reflected majesty from its surroundings it was a flophouse pure and simple the uniforms had canvassed the lions arms when sals body had been found but after dark were prime hours for a certain class of people who made their living on the street lots of tenants hadnt been home so sarah and lanier were back planning to knock on more doors normally inspectors dont like to work alone in this kind of environment but it was midday and they could get more done if they split up both were aware that they probably should have gotten back to this sooner but in the crush of other priorities it had had to wait to accommodate a relatively spacious lobby and mailbox area the building dated from a more gracious era there were only four units on the first floor and sarah began knocking on them the upper three stories had eight units each lanier mounted the stairs that began in the back of the lobby and took the second floor he was going to start at directly below sals apartment at the front of the building he wasnt even there when sarah appeared on his landing nobody home on the first floor ill start on three the name in the slot next to the door said blue and blue was coalblack she was vaguely familiar by sight to lanier he had probably seen her around the hall after shed been busted for prostitution for there was no question about her profession after lanier identified himself through the door there was the sound of some movement inside she must have been expecting a customer lanier thought probably was putting away some novelty items maybe a bong the door eventually opened shed opened the window but the room still smelled strongly of marijuana and somewhat less so of musk blue was tucking a red teddybear top into a pair of skintight black denims she stood in the open doorway not asking him in he showed her his badge and then she surprised him this be about sal upstairs lanier said it was and she nodded i thought you be by sooner i almost call you cept i dont call cops sal was okay you knew him she shook her head not real good we talk a few times in the lobby sometimes out the alley there he brung me up some fresh salmon sometimes i love salmon her eyes got wistful it was so sad him dying you find who killed him out of habit and caution lanier did not answer questions put to him by witnesses instead he talked to her for a moment realized he might have something and pulled out the tape recorder he almost hadnt bothered to bring along after intoning the standard introduction for the transcriber he came back at her did you see or hear anything on last friday may ninth that made you believe sal russo had been killed i didnt know killed at the time but somebody be up in sals place with him i hear the door open then she indicated over her head the ceiling creaks somebody else there and where were you here in my apartment and then some other noises what kind of noises were they like he fell down like some scraping furniture she looked up this place you know the walls pretty thin not zactly soundproof but lanier was going to keep her at it so you heard this noise some furniture scraping on the floor that wasnt precisely right wasnt like anything pushing more like something fell hit against it or something and it scraped then he kind of moaned and yelled no bunch of times no yeah like he was in pain or something but pleading like the saddest sound did you hear anybody else any other voices yeah two voices sal and somebody else male female male having some argument it sounded like this was before sal moaned before the furniture scraped blue closed her eyes her face a study before but there was an uncertainty what nothing it was just before and then after the moan what anything else she took a moment closing her eyes again making sure no just that then the door opened and closed again a few minutes later and then it be quiet so what did you do the question seemed to spook her she looked down then at a place somewhere over laniers shoulder i did go up but later no one answered lanier almost got sarcastic with her dead people generally didnt answer doors too well but he kept his tone neutral yeah blue but you heard this noise that sounded like sal might be in trouble while you were right here underneath him you said you guys were friends i didnt say we were friends not exactly friends i knew him a little he seem like a good guy thats all okay so why didnt you go up and see him while you still might have been able to help again that look over his shoulder blue i couldnt she paused and sighed somebody was here sleeping afterward you know i couldnt get up dismas hardy remained unaware of developing events for the whole day until nearly nine oclock thursday evening he had awakened at six and met michelle at davids deli for a breakfast meeting an hour later they were going down to palo alto fortysome miles south to meet with dyson brunei tryptechs ceo to introduce michelle and discuss some of the substantive issues related to the lawsuit hardy hadnt taken the time to even glance at a newspaper from his perspective the graham russo case was still smoldering but the immediate fire had been put out hardy was going to have his hands full anyway bringing michelle up to speed on this litigation continuing with his daily work he figured that graham was going to be in his life sometime in the future but for now it was important to will graham onto a back burner impending murder charge or not it was easier said than done over lunch the conversation between michelle brunei and hardy had come around to the surveillance equipment in use at the port of oakland perhaps michelle suggested there was some video record of malfeasance some smoking gun locked in the video camera at one of the security checkpoints there was no record anyone had looked into that possibility grahams bank hardy had thought video records at the bank could prove perhaps that graham hadnt gone there with his fathers money after friday that would mean that whatever else might have happened he didnt kill sal so that he could get at the safe it would get any murder charge out of the range of special circumstances once the idea about videotapes at the bank came to him the rest of the day was an agony of detail and protocol hardy couldnt shake the feeling that even during this apparent hiatus his inability to get out of tryptechs office might be costing graham russo years of his freedom hardyd let himself be lulled by the media attention around the idea that the death of sal russo had been an assisted suicide that was after all the express reason that sharron pratt had declined to file charges but the realization came to him in a bolt if the attorney general was going to play hardball politics and bring a charge against graham russo it wasnt likely to be for less than firstdegree murder still hardy couldnt very well leave his breadandbutter corporate client and his brandnew associate together and tell them to just catch up on things he had to sell brunei on michelles skills and competence simultaneously giving her a chance to show off what she had miraculously mastered in such a short time as if that werent enough he also felt they needed to conduct some real business going over deposition testimony hed taken in the past couple of weeks squeezing hard data from the elusive brunei the three of them and some of tryptechs staff remained at it until after seven then hardy decided to stop by his own office downtown and check his messages from the pile of slips and first four phone calls on his answering machine all from reporters it was immediately obvious that the russo case had gone ballistic making his delay more crucial he tried calling graham at home by now it was ninethirty and no one answered not even the machine hardy reasoned that if his own tangential connection to the case had produced todays volume of mail and phone calls then graham must have been absolutely inundated by the flood no doubt he was lying low he didnt get home until eleventhirty and frannie was by then asleep his dinner was on the diningroom table cold this morning out in the avenues where hardy lived it was more than mere fog it was wet as rain although for some reason the droplets didnt fall just hung in the air the temperature was in the low forties and a bitter wind whipped his coat as he approached his car things at home were not good he thought he remembered telling frannie yesterday that he wouldnt be home for dinner he had never planned to be home for dinner last night if he had told her though she didnt remember it and in all honesty he wasnt completely certain that he had though he ached with every bone in his body to be out of the house he needed a court order and then he needed to get to grahams bank he also knew he had better wait and talk to frannie when she got back from taking the kids to school which he had done now driving downtown through the soup he wasnt sure if he was happy or not that his wife wasnt a nag if shed only yelled at him he could have responded in kind or worked himself up a froth of righteous indignation that she didnt appreciate all the hours he was putting in so that he could support the family and all by himself he need hardly remind her it was a grueling responsibility the daily grind but it was his job and he was sorry if once in a very great while he had to miss a goddamn dinner some wives actually understood this thats what he would have said if shed come back in on the warpath but if she had lost her temper at any time last night shed found it by the time she talked to him this morning she wasnt mad and this threw him as she knew it would back on himself was this the way it was always going to be she simply wanted to know so shed be able to deal with it so she could be a better mom to the kids she didnt say in the absence of a father figure but he heard it so he tried a few clichés life is complicated we have different roles were trying to juggle this is just a busy time but hed ended up by apologizing hed try to communicate better in the future she was right something had to change well he thought something already had hed brought on michelle to help with tryptech hed more or less committed to graham russos defense this case intrigued him as corporate litigation never would there was no passion for him in business law and it took all of his time wasting him for anything else like his family it made him feel old he might no he would wind up working the same kind of hours for graham russo but it would be in the service of something he believed in maybe at fortyfive he was finally getting down to the core of who he was the car behind him honked and he moved forward then pulled over to the side of geary street letting the traffic flow past him this was the way he always reacted when he began caring too much he went on autopilot and ran from it there was too much to lose it wasnt safe it was what hed done after his son had died during his first marriage when he was twentyseven something in him decided he wouldnt survive looking over into the chasm he closed up and went to sleep he and jane had gotten divorced hed quit the law entirely and for nearly ten years hed tended bar at the shamrock drinking a lot but rarely getting drunk functioning quite well thank you but keeping any feeling on a short tether sleepwalking then suddenly frannie realizing that the essence of him had nearly dried up and would surely blow away if he didnt risk part of it hed started over fatherhood again criminal law again caring too much again what if he lost all this now or even any part of it no he couldnt let that happen he was at his limit of risk tolerance it was too dangerous it was a matter of his survival he had to pull back and thats what hed done gotten back to sleepwalking functioning keeping too busy he was on the run avoiding the only kind of work he found fulfilling maintaining a low level of interaction with his family it stunned him hed become afraid of change of failure in his job of caring too much at home it had to stop he thought he had to wake himself up what was the point of protecting the essentials in your life your talents your family your friends if you never took the time to enjoy them if you were already dead superior court judge leo chomorro a brushcut swarthy block of welltailored muscle was in his chambers playing chess with his computer he had blocked out six days for a murder trial in his courtroom and this morning one of pratts young wunderkind had forgotten to subpoena the witness he had planned to call at the start of the day so chomorro had a morning off not that this had put him in an especially good humor on the other hand one of hardys trials had been in chomorros courtroom and there was no evidence that anything put him in a good humor nevertheless he was the only available judge this morning and hardy needed him he kept it short hed like the judge to sign a court order to look at the surveillance videotapes from graham russos bank he explained why he needed it why dont you use a subpoena the judge asked him i cant theres no case pending so what jurisdiction do i have to issue this order who am i to tell the bank what to do i cant issue an order any more than you can issue a subpoena your honor hardy laid on the respect the bank doesnt care about the tape all they need is paper to cover themselves if you sign this no one will ever object if you dont important evidence in this case could be lost because the police dont want to preserve it chomorro snorted they shouldnt care either way hardy nodded should is the operative word there judge you think this ones going to get hot dont you another nod its smoldering already thats why i need the order now i dont know how long they save the tapes if its a week maybe im already too late i need last fridays chomorro reviewed the order that hardy had printed out from the word processor in his office to custodian of records wells fargo bank haight street branch good cause appearing therefore you are hereby ordered upon receipt of reasonable payment therefore to surrender to dismas hardy counsel of record for graham russo copies of surveillance videotape film for the dates may inclusive below the date was a line for the judge to sign and this he did looking up when he was finished handing over the paper i havent seen you around here in a while mr hardy you been on vacation hardy kept it light just waiting for the right case chomorro nodded looks like you found it graham had his telephone and answering machines unplugged but in new york on thursday afternoon a senior editor at time michael cerrone convinced his boss that the russo story in san francisco was a potential cover on friday at onetwenty shivering in the wind and fog even up on edgewood cerrone knocked on grahams door and introduced himself he had his photographer with him time magazine graham said youre kidding me cerrone had seen this response before in people whom fame had sledgehammered he proffered his credentials this is so unreal graham said here i just come home from getting laid off and now you want to take my picture for time magazine cerrone wasnt much older than graham though he looked even younger with dark hair to his shoulders and an open inviting smile in jeans hiking boots and a bright blue parka he was the farthest thing imaginable from a threatening bigcity media type he showed his teeth grinning hey i know its not rolling stone but ill buy you a beer then more seriously who laid you off how come graham explained it his employers had no complaints about his work but due to all the publicity theyd gotten several phone calls potential customers didnt seem all that thrilled with the idea that their sick patients would be riding in an ambulance with a paramedic who might help them end their suffering after all this blew over the ambulance company might reconsider bringing graham back on but until then that sucks cerrone said sympathetically dont you want to tell your side of it youll never get a better chance graham russo thought about it for a couple of seconds then told cerrone he might as well come on in out of the cold bring his photographer in with him the manager of the wells fargo branch a cooperative woman named peggy reygosa was inclined to comply promptly with hardys court order she wasnt about to let go of the originals however but arranged with the banks custodian to make copies for hardy yes of course shed tell him to be extremely careful not to erase the originals until hed checked over the copies in her corner cubicle ms reygosa assured hardy that the front entrance to the bank where the video camera was mounted was the only way into and out of the building even for employees she called in her custodian and asked him to get to work copying the tapes right away but if you wanted to see when mr russo last accessed his box you should also check the signin form nobody gets inside their box without signing in even if they have their own key she shook her head no it takes two keys yours and ours and your signature the inspectors who were in on tuesday theyve already made a copy of the signin sheet would you like to see it bleary eyed feeling stupid and finessed he really was out of practice hardy told the manager that it would be nice she got up and returned a couple of minutes later it wasnt much of a formal document just an oversized page with the banks logo on the top vertical lines intersecting the signature and date lines below so that each signatory had an individual box a bank officer had a stamp which was initialed in the first box then there was the date then the signature and finally the time ms reygosa came around to peruse the sheet over hardys shoulder on the line above grahams every box had been filled in hardy couldnt make out the name ben something but hed accessed his box on which was thursday at pm a bank officer with the initials al thats alison li had signed ben in on grahams line li had initialed her stamp again but beside that there was only a signature no time or date how did this happen hardy asked what does this mean it was evidently the first time that ms reygosa had studied the document she straightened up surprising hardy by laying a hand on his shoulder and told him shed be right back while she was gone he went back to the list below graham order had once again been restored on saturday he realized at ninefifteen a pam barr had signed in in all there were eight lines below grahams through tuesday night but there were no names at all for friday he put his hands to his eyes and rubbed them wondering why nothing was easy when he looked up again ms reygosa was back with a diminutive terrified young asian woman alison the peppy friendliness had disappeared this is mr hardy and id like you to explain to him how mr russo signed in for his safe deposit box without either a time or a date hardy smiled trying to put her at ease but it didnt seem to work she stared at the sheet for what seemed an eternity i remember this i reminded him about the date and time hardy kept his voice neutral but you didnt see him write them in obviously no as you can see he didnt she threw a glance at ms reygosa stammered to hardy we stamp you know after we check the signature then go into the room with the customer with our key and the customer writes the date and time sometimes sometimes i do it but neither of you did on this occasion she indicated the sheet as you see she repeated mr russo he was in a hurry he signed and i remember i even said not to forget to put the time and he smiled like he does said hed get it on the way out hed remember but he didnt and i must have gotten busy so i guess neither did i it seemed like he was anxious to get inside like he was nervous he had a briefcase with him id be nervous too hardy thought if i were carrying around fifty thousand dollars in cash but hardy had no desire to keep crossexamining the woman he didnt want to antagonize her since if graham did go to trial which he considered all but certain he would be questioning her then do you remember what day this was ms li thursday or friday you said it was near the end of the day do you remember the time she was biting her lip thinking hard finally it seemed to come to her it was the afternoon thursday or friday though i cant be sure hardy pointed down at the signin document again do you remember if it was right after this man ben somebody came in you signed him in too at twenty minutes to five she pondered for another long moment in his desperation hardy gave her a hint no one else signed in on friday mr russo would have been the only one that day does that seem right the poor woman was on the verge of tears another glance at her boss ms reygosa didnt help alison was trying to give hardy the information he wanted give him the right answer but she didnt know exactly what it was hardy pressed further you said you thought it was the afternoon alison did it feel like it was after three oclock mr russo went to work at three on friday suddenly her face cleared and she let out the deep breath shed been all but holding for five minutes oh yes then it must have been thursday afternoon thursday im sure of it near the end of the day she pointed down at the sheet maybe we should write it in now that we know since the inspectors had already copied the original of this document hardy gently allowed as how that might not be an inspired idea they should just leave it as it was hardys errand at the bank had he thought been supremely worth it as it turned out the haight street branch did erase their tapes on a tenday cycle hardy got his copies and spent most of the rest of the afternoon watching television in his living room the front door of the bank as people came and went after getting his bearings he got so he could fastforward until someone appeared in the doorway stop the tape determine it wasnt graham and move on in this way he got through viewing three days of the most boring video hed ever watched in a little over five hours perhaps it wasnt conclusive but at least once hed seen his copies he had a good argument that graham russo hadnt entered this bank from the time of his fathers death on friday until he was arrested on wednesday morning if a jury believed this then it would indicate that graham did not kill his father to get the money he already had the money and the baseball cards before his father was dead during the same viewing period hardyd had no trouble identifying evans and lanier when theyd come in to check the safe deposit box glitsky assistant ag art drysdale and san francisco coroner john strout sat around the latters desk in his office behind the morgue all around them strouts collection of murder weapons under glass from medieval torture devices to guns and knives lent a humorous macabre air to their surroundings but the three men werent joking now between them they had assembled the foundations for hundreds of murder cases and yet their respective roles were not necessarily complementary glitsky and drysdale the cop and the prosecutor viewed themselves as true allies they found and interpreted evidence with the mutual goal of proving that a particular person had committed a crime they did different work but it was toward the same end strout on the other hand jealously guarded his independence and his objectivity he was a scientist if his discoveries helped glitsky and drysdale and they often did then so be it but he had no ax to grind he did not consider himself a lawman an officer of the court anything like that his job was to rule on cause of death speculation did not enter into it nor did politics if he didnt know he said he didnt know and vice versa at this moment behind his desk strouts normally unflappable southern style was being put to the test drysdale had decided he wanted to be sure he had strouts support in calling the homicide of sal russo a murder and hed enlisted glitsky to come down as moral support now art thats just simply not going to happen i am not about to change an opinion without different evidence and to be honest with you im just a bit offended that you thought i might but drysdale had his game face on dean powell the attorney general had told him what he wanted in the best of all worlds and if it were gettable drysdale was going to get it strouts feelings would heal youve already called it a homicide john strout was holding a hand up well thats just plum inaccurate art i did not say it was a homicide i called it a suicide equivocalhomicide which is not the same thing it means i cant say for sure that russo didnt kill himself mr powell thinks thats splitting hairs strout removed his wirerimmed spectacles well mr powell can hire himself another pathologist and get himself another opinion but hes already got mine and its stayin the way it is glitsky thought he would try to calm the waters you know art doesnt mean to insult you john hes asking if theres anywhere this can bend thats all okay it could have been suicide we accept that well thank you all to hell lieutenant glitsky ignored him but isnt there anything that militates against it makes it a little more likely somebody killed him the bump for example drysdale had studied the autopsy report carefully he had years of experience and to him it read like a murder someone had whacked sal to knock him out then administered the fatal dose of morphine it was open and shut unfortunately other scenarios were possible maybe not as probable but medically feasible it made him short tempered strout kept his glasses off but sat back in his chair elbows on its arms the bump was caused as i mentioned by a blow to the head which is not inconsistent with the deceased banging it on the table as he fell down drysdale didnt buy that at all that would have meant he fell backwards john how could he fall backwards unless somebody pushed him there was no hair on the table he didnt hit the table he got hit by the whiskey bottle strout made a gesture at glitsky who reluctantly spoke up the bump didnt even bleed art its not inconsistent that it didnt take any hair betrayed by his ally drysdale bit out the words not inconsistent not inconsistent you fellas got a tape loop going down here strout impatiently explained some more there was sufficient edema which as both of you know is swelling to allow for the flow of blood for a half hour or more he turned his palms up he was alive art the blow to the head didnt kill him i cant even say for sure it knocked him out if it did it wasnt for more than a few seconds long enough to give him the shot strout shrugged i cant say maybe drysdales face had gone red and he sat back in his chair unbuttoned his shirt pulled at his tie in his own office he let off tension by juggling baseballs but there wasnt anything to juggle here except hand grenades and he wasnt going to go grabbing at them for all he knew they were live there was a short silence broken by the screech of rubber and colliding metal on the freeway outside strouts window all the men got up to gawk the coroner raised the blinds they couldnt see the freeway through the fog and it was less than fifty yards away they all stayed standing by the window nothing had been said but the anger somehow had dissipated yall just plain arent gonna prove it couldnt have been suicide strout began ive heard you say it a hundred times abe you cant prove a negative it might be yall want to concentrate on why it could have been a homicide im listening drysdale said strout ticked off reasons on his fingers one hed never used the site before the inside of his wrist two his blood alcohol was point one oh pretty drunk hittin the vein on the first try was dang good shootin three the needle wasnt in him it was sitting on the table there isnt that right abe glitsky nodded in agreement and drysdale asked what the last fact meant it means sal russo shot himself up and remained conscious long enough to withdraw the needle except you got eight or more milligrams of morphine goin iv on top of a point one oh alcohol most people time they got the plunger all the way down theyre at least in shock the needle might fall out when consciousness went but it dont get itself put neatly back on the table the cap doesnt get itself put back on the syringe thats for damn sure drysdale chewed on it for a moment if im on a jury those three taken together thats beyond reasonable doubt i dont know strout replied true to form it might be but it dont have to be which is what i said all along the photographer had left to develop his film fearing theyd be interrupted if they stayed on edgewood graham and michael cerrone had spent the afternoon and evening at modena an upscale italian deli on clement street sharing two bottles of tenyearold gold label ruffino chianti now they were no longer strangers in seven hours cerrone felt hed captured the soul of his subject on tape cerrone had come out to california with high expectations a cover after all was not a daily occurrence even for a senior editor but the interview had exceeded his hopes by far both in scope and in human drama the story had everything russos background as a bonus athlete cut down in his prime by injury a brilliant law student a clerkship with a federal judge then chucking it all to give his dream one last try only to fail again and only in turn to have that noble effort ostracize him from the legal community and now there was the fallout from the murder charge that had been summarily dropped even his parttime employer wouldnt keep graham on but cerrone thought the personal side was even more compelling although it was nowhere on the public record he learned that privately gil soma wanted grahams head on a platter the state prosecutor had been grahams office mate at the federal courthouse graham had told him that in somas eyes he was far worse than a mere murderer he was a traitor to be hunted and brought down on the other side was the picture of a talented and sensitive hero reconciling after years with his father who then became terminally ill graham had confided to cerrone that over the past two difficult years his father had been the only person whod accepted him who loved him the only person keeping graham from being utterly alone of course hed taken care of him though he didnt admit to knowing the source of the morphine he had often given him his shots cerrone fell short of getting the coup the confession but what he had was almost better it played into his hook perfectly the issue of the week was going to be assisted suicide the agony of the decisions confronting everyone stepping through this emotional minefield cerrone would write his story so that the conclusion was obvious graham had done the right thing his father wanted to end his life but he needed support someone to hold his hand at the last moment he was afraid of being alone he would choose his own time but graham his dutiful perhaps prodigal son would help him if need be this cerrone was sure was what had happened and the beauty and pathos of it was that there was no way that graham could own up to what hed done not if he ever wanted to work again after her morning meeting with glitsky sarahs turmoil increased by the hour by sunset when she parked down the street from grahams place she was a wreck twice during the day marcel had wanted to come up here to edgewood find graham push a few of his buttons see what popped up sarah told him they ought to wait get more on him bide their time in reality she wanted to keep marcel out of it to go see graham again by herself this was dangerous on many levels she knew and unprofessional on all of them but she was going to do it anyway for the first time in her career she wasnt sure she was after the right person suddenly after last nights really meaningless discussion at the ballpark shed lost her cops simple take on graham russo hed become mostly a human being not mostly a suspect and worse he was a human being she could be attracted to was already attracted to it was wise to acknowledge that keep it in front of her she knew it was a bad situation untenable really she ought to take herself off the case her objectivity was shot but what if that apparent objectivity led her and marcel to the wrong conclusion they might for the second time arrest the wrong man a black mark on each of their careers a possible falsearrest lawsuit to say nothing of the grief to graham this is what she wanted to avoid why she wanted to see graham without her partner hovering shed talk to graham and get it clear to her own satisfaction lay this ambivalence to rest he was either a murder suspect or not she had to know for herself then she could do her job that was all it was she was just making sure taking that extra step being a good cop thats what she told herself but there was one other problem she found she couldnt shake a kind of simmering anger at graham for having put her in this position was he manipulating her or trying to who was this guy he shouldnt have come up to her at the ballpark they were enemies on opposite sides what was that all about arrogance as marcel contended or was graham simply as hed appeared a sweet guy who held nothing against the woman whod arrested him had wanted no more than to tell her that he knew she was only doing her job no hard feelings she just didnt know it was personal somehow and it shouldnt have ever gotten to there it made her mad she was going to find out who he was graham and another man stood talking out in the street in front of his place it was full dusk and the fog had thinned up here on the hill though the wind still gusted fitfully shaking fistfuls of blossoms snowlike from the trees around them sarah walked up dressed for business in a blue suit as shed been all day hello graham he turned to look at her she thought she saw something welcoming in his face though it disappeared instantly she kept moving toward him your father called you twice on friday morning what did you two talk about it tore at her heart to see something go out of grahams shoulders but he recovered quickly bringing his companion into it this is my favorite cop sergeant evans sarah mike cerrone hes a reporter the reporter put out his hand and she took it youre not with the chronicle sarah knew the locals and this guy wasnt one of them time he answered my how the word do get around in truth shed been expecting something like this the shop talk at the hall was about how big this had gotten in a hurry and now time you boys been drinking she asked to cerrone i could call you a cab here in the wild west its considered bad form to drink and drive graham had his grin back what did i tell you she is some pistol dont let her sweet looks fool you i dont think they were going to cerrone said he never took his eyes from her in fact graham had mentioned her but only in passing now it seemed to cerrone an instinct that there was something more here or might be more story an attractive female investigator coming up alone to interview him at night how bout coffee instead go inside kill an hour get sober coffee just makes you wideawake drunk i dont think im drunk nobody thinks theyre drunk thats kind of the problem hey graham said getting their attention whats with you guys i think im drunk how about that ill make coffee evans looked at him levelly if you invite me in without a warrant but graham had already turned heading for his door what a hardass he said im going in im freezing you can come or dont i dont care cerrone in a mock gallant gesture indicated evans should precede him she did nobody was in a hurry to get down to business graham had put on the coffee then some music celine dions french album cerrone hated it didnt graham have any alanis morissette evans was somehow relieved that graham didnt she didnt want to think he had that much affinity for rage in the end he put on chris isaaks baja sessions came back to the table sarah finally asked him again about his fathers phone calls on the morning of his death graham sighed wearily okay we talked twice on friday what did you talk about graham drank some of his coffee then seemed to remember something are you recording this not that it matters with mike here ive been recording all day how many tapes we go through today mike five sarah processed that then got out her own recorder the electronic age you gotta love it her face dimpled prettily thanks for reminding me she gave her introduction and asked again we talked about his pain mostly he paused and stared out at the blackness actually his voice took on a husky edge sal and me we had the same discussion twice the first one kind of went away maybe the second one too i dont know he shrugged it was one of his bad days sarah found that she had to blink this response it was one of his bad days was grahams first real reference to the daytoday fact of sals condition in her concentration on the son shed nearly forgotten the father with difficulty she found the thread and picked it up again your father called you seventeen times in the past month graham he nodded something like that i guess so what did he want you to do the huskiness remained in his voice hed obviously been drinking his defenses were down she was sure this was honest and raw emotion an open wound i dont know what he wanted that day it wasnt one thing it varied he was dying you understand hed wake up and not know where he was he was scared he needed his hand held he just wanted to talk to somebody take your pick sergeant he counted on me at the opposite end of the table cerrone was an irritant god only knew what impression this interrogation was making on him but sarah had a tipsy and emotional graham talking voluntarily the opportunity had to be taken if she was to get what she needed cerrone stared at her disapprovingly but she ignored him all right he counted on you and what did you do that day after the second call graham sipped at his coffee he put the cup down and brought his hand to his face rubbing at his jawline as though it had gone numb when he spoke his voice was flat it wasnt just a bad day it had been a terrible couple of weeks just terrible everything was going downhill the pain the forgetting all the sudden way worse than it had been i dont know what happened if the tumor affected the alzheimers somehow i dont know what it was but something had changed something was going to have to be done did you know what graham shook his head when we first got back together wed talked a little about having to put him in a home someday back then hed gotten lost a few times but the disease wasnt very advanced he was functioning pretty well i think he went to see somebody some doctor to get diagnosed but chickened out before they could run all the tests he didnt want to know for sure didnt want to face that he had it but he knew and what did he think about being in a home there was no way he wasnt going to end his life as a vegetable he made me promise id kill him first and did you do that promise that cerrone leaned forward graham the trance was broken momentarily what im sure the sergeant meant to inform you that you dont have to answer any of this that you can have your lawyer here the alcohol was a definite if subtle presence graham reached over and patted the reporter on the arm hey its cool mike its cool sarahs not here to bust me he turned to her are you their eyes met held finally sarah broke it off im just trying to get to the truth graham im trying to find out what happened you just told me you promised your dad you would kill him if graham held up a finger there was a big if and what was that if the alzheimers snuck up on him and suddenly his brain wasnt there that was when i was going to do it how i dont know i hadnt figured that yet or even if i was really going to we hadnt got there he was still functioning but then he started getting the headaches and we found out about the tumor how did you find out about that grahams eyes went to cerrone for a moment then to sarah this is starting to sound like an interrogation you know that sarah tried to bluff it were just talking graham he motioned to the tape recorder with that thing running youre telling me you wont use anything on there she shook her head no i cant tell you that so this is an official visit after all again the eyes what else would it be i dont know he said a guy can hope he paused for a longish moment sure sal went to a doctor i guess do you know who another pause longer this time graham sighed heavily and lowered his head shaking it like a tired dog you want to go off the record she considered then shook her head i cant do that im investigating your fathers death graham if you know something about it you can tell me do you know the doctor your father consulted or not grahams eyes moved to the tape recorder on the record i dont know he went alone i didnt live with him you know he had a life did he tell you how he paid for this doctor didnt you talk about money graham shrugged he told me about the cancer that they couldnt operate it was going to kill him then the whole question of putting him in a home kind of became moot he wasnt going to get old as some shell in a wheelchair he wasnt going to get old at all the simple truth of this fact struck them all dumb the cd even chose this moment to pause between cuts finally graham shrugged anyway as i said the last couple of weeks it got worse but sarah now wasnt quite ready to move on something else was eating at her the last time we talked on the record she said you didnt know what was causing your father all this pain now you did know do i have that right yeah i knew it was the cancer the tumor but you didnt tell me then bad though it sounded the rationale was obvious enough to graham i also told you we didnt see much of each other he broke a grin come on sarah i was trying to be consistent and you caught me anyway and you still say you dont know where the morphine came from thats right he pushed his chair back hey can we stop this already im going to open some more wine you want a little wine a glass of beer mike sarah declined and mike said he had to go he had a plane at an obscene hour the next morning the three of them walked to the door and graham opened it shook mikes hand told him good luck sarah hung back as mike crossed the street and started walking downhill toward his car sarah stood crammed next to graham in the doorway it seemed to her that every cell in her body was attuned to his proximity yet it also felt as though he was daring her not to move he put an arm on the doorsill just over her shoulder then put some weight on the arm all but leaning on her are you really leaving he asked her she told herself that he wasnt completely sober his inhibitions were lowered and okay he found her attractive for the moment hed forgotten that she was a cop that was all it was and she would be damned if she was going to duck away raising her head she was looking up into his eyes bad idea whether or not it betrayed her true feelings shed better blink otherwise their superficially professional relationship was about to develop an overt new element and if she thought she had troubles up to now she swung under his arm outside onto the driveway all right graham she said if youll just answer three quick questions i promise i wont bother you anymore she broke a conciliatory smile tonight then afterward youll have a glass of wine with me she shook her head i cant im on duty so go off duty he said ask your three questions then declare your workday over his eyes never left her face this time she met his gaze first i want to be clear you did in fact give your father morphine shots from time to time he nodded i said that actually he hadnt said that sarah knew but hed been speaking so freely and hed had enough to drink that she wasnt surprised that he didnt remember exactly what he had admitted but he was telling the truth now how often is that the second question she thought about it and decided it could be yeah couple of times a week if i was there he didnt like to shoot himself up okay whats the third question after the two calls on friday morning when your dad called you in great pain why didnt you go over there to help him this last hurdle didnt slow graham at all he brought his arm down off the door took a step toward her well tell you the truth thats what i did spreading his hands he grinned sheepishly and guess what he asked the old fart had gone out he wasnt even there shaken with the import of what shed heard not only had graham been at sals on friday he had often administered morphine to his father she was nearly back to her car when she stopped herself up short and swore her tape recorder was still on grahams table shed gotten up with the two guys to make sure michael cerrone of time was good and gone before she attempted to ask her halfdrunk suspect her last three questions then shed ducked outside to escape the awful chemistry asked her questions and all but run away what a fool she was it had been less than five minutes but the window slits high on the side wall had already gone dark knocking on the door she heard no sound from within maybe hed gone to sleep already passed out or more likely she thought hed had it with reporters and the police whoever it was he didnt want any she knocked again softly graham she whispered its me sarah sergeant she reminded herself she was here not as sarah but as sergeant evans after a minute she heard movement the light over her head came on when the door opened graham seemed somehow diminished his expression she felt made every attempt to welcome her but she couldnt miss the labor behind it his eyes were exhausted suddenly heavy lidded i thought you were having another glass of wine she said all of grahams glibness was gone it was as though hed fallen into a deep sleep and been rudely awakened i think im about done for today you gone off duty but the question wasnt inviting she pointed ambiguously behind him i left my recorder on your table he nodded and hit the light switch next to the door stepping back to let her pass the recorder was where she had left it still spinning she flicked it off and walked back to the door where graham had remained waiting for her outside again she hesitated one last moment looking up at him well thanks for opening for me sure anytime he said the door closed on her before she could turn away and she wasnt three steps down the street when the overhead light went out for herself she had her answer this man had loved his father there were still outstanding questions about the wrapped bills the baseball cards graham had all but admitted he knew more and would tell her if she would go off the record but she couldnt do that whatever else might be true he hadnt killed sal for his money coming up here alone had served a purpose she now believed that graham had revealed who he really was to her to sarah but sergeant evans homicide inspector realized with a pang of anguish that the cost had been dear shed helped him dig himself further into an everdeepening hole hardy was in his backyard a long and relatively narrow strip of grass bordered by frannies rose gardens on either side apartment buildings rose to four stories but directly behind to the east there was a clear view all the way to downtown also beginning in about midapril when the sun contrived to shine the path of it cut between the apartments making a warm and cozy enclosure now tending to the barbecue scraping the grill down waiting for the coals to turn hardy was nearly recharged for the new week glitsky and his young son were coming over for dinner so was frannies brother moses mcguire and his wife susan and their baby jason it was late afternoon on sunday and both the weather and the mood around the house had warmed a little from the deepfreeze late in the week and here in the backyard the house shielded most of the breeze off the ocean the other center of chill frannie came down the back stairs with a large covered tupperware container hardy watched her as she put it on the picnic table that was up against the house she stood still a moment then set her shoulders and deliberately walked the halfdozen steps over to her husband leaning into him and putting one arm around his waist whatever you decide is all right you know it doesnt matter to me as long as were in it together he brought her in to him sometimes it doesnt seem like that he said i thought you were pretty clear about no more murder cases thats what you told me you wanted remember so i got used to the idea but i dont really care it doesnt matter to me if youre a dog catcher if thats what you want to be if thats what makes you happy she moved away a step so she could look at him youre the one with all the angst dismas i know what im doing it burns you out he said the kids all the time no it doesnt well a little but so what thats not your problem its what im doing if my husband were happier life would be perfect if you were happier with the kids hardy let out a breath i love the kids fran but theres always a but dismas there shouldnt be a but its not the kids its not me or your job its your attitude she walked up and placed a quick kiss on his lips dont worry she said be happy sing the song check it out abe glitsky sat straddling the picnic bench at the table by the house he sat forward elbows on his knees his hands around a glass of iced tea hardy was lifting the lid from the kettle cooker checking the chicken youre not supposed to keep lifting the lid it wont cook right theres nothing worse than uncooked chicken hardy threw him a withering look took a pull at his beer global warming is way worse he said acid rain hemorrhoid commercials i can think of a hundred things he leveled the tongs at the grill you dont lift the lid how do you turn the chicken once glitsky said you lift it once turn the chicken put the lid back on come back in a half hour its done thats why they invented this kind of barbecue as a matter of fact brilliant scientists working around the clock to save you from the necessity of having to watch your chicken every minute thats my personality hardy said i need to watch things stay in control and a good thing i do too glitsky stood up and walked over you could turn them now for example they look about done on the bottom then you could sit down and enjoy your beer without interruption hardy took a minute poking and jabbing then started turning the pieces im not doing this because you said so independently they look done to me too half done glitsky corrected hardy took his beer back over to the bench and sat down okay now im enjoying my beer without interruption by the way what do you hear about graham russo by the way huh a nod at your very own suggestion i sit myself down to take a moment of leisure and what should pop into my brain unaided but the thought of my client glitsky took a seat at the other end of the bench straddling it again and here i allowed myself to hope that your wife had invited me over again because she enjoyed my company so much last time maybe that too hardy said mysterious as that may be to the rest of us but while youre here while im here seriously im not talking about it hardy had heard this kind of denial before in a dozen different guises and usually it went away of its own accord he wouldnt have to push his friend would get around to telling him off the record or he wouldnt hardy brought his bottle to his mouth started to get up to check the chicken again caught himself and sat back down so how about them giants but the lieutenant was shaking his head i dont think i can tell you anything this time diz there is some serious juice around this one powell glitsky shrugged hardy didnt even have to ask he knew powell had decided to prosecute the case the question was when but he wasnt going to get that by asking directly did you know about the wife hardy asked or did you read about it in the paper in this mornings paper a reporter had discovered from reading recent police incident reports that leland and helen taylor had summoned the authorities to the seacliff palace known as the manor three times in the past six weeks the first two times it seems sal russo had come by and knocked on the door when helen had opened it hed simply walked in making himself at home helens home was his home wasnt it wasnt she his wife helping himself to whiskey becoming verbally abusive refusing to leave the third time sal had let himself in through an open servants entrance in the back helped himself again to a couple of drinks gone upstairs to where helen was napping and lain down next to and begun fondling her demanding his conjugal rights in each case police had taken sal to a local mentalhealth facility and booked him as a danger to himself and others the third time he was held for two hours and released the first two times he hadnt stayed that long glitsky nodded yeah we heard about that on saturday and you were looking into it as a possible motive for sals murder get another suspect in the loop nice try no comment sal russo waited patiently on one of the plastic yellow chairs in the sunlight that streamed through the lobby door of the social welfare detention center he had graham coming down in a couple of minutes to take him back home hed surprised this social worker here don not only did the old man know who he was he knew his sons telephone number hey sal don called to him he opened his eyes what you want to tell me why you keep breaking into your old house don thought he could trick sal into giving an answer that would incriminate himself so they could maybe send him to jail but sal knew his game don wasnt fooling him sometimes i miss my wife that a crime except she s not your wife anymore we said till death do us part i remember that clear enough sonny im trying to get her back still maybe it upsets her family now dont you think you do it again they might try to lock you up helen wouldnt lock me up dont you worry about it what i got on her she wouldnt dare he closed his eyes and faced the sun for another minute a peaceful look settling over his features she wasnt always little miss proper you know we had ourselves some times i reminded her today got her upset i think she doesnt want anybody to know sal suddenly brought his hand up and squeezed at his temples you all right don asked damn headache im fine we used to smoke a little dope you know a few lines of cocaine once or twice you think her leland wants to hear about that i dont think so you think leland knows she got arrested for shoplifting that time you think that might bother him her lelands a little too uptight to handle that news isnt he don chuckled and your wife had me thinking she didnt file a complaint because she didnt want to cause troubles for a harmless old man you were blackmailing her werent you youre not harmless at all are you sal smiled not even a little he said hardy got a better idea of the way the wind was blowing during dinner it was still light outside and the five adults were eating in the dining room while the kids ate their drumsticks in front of the video susan weiss was mcguires wife a cellist with the symphony although shed been on strike for a while now she had an artistic temperament and spoke her mind freely she knew all about the troubles with glitskys wife flo that she had died a couple of years before after a prolonged battle with cancer she couldnt understand how a man even a cop whod been through that experience could be opposed to ending the suffering of someone else who was in the same place im not glitsky put the evil eye on hardy as though his friend had somehow prompted susan then did his best to answer her his voice under tight control even if im a cop im not opposed to the idea of assisted suicide but i think it ought to be more private much more private than than what we are seeing sometimes what do you mean private i mean between the involved parties and no one else private how about doctorassisted suicide kevorkian all these guys i hear half the doctors in the city do it all the time and this means well if youre going after sal russos kid shouldnt you also be going after these doctors isnt it the same thing glitsky appeared to be having trouble swallowing he was the only adult at the table drinking water and now he took his glass and drank from it no its not hows it different cornered glitsky let out a quick breath its different because somebody killed sal russo murdered him and not out of mercy i dont think so hardy said seated between his wife and his sister moses mcguire had been relatively quiet throughout the meal an irish brawler a doctor of philosophy turned bartender moses usually tended to be a presence but hed sat without comment on this discussion up to now drinking steadily from his glass of scotch mcguire knew that glitsky and hardy were friends moses also considered himself hardys best friend this did not mean that glitsky and mcguire were especially close now mcguire laid a proprietary hand on his wifes arm didnt the dead guy sal didnt he have cancer glitsky nodded again yeah inoperable from what i hear right susan popped in so how can you write off the idea that somebody helped him kill himself that thats what he wanted we dont just write it off susan glitsky was still striving for the patient tone we collect evidence see what it looks like go from there but mcguire was now warming to the argument or from the scotch one of the two youre going to have to go a hell of a long way from there to get around the fact that the guy was dying in a couple of weeks anyway why in the world would somebody want to kill him frannie joined in answering for the lieutenant abes going to say it was money graham had a lot of his dads money fifty thousand dollars so what susan said that means he killed him no abe replied it means he might have thats all were looking at hardy spoke up the reason he had the money was in case his dad had to go into a home though he knew grahams story about the children of joan singleterry he wasnt at all certain that he believed it in any case he didnt want to muddy the waters and hed come up with his own theory over the past day or two he thought it had a more credible ring his dad had it in a safe under his bed and graham didnt think that was the most brilliant idea glitsky turned to hardy he tell you that he didnt have to i wonder why didnt he tell us abe frannie put down her fork we dont mean to pick on you but this just doesnt make sense susans right this kind of thing is happening every day why are you going after this boy glitsky clipped it out because he lied about everything we asked him lying makes us lawenforcement types suspicious but it was all of a piece abe hardy the voice of reason grahams already blackballed for legal work in town he was afraid hed lose his bar card if it came out he helped kill his dad even with the best of intentions frannie picked it up so he made up the story that he and his dad didnt see each other he didnt think you guys would look so hard so it sounds like he didnt lie a lot susan joined the chorus he just told one lie and then had to make up a bunch of other stuff to support that one a ghost of a smile flickering around his mouth glitsky sat back and crossed his arms just bad luck we happened to catch him at the big one huh he came forward and picked up his fork maybe its just me but does anybody else think its funny that he still had the money after his father was dead then kind of forgot to tell his family about it maybe he was going to susan said maybe he just didnt have time yet you arrested him so fast maybe more bad luck glitskys voice dripped with sarcasm graham russo he said the original badluck kid playing up front in mixed doubles and standing too close to the net mario giotti didnt even see the vicious forehand his opponent launched at his head one second he was on his toes poised for a volley following the flight of the ball his wife had just returned and the next moment he was on the ground flat on his back the wind knocked out of him conscious only of pain sunday evening and they were playing indoors at the mountain view racquet club located on the crest of the escarpment in pacific heights where divisadero street began its cascade down from broadway to lombard eight hundred vertical feet in six blocks the judge was aware of people gathered over him then his head on his wifes thigh someone brought over a white towel then another one wet and cool he had an impression of blood blotches of red on white in his vision the brassy taste in the back of his throat pat was taking control as she always did after satisfying herself that it was true she assured one and all that giotti was fine she came down close and whispered into his ear its all right she assured him youre okay she wiped the wet towel over his face again gently then they were up he and pat walking together the judge held the stained wet towel to his face aware of the stares of the other patrons their opponents another couple a decade younger than they were tagged along extras without any role a few steps behind them giotti felt the sturdiness of his wifes shoulders the weight they could bear just lean on me she said he noticed some streaks of red on her short tennis skirt by the time they got to the juice bar his breath was returning he felt sure that his nose was broken but the pressure hed applied with the towel seemed to have stanched the flow of blood the other couple joe and dana insisted on buying something and pat ordered large bottles of water for them both they went off together stricken and solemn giotti watched after them whats he think were in the goddamn french open this is supposed to be a friendly little workout and we get agassi and evert what is this shit shh pat put a hand on his knee leaning in toward him whispering somebody might hear mario let em he snapped back at her but his eyes following hers surveyed the nearby tables no one was within earshot he turned back to her this public court nonsense they should have installed one at the courthouse you know your opponents they know you you can be civilized the judge worked and had his chambers in the newly redone us courthouse the building that had gone unnoticed by lanier and evans two days before the recent renovation over eight years and at a cost of nearly million had restored the building to its original opulence and that was saying something nicknamed the federal palace it was widely considered after the library of congress to be the most beautiful government building in the united states the palace had originally been built by italian artisans completed just in time for san franciscos great earthquake of it had miraculously survived that catastrophe because the postal clerks who worked in the new building at the time had refused to leave choosing instead to fight the fires that threatened it now the elegant interior of the place marble walls and frescoed ceilings had a modern infrastructure it was newly wired for computer terminals in nearly every room over the objections of many of the judges including giotti who felt that the courts should be open and accessible to the people without hindrance security was tight video cameras hovered at each entrance with a bank of television screens overseen by uniformed deputies at a central command post by the front doors downstairs a private indoor parking area for the judges led to an equally private workout room and gym for the staff but no tennis courts for which giotti had lobbied strenuously according to the experts there hadnt been room this was an opportunity for the judge to remember it and he continued raving at his wife although quietly to be sure we should join a private club no we cant do that mario weve discussed it lets leave that now no i dont agree her eyes narrowed in resolve and her fingers tightened on his leg just above his knee a warning pat was a powerhouse physically strong and mentally tough the monitor of the judges behavior outside of the court the guardian of his precious reputation he rarely disagreed with her judgment in these areas but today he did people can be discreet he said we dont need to make friends have private dinners but the class of people dont use that word please a frustrated expression you know what i mean and i also know we cant refer to it ever so giotti went back to his original complaint a hundred million dollars and they couldnt figure out a way to put a court in the basement i solve more difficult problems three times a week fucking bureaucrats pat was by now reassured that her husband couldnt be heard but his profanity when angry still was a source of frustration her fingers tightened around giottis leg again it made her crazy he didnt seem to realize who he was sometimes or more truthfully he seemed to want to forget that a federal judge was not an ordinary citizen all of them breathed rarefied air and were accountable on a different level and her husband particularly a centrist democrat had to be ever vigilant there were rumors that he was in line for the supreme court at the next vacancy surely hed earned it the lifetime of sagacious decisions published majority opinions brilliant dissents the millions of travel miles as he flew the circuit the sacrifice of abandoning all their old friends all of the citys rich social life on the altar of judicial purity but that last wasnt unique to the giottis to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest and because of the awesome responsibility of the issues they must daily decide most if not all federal judges wound up cutting off their preappointment relationships both business and personal that was part and parcel of the life of the federal judge and those who didnt know it at their appointment soon found out sometimes to their great dismay and disappointment even despair they couldnt have friendships in the usual meaning of the word it wasnt so much that people couldnt be trusted no it was more that if he served long enough and the job was a lifetime appointment sooner or later a federal judge would be called upon to make a decision that would impact nearly everyone he had ever known a casual friendship an innocent prejudice a personal comment an inappropriate liaison too great an attachment even to a son or a daughter or a wife any of these could sully the sacred objectivity of the law pat giotti knew that this was why all the federal judges were such a family and in that artificial and ethereal family where there were few real friendships and little outside influence reputation was all of course she knew marios profanity wasnt going to lose him his job but it might lower the judge in the eyes of even one citizen and pat giotti bred to the culture of the ninth circuit would not abide that she too had made great sacrifices to further her husbands career her own friendships her fun the intimacy of their four children her youth sometimes she thought in her dark moments her very life but these thoughts passed they couldnt be allowed it had all been worth it mario giotti was a federal judge now he was someday with luck going to the supreme court perhaps as its chief justice the culmination of their every dream the goal for which they had never ceased laboring together the couple had come back and the man was blathering on im just so sorry joe was saying i get too competitive i shouldnt have dont be silly pat interrupted spirit of the game you dont play if you dont want to win isnt that right mario the judge pulled the towel down from the bridge of his nose his eyes were mild the smile benign its one of the absolute truths joe he took a long sip of the bottled water then dont worry about me im fine couldve happened to anybody helen taylor reclined in the oversized marble bathtub soaking in scented oils the disastrous meeting with graham on friday night had exhausted the family after her children had gone she and leland went out to a late supper at the ritzcarlton and afterward keeping the unpleasantness at bay theyd danced at the top of the mark the rest of the weekend had been given over to society events theyd had no private time to talk until now leland knocked at the bathroom door and she told him to come in which he did taking a seat in the brocaded wing chair that graced the wall opposite the bath crossing one leg over the other he leaned back enjoying the sight of his wife in the water he was wearing the pants to one of his savile row suits a white shirt and dark blue tie black shoes black socks with garters inhaling through his nose he seemed to have suddenly encountered an off scent his voice had a reedy tone highly pitched and phlegmy i suppose were going to have to pay for grahams defense arent we helen took a moment before answering i keep hoping theyre not going to arrest him again no leland was certain its a matter of time but they will i wouldnt squander my hope there his wife sighed and moved the water lapped gently once or twice then i suppose we must pay his attorneys i mean i know he cant the phantom scent wasnt getting any better leland held his chin high turning his head from one side to the other as if trying to place it well have to keep it from george he paused perhaps it should be a loan this time a real loan through the bank if its through the bank it would be impossible to keep from george her husband was shaking his head no i was thinking of a personal loan we could but another thought had crowded in and helen interrupted you dont really think hell go to jail do you i dont know helen if he did kill his father for the money graham couldnt have done that leland its impossible thats not who he is he might have helped him die but it wasnt for money her husband raised his eyebrows a parlor trick of impressive eloquence he lived in a world entirely circumscribed by money and believed that to a substantial degree everything was connected to it but there was no need to make this point to his wife and he moved along im thinking though back to the loan now that if he doesnt get convicted we might be able to get some reasonable behavior out of the boy at least until the debt was retired but if he does get convicted i mean i suppose then hell have rather a more difficult time paying us back leland seemed to savor the thought but that isnt really the issue when we paid for his law school a mistake as it turns out maybe it wont turn out to be eventually but there was no sign he heard her law school if you recall supposedly wasnt the money either he held a palm up to forestall any interruption im only saying that if it had been a loan instead of a gift with no strings if hed felt the monthly burden of paying off a debt he might have thought twice about quitting his job no he wouldnt have he thought hed be stepping up playing in the major leagues making multiples of his clerks salary at the court that was the whole problem he probably wouldnt take a loan anyway knowing he couldnt guarantee paying it back so whats this attorney of his working for helen shifted again sitting up slipping the net from her hair she shook it out and it fell gleaming dyed but gleaming to her shoulders her breasts were buoyant at the waters surface i dont know advertising maybe i imagine therell be a lot of publicity of course there always is from lelands expression the bad smell was back well therell be time to decide this assistedsuicide angle looks promising perhaps a jury will clear him on that score but that would still ruin him his mother said he couldnt ever work in the law again and i do think that eventually he intended to do just that dont entertain these false hopes helen hes out of the law thats already come to pass he uncrossed his legs and came forward in the chair a great deal more urgency in his body language he cleared his throat his voice taking on a deeper pitch now i must tell you i am worried about george yes she said simply her younger sons reaction to graham had been wildly disproportionate as well as out of character if george had any trademark it was generally his lack of emotion not his susceptibility to it that really wasnt like him i wondered if hed talked to you her pretty face held a thoughtful frown about what that friday anything that might have happened that friday she shook her head no not to me because you know he wasnt at the bank her eyes narrowed apparently this was news to her she slid back down slightly into the comforting water when wasnt he at the bank leland stroked his upper lip i dont have it precisely fixed but it seems between about eleven and two did you ask him i did but you know george he said he must have been at a clients he couldnt remember exactly if it was important hed doublecheck but he hasnt gotten back to me i wondered if hed mentioned anything to you no nothing leland honestly nothing she let out a sigh watching as her husband resumed his old posture his back rigid against the wing chair one leg crossed over the other you dont think he went to see his father im afraid i think its quite possible i dont like to think it but its almost as though i see it happening helen shook her head we shouldnt have had him come over when sal was here that last time but leland brushed that off well what we should or shouldnt have done is beside the point now he did come and in this one area protecting you from sal i know i think it was just he never got over the hurt he continued to believe that anyone who could inflict such pain couldnt be harmless maybe at base sal wasnt harmless after all no she was certain he was she reached a hand out over the marble and her husband took it he wasnt like you leland he really was a simple person he wouldnt ever have hurt me he was sick and confused thats all the tableau froze for a long moment at last the bankers eyes came back into focus i just wonder if george realized that that wed taken steps maybe if we had in fact filed charges but helen was firm there was no need leland we did inform the social agencies they would be getting around to him this wasnt a continual stalking just an episode several actually three only three but the point is that there wasnt really any urgency and these things always take time there was no further danger in fact there hadnt been any danger all along sal would just flip into the past i know george realized that i hope so leland said but im not at all so sure on monday morning early hardy was in his office with michelle one of them on either end of the couch folders and copies of briefs on the low table in front of them you know where we get the term straight from the horses mouth michelle looked up from some paper shed been reading as though hardy had broken into sanskrit it relates it relates small talk wasnt michelles long suit but she had already learned that this was how her new boss liked to break up his work so she sat back and listened no this is important were talking one of the major philosophical questions that plagued the early middle ages right up there with how many angels can dance on the head of a pin what was how many teeth a horse had youre kidding me hardy was having a difficult time believing that michelle with the possible exception of david freeman the most highly developed brain in the office was ignorant of this fact but then hed seen enough intellectual myopia that it didnt shock him anymore here in the age of specialization if you held a double major in law and accounting you werent expected to master any context any history that was irrelevant junk for the most part but hardy thought it wouldnt kill her to know an oddball fact or two that wasnt strictly related to the case at hand im not kidding they argued about it all the time who would argue about that philosophers and theologians most of whom i think would have been lawyers in todays world so why didnt they just count them she made a face at him wondering if he was teasing her are you making this up no i swear im not its true okay michelle you got the right answer but youre ahead of my story listen these guys would sit around the old monastery convinced that there was a platonic ideal number of teeth in the perfect horse they evidently debated this thorny problem for decades these were not rocket scientists michelle said hardy wondered if she realized they were talking about a time before there were rockets or scientists for that matter no but these were intelligent men no women i doubt it id be surprised this was a guy thing no wonder michelle said well anyway hardy continued one day a monk who was far ahead of his time decided on the revolutionary approach of going out finding a horse and counting the teeth in its mouth and that settled it well not exactly i gather it took maybe a hundred years or so before everybody agreed that this was an acceptable way to get an answer to a question like this anyway he pressed on in the face of michelles sublime tolerance thats where we get the expression great she said dryly thats fascinating really the judge in the tryptech case had just taken on the modern role of the monk whod counted all those teeth first thing this morning michelle had called hardy at home with the news that they had been served with a crosscomplaint the port of oakland had evidently decided to press the charge that tryptech had overloaded their container further a judge had decided that tryptech had the burden of proof as to how many computers were actally in the container an affidavit from some shipping guy wasnt going to do it tryptech through hardy had been making the argument that the container hadnt been overloaded he had presented the bill of lading which in theory proved the actual number of computers inside the container additionally the computers were insured and therefore it would obviously be counterproductive for the company to claim fewer than had actually been there since they were being paid for every one that had been lost of course hardy knew it wouldnt take a genius to realize that the monetary difference between say two hundred extra computers at a thousand dollars each and the millions the company stood to lose if the port of oakland won the lawsuit was fabulously insignificant now the thing would have to be lifted from the bottom of the bay so that the computers within could be counted but pulling up the container would cost a bundle and their client had told them he didnt have a bundle on hand in cash just now the name of the game was delay and hardy had been successful in putting off this problem for nearly five months however now that the judge had decided it was going to happen the dredging fee of one hundred and sixtyfive thousand dollars might not be unreasonable in light of the potential size of the damage award but brunei was saying it was blood from a turnip hardy didnt know how he could delay any longer tryptech would have to figure out some way to come up with the money actually michelle was more comfortable now that they were back to business i see a way that we can use this to our advantage we should be able to string this along for a while okay hit me hardy said take it out to bid well of course comply with the ruling but unless the port wants to take on some no all of the expense i think we can argue that its only fair that we solicit bids from competing dredging firms get the best possible price who could argue with that hardy had to admire her say what he would about the values of his own classical training he had to admit that in the here and now michelle was a godsend competing bids would buy them another few months at least and anything could happen in a couple of months maybe hardy fantasized he could convince brunei to hire a team of scuba divers to locate the container in deep secrecy by night and put in some extra units the presence of which brunei continued to assert how would you like to handle the details he asked her she had already gathered the paperwork and put it atop the stack of briefs they still had to discuss thats what im here for before the horses mouth issue had intervened the morning routine at home had been anything but todays drama was the mystery of how every toothbrush in the house had disappeared upon some pretty hefty crossexamination rebecca and vincent had confessed that maybe they remembered that yesterday orel glitsky might have thought of another use for them and theyd played some game in the backyard or mostly in the backyard they thought there were fences and forts involved and jason their little nephew and hes still a baby dad rebecca reminded him had played with the toothbrushes too but both of his kids were sure they were positive that if somehow they had taken all the toothbrushes which wasnt very likely but if they had then they had put them back right afterward after finishing up the mornings strategyandreview session with michelle hed walked three blocks in the breezy forenoon and picked up half a dozen fresh bao sticky buns filled with hoisin and plum and barbecued sauces and stuffed with various roasted meats pork chicken duck all by itself he thought the ready availability of hotoutoftheoven bao was reason enough to live in san francisco he was in the greenhouse solarium alone the bao a stillfragrant and comforting memory the morning chronicle open on the table in front of him he hadnt forgotten anything about his talk last night with abe glitsky maybe glitsky had stolen the toothbrushes aha that was it even if it wasnt he could accuse him of it and have some fun it had become pretty clear in the talk at the table that glitsky thought sal had been killed and more that graham had murdered him and if that was the case then glitsky knew more than hardy did he scanned the paper but there was nothing particularly new and exciting there the weekend hadnt provided any startling revelations even da pratt and ag powell had maintained what one article called a wary silence thirtyone doctors took out a fullpage advertisement announcing that they had helped patients kill themselves but this hardy knew wasnt going to have any direct impact on the graham russo case so what did glitsky know pulling the tenbutton conferenceroom phone over to him he started to call the homicide detail but hung up if the lieutenant hadnt talked to him sixteen hours ago he wasnt going to start now nothing had changed on that front suddenly that old horses mouth yawed open before him again idiot he said to himself shaking his head a miracle graham was home and picked up his telephone but the first words out of his mouth that hed spent more time chatting with sarah evans cut short hardys happiness that hed reached his client youre making this up arent you graham he said please tell me youre making this up no im not it was really good it was really good hardy repeated thats nice im happy for you it wasnt like what youre thinking graham protested hardy could picture him sitting framed in his splendid back window looking out over the city having a cup of his terrific kona coffee perhaps savoring a fresh croissant bought with who knows what money maybe hardy thought living up there in fairytale land colored ones view of the rest of the world in any case graham was in serious need of a reality check what wasnt it like you tell me how it could be different from what im thinking even in the best of all worlds what other interpretation could there possibly be if sarah was going to arrest me diz she would have done it already she just wanted to know were talking sergeant evans of the homicide detail is that right suddenly shes sarah now are you guys going out together staying in what it would help if i knew nothing diz nothing like that she just wanted to know the truth right and the time guy what about him he was a good guy hardy could envision the shrug the nonchalance he knew he was getting geared up here and he didnt think it would hurt his client any to realize it graham its this reporters job to be a good guy and get you to like him so youll open up and tell him the story he needs to write its not personal no graham was convinced this was different really it was great to get to lay some of it out finally hardy had both of his elbows on the table the receiver cradled against one ear his head held up with the other one there wasnt any sense in going further with this it was time to shift to damage control if that was going to be possible he forced some modulation into his voice so what did you tell your friend sarah this time i hope parts of it were close to the last version he heard an amused chuckle its just the obvious stuff nothing to worry about obvious you know i dont really why dont you humor me well the truth about my dad and me i mean of course i helped him out once it was clear that wed kind of patched things up the rest of it just followed what rest though thats what im trying to get at a pause that id given him morphine a bunch of times but not that day he added you told sergeant evans that yeah another hesitation longer and that id gone by there on friday by sals but he hadnt been home at almost precisely the same moment state attorney general dean powell was reaching his own decision hed quietly come down from sacramento early in the morning and spent the morning with drysdale and gil soma now they were finishing their lunch at a back table in jacks one of the citys finest and oldest restaurants an elderly waiter in a tuxedo was pouring coffee all round the white linen had been cleared of crumbs powell originally hailed from san francisco before his election hed been a senior attorney in the das office his habit of combing his long white hair with his fingers had been the subject of dozens of caricatures and he was doing this as he spoke to soma i think were close to settled on the basics but i must confess gil ive got a reservation or two about your involvement you ever put on a murder trial before powell of course knew the answer to this he was impressed with somas credentials and more his passion but if the young man couldnt stand up to the pressure of his bosss informal interrogation now hed melt in the crucible of a specialcircumstancescase courtroom better to find out sooner soma brought a napkin to his lips but didnt waste any time with the motion he wasnt stalling no sir but i can win this case as a murder one it is a murder one this mornings police reports lock that up this wasnt any assisted suicide powell nodded i buy that gil its critical though that we have the right man he leaned over the table combed his hair back again then pointed a finger at soma you hate this graham russo dont you its personal isnt it soma glanced over at his mentor art drysdale who was stirring his coffee no help there i dont like him sir thats true and youre sure youre not seeing what you want to see here youve thought about this a lot now soma did reach for his coffee powell thought this a wellrehearsed move the question appeared to call for thought and even if soma had considered every possible ramification of it he would take a formulaic pause placing the cup carefully into the center of its saucer soma brought in drysdale for a beat then proceeded the original case the das here in the city had several holes the money alone wasnt really enough and we knew that which was why we waited since then weve discovered that there was a fight that graham russo was there hes admitted it drysdale finally spoke up thats a little squirrely but soma didnt think so its evidently not on the tape but glitsky guarantees weve got evanss testimony shell swear to it then were back to he said but she said powell interrupted art play devils advocate a little later i want to hear what weve got altogether he gestured back to soma okay weve got the fight we put graham there weve got the morphine plus syringes from a box traced to his ambulance company we got a fistful of his lies on the record weve got his financial position which is horrible and which leads us back to the money weve got means opportunity and motive its classic sir he did it and we can prove it on somas left drysdale cleared his throat he wanted in art powell asked i agree with everything gils said here but if were talking specials we are powell was solid with this decision okay then the options weve got are lwop this was life in prison without the possibility of parole or death gil youre telling me youre comfortable asking the state to put your old office mate to death this finally stopped the posturing some of somas spark went away i dont know he said taking in both of his superiors to be honest i dont think so i dont think we should ask for death powell nodded this was the right answer soma was passionate but not blinded by hatred a critical distinction i wouldnt either drysdale said but we might wave it around early on see if something shakes loose soma shrugged i can do that and no other suspects real imagined implied powell wasnt getting into this without having it locked up he hadnt gotten where he was by going high profile and losing drysdale passed the question over to soma with a look were still checking some of his fisherman contacts he poached for a living but the volumes are tiny a hundred two hundred bucks i dont see anyone killing him for it the family drysdale prompted oh yeah sal the victim he broke into the family house three times in the past few months nobody seemed to get too upset though they didnt file criminal charges just wanted to help him get some assistance okay powell was thinking the loopholes are closing up and it was definitely not a suicide i dont want to have that come back and bite us drydale took this one i dont think theyll even make the argument but strouts got some pretty good stuff for us nobody thinks sal killed himself that didnt happen a silence descended for a moment powell raised his eyes dismas hardys doing the defense yes sir soma knew the story as well as he knew his name three years before in the last major case powell had prosecuted before moving to the state capital dismas hardy had pulled a rabbit from a hat and beaten him after a jury had both convicted his suspect and sentenced her to death it was no secret that the ag longed for payback all right powell said at last lets go get him drysdale tapped the table with a fingertip getting their attention one last time i suggest with all respect dean it might be wiser to wait another couple of days grahams not going anywhere make it fat this was jargon from powells earliest days with the da fat was the acronym theyd all used back then for making a watertight case frogsass tight fat powell gave it another seconds thought then nodded all right he said thats probably smart but lets tie this sucker down by thursday friday at the latest he was looking directly at soma and the young attorney simply nodded done he said hed been the head of homicide now for nearly two years and glitsky felt he was growing into the job taking bold steps to improve conditions and performance this morning for example after hed trotted down to vice again with lanier and evans so they could enjoy the privacy of an office with a door hed come back to homicide and pulled a tape measure from one of the drawers in his desk after carefully measuring the size of the hole in his wall where the door should have been in fact used to be until it was removed one day for painting and never returned he called a local hardware store and found that doors were not some kind of embargoed item the salesperson to whom hed spoken had seemed somewhat amused that glitksy didnt realize that doors were available on a regular basis almost anywhere upon reflection the lieutenant realized that he should have known this from his own life but he also knew that when you worked in a bureaucracy simple tasks had a way of becoming herculean difficult tasks impossible hed filled out four requisition forms from building maintenance requesting a new door and in two years hadnt yet gotten even one answer eventually hed come to accept that a new door wasnt ever going to appear and then suddenly the bolt of inspiration had struck him this morning he could just order his own door take up a collection among his inspectors the salesperson assured him he could have the door installed by friday painted fitted hung miraculous now it was midafternoon and lanier and evans were back it was glitskys second meeting with them today the first one down behind the closed door in vice had been to bring the lieutenant up to date with a recap of their weekends activities at this confab hed learned of the apparent fight in sals apartment he was also pleased with evanss discoveries about graham russo the morphine the visit to sals on the day of the murder he wasnt so thrilled about her technical blunder with the tape recorder but what could he do that first meeting had been to prepare glitsky for his nine oclock with drysdale whod be passing along all of his information to dean powell evidently that meeting had gone fairly well because after lunch drysdale had called again powell had been disposed to proceed immediately with the arrest of graham russo drysdale said but he had convinced the attorney general that a few more days might be productive might lock the case up fat he gave glitsky some marching orders and now the second meeting the lieutenant planned to pass these along to the troops gil soma had been sent along drysdale probably trying to make the new kid feel part of a team they were all crammed in glitskys office the lieutenant at his desk soma in the doorway evans stood at ease behind one of the chairs facing his desk lanier was more relaxed propped on the corner of the desk cracking and eating peanuts dropping the shells in the wastebasket mostly but first glitsky was killing a couple of minutes loosening up the audience crowing in his lowkey way about his proactive move regarding the door he had just finished outlining his bureaucracy theory and it rang a bell with lanier reminds me of one time back when i walked a beat they were having this trade show at the holiday inn i think one of those hotels anyway guys in one of the booths were just freaking out couldnt get all these logos and lights and stuff to go on so they called us cops over right i take a look and theres this plug on the ground and i ask em this the plug and they say yeah but the union rep came by and told us not to touch it so i give em the look plug the sucker in the place lights up like a christmas tree i give em my badge number tell them if anybody asks they didnt touch it have a nice day thats perfect glitsky said exactly what i mean you think the door might really be in here by friday i dont know what this office will feel like its been so long against the back wall evans coughed politely are we going back down to vice she asked glitsky caught her drift okay youre right its probably not as fascinating to you all as it is to me he straightened up in his chair no i think well stay here he included the young attorney this okay with you gil theres nothing to hide about this the two inspectors glanced at each other about what lanier asked about what gil glitsky repeated soma was pumped up from his personal meeting with the attorney general his tailored dark suit seemed to hang like a tent on a thin frame glitsky had sat down because he didnt want to tower over soma but what the young man lacked in physique he made up for in intensity nodding at the lieutenant he began the ag likes everything youve both done up to now weve got plenty of evidence to convict but for the next few days he thinks a change of emphasis might be productive to what lanier asked to everybody but graham russo a moment of silence lanier cracked a peanut but graham did it soma nodded i know that but dean powell wants to turn over a few more rocks thats all youve both undoubtedly noticed this ones a political bomb we want to head off any accusation that were going after graham for politics show that theres no rush to judgment he altered his tone lightening it he just wants to make sure glitsky leaned back and his chair creaked lanier swung his leg and his heel kept knocking into glitskys desk bump bump bump deep and hollow sounding these interviews soma went on do you tape all of them lanier threw a glance at glitsky who was silent sitting back arms crossed listening maybe we should have gone to vice lanier said evans moved forward the young attorney had moved more into the room and had lowered his voice she didnt want to miss anything why would we need to go to vice she asked but her partner was a veteran cop he knew what was coming and didnt wait for soma before he butted in you dont want us to create any paper is that what youre saying the young attorney nodded that would probably be more convenient what are you guys talking about with a nod soma tossed it back to lanier discovery okay evans said i give up what about discovery the prosecutions got to give everything to the defense right everything they get so if we go finding alternative suspects and reasonable evidence guess what the defense gets to bring them all up in front of the jury so they can make up their mind essentially soma added mr powell doesnt want us to help the defense by providing them with other suspects a jury might get confused about so you talk to these people what people though a shrug the rest of the family where sal got his fish who got him the morphine if it wasnt graham like that lanier but we dont run tape we dont take notes soma right basically you tell us what you find but you dont create discovery and as an extra special treat lanier added to sarah you didnt hear it here sarah all but glared at the inscrutable glitsky hoping that hed speak up he didnt but soma stopped her except of course if someone really starts to look like a suspect he added hastily but if you think youve got something talk to us before you write it up silence we wouldnt want to create false impressions he trailed off lamely in the small room sarah again became aware of the bump of her partners heel he cracked another peanut she moved around and sat in the chair in front of her lieutenants desk this type of discussion was all new to her and it wasnt settling well soma and lanier must have realized it as a glance passed between them and lanier took the ball i think mr somas just talking about the preliminary interviews sarah we get anything that sets off a charge we come back and do the souptonuts version is that it but you wont soma said because graham did it right right lanier was with the program ready to be rolling again you just want to avoid making a case for the defense we got it sarah wanted to make it crystal clear but we are in fact looking for another suspect isnt that true absolutely soma said if somebody jumps up at you we put graham on hold and go after the new guy but there isnt going to be any new guy look sergeant you and your partner here found graham out of a universe of potentials right right so hes the man this is just some cya for the ag were beating the bushes backfilling making sure we havent missed a bet any righteous evidence i promise you we cough it up sarah obviously still didnt like it and soma moved to cut her off were not subverting anything here were not asking you to finally glitskys chair squeaked again he came forward the scar white through his lips a pulse visible at his temple all eyes went to him im going to pretend i didnt hear any of this he whispered he turned his wrathful gaze to soma i dont know how you boys do things in other jurisdictions but this department writes up everything thats our job we find what there is to find all of it soma had blanched i didnt mean his voice still low and taut glitsky sounded meaner than he looked and evans thought that was a physical impossibility i know what you meant i heard you all the way out and im telling the sergeants here that they are going to do it by the book every time everybody we talk to that covers our ass it covers your ass everybody stays clean he shook his head calming down by degrees still at soma listen what do you think happens if some defense attorney notices we havent interviewed anybody except the suspect you think this might raise an eyebrow somewhere what if they find we talked to somebody and forgot to tell them think thats a problem i do ive seen it happen no our position is that if theres anybody else to look for were looking for them we dont find em theres no other leads thats why the case is strong he met the eyes of all three of them one at time slowly just so were clear everybody on the same bus here nods all around in under a minute theyd all filed out he decided then and there he would pay out of his own pocket if he had to for a door to close behind them after his inspectors had gone glitsky was drinking a cup of tea filling out a requisition form for the door that he decided would be his first offensive sally stamping urgent in red ink on the slip he put his tea down and was taking the slip outside to post in the building mail when he ran into dismas hardy in the hallway coming down in his direction all right hardy said anger all over him what did you do with them what my toothbrushes thats what every single toothbrush in my whole house what did i do with your toothbrushes right they were there yesterday when you came over this morning they were gone ruined my placid morning upset my domestic tranquillity which is explicitly guaranteed by the constitution the preamble right up in the front there after we the people glitsky stood still for a moment then he nodded said excuse me and went to post his requisition slip when he came back into his office his friend had settled himself down at his desk feet up eating peanuts what do you think he asked if i took away the peanuts would anyone ever again come into my office hardy gave the room a onceover i doubt it as a popular destination its a little flat dont you think how come nobodys ever here anymore you notice that look out there the place is a ghost town glitsky glanced back over his shoulder an hour ago we had to call in crowd control i dont know everybodys out working they come in here to write reports why are you here the feet came down because through secret sources i have discovered what you already knew yesterday when you wouldnt talk to me about graham russo which was he was at his fathers place he shot him up with morphine all the time did i know that yesterday i dont think i knew that if i do until this morning you knew something though more than you had last week you were convinced you had a murder glitsky moved into the room no comment has it gone to the grand jury yet tell me that no comment then sal had a fight hardy gave them a minute then shook his head not with graham if you say so and you probably will at the trial glitsky had just told him what he wanted to know there was going to be a trial there was no point in arguing the merits with the combination of grahams presence at sals and the fight added to the lies and the money there was a case the attorney general could prosecute even if the district attorney would not the lieutenant had one more remark however whoever did it diz this was a murder you mind if i sit in my chair hardy got up and they did a little dance moving around each other glitsky looked up at him why dont i think you came all the way down here just to have some peanuts i needed to know if you had a smoking gun before i did anything else glitsky considered this no comment he flashed his terrible smile what else brought you down to our little garden spot no comment hardy smiled back gosh weve turned into some great conversationalists here in our middle years havent we he hesitated about to say something else then thought better of it he checked his watch lord how time flies thanks for the peanuts later hardy had tried to make the appointment with sharron pratts chief assistant claude clark soon after hed hung up with graham his client might choose to deny it but hardy knew that after his admissions to sergeant evans big trouble was brewing he had a wild idea that might head it off at the pass clark already had a reputation as a trim and officious bully in his late thirties he sported a sandy buzz haircut a clipped mustache with goatee and an openly fey style that he would exaggerate around people whom he suspected of homophobia he had the power now he controlled access to the district attorney and was very effective at conveying the feeling that if you wanted to see her then you could very politely kiss his ass pratt liked to pretend that she was sensitive to people that she cared about their personal feelings and keeping clark near by to do her hatchet work was she believed good politics the chief assistant dismissed hardys request to meet with pratt as ridiculous the district attorney did not take meetings with defense attorneys on little or no notice she might be able to set aside some time for him in several weeks if he put his request in writing thinking its bad luck to diss the diz hardy put on the press id appreciate it if youd just tell her id like five minutes its about the sal russo case it hasnt gone away ive got some information that might help her why dont you just brief me and ill pass it along to her ill tell you what hardy had said ill just call my good buddy jeff elliot over at the chronicle you know jeff hell of a reporter writes the citytalk column gets his teeth in and never lets go sharron can read about it in the morning take care now in ten minutes he got the call pratt could set aside a few minutes if hardy could be at the hall at four oclock sharp the da set the rules of engagement she reigned from her chair protected and isolated from supplicants behind an expansive slab of polished hardwood claude clark hovered by the windows hardy hadnt been in this room since hed been fired five years before by the late christopher locke he had been ushered to his spot front and center mr hardy she nodded nice to meet you though of course i know you by reputation hardy doubted whether this was true but made the appropriate face i understand youve got some information for me he nodded getting right to it yes maam graham russo talked to the police over the weekend he admitted that hed been to his fathers and that hed injected him with morphine she sat forward he admitted he killed him no im sorry he admitted that hed earlier injected him with morphine the point is hes contradicted his original story again also apparently there was a struggle the chair she asked then shook her head weve already seen that thats no proof of a struggle they have a witness he saw her eyes narrow she was following him closely in any event im convinced that they now have a case the ag is going to make an arrest she nodded i had assumed they would powell wants to make some bones he wont win assisted suicide shouldnt be charged as homicide and every jury that gets picked in this city is going to agree with me but what does this have to do with you or me i want you to arrest him again her eyes went down to slits then opened as an admiring smile formed let me see if i get your meaning here she understood it perfectly she would simply pull the rug out from under the attorney general if she charged graham in sals death then cut a deal with his attorney then under double jeopardy graham could never be brought to trial again for the same crime she locked him in her gaze again youre afraid powells going to charge murder one with specials here arent you hardy nodded yep and youre sure hes not indicted the son yet thinking of glitsky hardy felt a tug of guilt theyd played the no comment game but hardy knew that if they hadnt been friends off the court glitsky wouldnt even have spoken to him in fact glitsky had as much as confided that the case hadnt yet been to the grand jury and now he was telling that to pratt it bothered him to do this to abe he should have thought about where it might go before hed come in here but hed been psyched on his strategic brilliance and now was the time he had to go ahead no indictment thats what i hear so whats your offer you charge him tomorrow morning early if the grand jury indicts first were dead i bring graham down and the next day we plead manslaughter the deal is probation no time community service negotiable and your clients on board with this he didnt really see how graham could disagree hed called him back after their early talk to propose it to him but again maddeningly thered been no answer not even a machine but hardy would get to graham before the morning if he had to camp on his front step he nodded he will be this response though brought pratt up short you dont have your clients approval for this i wanted to get your take on it first if you werent interested what was the point pratt obviously thought this was bassackwards as indeed it was but the idea itself played beautifully into her hands as a vehicle for votes she could ride it for miles still i wont move forward on this until ive heard from you i understand that she nodded once claude give mr hardy one of my cards with my home number mr hardy ill expect to hear from you since the business day was nearly over hardy drove directly from the hall of justice graham was home and cracked a bottle of beer for each of them suggesting that they walk up and have their talk outside at the top of the interior park belt which marked the end of edgewood they were sitting on a low brick wall looking down the canyon at the lush eucalyptusscented greenery the microclimate was putting on a show for them there wasnt even a light breeze and the temperature was pushing eighty hardy had left his coat in his car had removed his tie graham was barefoot in khaki shorts and a mesh jersey i never asked you play ball this weekend hardy thought hed ease into the real reason for his visit get some dialogue happening before he dropped the bomb luckily graham pulled at his beer i told you i got fired from the ambulance company didnt i though hardy wasnt happy to hear this it wasnt any surprise things were going to get a lot worse for graham and anything that helped him realize it was to the good you make some money a sidelong look is this a subtle intro to the fees discussion hardy smiled dont worry ill send you a bill eventually no i just wondered how you were getting along sorry im a jerk lately yeah we played a tournament down in hayward yesterday five games went all the way he made some dismissive gesture i pulled down two grand in one day five games the second game we got a bonus of a thousand bucks on the mercy rule thats how it works two grand a day best case if we win if wed have lost the first game i would have made fifty dollars so were motivated to win the mercy rule helps whats the mercy rule graham looked at hardy as though hed just stopped by from mars if a teams ahead by ten runs thats the game they call off the slaughter its called the mercy rule the way the sponsors bet they get double sometimes more if the games mercyruled the players get a bonus that happen a lot team full of ringers like us yeah id say so the guy who sponsors your team whats his name ising craig ising so craig ising paid your team ten grand in one day shrugging graham gave it a minute i guess so something like that hardy whistled what did he win betting more than that graham said these guys they dont get out of bed for ten grand but this subject clearly was making him uncomfortable he bought his bottle up took a drink so something tells me you didnt come up here to talk softball you get some more news well actually i did there really wasnt going to be any way to sugarcoat it so hardy didnt try graham listened patiently shaking his head theyre not going to arrest me again he said easily when hardy had finished sarahs not going to arrest me she likes me i like her shes cool shes a cop hardy said shes using the fact that you think shes cool that maybe theres a buzz between you two you talk to her shes using that to take you down that would really surprise me he said when she came by here saturday night that wasnt business so what was it a date graham laughed at that almost not quite but we might have got there hardy shook his head why is it graham that youre the only person in the city who doesnt think youre going to get arrested you ever ask yourself that graham shrugged sipped his beer they already took their shot with me diz whats in it for them doing it again its not the same people how about that he stood up and walked a few steps away he was thinking that after all he should have come here with the appearance of panic maybe that would have gotten his clients attention made him realize the seriousness of his situation but he hadnt wanted to scare him off hed wanted to keep him talking not to reject the pleabargain plan out of hand out of defensiveness well there was nothing for it now hardy had to make his case he turned back look graham heres the situation youre going to be arrested again in a couple of days certainly by the end of the week youre going to get charged with firstdegree murder maybe even specialcircumstances murder this is going to happen even if its not your sergeant evans and i think it is somebody is going to get this done its too big an issue its not going to go away he didnt win him over but at least the confident smile vanished all right lets say that happens lets just say then were just where we were last week anyway right we duke it out thats one approach but ive got a better one he came back to the low fence handed his untouched bottle of beer to graham and laid it all out his deal with pratt the whole strategy when hed finished he waited watching his clients face it wore a dead sober expression now conjuring with the possibilities he blew out heavily shook his head at something craned his neck but id have to say i did it he said at last but you wouldnt serve any time nobody could come back and get you for it it would be over the deals already cut graham pratts bought it its a good attorney move ill give you that hardy tried a light touch afterward you could even call up sergeant evans again ask her out but maddeningly seemingly unable to leave it alone graham played his refrain id have to say i did it there was no evading this yeah you would but what if i didnt it doesnt matter hardy said surprised by how much he sounded like a defense lawyer it didnt matter if he committed the crime what was he saying but he pushed at it its just a legal issue and id be off that would be the end of it hardy had him on the verge he could feel it now was the moment he had to close the deal you might get a couple or three years probation but graham listen to me youre just starting out in the business world theres a lot more to do than be a lawyer i am a lawyer and i know its ninetynine percent drudge and the rest is kissing your clients this brought a smile like now with me youre kissing my ass somehow it doesnt feel like youre kissing my ass this is an exception what im saying is you could do anything you dont need your bar card you dont need to be a lawyer any more than you needed to be a baseball player theyre just jobs finally a heartfelt note but im good diz i made law review i got the clerk job with draper nobody gets that job except the best hardy was shaking his head so youve got a good brain use it on something else and if you dont youre looking at prison graham were not talking your second or third choice in your career goals were talking years out of your life prison hard time for nearly a full minute that seemed like an hour hardy waited birds chirped in the foliage around them but otherwise the stillness was complete at last graham shook his head im sorry i know you put a lot of thought into this but i didnt kill my dad i cant say that i did hardy his stomach tight wished graham could simply leave it that he hadnt killed sal instead of always adding that he couldnt say he had he gave it a last try we dont have to call it killing him graham we can say no listen to me i am not going to say i killed him hardy listened to the birds chirp for another moment then gradually stood up ive got to tell pratt your answer by the morning he said youve got my answer my father killed himself he left the dnr tag for the medics he did it thats what happened a large percentage of marcel laniers working life outside of the office was spent in and around the citys various slums and housing projects poverty being the wet nurse to so many crimes this was the usual beat and homicide cops soon grew accustomed to it occasionally though the work took him on a different tour so while sarah evans was working phones at the hall of justice punching the numbers that sal russo had written on his scraps of paper playing connectthedots with the names lanier thought hed grab this opportunity to take a different more direct approach in spite of glitskys explicit instructions lanier forgot his tape recorder he knew that danny tosca held down the end of the bar most nights at gino carlos the place had been in its north beach location forever this was where the authentic old italian heart of the city beat most strongly and danny tosca was in some sense its unofficial pacemaker now in his early fifties cueball bald casually dressed in a dark sport coat burgundy shirt tasseled loafers tosca was ostensibly in real estate and in fact many of the businesses in the neighborhood made their rent checks out to his company which brokered for the actual property owners danny tosca had never been indicted or arrested as far as lanier knew hed never even had a parking ticket although if he had gotten one it would have been taken care of before the ink on it had dried he occupied a unique niche in the sense that he did not appear to believe in physical force he would be the first to admit that he had a knack for persuasion and negotiation for locating the pressure point and wasnt averse to accepting commissions from grateful clients he simply took a proprietary interest in his community and like lanier viewed himself as one of the many checks and balances in the city by which order was maintained he was enjoying his inevitable demitasse of espresso when lanier pulled up a stool and said hello tosca gave every appearance of being glad to see the inspector nodding at the bartender to set him up with whatever hed like marcel had a frangelica in a pony glass on the bar in front of him before his seat had gotten warm the two men chatted about the beautiful night the warm spell the giants who were on television above the bar losing to the dodgers finally marcel deemed the moment propitious that was a shame about sal russo he said i guess hed been sick a long time though tosca sipped his espresso waved at a couple whod just come through the door came back to lanier maybe it was better the son what he did you think it was dan a shrug thats what the papers say lanier nodded taking his time you see sal recently you know here and there and howd he seem in a lot of pain he dont show it you know doesnt mean it isnt there and what if it wasnt about his pain how about if it was something else lanier could see that tosca didnt expect this the question slowed him he fiddled with a sugar cube turning it around and around on the bar lanier leaned in closer somebody killed him dan we dont know why if it wasnt the kid wed like to know it before we arrest him again youre saying it was business im saying i dont know maybe somebody does im wondering if there wasnt something else in the fish meaning drugs if the illegal fish sales condoned as they were were a cover if sal had in fact been a mule for some major dealers there might be a motive but tosca was shaking his head that didnt happen he said flatly he sold fish good fish too a lot of it tosca eyed him carefully one day a week not exactly what i asked the twirling had moved from the sugar cube to the cup itself i dont think he cleared two hundred a week what he needed to survive there wasnt any loan to welsh on this was cash business he paid when he picked up okay but the suppliers some of them turn volume am i right tosca thought a beat youre asking was sal blackmailing somebody getting some payoff if they didnt pay maybe hed fink to fish and game why would he do that more money what would he need more money for lanier shrugged suddenly he needed morphine although not particularly convincing to tosca this was at least an answer he chewed his cheek for a minute popped a sugar cube into his mouth and chewed some more okay theres one guy he said ill see what i can find out if you give me his name lanier said i can go see him tonight at toscas glare he explained were on deadline here danny sooner would be better the glare abated tosca patted laniers hand on the bar i hear you marcel ill see what i can find out sarah was almost beginning to think sal russo had sat in his room for hours making up names and telephone numbers certainly not one number she reached in the first hour admitted to knowing him or had any idea what her call could be about she reasoned that there must be a password she didnt know or everybody knew that sal russo was the subject of a murder investigation either way the well was dry until she got to the name finer disheartened and ready to call it a day she listened to five rings and was about to hang up when a weary voice answered whos this what time is it mr finer a deep sigh exhaustion doctor finer and im not on call this isnt right i havent slept in two days howd you get this number from sal russo i dont know any sal russo dr finer wait a minute this is sergeant evans with san francisco homicide sal russos been murdered she wondered if hed hung up anyway there was nothing but air in her ear then another sigh homicide whos been murdered she gave him an abbreviated version and at the end of it he seemed to have broken a bit through the fatigue did i treat this man im sorry but im interning at county its not like i have patients the way youre thinking what did he have cancer a brain tumor she said and alzheimers and you got my number at his house thats right well then i might have seen him but ill tell you it wasnt recently ive been in the er for the past six months and if he wasnt bleeding i didnt treat him he wasnt bleeding but it might have been before that i dont know when it was ive got your name and phone number on an old crumpled piece of paper and thats all i know she heard ive got to get some sleep then what was your name again evans all right evans hold on it might be a minute russo sal russo she said it was more like five minutes but sarah was content to wait at least she had someone trying to find something related to sal russo it was better than punching phone numbers and getting nothing finally he was back if he had this number i must have seen him here this didnt mean anything to sarah but he was going on salvatore russo hed be near sixty now right that was him all right finer was obviously reading his notes he came into the public clinic on his own and was referred to me i was doing primary care said hed gotten lost twice in the last couple of months just suddenly couldnt figure out where he was he was worried he might have ad ad alzheimers so anyway lets see hold on she waited and heard paper flipping yeah i scheduled him for blood chemistry and a thyroid panel but he didnt show then he had another episode this was four months later and we tried it again the blood tests is that how you diagnose alzheimers blood tests no first you eliminate other possible causes of dementia thirdstage syphilis for example there isnt any diagnostic genetic test for ad were talking a whole battery of this and that until they get to imaging and even then the diagnosis especially at the early stage is uncertain but you did diagnose sal he made sure answering slowly no he stopped coming we never got to the mri he didnt want to know for sure maybe he got scared of knowing some of that im sure i dont know maybe i made some mistakes ive got a note here he wanted to know what would happen if we got to a diagnosis what would happen well im mandated to report to the dmv for example if somebodys got advance dementia you dont want no i see that also this was him not me but ive got it here where he said he didnt want to get to be a burden on anybody hed kill himself before that happened he said that yeah but then you know this is hard to deal with he didnt want to get any closer to it especially if he thought it would be his duty or something to kill himself if he had it hed rather not know about it for sure that makes sense evans said she tried another tack so you didnt prescribe anything for him no we hadnt gotten anywhere really do you remember him at all personally a pause then a sigh these last couple of years i often dont remember my name im on autopilot supposedly its going to make me a better doctor someday sarah felt for the man i wont keep you much longer doctor it wasnt you who prescribed a dnr tag for him then dont resuscitate no did he finally kill himself if he had a dnr and cancer i thought you said somebody killed him we think so were trying to make sure heres the last question youre a doctor and you couldnt diagnose alzheimers only a couple of years ago could it have progressed far enough by now that he was somehow incompetent to live alone finer gave it some thought i cant say for sure it could it varies he could be going in and out of dementia with more frequency and still live a seminormal life if he had help of course theres no cure it just keeps getting worse you know finer concluded if he had the dnr thats a pretty good argument he wanted to die i know she replied were trying to figure it out thanks for your help doctor ill let you get back to sleep the hardy family was having a renaissance theyd all eaten dinner together an unusual occurrence over the past few months supposedly that had been due to their fathers work schedule but today hed put in nearly as many productive hours as he usually did this time though hed made it a point to come home when he finished after they ate they had sprawled with popcorn on the livingroom floor playing a marathon tournament of chinese checkers when hed gone to tuck them in for the last time both kids put their arms around him not wanting to let go as he came out to the kitchen his wife did the same thing they miss you all the time this is what they need once in a while i do too he held her i know im going to try and keep doing this being around its a concept she said she moved closer against him were they asleep asleep enough we close the door and they wont hear a thing snuggled together they were dozing to the news at first hardy didnt know if hed dreamed or heard the name graham russo but frannie nudged him did you know about this what but it had only been the teaser they had to endure four commercials before the news came back on while local police still wont comment on the apparent assisted suicide of sal russo ten days ago saying only that the investigation is continuing in sacramento today the chairperson of the hemlock society a righttodie group came forward and said that sal russos son graham had spoken to her just minutes before he went to his fathers apartment for more on that story live in sacramento heres hardy was sitting all the way forward oh lord give me a break barbara brandt looking every inch the lobbyist confidently met the eye of the camera he was very emotional and upset as anyone would be when it comes to the moment i think he just wanted some assurance it was natural off camera the reporter asked why graham hadnt admitted this himself brandt understanding yet slightly disappointed in the nature of people shook her head we argued about it last weekend on the phone this was heroic the public has a right to know the truth sal and graham russo together had the courage to act but graham doesnt want to embody the issue well its too late for that now im going public to let graham know that hes not alone the laws against assisted suicide and euthanasia must be changed she stared at the camera whatever the consequences graham you did the right thing hardy hit the mute button i dont believe this frannie too had come awake what dont you believe she asked that she came forward with this or what shes saying i dont know who is she i never heard of her graham never mentioned her hardy was shaking his head but ill tell you one thing for sure whoever she is she just screwed him at eight fortyfive sarah opened the door to her apartment thinking she should get herself a cat or a hamster or a goldfish something alive to greet her when she came home she had stopped in at the corner grocery downstairs and bought an apple and a tv dinner that she called mean cuisine and now she took off her jacket unstrapped her holster and hung it on a kitchen chair unwrapped the food and put it in the microwave went into the bathroom to take a quick shower fifteen minutes later she had eaten and gotten dressed again in civilian clothes blue jeans tennis shoes a white fishermans sweater she wasnt planning to go out but it was too early for pajamas and her robe she made the conscious decision not to pursue any thoughts on the russo case tonight her workday was done dr finer had been the end of it well almost after that discussion shed sat at her desk fingering her paper scraps conjuring her own image of who sal had been carrying her afghan in from the bedroom she got herself settled in her chair and spent most of another hour finishing a paperback about kat colorado going on tour with a country singer in nashville saving the womans life of course winning another one for the good guys sarah liked these books about women private eyes especially the quickwitted smartmouthed ones she didnt fancy herself like them but it was fun to live in their shoes for the space of a book although they always got so personally involved that wasnt like real police work she wasnt going to think about it she turned the television on to pick up the end of the giants game they had just come back in the bottom of the ninth and beaten the dodgers she thought shed call her parents and rub it in a little but they werent home she left a message came back to her chair in front of the tv sat down heavily her parents were always going out nowadays having fun three of her girlfriends and her little brother jerry in concord three answering machines and one she woke up okay she told herself it was just one of those nights but the walls closing in the droning television her only companion she decided shed go out for a walk grab a cup of decaf at one of the places over on clement thats what shed do by then her mom and dad might be home and she could talk to them for a few minutes and then turn in she considered calling her partner but no she saw enough of lanier and socially he was not her idea of company besides they would wind up talking about the case it was eating her up she felt an unseen pair of hands pushing down on her holding her in the chair she was not going to turn out like sal russo she told herself so what if she lived alone in an apartment not too dissimilar from his what did that mean half the city hell half the people her age in cities all over the world lived like this or worse sometimes much worse it didnt necessarily lead anywhere she wasnt anything like sal she wasnt going to wind up where he had she was a success by thirtytwo shed reached the peak of her profession the walls again she hadnt gotten around to hanging any art with her work she hadnt had time and look there were a couple of posters after all the monterey aquarium a saguaro cactus in a desert somewhere that reminded her of her parents but they were both unframed sagging from their tacks in the faded drywall she got up and took the fivestep walk into the kitchen it was neat enough unlike sals see she said to herself there were no dirty dishes piled anywhere but the linoleum was peeling up in the corners the table and chairs were thrift store secondhand nice enough but after thirty more years she wondered what theyd look like what theyd feel like at that time to someone who was her age now but that was silly of course shed move up into something better now she was young and unattached she didnt need any more but graham damn him coming back into her consciousness like this grahams place wasnt at all like this was it it was elegant and fine and he too was young and unattached in the door between kitchen and living room she surveyed her own place objectively as if it were a crime scene as if something had happened to her here tonight now the afghan had been tossed off and lay half on the ancient wing chair half on the woven throw rug everything in sight was well used the homemade brickandboard bookshelves with their dogeared paperbacks and lawenforcement journals the cassette player the lionsclaw coffee table pocked with rings from hot cold wet glasses placed directly on the wood the couch was frayed and worn its oncebright red gold and green brocade now lackluster nearly sepia the threebulb standing lamp behind the sofa threw almost no light two bulbs needed to be replaced she was going out all right this was just a mood if she didnt like her apartment shed change it soon it had never bothered her before she wasnt stuck with it forever shed just turn off the television graham russo who was arrested then released last week for assisting at the suicide of his father he was not home the house was as dark as it had been the night before shed parked at the bottom of the street across from a streetlight under a canopy of trees now she stood leaning against the hood of her car looking north back toward her apartment trying not to think edgewood dropped off in a cliff from where she stood she could look down a hundred feet or so into the backyards and onto the roofs of the multistory buildings below her on parnassus in one of the upper windows close enough to see clearly two men were in a bed together naked the chill had come up again a brisk breeze out of the west although with her fishermans sweater she wasnt cold still she tightened her arms around herself a stair street farnsworth fell off steeply to her right in the wake of the chikchikchik of an owl flying overhead she heard footsteps coming up the steps shed left her apartment hurriedly unarmed now she backed into the shadow of the canopy as the steps came up to her paced and rhythmic jogging suddenly certain she stepped out into the light as graham got to the top of the steps seeing her breathing hard he stopped his shoulders dropped and he shook his head as if shed finally beaten him gathering another breath he spread his hands palms out am i under arrest the thought was so far from her mind that she laughed out loud what are you doing it took a minute for him to figure out what she meant trying to stay in shape running off some of this he gestured ambiguously took in another lungful of air all this madness he was still panting those are some serious stairs more than a hundred id bet but whos counting then focusing back on her so if im not under arrest she took a half step toward him i guess im finally off duty i thought you might have some of that wine left they walked uphill in the middle of the street in silence inside he turned on the indirect track lights and opened the curtains to the view downtown and the east bay shimmered down below them i was going to take a shower he said indicating the tiny booth that was his bathroom theres no room to change in there she swiveled in the chair grabbed one of the magazines i wont look when he got out of the shower he opened a bottle of red and poured them both a glass they moved to opposite ends of the low leather couch graham was back in his uniform barefoot baggy running shorts a tshirt sarah tennis shoes and all had her legs curled under her though barbara brandts announcement that shed counseled graham in the minutes before hed killed his father was the immediate catalyst that had gotten her out of her own apartment and up to here sarah felt no inclination to raise the subject shed told him she was off duty and she was graham evidently hadnt yet even heard about it hed been out jogging to the beach and back over an hour the phone she noticed was unplugged she had no idea where the words came from your father painted she began out of the blue the comment seemed to require an adjustment to grahams mindset he shifted on the couch averted his eyes he did a lot of things are you still off duty she had to smile at that yeah you want to talk about my father she nodded looks like i was at his place it got a little bit inside me so did he graham leaned down and put his wineglass on the floor then stood again crossing to the bookshelves he turned you know when i got the letter i hadnt talked to him in like fifteen years he was at my high school graduation just came up and said hello when my mom wasnt around congratulations i had no idea what to say back i think i just looked at him all i really remember is it made me feel sick and thats the last time you saw him i mean before the letter graham shook his head no thats whats funny when i worked for draper id see him on fridays all the time out in his truck behind the courthouse id stand at the window and watch him out in the alley everybody seemed to love him but you didnt go down i thought i hated him still across the room from her he pulled a kitchen chair over and straddled it even after the letter he stopped i thought the letter was when you connected he considered that for a beat i saw him in vero then once but it wasnt very good i was a jerk i think its my truest talent jerkhood i think its jerkitude then realizing how that could be interpreted she added not your truest talent the word he shrugged well whatever you call it there it was so right after i read the letter i decided id sucked it up enough i should spill out how i felt it would do me good my dad had caused us all so much grief and id never told him how i felt about it what hed put us all through so he writes me this this beautiful letter reaching out really and somehow this cues me sensitive guy that i am that the time is right to go and beat up on the old man literally you hit him no i might as well have i told him he was a son of a bitch who had a hell of a nerve thinking he could make some kind of amends sarah didnt think graham was aware that hed stood up and begun pacing as though hes going to somehow make up for leaving us just walking out in his dreams whatd he think i was going to do forgive him take him back with open arms get a life sal but im not letting you back in mine i dont want to make you feel better not now not ever i dont care how you feel and were not going to be friends for christs sake you think we can be friends i hate you man dont you fucking get it i hate your guts he was yelling by the end now in the small room the silence when he stopped left a vacuum he was breathing hard looking back at sarah as though in panic yeah he said i beat him up i beat the hell out of him she waited until hed crossed to the kitchen sink and scooped a few handfuls of water into his face sorry he said so what did he do how did he react he was leaning against the counter his arms crossed over his chest his massive shoulders slumped he said i was right he was crying and you know what i was glad he was crying he said he was so sorry graham blew out in frustration and right in character i told him sorry wasnt good enough sorry didnt make any damn difference anymore in the pause she asked and then what then i left so how did you that was later he said there was an old hose in the alley where he parked his truck across from his apartment it had been left behind by the construction crew at the federal courthouse and sal russo had claimed it he had it hooked to a spigot and was washing out the bed of his truck which got tolerably rank by the end of friday there wasnt any nozzle but sal was happy enough to control the spray with his thumb it spit water back all over him but he didnt care his life was sea spume and fish smell this was part of it hed polished off the last mouthfuls of the gallon bottles of carlo rossi that his customers hadnt got to he had the cigar butt in his teeth chopping words off around it half singing half humming sweet betsy from pike it was the middle of the summer two or more hours of daylight left and the wind was gusting up in front of him blowing the spray back soaking him by the second chomping down harder on his cigar he grinned into the force of it then turned to get another angle on the truck bed flush out the scales initially he thought it was a premonition of one of his spells a shadow in the center of the suns glare something about the shape so mnemonic it felt like a haunting moving to one side he squinted up into it graham hey dad sal bent the hose over on itself stopping the flow of water he hadnt seen his son since that time in vero and that had been a stupid mistake he had seen him play and then hadnt been able to stop himself he thought enough time might have passed maybe graham could understand but hed been wrong and now here he was again whats goin on your mother all right he couldnt imagine any other reason his son would come to see him not after the last time helen he thought must have died and they send graham to tell him mom s fine he shifted on his feet i uh i came by to apologize im sorry the world took on a blurry edge for a beat but sal only blinked and nodded yeah well like i said you were right he released his grip on the hose pointed it vaguely at the truck so how you doin his son didnt answer right away which forced him to look not that great to tell you the truth sal kept the water going i saw they cut you i dont blame em he said i sucked there was a set to the face a tight control he looked about to break im too old its a kids game i was stupid the whole thing was stupid sal nodded yeah probably if its any consolation its in the blood id a probably done the same thing then got cut too bet that makes you feel better a smile started but went nowhere lots thanks dont mention it you hungry he squeezed off the water again held it with one hand and pulled a roll of bills out of his front pocket sal had a regular spot at the us restaurant a lone table that spearheaded the sidewalk at the narrowest point in the triangular building the place was in the heart of north beach and had been in its location half a block from gino carlos bar essentially unchanged for as long as sal could remember you still couldnt spend ten bucks on a meal there if you tried they were on their third carafe of red wine the wineglass was a prop and sal had his hands wrapped around his a foot from them both outside the glass the tourist night was getting into swing the lights coming up on the street i dont know if there is a why anymore sal was saying maybe there never was i dont know but there had to be sal you dont just maybe you do maybe one day you wake up and youre a different person youre going along and something happens and the whole vision you have of who you are suddenly that whole thing just doesnt work anymore so everything it was holding up comes crashing down around it what did mom have an affair sal shook his head it wasnt your mother this was me who i was he lifted the prop and used it buying some time it wasnt anything as easy as an affair so what was it sarah asked him by now it was nearly midnight although neither of them was much aware of the time they were facing each other sitting crosslegged on the floor to this day i dont know he said i didnt realize how insecure a person my mother was still is if you want to know no one who saw her out in the world would ever see that though we kids had seen it of course after we were older the facelifts now the trappings stuff you dont need if youre together with yourself graham seemed embarrassed by the cheap psychology he looked down at his hands anyway she loved him their backgrounds might never mesh they got uncomfortable doing each others things you know like what oh mom wouldnt go out on the boat sal wouldnt get dressed up for anything it broke down to money mom was used to things you bought sal liked things you did it was a pretty big difference but they got together he nodded theyd never be friends like some couples were but he loved her and knew he could make her keep loving him he could make her thats what he said and how did he do that by being stronger than she was having a stronger will and that made her love him yeah i think it might have sarah and graham had never gotten around to drinking any of their wine the glasses remained half filled on the hardwood by the couch graham was still trying to reason it through for himself how it had happened with his father and mother so it wasnt the hour or the alcohol still with no real intention of doing so he was becoming more aware of the planes of sarahs face the soft bow of her lips the way her hair fell across her cheek sals eyes danced with the memory see i knew who i was i was happy in myself i was a person okay a schlemiel like i still am but i knew where i belonged who i was your mother she didnt she was looking always looking for something solid always unsure of where the ground was i think no hell i know that nothing in her parents life got inside her shed gone to the schools and had the clothes and the fancy friends but you know what they didnt do it for her then when we got together finally she was happy not always thrilled with the way we lived with no money none of that society junk but she loved you kids and what about you did she still love you his father leaned across the table and graham could pick up the odor of fish of cheap wine but even with that the old clothes and the stubble the random fish scale on his skin sal remained a compelling figure i told you i made her graham rolled his eyes and his father laughed that too but that wasnt what i was talking about graham hadnt touched his spumoni ice cream and now it had melted into a waxy pinkishbrown liquid in its small tarnished metal bowl sal pulled it over in front of him and dipped a spoon shed get the doubts you know do we belong here maybe my parents are right where are we going did i still love her the way i did when we started all the time he shook his head sadly all the goddamn time graham and you know what id do he scooped up another spoonful of melted spumoni id tell her i was sure that this is really what she wanted down in her soul that the kids the house the worries this was real life it was the only thing that had ever made her happy she knew that and that i loved her not because of anything except for who she was he sat back scratched at his face pulled at the sides of his mouth finally speaking about this after all these years to his oldest son bringing it up again the memory seemed to be battering him it was just a constant battle graham you cant imagine the conflict between how she was raised and how she was living it seemed like she always had one foot out the door ready to go back so i couldnt ever waver couldnt show any doubt of my own or shed lose faith if i stopped acting like i believed then she couldnt go it on her own it wasnt her dream at all really it depended on who i was and who were you he sighed wearily and spoke with a huskiness that now betrayed the words he had confidence in the memory he knew who he d been i was sal russo id never make a lot of money never change the world but i was as good a man as there was i was strong i worked hard i didnt cheat i loved your mother with all my heart simple stuff but it was what she needed to hear who she needed me to be and it was true so what happened he searched the crowded restaurant for a minute hiding or searching for the answer letting out a deep breath he shrugged i lost my confidence i guess i couldnt pretend i was anybody special anymore but why because i wasnt it wasnt really an answer but another more pressing question kept graham from pursuing it but what about us me deb georgie how could you just leave us he reached across the table and put a hand on his fathers arm im not here to bust your chops on this id just like to understand it thats all i would too graham id go back and live every minute of that time over again if i could i dont know how i could have done it i want to blame your mother but again it was all me i could have fought her the implications here rocked graham the only story hed ever heard was that his father didnt want to see his children anymore and indeed apparently he hadnt made any effort to not that graham had heard of what do you mean he asked you could have fought mom they were out of props wineglasses ice cream coffee cups at the us restaurant steady customers could sit all day and night over a demitasse if they wanted nobody hustled them out sal had his hands folded on the table the knuckles gnarled and white with pressure i dont know exactly how to say this but when we broke up when it stopped working your mother it meant shed failed shed gone up against everything she was raised with because id convinced her it was somehow truer or nobler better then when it didnt work she had no choice i think she had to hate me i had betrayed her i was the devil you couldnt see us because of her sal didnt like that slant on it it wasnt helens fault it was his own she got very protective of you i had ruined her life she wasnt going to let me ruin yours and you accepted that he shook his head i was at the bottom graham i was worthless i guess i thought she must be right it was too hard i dont know every time i tried she was in the way until finally i just gave up grahams hand was still on his fathers arm he tightened down his grip how could you do that sals eyes leveled on his i got hit pretty hard by a few of life s pitches graham i guess i got afraid to come back to the plate you know what im talking about i think i do he said it s kind of how i feel why i thought i d come look you up they were outside now where hardy and graham had sat late that afternoon though by now the temperature had dropped to the fifties graham was still barefoot still wore his shorts although hed pulled on a warmup jacket sarah leaned against a lightpost hands in her pockets graham was concluding so thats when we became friends again i was pretty low i didnt know who else he let it hang but it was clear enough graham felt and from all accounts with some justification that hed alienated everyone in his world too and didnt know where to start to get back in maybe with his dad whod been there as well i wish id known him somehow she said im glad i did finally but the subject suddenly seemed too close embarrassing him he was great but that night in north beach did he already have alzheimers then graham nodded i know thats a question it didnt seem like it at all he was like hed always been but the symptoms had started before i found that out later after we after i became more involved with him it was getting worse of course it doesnt get better but he was still trying to live with it it was a clean opportunity to get back to the pursuit of her investigation but she no longer had the heart for it so how sick was he at the end it wasnt the alzheimers graham said ad wasnt ever going to kill him it wasnt going to get the time he shook off the thought the funny thing is you know we were so much like each other firstborn kids jocks confident to a fault even now he stopped again even now what even now with everything thats happened with the clerkship and with baseball with being unemployable getting arrested then fired i still know who i am im fine with me its everybody elses reaction thats a little hard to take he wasnt whining it was said so matteroffactly that another person might have missed it altogether and that would have been fine with graham but sarah knew what he was saying he had no close friends anymore no one to share what went on in his soul there had been sal his father and now sal was dead his smile wasnt a comeon it was a question it makes one cautious sarah smiled back im a firstborn jock with attitude myself she said do you know the secret handshake im not sure i do moving off the lamppost she took his hand raised it open to her mouth and holding his gaze licked his palm part three it was friday in the third week of may hardy was at an outside table alone just finishing an order of mussels from a lunch at plouf a bistro on belden alley smack in the middle of the financial district belden was a true downtown alley perhaps a dozen feet wide shaded except at high noon by the buildings on either side of it the sun had just passed out of sight and the slice of sky above the alley was bright blue hardy had taken frannie to paris the previous summer leaving the kids with moses and susan for five tooshort days he hadnt been to france since just after his hitch in vietnam and going back had nearly broken his heart hed been a free man in paris the one joni mitchell had written her song about unfettered and alive well the savory smells of great food cooking here on belden didnt completely mask the underpinning aromas of fish and tobacco and urine with those plus the halfdozen french restaurants in the space of its one block the place was paris sitting over his crock of mussel shells hardy had that feeling again not exactly unfettered but alive energized by the tastes and smells and bustle around him he was certain that very soon he was going to be back in the thick of what he was born to do and it wasnt tryptech hed looked in on michelle back at the office up to her elbows in paper and had left for lunch with nary a trace of guilt there was one problem though he hadnt been able to reach graham calls hadnt been answered hed left notes tacked to the front door on edgewood nothing his client had vanished without a trace and given their disagreement over the plea bargain hed struck with pratt hardy wasnt a hundred percent sure that he still had a client at all after what hed been through adjusting his attitude and priorities this was something hed rather not consider this seat taken the familiar face belonged to art drysdale whod long ago been hardys mentor art had even rehired him to the district attorneys office getting him back into the practice of the law after his decadelong selfimposed exile since then their professional lives had put them in different corners but hardy had always liked art and was glad to see him the other guy with him he didnt know have you met gil soma the two shook hands the lawyer club it didnt have to be personal not yet at least hardy looked from one man to the other the mussels are really great he said smiling going on the assumption that you being here with me is a coincidence drysdale grabbed a leftover piece of bread and dipped it in hardys sauce wine parsley garlic mostly i did happen to call your office right after youd left and phyllis told me you were coming here shes very efficient hardy had his poker face on it was good practice hed been out of the game awhile then since it was such a nice day and lunchtime to boot we figured wed take a walk get out and enjoy the city good idea he waited let them come out with it it was what had brought them here they pulled chairs and got themselves arranged have you heard from your client today drysdale finally asked which one art ive got clients coming out of the woodwork i cant keep track of them all soma didnt appreciate all this pirouetting he snapped it out the famous one graham russo oh your buddy didnt you guys use to work together till he stiffed us soma was smiling but hardy was getting the feeling that it wasnt sincere even before barbara brandt had entered the picture with her claim that shed counseled graham just before sals death the case was developing a lot of momentum of course it didnt hurt that cerrones article had indeed made the cover of time grahams handsome guileless face had stared out at hardy from every newsstand hed passed on his way to lunch the photographer had captured a vulnerable moment and the tale it told was wrenching hardy thought the story was also probably true or mostly true at least in some respects close to true unfortunately for his client two out of three of those choices were disastrous but he got back to the point anyway no art i havent heard from him hes probably lying low maybe he left town i think i would have soma jumped at this did you counsel him to do that where did he go hardy took in soma for a beat then turned to drysdale the reporters were getting on his nerves tell you the truth theyre getting on mine too then you did talk to him resolutely mild hardy kept his eyes on drysdale which he knew was making soma crazy did you read that little piece about me and sharron art jeff elliots citytalk column this morning had alluded to hardys aborted plea bargain and pratts displeasure with the way things had turned out reading it at their kitchen table in the morning frannie had commented that her husband seemed to have a knack for alienating district attorneys hardy allowed as to how that was probably true it wasnt the worst possible trait in a defense attorney to which frannie had raised her eyebrows her husband was precise with his words and if dismas was calling himself a defense attorney right out loud thats what he meant but drysdale was nodding smiling pratt after all had fired him recently enough that he still didnt wish her all the best she shouldnt have leaked it before the deal was done he said im afraid it made her look less than astute bumbling in point of fact the wattage on the smile increased poor woman my heart goes out to her but i do think diz it put you on her list ill try to make it up to her hardy enjoying himself finally turned to soma anyway to answer your question gil grahams been a little tough to reach he hadnt been indicted in her wisdom ms pratt let him go he was a free man he smiled all around its a free country drysdale cut to it hes been indicted now and i expect you to surrender him though this was news it was hardly unexpected and hardy took it calmly what charge murder one with specials expected or not and it was the official confirmation of what hardy had predicted this wasnt good news you cant be asking for death on this lwop this was soma rapping the rap trying out the sound of the jargon pretending to be an old pro hardy wondered if soma had given any thought to the reality of life in prison without the possibility of parole for someone very much like himself as graham was if in fact soma had given thought to much except getting highprofile cases and winning them hardy guessed not the boy had all the signs of testosterone poisoning which meant he wouldnt do it by the numbers also the case had a personal edge which increased the odds if soma was smart which also appeared to be the case that hed come up with some tricks in the courtroom but here in belden alley the attorneys for both sides of this highly publicized case were at the same table informally in some kind of freeform mode from what theyd said they hadnt found graham yet to arrest him hardy knew drysdale well and thought hed orchestrated this meeting for some specific purpose maybe get another plea in play although a zing of caution maybe art thought he could get information they didnt have while hardys guard was down hed find out either of you read the article in time cerrone had done a masterful job of creating an impression without ever crossing the line into accusation the graham russo case hed written was a poignant illustration of the many ambiguities facing the country surrounding the entire problem of elderly careassisted suicidethe right to die woven into the fabric of the legal story of the arrest and subsequent release of graham russo was the relationship between him and his father the desperation of sals condition grahams access to morphine and syringes reading the article hardy concluded that no reasonable person would assume that graham had not helped his father die with dignity hardy had his ear to the ground and as far as he could tell the article coupled with barbara brandts confession had pretty much settled the question for the public even some of the legal public freeman michelle these two lawyers with him now however represented something entirely different a waiter had come and taken their lunch orders and hardy had decided on a cup of espresso high octane after it arrived he slowly stirred in a spoonful of sugar ive got to say art this is a terrible call if you read the article true to form soma butted in again the article left out just a few things yes it did hardy was all agreement and i know all about them the money and the socalled struggle but ill tell you something graham didnt kill sal for the money youll never be able to prove he did he found himself addressing art again powells got to know this art its damn near frivolous we did get the indictment drysdale shrugged the grand jury didnt think it was frivolous hardy sat back in his chair amused wasnt it your very self years ago who assured me that if the prosecution asked nice enough the grand jury would indict a ham sandwich drysdale nodded i might have said something like that when i was but a callow youth but i was wrong he grinned besides the ham sandwich might have done it so remind me again why are we having this discussion you came down here looking for me remember why didnt you just give me a call and tell me to bring in my man putting a hand over the arm of soma who looked equal parts ready to interrupt again and in sore need of a bathroom break drysdale leaned forward deans made his point getting the indictment diz hes upholding the law pratt isnt i dont think this kid has to spend the rest of his life in jail he threw a quick glance at soma shutting him up so what do you want you tell me the word was you went to manslaughter no time with pratt i dont think dean will go there but he might bend down from the specials but hardy was shaking his head my client didnt even cop to probation art he says he didnt do it although the entire country now thinks he did hardy spread his palms be that as it may and even if thats true even if some jury comes to that view they wont see murder with specials theyll see an assisted suicide finally soma could hold it no longer which is murder drysdale agreed forget the legal niceties diz this was a murder we can prove murder which means graham did it soma blurted hardy took a beat thats an interesting legal theory he said the point drysdale went on is this you know powell diz hes not immune to public opinion this hardy thought was surely one of the great understatements of drysdales career but he let him go on he doesnt necessarily want to try a case where sixty percent of his constituency thinks his suspect is a good guy who did the right thing but drysdales hand went back to somas arm but dean is convinced and i agree that this was a murder you will too diz when youve seen all the discovery so if you plead its winwin dean gets a w in his column for upholding the law you get a w for pleading down pratt picks up an l i love the sports analogy hardy said so graham gets time in the slammer my guess is hed call that one the big l for him what do you think l for life is the big l soma said this would be lower case its not going to happen hardy replied standing up but ill convey your kind offer to my client if i can find him shaking hands he was effusively friendly he told art it was nice seeing him again they ought to plan a lunch together sometime catch up on their families the changes in their jobs old times turning to the younger man extending his hand hardy broke a practiced smile it was nice to meet you mr soma i wish you luck in your career the young man wasnt blind or stupid he caught the dismissive tone and served one back to hardy we need to see russo by tomorrow we dont mean the day after hardy nodded yes sir i guess i hear that message loud and clear thank you very much an hour after soma and hardy exchanged their pleasantries marcel lanier sat doubleparked in front of the office of the attorney general on fremont street drumming his hands on his steering wheel this was supposed to have taken five minutes whip by here and get confirmation that graham russo was in the system hed sent sarah up and shed already been gone for twenty marcel sat with his drivers window down eyes closed it was a nice afternoon smells of coffee roasting and diesel fumes not altogether unpleasant he was half dozing until another cop pulled up behind him marcel flashed his badge and explained the situation and tried to go back to dozing until two minutes later when another trafficand parkingenforcement meterminder tapped him hard on the elbow come on now move it along another flash of the buzzer this one not as effective i dont care about the badge inspector youre blocking the street here you gotta move it along so marcel humoring this bozo drove in a big circle hoping evans would be back down when he returned but she wasnt so he doubleparked again in the same spot closed his eyes again it couldnt be long now he told himself it just couldnt be but it was long enough for a pair of indigents one of them wearing a football helmet and the other pushing a stolen shopping cart loaded with recyclables to stop at his window and ask him for money marcel revved the motor and took off again for another tour of the surrounding three blocks when he returned this time he at least got the time to start drumming his fingers before evans appeared coming out of the building with the skinny young lawyer lanier was watching the guy move soma had come all the way down from the third floor with sarah evans when all he needed to do was have his secretary check the computer so thats what it was soma was hitting on her leaning on the horn he saw her wave gesturing to him making excuses as though she needed to explain to this dweeb that she was supposed to be doing her job he rolled down the window on her side hey sarah he didnt know what it had been whether soma had been overbearing or hed honked too often maybe it was pms you never knew he was the one whod had the frustrating twenty minutes out in the car but now she was sulking her elbow out her own window as they drove west staring out away from him you all right he asked im fine except of course that the man i love is now a fugitive and the next time i see him ive got to arrest him that guy soma bothering you she shrugged still not looking over the silence went on for another few blocks finally lanier spoke again so what happened nothing well nothing seems to have got you pretty upset now she turned im not upset right thats right youre always this way quiet and kind of moody another block i told him he was making a mistake who lanier asked about what she flicked at the folder containing the file gil soma this thing marcel threw her a concerned look the warrant whats the matter with it russo you back on that again give it a rest he did it oh okay never mind sarah asking her to be reasonable no really you think he did it therefore he did it who cares its somas problem its not our problem were just doing the delivery youre right theres nothing to discuss besides he did it nobody else could have done it we checked everybody else is clean you read that time story that woman up in sacramento he did it she was silent what he helped his dad die to put him out of his misery right right so what about the struggle what about the hooker downstairs what she heard the bump on the head marcel was nodding thats what i mean he did it for the money sure but you just said it was assisted suicide maybe it started that way and the idea that when it was done he would have the money maybe that kind of grew on him then he got started and panicked when the old man changed his mind anything could have happened sarah but whatever it was he was there he did it this stuff happens i had a guy once killed his wife same thing she was sick oh yeah same thing wouldnt admit he did it why not youre going to love this guy was like sixty years old he didnt want his eightyyearold mother to be mad at him what gods truth you heard it here first the mother didnt believe in the concept so the son tried to fake it and make it look like a straight suicide but he botched it all up did he also try to make it look like a murder steal his wifes jewelry anything like that no but that would have just been going into more detail he just wasnt as smart as this russo guy thats all same basic idea though well thanks for making that clear anytime you think hell be home russo i doubt it sarah didnt simply doubt that graham wasnt at his home she knew it for a fact hed been staying at her apartment since the long night theyd spent with each other after shed licked his palm sarahs argument to herself fatuous and she knew it was that graham had not been under indictment at that time and was in theory a citizen who was to be presumed innocent now the indictment had come in and though it had been expected like it or not it changed everything he saw it as soon as she walked through the door closed it carefully behind her kept her distance from him for the last few days shed entered the apartment and theyd fallen into each others arms he stood in the middle of the living room whats the matter he asked whats happened the matter is you got yourself indicted this morning by the grand jury im not supposed to tell you that im not supposed to be in love with you im supposed to arrest you right now he tried a tentative smile you going to this isnt funny i dont think its funny then do me a favor dont laugh about it that ought to be easy not laughing i mean he couldnt make himself move toward her he could feel the aura from where he stood she had to keep a distance between them he wasnt going to push it what do you want me to do sarah ill go if you want leave here if itll make it easier for you or you can take me in whatever you want dont you understand shit i dont want to take you in her strong shoulders sagged she bit at her lip this is wrong this is all so wrong this time he did take a step toward her but she held out a hand dont he stopped waited spoke quietly my dad and i i didnt she interrupted him thats not the point graham so what is the point she said tightly is that im a cop and youre indicted if i was doing my job i should have come here with marcel in the middle of the afternoon taken you downtown im not kidding you he said ill go ill go right now ill beat this and then no god damn it no were not doing that he waited then what she slumped onto one of the kitchen chairs i dont know i dont have any idea she was about to cry ill give you a dollar if you let me come over and hug you he crossed the room went down on a knee and put his arms around her shoulders dont worry he said its going to be all right how she was shaking against him what are we going to do i cant see you you cant even be here if i dont take you in im committing a felony myself in fact i am now how can i commit a felony youre right you cant he said look ill just turn myself in ill call hardy find out where he lives show up at his house and have him do it but i dont want to leave you to them even to him i want you to be here this cant be the only time were ever going to get i cant i just cant i mean we just started and its so good graham its so good dont you feel that her cheeks were wet now and he wiped the tears gently away weve had a few days he said well hold on to them hows that we wont lose this you dont know that who knows how long youll be in jail with the trial even if you win ill win she shook her head sniffling but what if you dont i will nobodys going to be able to prove i did anything wrong ill beat it and however long it is well get through it okay she shook her head again i dont know i dont know how we can if we can we will i promise ive been looking for this for too long and now weve got it im not letting you go and thats all there is to it hardy was intensely unhappy with grahams disappearance but there wasnt anything he could do about it now the police would probably find him first and hardy would get a call from jail meanwhile he did have other clients who needed consistent if perhaps lowlevel effort he tried to leave friday afternoons open for the motions and correspondence that covered a decent part of the overhead of a small commercial practice like his own he was just finishing up a memo for one of these clients when he looked up and saw abe glitsky standing in his open doorway momentarily startled hardy sat back now i know how you must feel people turning up in your office without any warning hey wasnt today the day tell me your doors been installed its in glitsky nodded but there was a set to his features he wasnt here to talk about his door whats the matter the lieutenant took a step into the room i tell you something in confidence as a friend and you take it to the da and try to make your own juice out of it i feel kind of like youre a sackofshit lawyer instead of my old pal any profanity from glitsky was unusual but a directed vulgar insult was unheard of serious you want to come in im sorry i was wrong glitsky didnt move i dont think i do im just here with the message so youd know i knew dan tosca was allowing himself to be treated to a nice dinner at firenze by night lanier had wanted the information sooner if he could have gotten it and now technically it was too late the attorney general had already got its indictment on graham russo though he and his partner hadnt been able to serve the warrant lanier didnt really think there would be anything with sal russos business dealings that might complicate the investigation into his death but as it turned out he was wrong tosca was eating coniglio con pancetta lanier called it bunny and bacon and marcel was having spaghetti and meatballs so i was surprised mostly because i hadnt heard a word about it but it was a heart attack youre sure tosca shrugged pushing sauce around his plate with a piece of bread nobodys sure of anything come right down to it but pio gets a pain in his chest he goes to the hospital he dies pio pio yeah ermenigeldo pio he ran the fish operation for who tosca lowered his voice it was his shop he built it up and how big was it not just russos the whole thing dollar volume thirty thirtyfive a month tosca shrugged agreeing people like fish everybodys worried about cholesterol me he pointed down at his plate i like this i dont worry about it marcel put his fork down i dont feel good about pio dying just now a smile i bet he dont either and its not now it was last week this really set off warning bells like all veteran cops lanier set little store in coincidence they do an autopsy why it was a heart attack guys sixtytwo probably didnt eat enough fish tosca speared some meat but you ask me its all genes anyway you get your time then youre dead youre a philosopher arent you dan another shrug part time look if it makes you feel better i can tell you this has nothing to do with sal russo and his one truck of fish pio was doing vans hes got a fleet hes doing half moon bay up to tomales seven days a week so whos doing that now whos taking that over toscas eyes twinkled i dont think thats all settled yet he reached over the table and patted laniers arm a vacuum like this comes up theres always a little power struggle itll work itself out but i guarantee you this has nothing to do with sal russo if it was all fish lanier could believe that even at the enormous volumes they were discussing but if it was anything else you would tell me if youd run into drugs wouldnt you tosca put his fork down marcel this is not how dope is handled you know this you got your koreans your vietnamese the chinatown tongs your longhairs bunch of guinea pescadores go up against these hardons i dont think so besides i thought you told me you were arresting the boy his son we are and wasnt there some magazine story he admitted it yeah tosca spread his hands so whats the problem sarah wasnt sure whether it had been her idea or grahams but somehow theyd decided they would spend a last weekend together after which graham would turn himself in but it wouldnt be in san francisco where the risk was too great sarah already felt so compromised that she barely considered what difference another day or two would make especially over a weekend graham had a saturday tournament across the bay if his team won he would have more money for his defense which he would need so at ninefifteen saturday morning they parked at the tournament site a multidiamond complex in a valley surrounded by oakstrewn rolling green foothills graham was pulling his bat bag from his trunk when a trim man in a designer sweatsuit gold chain sunglasses came jogging up i cant believe it i cant believe youre here graham turned hey craig how you doin a bounce of the shoulders we got games im here grahams macho pose was kicking back in sarah saw little sign of the man shed been with for the past week for whom she was sacrificing everything this untouchable athlete needed no one it was an unsettling moment but this man craig was going on youre having some week arent you i know some important people let me tell you and i dont know anybody whos ever been on the cover of time its just stuff around me graham said im here to play ball thats all he put out his hand to include sarah bring her up to them this is a friend of mine sarah evans sarah craig ising our sponsor shaking hands with him sarah was struck by his relative youth he wasnt much older than they were certainly not over forty from grahams description of him really from what she knew he must be worth she had expected someone in his fifties at least half an hour later sarah was eating a snokone watching the teams warm up ising appeared from somewhere and sat next to her so you been seeing my star a long time couple of weeks she said you live in the city yeah she glanced out the side of her sunglasses howd you find graham i knew his dad sal you knew him too graham talks about him a lot yeah hell of a funny guy was i mean shame about that he had some great jokes anyway graham was in triple a and got cut and sal told me i ought to try him out im glad i did kids made me a bundle thats nice hes mature you know a leader she smiled i like him already craig so what was it you bought fish from sal naw he lowered his voice he had protection you know he was good luck sarah felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck what do you mean protection the game had started and the shortstop for the hornets took a hit away from the first batter going deep into the hole when ising sat down again sarah repeated her question im just curious protection from what this kind of thing fascinates me ising impressing the pretty girl unraveled the mystery for her he was connected i dont know somebody way up there he looked like a bum and nobody touched him so how did you meet him one of my friends i do a little betting maybe graham told you these games other things so sometimes cash moves around downtown youre saying sal carried this cash he playfully hit her lightly on the knee hey you got a knack for this sarah im not kidding you yeah you give sal a paper bag and a bill and off he goes he stopped lately he must have known he was getting forgetful didnt want to lose track of anybodys money all those names she was thinking all those numbers they werent the people who supplied his fish to him could it be they were gamblers highstakes gamblers did graham know about this i dont know you ought to ask him hey by the way he was fishing in his pockets for something and came out with a business card his name and a number dont take this wrong but it wasnt real clear are you and graham an item she shrugged close kind of well he handed her the card if it doesnt work out give me a call i have a pretty good time i can see that she said smiling at him ill keep it in mind right after hardy got up saturday hed called glitsky to apologize again and the nanny told him the lieutenant was busy she didnt know when hed be available he asked her to make sure and give him the message that his friend hardy was a horses ass but he wasnt sure shed deliver it verbatim then while he was telephoning hed tried graham russos home for the fun of it and gotten the expected result nothing then frannie reminded him that the kids had arranged for some school chums to come over and play and frannie was going to her saturday jazzercize class so hardy was in charge shed told him didnt he remember of course he did he had told her although this was a lie he said he was just teasing her so for three hours hardy had babysat although as his wife never tired of telling him he shouldnt think of it as babysitting they were his children he wasnt merely watching them he was their father responsible for their guidance and development too true he admitted every time this topic surfaced he even believed it but there were moments as for example when five pretenyearolds were playing some kind of parade game with every pillow blanket cushion and stuffed animal in the entire house on the livingroom floor that his parental role seemed limited more or less to just babysitting neither his kids nor their friends really cried out to have old dad guiding their development at that particular moment this was not to say there was not a great deal of crying out in general and screaming and giggling and fighting and running around and hardy never for a moment doubted that if he wasnt in babysitting mode they would destroy the house as surely and as efficiently as vesuvius had destroyed pompeii finally frannie came home hardy nearly insane with enduring the kid stuff asked her if she minded if he took a little break hed be back in a while going for a jog until three years before hardy had been religious about running a fourmile circle from his house on th avenue out to the beach south as far as lincoln then back east along lincoln to park presidio up through golden gate park and back home frannie warned him that maybe he should warm up for a week or so get back in some aerobic condition before tackling four miles to which hed beaten his chest like tarzan getting a big laugh from the kids their dad was funny and told his wife hed be home in fortyfive minutes he was still in shape he had never given the workout much thought it had been part of his daily routine today before hed even made the fifteen or so downhill blocks to the beach he was truly winded but never one to let a little physical discomfort stand in his way especially when he thought it could be overcome by an act of will he turned south and kept jogging frustrated by the burning in his lungs and leg muscles he decided hed just show his uncooperative body who was boss and run in the soft sand not the hard pack by the breakers when he finally realized that the cramp that stopped him a mile farther on was not a fatal heart attack he was in a real pickle he hadnt brought either his wallet or keys so now at the farthest possible point from his house he was stopped in agony without cab fare or id he was going to have to walk or limp home hed better start walking getting back home wasnt going to be quick it was sometime after noon and the wind off the ocean had picked up his sweat glands worked fine and the dampness of the sweats he wore made it even colder he wasnt going to make it home he would die here limping on the beach the fineblowing sand would imbed itself into his damp sweatsuit his very pores and turn to cement and leave him permanently frozen in place he could see it clearly generations hence tourists would flock to san francisco to the binoculars at the cliff house and pay a quarter to look down the beach and marvel in wonder at the origins of the manlike form that had magically appeared one day in the late nineties an eternal sandstone monument to middleaged flabbiness and stupidity it took him nearly an hour and a half to get home from the beach he had a bath tried glitsky and graham again to no avail got in a twentyminute nap he was going to survive although the next few days might not be much fun that night he and rebecca were having their own date the word had a lot of emotional resonance in the family due to the traditional wednesday date night theyd instituted something of the sort with their kids hardy with the beck frannie with vincent he and his daughter got to north beach with time to kill before their dinner reservation so they strolled the neighborhood together the becks dress was a flounced floral print in pinks and greens she wore black patent leather shoes and white tights holding hands flushed with excitement to be in the grownup world with her dad rebecca chartered her way through the tail end of chinatown with its ducks hanging whole in the windows its bushels of strange green vegetables and even stranger brown tubers on the sidewalks its fish in tanks live poultry in cages can we go in one sure in front of them a tiny asian woman ordered something and the man behind the counter took a turtle from a tank and a cleaver from the butcher block eviscerating and cleaning it as he would have any other foodstuff i didnt know people ate turtles she whispered as they left hardy bought an orchid from a street vendor and leaned down to arrange it under his daughters hair band they quickly passed rebecca silent holding hardys hand tightly through the gaudy tourist saturdaynight gauntlet of strip shows and adult theaters the hawkers and gawkers and rubes from out of town and then up broadway by the tunnel to the quiet serenity of alfreds at their banquette the beck smiled at her father with an adoring radiance her strawberryblond hair was pulled back off her broad unlined forehead usually hidden by bangs it made her look three or four years older her manners were flawless what a little doll such a charming child you are one lucky man you must be so proud of her the two of them rebecca was meant to hear took the compliments in stride modestly graciously thanks she is a gem isnt she i know her dad is so proud of her it was difficult to reconcile the sophisticated daughter who sat across from him now dazzling the waiters and staff with the jellycovered dervish of the morning but then hardy realized it would be equally difficult to recognize the wellgroomed man in the dark suit as the limping teethchattering hunchback of ocean beach hed been only a few hours ago and for the lady the waiter asked she ordered a shirley temple in a martini glass to go with her fathers bombay after the drinks arrived they clinked their glasses to you hardy said im so glad we do this rebecca looked down demurely me too she sipped and put the glass down carefully then looked back up at him daddy that man youre helping why did he kill his father out of the mouths of babes he thought well i dont know if he did they said at school he did they did huh she nodded solemnly because he was sick the dad i mean we had a big talk about it if it was okay they said he killed him because he was so sick but i know i wouldnt want to kill you even if you were sick then i wouldnt have you anymore no thats true you wouldnt hardy searched for an approach have you been thinking about this a lot she shrugged a little i mean i know youre helping him right so you must think its all right i dont think its bad hon not necessarily it depends on the person whos sick i think if he wants to die but that would mean hed want to leave his son too well hardy rubbed at the table with his fingertip not that hed want to but what if he was hurting all the time what if i was you wouldnt want me to spend my life suffering would you but i wouldnt want you to die he reached across the table and put his hand on top of hers this is just something were talking about beck im not going to die okay were talking about my clients dad and he was old and really really sick i think he wanted to die and he needed his son to help him he couldnt trust anybody else to do it right well then why is there going to be a trial if it was the right thing because the law says its wrong but sometimes things that are against the law arent really wrong theyre just against the law he heard himself uttering these words and wondered if he really believed them when hed been a prosecutor the distinction wouldnt have mattered a fig to him he wondered if he was beginning to even think like a defense attorney and for the millionth time wasnt sure if he was comfortable with it but rebecca her face betraying every nuance of the quandary hadnt lost the thread like what what isnt wrong but is against the law he searched his brain well you know those places we passed coming here with all those posters of naked women yeah that was gross it might be gross or whatever but its not against the law it might not be the way youd want to choose to live to do that kind of stuff you might even think its wrong but its still not against the law he squeezed her hand are you sure you want to talk about this is this a little serious a frown daddee im nine you know i think about a lot of things i know i know you do he smiled at her this justicefreak daughter of his with a passion for knowing whats right and whats wrong and the example hed just given her was backwards something perhaps morally suspect but within the law he wanted the opposite to make the point okay lets start over maybe i used the wrong word like wrong for instance theres the law right right okay so the law is just a bunch of rules thats all it is some good rules and some rules where it doesnt make too much sense that they even have the rule the point is though good or bad if you break one of the rules youre going to get punished thats another one of the rules right but sometimes you break a rule a law because you think theres no reason for it or its just plain wrong now youre still going to get punished because you cant allow people to just go breaking the rules but maybe when you go to trial to get punished people will realize that the law is dumb and theyll change it like what hardy thought a moment for a clean example well like it used to be against the law for black people to sit on buses with white people i know but that was just stupid of course but it was a law nevertheless until this lady named rosa parks oh i know all about that we learned that in school she sat on the bus and they went on strike yeah well and then they changed the law and then it wasnt against the law for black people to sit on buses it was the same thing in this case a right thing but one day it was against the law and the next day it was okay it wasnt the thing itself it was the rule is this making any sense sure i get it completely okay i bet you do anyway this thing with graham my client its a little like that example but not exactly im not sure the law about letting you kill your father or mother ought to be changed why not because then how do you decide for sure whether or not its a good reason if the person whos sick really wants it or even knows whats happening hardy decided to test his martini buy another few seconds to think or sometimes sick people are really hard to take care of and maybe the people taking care of them get tired of it and just want the person to go away that would be horrible well yes it would but if there wasnt some law preventing it it might happen theres just all kinds of problems its really really complicated but in this case what graham did might not have been wrong i think i hope she met his eyes i know daddy if youre helping him he didnt do the wrong thing hardy had to laugh you know that huh cross my heart graham and his father didnt only have hallmark moments who do you think you are telling your old man what to do though it wasnt yet ten in the morning sal had been drinking he took a feeble swing at his son as though he were going to cuff him im the dad here you are just my little snotnosed kid and you do what i tell you not the other way round graham easily ducked away from the roundhouse but that was the only thing that was going to be easy about this morning we got an appointment sal the doctor you remember i aint going to no doctor i told you they take my drivers license what am i supposed to do for a living graham tried to remain patient this is dr cutler sal my friend not the other one whats his name finer theyre all the same finer cutler i dont care im not going he had settled himself onto his couch arms crossed the picture of resistance there was a flask on its side on the table in front of him and he grabbed it and swigged from it you know how tired i am of getting poked at yeah i do dad almost as tired as i am of all this graham thought and russ cutler had told him the ad was only going to get worse unless this brain tumor turned out to be inoperable which the good news looked like the diagnosis graham didnt think it was funny but the irony didnt escape him hed brought sal down to russ cutler for the alzheimers sals eccentricity had suddenly become far less manageable graham had wanted an opinion whether his father should be left to live alone or should be placed in the dreaded home would he even know it if he was alzheimers wasnt cutlers specialty but he knew enough the disease began almost imperceptibly with smaller losses of shortterm memory gradually becoming larger more all encompassing the distant past began to assume a more immediate reality than the present for graham the most heartrending aspect of the situation was its apparently random appearance forgetfulness then a reversion to normalcy or near normalcy you kept wanting to deny that it had reached a point of no return you kept hoping up until a couple of months ago he had spent lots of time with his father making his fish rounds playing cards going to meals taking walks graham trying to get his own reality into focus what he was going to do with his life where if anywhere he fit in and sal had been great his best friend a wise albeit vulgar counselor playmate drinking buddy but then all at once sal wouldnt be there in an almost literal sense he wouldnt know who graham was son my ass i havent seen either of my sons in fifteen years who the hell are you trying to fool what do you want out of me you think youre going to get my money you got another think coming the hours graham had spent camped in the stinking hallway of the lions arms making sure sal didnt go out when he was this way it was killing graham never mind sal so he d gone to russ and learned that this randomness was part of the progress of the disease until finally the brain didnt appear to process anymore whether or not it did was impossible to say and even then russ had told him youll go into the nursing home to visit your dad one day he hasnt said a meaningful word in six months and hell look up and know you and say hi like it was yesterday and maybe for him it was but then theyd found the tumor and would be doing the tests on that that was today the first of these tests the tumor if it wasnt fatal might be affecting the alzheimers moving its schedule forward although that too wasnt more than informed conjecture it was possible that arresting the tumors growth might inhibit sals memory loss for a time come on dad dr cutlers going to be waiting for us hes a good guy but sals eyes were closed now he had collapsed to one side on the couch his pants were wet at the crotch either alcohol or urine god graham couldnt keep doing this for long he wished the old man would have the good grace to go and die the ritual of a cup of coffee over the newspaper had fallen victim on most days to the mad rush of getting the kids washed dressed fed teeth brushed hair combed lunches made out the door to school but sundays still had some of that old charm hardy and frannie were still in their bed with the sunday paper spread out all around them they had their mugs of coffee last night before hed left north beach with rebecca he stopped and picked up some cannoli and biscotti and the crumbs in the sheets would have to be dealt with but later vincent and rebecca hadnt slept in on a weekend dont be absurd but for the moment were cooperating in building the worlds largest lego castle both of them quiet and happy hardy had cracked one of the windows two inches to let in some fresh air sunshine filled the whole room the telephone rang the portable phone by their bed had disappeared so someone was going to have to get up and answer at the kitchen extension frannie flashed a smile at hardy the walk might do you some good after your jog yesterday but she was up answering it reappearing a moment later she stood in the doorway her hand up through her long red hair one foot resting on the other one its graham russo she said it was also bay to breakers sunday every year upward of a hundred thousand people flock to the city by the bay to run approximately seven miles from the ferry building on the bay to ocean beach although only about one tenth of one percent of these people come to compete in any meaningful way the event has evolved into a party of significant proportions there are running teams outfitted as caterpillars barefoot teams naked runners participants who sprint for the first three blocks and then duck into bars to watch themselves on television grandmothers children dogs snakes marching no jogging bands a party graham russo called hardy from jack london square in oakland he told his attorney hed gone into hiding for a few days to make some decisions to consider his options now it was time if hardy would like to take the alameda ferry over and meet him graham was ready to turn himself in they could talk strategy and graham would answer hardys questions as they chugged back across the bay as a plan it wouldnt have been bad on most days but it left the race out of the equation hardy hadnt even gotten to his car when the crowds and traffic around his house told him something was going on after a minutes reflection even before yesterdays painful reminder of his lack of conditioning hardy had never been a bay to breakers kind of guy he realized what he was dealing with he knew it was going to be iffy taking a ferry anywhere in the next several hours even getting to the ferry building was going to be a challenge but he tried hed told graham hed be there in an hour maybe a little more though he had been hoping for less clients about to turn themselves in on murder charges had been known to change their minds since the route of the race was along the edge of golden gate park which was several blocks south of the main eastwest corridor geary boulevard he thought he might have some hope of making it he vaguely knew that the race began at about eight oclock and it wasnt yet ten it was possible he knew that some of the participants still hadnt crossed the starting line they queued up for miles along the embarcadero before the gun that started the race so maybe the outbound arteries wouldnt be clogged yet with people whod finished and were leaving the city to go to their postrace parties and indeed he got nearly to van ness the western edge of downtown before things stopped dead after ten minutes at one corner he got out of his car and looked around him the honking was in full blare lines of cars glaring in the bright sunlight stretched out in all directions a river of humanity waving singing highfiving having a great old time on that fabled runners high although few were actually running flowed by there was no place even to pull over and park after which he could try to walk it he wasnt going anywhere for at least a couple of hours vincent had a birthday party to attend in the early afternoon and while that went on frannie and rebecca met her grandmother frannies first husbands mother erin for a picnic on the cliffs just outside the legion of honor so no one was home to answer grahams next couple of calls though hardy did hear them on his answering machine progressively angry and frustrated when he finally arrived back at the house a little after four he was somewhat angry and frustrated himself the last incoming ferry was at the dock in alameda graham sat in a windbreaker next to his duffel bag on one of the pilings by the gangplank where it tied up sarah as she had when the last four boats had docked hung back by the shops when grahams lawyer came up to him she was planning to leave and go home but they both agreed there was no sense in graham waiting all afternoon alone until hardy showed and now it looked like he wasnt going to sarah was really unhappy that hardy hadnt found a way to get to graham what the hell kind of lawyer was he anyway hes a good guy he said something must have happened what could have happened he shrugged maybe he was on an earlier ferry and we just missed each other with you sitting here on a piling that everybody has to walk past no youre visible he wouldnt have missed you a last group of passengers disembarked and started up the gangplank four couples in their twenties and face paint not sober laughing a lot wearing bay to breakers tshirts over the body armor theyd evidently run in graham and sarah had spent the whole day here saying goodbye preparing themselves for what was to come every time a ferry had arrived the tension had overwhelmed them where was hardy what was going to happen to graham now to them everything else was invisible now suddenly together they both realized what they were looking at bay to breakers sarah said smart of us to pick today graham picked up his duffel bag i think our timings off that must be it they were stopped in the middle of the bay bridge when she brought it up to him it had been haunting her since shed been so thoroughly uncharmed by craig ising the day before she had to get it clear you know your friend craig ising he interrupted her hes not my friend he pays me thats our entire relationship this while gratifying was not the point well whatever he is he told me your dad used to deliver money around the city for him and some other gamblers yeah he did so what dont get mad im trying to get a handle on your father thats all who he was but graham took offense at this tack he lived on the fringe sarah okay he sold illegal fish he might have run some money so sue him im not saying yes you are maybe he wasnt a good citizen but theres no way he did anything that hurt anybody hes not so unlike his oldest son that way what way exactly you follow the rules you play fair and you get screwed anyway it makes you lose faith in the sacred rules he lowered his voice youre doing it here with me sarah right now the rules dont work sometimes then what do you do you dont break them i know that or if you do she added mostly for herself when youre caught and punished you dont whine about it he looked over at her the strong face the set jaw he reached across and put a hand on her leg hey he said gently i shouldnt have put you in this im sorry she let out a breath i put myself in this graham if i didnt want to be here i wouldnt be and i know people break rules all the time and sometimes it seems justified what i was trying to get to was sal if running this money around might have gotten him killed graham let out a sigh of his own but he stopped a long time ago how long i dont know couple of years at least youre sure i think so yeah when he started forgetting more he thought it wouldnt be safe which is what im getting at graham pondered for a minute his feet up on the dashboard it was just dusk the window on his side was open and the skyline was a sparkling jewel over the darkening water he wouldnt have started up again there was no reason to he didnt need the money and it wasnt that much anyway a hundred now and again not worth the risk he might forget and lose enough money for somebody to make them mad at him maybe that somebody ran into him recently last week even asked for a favor one time and he forgot or forgot that he would forget and said okay and then what im just thinking it might be a motive thats all graham put his hand on her leg sarah we dont need a motive he killed himself she turned to him stop saying that graham please nobody believes that i do she moved his hand off her its not true thats why i dont believe it i know what happened well enough now im just trying to come up with some theories that might help your defense this might be one of them another silence graham looked across at her so what did happen that youre so sure of graham come on no really i want to know she took her eyes from the road it didnt matter they were barely creeping what are you saying she finally asked what are you saying he shot back at her after all this time after everything you still think i killed sal im saying somebody was there if it was you helping him it wouldnt matter to me graham thats what im saying it would matter to me jesus sarah dont you believe anything ive told you dont yell at me please dont yell at me she was afraid to look over at him again her eyes were glued to the road hands tight on the wheel at ten and two because ill tell you something she said somebody was there somebody did help him die or killed him abe glitsky stood in the main doorway to the homicide detail seemingly unable to move his mouth opened and closed a few times but no words came out it was the beginning of a new week and most of his inspectors were already in the big open room sitting at their desks drinking coffee while doing paperwork going over their days schedule writing reports on witness interviews taking notes on transcripts busy busy busy no one looked up abe wasnt going to give anyone the satisfaction he finally got his legs moving and walked into his office closing the door quietly behind him his door installed and freshly varnished on friday with a nice newwood yellowish finish wasnt yet completely covered with bumper stickers and wanted posters and shooting targets from the police range but someone or a team of trained professionals had done a pretty good job getting to most of it there was even a bullet hole the centerpiece was a large picture of bozo the clown with the international symbol for no through it taking deep breaths he sat at his desk the room seemed smaller with the door closed he couldnt see anybody outside the windows in the drywall he had not been able to before the door was in either but he hadnt noticed now he suddenly felt cut off from the detail he steeled himself and finally brought his eyes right inside the door looked pretty much the same as it had on friday new and nicely varnished except for where the bullet had splintered the wood around its exit hole he remembered that years before during one or other of the endless labor disputes in which the city always seemed to be embroiled some unknown and never apprehended officers had released chickens on a friday night into the offices of police chief dan rigby apparently some felt at that time that their chief was acting in a chickenshit manner not standing up for the demands of his troops it was a notsosubtle but ultimately effective way to express their displeasure glitsky didnt think there was anything like that going on here the detail wasnt in the midst of any turmoil that he knew of he got along with everybody pratt he thought her staff but no not here in the detail nobody who worked with her would have risked it this was just a practical joke he didnt find it very funny but he remembered that rigby hadnt laughed all that much about the chickens either in fact rigbys reaction had been so over the top that it had cost him some respect glitsky wasnt going to have that happen to him he was going to remain cool and never mention it to a soul but he was as mad as hed ever been pushing back from the desk he walked over and scratched away at the splintered wood the hole went all the way through instinctively he searched the opposite wall there it was up by the ceiling the next place the bullet had hit he couldnt believe that some idiot inspector goofing off would discharge a firearm in the building even if it had been during the weekend when the odds of hitting someone with the bullet were marginally lower for just a second he toyed with the idea maybe he could find the slug somewhere in the building and run ballistics on it and all the weapons of his inspectors this might identify the shooter whom he would then publicly humiliate horribly torture and then fire not necessarily in that order he crossed over to the hole sure enough the slug had been pried out of course he realized these were pros idiots but professional idiots whoever did it had customized themselves a light load of powder probably not as light as theyd intended but theyd given the matter some thought and then dug the slug out and disposed of the evidence pros his telephone jarred him back to where he was glitsky hardy he was already angry enough and now hardy wanting to banter his way back into his good graces what do you want you get a message over the weekend yeah great youre sorry i got that friday too at your office remember sorrys a big help is that it im busy a pause thats not it im bringing graham russo in this morning i wanted to let you know thats really swell thanks ill pass it along he hung up took another look at his very own bullet hole then opened the door and went out into the detail graham spent the night alone on edgewood and called hardy as soon as he got up before sunrise ha ha yeah that was funny they agreed the whole bay to breakers thing hardy picked him up on the way in to work now they were in his office on either end of the couch the doors were closed behind them phyllis was holding calls although hardy had already phoned out to glitsky but the morning paper had contained yet another new story about his client he wanted to ask graham about it barbara brandt the sacramento lobbyist had taken a lie detector test for sharron pratt saying that shed spoken to graham on the day sal died and she passed ostensibly she was telling the truth so what about that hardy asked she says she counseled you before you went over to your dads and youre telling me you dont know her you got it graham in slacks and a sport jacket was shaking his head no he seemed truly baffled i have no idea where shes coming from diz i never met her in my life no correct that she called me once hardy was sitting with studied casualness legs crossed hands clasped on his lap graham she took a lie detector test and passed it i dont care ill take one too i dont know her shes got to be some fruitcake shes a lobbyist in sacramento graham smiled i rest my case hardys brow was etching itself a few new lines you dont know her he repeated a last time then what i dont know maybe its some kind of publicity stunt but she did talk to you on the phone graham was showing his impatience we didnt even get to what she wanted he shifted forward elbows on knees i still dont know what she wants what does this get her hardy was wondering the same thing youre on the cover of time it was a sympathetic article maybe shes on your coattails for her cause graham sat back but the conclusions in time the way he made it all sound it was all wrong this was what hed argued about with sarah although he couldnt very well tell that to hardy right now i never went inside diz i went over early sal wasnt home i left i didnt talk to any barbara brandt or anybody else im not lying there was real anguish in his voice and hardy was almost glad to hear it maybe graham was at last starting to get some understanding of the predicament he was in but there was still one last hurdle before hardy could sign on for the duration and they had to jump it now okay graham youre not lying thats good news i believe you but the bad news is i might not be able to stay on with this case thats not funny but its true graham looked at him imploringly he hung his head for a teat looked back up why not this was his least favorite part but hardy had to explain his position as it stands now youre into me for maybe four hundred dollars two hours its been more than that hardy waved off the objection were talking round figures four hundred gets us to here but if i continue and we go to trial then you get most of my time for most of a year or else i take the public defender thats right theres some good lawyers in that office i could recommend but graham stopped him so could i i know those guys they got fifty cases going all the time id be one of them hardy didnt want to waste breath arguing it many public defenders were decent enough trial attorneys but graham was right in general workload remained a factor in quality of defense but they couldnt sit here all day either hardy had already alerted glitsky that he was bringing graham to the hall and judging from the lieutenants mood he wouldnt put it past him to send a car down here and make the arrest in hardys office a little object lesson in the etiquette of friendship how about this graham asked you take me on for a small retainer say a couple of grand and after six weeks you tell the judge im busted then the court appoints you to represent me and it pays you hardy was shaking his head no i dont do that yeah i dont blame you its pretty sleazy so where does that leave us you want a private attorney youve got to pay for one thats the way it works i know youre right he pulled an envelope from the inside pocket of his sport coat deduct the four hundred i already owe you and thats eleven thousand six hundred hardy flicked at the envelope a few times then left it on the couch got up and walked over to the window he hated this there was a time he knew when he would have taken this case literally for nothing he would have lived on beans and burgers and somehow made it work but it wasnt only him now he had a family that depended on him absolutely he thought of talleyrands axiom that a married man with children will do anything for money leaving aside the thornier question of where this money had come from he turned back im sorry graham its not close not even as a retainer i could sign a promissory note for the rest and what about if youre convicted its notoriously hard to make a good living in prison he didnt mean to be such a hardass but he knew this was gentle compared to what graham would be facing in the coming months if you put my beemer up for sale you could probably clear another twentyfive sals baseball cards maybe another thirty except that sals cards arent yours theyre under seal since graham was going to be charged with killing sal for the money and the baseball cards if he was convicted those items would be permanently confiscated by the state they were untouchable assets but hardy badly wanted this case hed been living with it for a couple of weeks and he couldnt imagine letting it go now hed committed thirtyseven thousand dollars twelve in the envelope and twentyfive from the bmw wasnt going to cut it for a years work in a murder trial but it was a reasonable retainer under normal business conditions theyd just have to figure some other way hardy was convinced that graham was doing his best to show good faith although he really didnt want to think about the provenance of the cash in the envelope he was holding it was probably money saved from his softball tournaments maybe left over from his wellpaying law job it broke the first law of the defense attorney which is get your payment up front but hardy did not care as with all acts of faith it was irrational and in many ways unexplainable it was just something he felt he had to do all right graham he said my fees are two hundred an hour twice that at trial you want to sign a note that youll pay it all when this is over no matter how it comes out it was a nobrainer maybe hardy thought on both sides and graham gave it all the time it deserved about a second yeah ill do that hardy put out his hand then you got yourself a lawyer when hardy returned to his office in the late afternoon there was a call from helen taylor grahams mother a cultured voice saying shed like to make an appointment at his earliest convenience to discuss the case of course we want to help graham any way we can are we allowed to come and visit him at the jail where did he go this last week do you know when is he being whats the word arraigned thats the word tomorrow morning nine am but these things arent very exact in terms of time he explained understating considerably if youre there at ninethirty superior court department twentytwo you wont miss it we can meet after that ill be there she said my husband too fine hardy replied ill be the one in the suit standing next to your son lanier and evans had spent the afternoon going door to door in hunters point questioning the residents who lived near one of the neighborhoods busiest intersections wondering whether any of them had noticed the fusillade of eighty shots from at least three different weapons last thursday night that had killed two teenagers and wounded four others broken sixteen windows and set off alarms in five of the streetfront businesses mostly nobody had seen or heard a thing thursday no thursday be pretty quiet most times sarah had been in the game a long time so this didnt surprise her but it did make her angry between them she and marcel had located and interviewed a grand total of three witnesses who had seen the car drive up and fire randomly into the crowd gathered on the corner but it had been dark and there was no telling the make or model or the color or size or sex of the driver or other occupants if any what really gets me sarah was a few minutes into milkshake therapy at the closest mcdonalds is they treat it like its a natural disaster some act of nature nobodys fault it just happens since this was the essence of police work it didnt seem to faze marcel whod walked the walk through dozens of similar incidents i dont know why they make these things so thick i cannot get a drop out of this straw you think if i went back and told em i was a cop theyd add some milk or something heres a wild concept marcel you could use a spoon see just like im doing but doesnt it make you crazy he put the shake down and lifted his shoulders the thing is sarah nothing that happens is anybodys fault things just happen to people so you called it its a natural disaster but somebody did this marcel somebody drove up and shot these kids hey dont you go losing sleep over these poor kids somebody in that crowd had guns on em thats a guarantee and so you shoot at the whole crowd and miss marcel said dont forget that part you are not a true gangbanger if you actually hit any part of the person you go to take out you only hit bystanders its kind of like the unwritten rule maybe an inside joke im not sure which im going to go get a spoon when he came back to the table sarah was staring at nothing eyes glazed marcel slid in what now nothing lanier spooned some milkshake look sarah you want some free advice probably not but here it is you cant worry so much you take all this too seriously thanks but i wasnt thinking about this anymore im thinking about graham russo thats exactly what i mean graham russo is in jail that means were done with him until he goes to trial what are you thinking about wondering how much she could say she stirred at her shake theres something going on we dont know there has to be this is always true lanier said but a lot of whats going on doesnt have squat to do with our jobs this does look they ask us to go find everything we can to make sure russos not the wrong guy and give us three days to do it so we dont find it in three days it doesnt exist marcel was dipping his spoon his brain reluctantly engaged he nodded essentially okay now were six days down the road tosca tells you about a power struggle that sals smack in the middle of and i learn that theres at least some chance he was holding a big bag of cash on the day hes killed so what do we do with this information youre telling me you believe it doesnt relate lanier shrugged even if it does so what she just stared at him do you really think the attorney general of the state of california would bail on this now after sticking his neck so far out there is no chance i know dean powell he used to work here and soma jesus these guys could get an affidavit signed by two dozen eyewitnesses that graham russo was in new york for the week all around sals death and theyd say then he must have killed him by phone sarah sat back drummed her fingers on the table i mink we ought to tell abe cover ourselves if nothing else and whats he going to do lanier gave up on his milkshake pushing it aside look they got the grand jury to indict russo already hes in jail anything but a smoking gun in somebody elses hand and maybe not even that its not going to matter from now on the evidence talks except what weve found since friday he was shaking his head none of its evidence its all maybe and what if sure but theres a hell of a lot of it any other case wed still be looking around see what we found thats right well he took a moment well this case we dont lanier shrugged thats the way it is sarah knew that in general lanier was right that was the way it was they were in police work and it got ugly and intense you took a position and you held it against the odds if you needed to above all you did not criticize other cops if a person wanted touchyfeely there were lots of other places to look for work because sarah had come to believe that one suspect in her entire career was innocent this did not make her a bad cop a weak link shed prove that anytime she needed to abruptly she stood up hey marcel she said suck that up were going back to the point sarah had spent a lot of time at hunters point in the course of her career it was a rough place where over eightyfive percent of the adult population had either committed or witnessed a violent crime at the mcdonalds she suddenly realized that if they cruised the streets for a while in the neighborhood she could find some somebody here she could break and sure enough there was yolanda coming out of one of the boardedup establishments marcel pulled up and sarah was out of the car badge out hey i didnt do nothing what you comin at me for just get in yolanda were going to talk now she had the twentyyearold woman in the backseat of their unmarked car marcel was in plain sight on the corner not fifteen feet away but they werent going to goodcop badcop this witness sarah was going to get some answers herself i saw you at the jail the other day didnt i yolanda you were visiting damon down there again werent you how is damon damon frazee was a goateed weightlifter who occasionally did some mayhem on citizens as he had a couple of weekends before a friendly little bar fight with a knife or two unfortunately damon was looking at life in prison now under californias threestrikes law if convicted it would be his third violent offense and he would be gone from yolanda forever sarah figured she could work this to her advantage framed yolanda mumbled damon got hissef framed one of the brothers plant that knife on him did they a sullen nod but i aint do nothing you got no business taking me in im not taking you in im talking to you thats all im thinking maybe you can help damon aint nothing gonna help damon you lyin if you think so the poor mixedup girl was shaking biting at her nails her eyes were glistening with unshed tears suddenly sarah leaned in close snapping out her words like a drill sergeant get your fingers out of your mouth child and dont you dare call me a liar you hear me a sullen nod sarah slapped at the window by yolandas head i said do you hear me i hear you sarah hated this kind of interview but shed done it many times before and knew she would again too bad she was doing yolanda a favor but she was going to get what she came for now listen we got this shooting down here last thursday maybe you heard something about it she waited thats a question yolanda maybe you heard something about it silence what im thinking see if you remembered anything important anything i can use like who might have been in the car something like that who set it up what you heard about it anything maybe i can do something about damon the eyes almost more scared of hope than of anything else came up what you mean i mean we dont go for the strike the third strike he does some county time hes back home for thanksgiving if what what i said yolanda huddled down into herself i give them brothers up they come kill me what boys yolanda you give me a name one name we start looking maybe get enough evidence on em hardware in the cars trunk like that we dont even need you to testify at the trial this last was complete fabrication and sarah knew it but she wasnt lying about cutting a deal involving damon the cops would trade a thirdstriker for a gangbanger any day as for yolanda she was right if she did someday have to testify she might very well end up dead but sarah was willing to take that risk for her it was a tough profession yolanda looked up waited as though for further guidance it wasnt coming people here in the projects knew that if they didnt take help when it was offered it tended to disappear and sarah was right here nodding at her just give me a name yolanda one name lionel borden he hang the world gym most days he was drivin freeman was on the couch thumbing through one of the russo folders hardy at his desk had another half hour of work hed decided to try to leave the office at fivethirty so he could see his family but he was glad enough for the silent company after getting back from dropping graham at the jail hed put in two hours on tryptech good work too he thought tedious as hell but god was in the details checking his newly arrived records of past transom and conveyor failures at the port of oakland hed hit a vein in which there might be some pay dirt it seemed that only seven months before the accident with tryptech the port itself had sued the manufacturer who had produced the couplings for its transoms alleging irregularities in their holding capacities it didnt exactly get him up and dancing but he did call dyson brunei with the news and spent another forty minutes with michelle outlining their followup now more necessary tedium he was preparing the first of the binders hed be living with for the duration of grahams trial it was mindless and pleasant work labeling his tabs police report inspectors notes inspectors chronological autopsy coroner witnesses beginning to organize the discovery hed been given for grahams defense by the time he got to trial hed have a dozen binders jammed with everything even remotely connected to his client the victim the trial what he found scary was that hed have memorized most of it he looked up im getting to publicity david im going to need that folder freeman had his postworkday glass of wine at his elbow he spoke calmly you cant be considering change of venue hardy had to give it to his landlord he was joined at the hip to the issues but hardy thought if anyone would want a change of venue in this case it would be the prosecution san francisco after all was the town that had elected sharron pratt possibly the only prosecutor in the entire world who was more interested in helping and understanding lawbreakers than in punishing them this was still the city that had accepted the notorious diminishedcapacity twinkie defense when a supervisor had sneaked into a basement window in city hall shot the mayor to death reloaded walked down the hallway and then slain another supervisor the jurys decision in that case boy that shooter must have been pretty upset and besides he was on a sugar rush from all those twinkies and couldnt really be held responsible for his actions so as freeman loved to say it was a banner town for defense attorneys at any time and now under pratt even more so reasonable doubt had transmogrified here to any doubt at all the slightest doubt about any issue in the trial would likely result in acquittal this was good news for graham russo who would benefit from the citys kneejerk liberal bias so hardy wanted the trial here and graham had an absolute right to be tried where the alleged crime occurred here theyd stay but hardy resisted any tendency to feel complacent the stakes were too high to take anything for granted in a murder case no he told freeman im not going to ask for change of venue but id like to file all that stuff and head on home if youre finished reading it the accordion folder bulged with newspapers magazines nexis and lexis printouts everything hardy had found in print to date about the case ive got to just cut out the stuff about the case he said its going to be unmanageable if i throw in whole newspapers every day freeman was only half listening back with another article i wouldnt do that id save it all you never know you never know what hardy didnt always agree with the old man but he was always interested in his opinion freeman had forgotten more than many attorneys ever learned and if he wanted to talk theories hardy would listen context hardy repeated the word meaning what heres time right your boy on the cover he started flipping the pages i count at least eight related stories assisted suicide kevorkian supreme court ninth circuit states opposed and in favor heres a guy with lou gehrigs disease wants to live forever pulling the plug he closed the magazine it just goes on and on heres all your research for closing if you decide to go that way he reached up to the coffee table and grabbed a newspaper okay forget that obvious stuff heres the paper reporting sals death for the first time i myself noticed something in there apparently unrelated to your client that would arouse my curiosity if you cut out the graham articles youd never run across it hardy intrigued stepped over to the couch freeman handed him the newspaper his eyes challenging could hardy find it in a couple of minutes hed scanned the entire first section the story on sals death was near the back but there was nothing remotely relevant there a followup story on the enduring legacy of halebopp and the heavens gate crusaders a painter on the bay bridge had fallen to his death hardy closed the paper i give up freeman was savoring his wine enjoying that and his little puzzle front page another minute a shake of the head nothing i dont see it how about the bomb threat hardy reread the article the new federal courthouse had been evacuated a little before noon after someone had called in a threat i dont know david i dont think sal had anything to do with that i dont either but where is the courthouse freeman didnt need to explain any further thats what i mean by context son he said you got a hundred or so people maybe more milling outside in the alley under your victims window couple of hours before hes killed he shrugged i dont know what it means if anything maybe not probably not it just catches my interest thats all on its best day the third floor of the hall of justice was a study in controlled mayhem lawyers cops bailiffs clerks prospective jurors relatives and friends of defendants or victims the curious law students retirees reporters anyone with a legal or political ax to grind these folks would congregate in the wideopen hallways sometimes they didnt all get along unlike the federal courthouse with its renovated marblearched interiors inspiring confidence and even awe in the majesty of the law the hall of justice with its green paint and linoleum floors inspired nothing it was a big loud place where bureaucrats worked and deals got cut the minute hardy arrived for grahams arraignment he was noticed thats him he heard there he is the reporters were flies to his honey shoving microphones into his face shooting questions in their lowkey and dignified manner impeding his progress down the hall a couple of minicams were rolling and the bright lights nearly blinded him his peripheral vision had picked up some placards behind the knot of reporters there were a lot of bystanders today even for the hall the show after all was about to start no comment sorry i really cant say anything yet please ive got to get through here he went through the special extra metal detector set up outside department he knew it was for his case placed there to guard against the possibility that someone would try to kill his client to show the world that assisted suicide was wrong in the courtroom it was less frenetic although every seat in the gallery was taken the presiding calendar judge timothy manion a youthful darkhaired leprechaun with whom hardy had tipped several glasses back when theyd both been assistant das had ascended to the bench but appeared not to have called the first line a reference to the computer printout listing defendants and charges walking up the center aisle and through the rail hardy breathed a sigh of relief graham hadnt even been led out into the courtroom yet at the jury box attorneys waiting for their lines to be called could sit when there was an overflow gallery and hardy took one of the chairs next to an older courtroom regular this crowd here for you the man asked hardy said he thought so and the guy passed a business card over to him you need some motion work background checks anything im available hardy nodded friendly but it bothered him the hustling for clients for work it just never let up he glanced at the card then put it in his pocket ill keep it in mind thanks finally he got a chance to take in the surroundings he hadnt been in superior court for four years and it hadnt changed in any way high ceilings no windows the room was large and utterly bland in front of the bar rail the gallery held about a hundred and twenty people on uncomfortable theaterstyle seats of hard blond wood there was also standing room for another forty or so recognition was kicking in sharron pratt herself was here in the second row at the end of the jury box gil soma conferred with art drysdale hardy checked for dean powell but the attorney general was leaving it to his deputies then the gavel came down and all eyes went to the bench to the judges left a door at the back of the courtroom led to the defendants holding tank and as the fourth line was called this morning that door opened and graham russo was brought in there was an audible hum in the gallery that manion stilled with a warning glare hardy got up from his seat and went to meet his client at the podium in the center of the bullpen after his night in jail graham looked wan and tired and the orange jumpsuit reinforced that impression but when hardy asked him how he was doing he said okay then leaning across his attorney he whispered at the prosecution table hey gil when soma looked over graham smiled at him keeping his hand behind the podium so the judge couldnt see his body blocking it from the gallerys view he flipped him off hardy of course saw it he immediately covered grahams hand with his own but not in time your honor soma was up out of his chair the defendant just made an obscene gesture to me not obscene enough graham whispered shut up hardy ordered him he didnt know what soma hoped to achieve by bringing this little contretemps to the judges attention but hardy knew manion and he wasnt going to react well to any grandstanding particularly if it involved whining hed been rearranging his papers and now he raised his eyes mr hardy he said simply control your client i dont want any shenanigans in here is that understood this is a court of law yes your honor hardy said and decided then and there to take a gamble but for the record mr soma may be mistaken the judge sensing a pissing contest wanted to keep his busy day moving he bobbed his head and said noted keeping his own expression under tight control hardy threw a look at soma the message he was sure got delivered from now on every word counted to every play soma made no matter how small hardy would fashion a defense best let soma know he had a fight on his hands hardy would kick his ass in this courtroom if he could every time he could that knowledge might make the boy reckless it might make him scared if nothing else hardy had rattled his cage but the moment was just that a moment hardy knew indeed most of the courtroom knew what was coming next and a stillness settled as the judge looked straight at graham and intoned his name graham russo he began you are charged by indictment with a felony filed herein the words were pro forma but they always had an effect on the gallery there was a stir behind hardy manion glared for quiet but it didnt work this time some members of the gallery had come to make a stand this wasnt any felony it wasnt even wrong sal russo had a right to die the gavel when relative quiet had resumed the judge raised his voice so he could be heard all the way to the back of the room but his tone was mild i know a lot of you people have gone to some trouble to get down to this courtroom today but im not going to tolerate this kind of disturbance so all of you do yourselves a favor and do not interrupt these proceedings again i will remove every one of you all the hell out of here is that clear apparently it was mr russo manion repeated the formula continuing to wit a violation of section of the penal code in that you did in the city and county of san francisco state of california on or about the ninth of may willfully unlawfully and with malice aforethought and here the judge paused again as if he himself were questioning the language but he took a heavy breath and went ahead with it murder salvatore russo a human being manion then had the clerk read the special circumstances alleged by the prosecution murder in the course of a robbery when hed done the judge nodded how do you plead mr russo graham spoke right up not guilty your honor all right this wasnt any surprise manion consulted his computer sheet again this being a specialcircumstances case bail will be denied mr hardy do you have a comment yes your honor there is no way the prosecution can justify this as a specialcircumstances case my client should be allowed to post bail mr russo voluntarily turned himself in to the authorities yesterday soma was on his feet after hiding out for four days hardy turned to him he left town before he knew there was in indictment against him so he says the gavel came down manion wasnt yet angry sometimes calendar was so boring that these peccadilloes in courtroom etiquette were almost a relief to a judge who had to sit through eight hours of procedure but he didnt want to lose any more control gentlemen he reminded them all remarks get directed to me thats how we do it hardy apologized soma sat down drysdale put a restraining hand on his arm and hardy heard him whisper just listen all right mr hardy go ahead hardy made his case mr russo will surrender his passport your honor there is no risk of flight as ive already said he voluntarily turned himself in just yesterday as soon as hed returned to the city after a few days away manion appeared to be giving his argument some thought on the other hand he said special circumstances precludes the possibility for bail thats the law yes your honor i realize that hardy took a deep breath glanced at graham nodded and waited this was more argument than hed expected he suddenly wondered if manion subscribed to time people started coughing as time stopped for a while at last the judge invited counsel up to the bench hardy got there first and to his surprise found that soma had remained back at his table drysdale was standing next to him the kids a little excited judge he said quietly referring to soma no sweat art dont worry about it but this bail thing drysdale nodded theres no bail allowed thats the law judge apologetic really nothing drysdale could do about it i know the law but it seems to me what mr hardy says here is true theres very little if any flight risk right this was starting to make drysdale uncomfortable theres no bail allowed on specials your honor he repeated feebly but you do admit that this defendant is no danger to the community we cant be sure of that your honor but manion was running out of patience so there is no public policy reason to deny bail to mr russo theres no risk of flight and he poses no danger to anybody drysdale didnt even try to answer this time i dont suppose the people want to drop the specials manion was giving drysdale every opportunity to save face bail was permitted for nonspecialcircumstances murder all drysdale had to do was lower the charge it would still be a murder case but he was shaking his head i cant do that your honor in other words your office is simply making me deny bail to mr russo because it can is that what im hearing the judge disgusted shook his head next time you see mr powell art i want you to tell him he makes me proud to be an american would you do that he turned to hardy and offered a sympathetic smile i guess well be denying bail diz hardy hadnt planned to have lunch with the taylors maybe a little snack at lou the greeks but the arraignment had begun later than hed thought and then dragged on getting his case called had consumed an entire hour and before theyd finished getting a trial date three months hence another twenty minutes had gone away after that it had taken hardy the rest of the morning to see graham in jail where they had conferred for another twenty minutes or so in that time the bailiff had come up and conveyed the good news that the sheriff no doubt at manions urging was moving graham to an adseg cell for the duration of his confinement adseg short for administrative segregation was most often used when an inmate was in danger of being hurt among the general population of the jail in grahams case hardy was sure it was a courtesy so hardy finally got back to the hallway outside department at a little after noon helen and leland were sitting like statues sharing a wooden bench with an hispanic teenager who was breastfeeding her baby as hardy approached they stood and made their introductions and then leland with the force of edict had suggested lunch his office was up on market top floor of the bank he had his own private dining room his own chef theyd just take the limo it was not a particularly large room but it was beautiful with its hardwood floor the antique sideboard with its stunning floral arrangement of iris and gladioli the wall covering was a soothing green silk water had been poured hardy was seated in an amazingly comfortable upholstered armchair with a view to the northeast alcatraz and angel island there was chop on the bay a high covering of cirrus in front of him the table had been set for three white linen crystal china silver the setting was meant to intimidate although of course not obviously it simply made clear the line of command leland taylor was in touch with his inner self he knew who he was what he wanted how to get it and didnt unduly concern himself with internal doubts or how his actions might appear to others hardy thought this might be one of the perks of being born to and living a life insulated by great wealth leland was in charge an immutable fact of nature his time was more valuable than hardys his opinions more valid his stepsons lawyer was essentially staff a servant to do his bidding evidently some unspoken rule dictated that chitchat precede business mrs taylor helen had been carrying the conversational ball for twenty minutes she was good at it but hardy was relieved when they got down to tacks my wife was gratified to see youd never lost a case leland said in his reedy voice hardy sat back in his chair ive only done two murder trials ive been lucky he said modestly a dry chuckle lets hope its not that you seemed very sure of yourself in the courtroom that bail business what i heard is the judge a friend of yours i gather that would be to our advantage hmm hardy explained a little about the system normally cases stayed in department until the day of trial when they were sent at random to other courtrooms and the judges who would actually preside over the case this one was important however and got assigned now for trial in three months to judge jordan salter in department that way the judge who knew it was coming as well as the lawyers could prepare for unusual or unique issues that might arise hardy did not view the choice of salter a republican appointee and an old buddy of dean powell as propitious taylor put a hand over his wifes do we know him helen shook her head prettily everything she did was done prettily she was very attractive hardy thought nothing like what hed imagined a wife of sal russo could have been not that he imagined grahams mother would be unattractive it was more a matter of style this woman fit her husband leland to a t poised confident insincere anyway hardy said the judge can have some influence of course but it boils down to the case against graham which fortunately has a lot of holes there was no immediate response to this although glances were exchanged some message conveyed finally helen spoke do you think graham did this mr hardy killed sal for money no i dont its absurd leland said he could have all the money he wants by simply asking for it which of course he wont do helen added im afraid he doesnt want to feel in our debt which is i suppose noble enough but im his mother it would not be debt leland and i have discussed this but the fact remains hardy said he didnt feel comfortable asking did he the dynamic he saw was transparent enough there might not be monetary payback but there would be strings lots and lots of strings behavior issues how one acted and if hardy knew anything at all about graham he wasnt a string kind of guy we did help him with law school these petty details seemed distasteful to leland but he wanted them on the table although that would appear to have been money ill spent a tepid smile well he brought his hands together but thats not the point either is it we were just rather wondering how graham was intending to pay you youre not doing this whats the word pro bono i assume hardy smiled no grahams paying me but i cant really talk about those arrangements without his consent of course not leland said i wouldnt suggest a discreet knock on the door was immediately followed by a waiter bearing a tureen from which he ladled a dark clear consommé into their bowls after the waiter had gone leland tasted the soup to no comment or reaction it was perfect dark intense rich perfectly balanced perhaps the best soup hardy had ever tasted in his life and he had to say something thank you leland said in response to the compliment yes its quite nice conveying an air of what else could it be then he went back to graham precisely where they had left off on the money but helen would like to another glance at his wife actually wed like to help out monetarily i dont know hardy began only to have leland cut him off i have spoken to some of our attorneys here at the bank he said and they tell me theres no ethical question my understanding is that you would be free to accept remuneration from any source so long as it was understood that graham was your client that you represented his interests not ours is that correct hardy had to laugh this question doesnt exactly come up every day what you say sounds right though ill check and make sure id still want to talk to graham about it helen reached over and this time put her hand over lelands this was evidently some preemptivestrike code theyd worked out wed expect that wouldnt we leland of course a pause sure leland taylor wasnt a man who said sure very often and from hardys perspective it came out stilted but maybe not maybe everything just seemed a little bit skewed up here good helen said now mr hardy if we may can we ask how you plan to proceed hardy nodded you can ask he said but its pretty early ive barely begun looking at the evidence so anything i say now wouldnt be set in stone we understand that leland said they were definitely twoteaming him but certainly the general plan will be to play up sals illness grahams closeness to him particularly at the end youre shaking your head you dont agree actually i do graham doesnt what do you mean helen asked he tells me he wasnt there he wasnt any part of it the waiter entered again during the ensuing silence removed the tureen and the soup bowls then set in front of each of them a little work of art featuring seared scallops angels hair pasta some zucchini blossoms a limpid bright orange pool of sauce a bottle of kistler reserve chardonnay appeared was poured hardy thought he might swoon from the first taste but again to leland it was just grub as soon as the door closed he continued as though there had been no interruption but isnt that grahams best defense that the killing was out of mercy it might be sir but he wouldnt even plead to that last week legally thats still murder helen spoke hes afraid he wont be able to practice law hardy nodded thats right thats what he tells me too he wasnt exactly tearing up the field to this point though was he helen this seemed to invite some response from grahams mother and hardy waited until it was clear none would be coming the problem is he said there are certain irregularities somebody else may have been there there might have been another motive sal might in fact have been murdered but not by graham helen was certain about this no but thats whos going to trial for it wait a minute leland said im hearing all kinds of conflicting reports here mr hardy do you believe graham killed his father or not hardy thought for a minute i guess i dont think he did even out of mercy no helen blurted out but all those articles all this winding down she stopped leland picked up the thread that means you think someone else did it shaking his head hardy grabbed for his wineglass a sip during the daytime wouldnt kill him and he wanted the extra second to think i dont think its out of the question sal killed himself the coroner didnt even rule it out i might go that way i see leland busied himself with another bite thinking what would happen though if you argued for assisted suicide and the jury believed you graham wouldnt let me do that but if he would no one can predict what a jury is going to do im not trying to im asking you a simple factual question what would be the result if a jury decided graham had assisted sals suicide or helped him die in some compassionate way this was in many ways a fascinating turn and hardy considered it a minute thats not a technical defense he said carefully trying to be precise a jury that followed the law should convict on murder should helen picked up the nuance the wrinkle hardy nodded except that this is san francisco here you never know even a judge like salter might not instruct the way the prosecution wants any given jury if the defense can guide them right might do anything if they concluded it was an assisted suicide they might you mean theyd find him simply not guilty helen wanted to be sure she understood yes not guilty well then leland concluded thats your defense hardy demurred its not that simple the prosecution is going to make sure the jury knows that assisting a suicide isnt a defense to murder and the judge should instruct that way but might not helen didnt want to let it go hardy wanted to keep her hopes in check but probably will its moot anyway graham wont let me do what were talking about here so whats your mandate leland asked him to do what your client wants or to get him off and that hardy thought was a hell of a good question theyd gotten to dessert a cream puff stuffed with brulee fresh blueberries coffee all right hardy put his cup down now if you dont mind ive got a couple of questions for you they both were listening sal broke into your house three times in the past couple of months didnt he why didnt you press charges the couple communicated in their wordless way and helen took it we thought he needed help we did contact the social services they were i believe arranging something when sal died but it must have bothered you leland answered it was very traumatic for helen we thought the best approach would be to leave it to the authorities you can appreciate that we didnt want to become involved with sal again helen had already been through all that years ago it was painful hardy kept his eyes on the wife and you werent concerned it might happen again i didnt believe sal would hurt me it was more sad than anything really pathetic he just seemed so confused helen hadnt really answered the question he would never have accepted it from a witness but here there wasnt much he could do she continued on he really seemed to believe he still lived with me at the manor the manor a pretty embarrassed smile our home he was that far along with the alzheimers hardy asked i dont know anything about the disease she said he wasnt malicious he just didnt know where he was where he belonged i felt sorry for him she repeated i didnt leland interjected i wanted him arrested its all right helen im on the record with this i thought he was a grave danger to my wife and george your other son hardy said to leland i gather he agreed with you this question appeared to stun both of them their magic code seemed to fail finally leland took a sip of coffee wiped his lips with his napkin george isnt any part of this he said with finality to answer your question yes what dutiful son wouldnt object to the father whod deserted him coming back to harass his mother but this is not a taylor family matter this is about graham not george as if on cue perhaps some button had been pushed under the table the waiter reappeared its two oclock sir leland looked at his watch and made a face some oil leases he said apologetically ive really got to run mr hardy youll contact us after youve spoken to graham about what we discussed helping him out good then helen he reached out a hand to help his wife up from her seat lunch was over when leland taylors limo dropped him back at his office hardy had a message from david freeman asking him to come down something had come up with dyson brunei and tryptech and they needed to talk what now hardy thought but freeman was no surprise in court for the afternoon in the meanwhile a messenger delivered another box of discovery documents on graham this stuff kept pulling him along until nearly five oclock when he realized he had better try again to see what freeman wanted the old man was buried in some legal text in the law library off the solarium he was chewing contentedly on the butt of a thick cigar three halffinished china cups of coffee told hardy hed been back in from court for at least an hour but he showed no sign of impatience time didnt exist for freeman only the beautiful law hardy pulled up a chair next to him dyson brunei he said whats happening freeman finished his paragraph made a notation in ink in the margin of the book marked his place with his cigar and closed it this dredging fee what about it dysons having trouble pulling the cash together to pay for it tryptechs running a little thin he wants to pay you and michelle in stock options for a while shocked hardy sat back in his chair in stock options for tryptech freeman nodded its not unheard of im not saying it is im wondering what im supposed to live on until i can cash them in i thought youd wonder that tell you the truth hardy didnt need this at all right now tryptech was his main source of liquid income his salary youd tell me if you thought they were going belly up wouldnt you david i dont think its like that diz brunei tells me the companys still very strong i think i believe him its a cashflow issue but they dont want to pay us in money thats one way to keep the rest of the old cash flowing he says theyre doing some restructuring trying to make their cash outflows look a little leaner freeman lowered his voice implying a confidence the annual report is coming up diz theyre carrying the eighteenmil container loss forward on their books and that plus our legal fees not exactly the national debt david no but all out of pocket it directly impacts the bottom line freeman held up a palm cutting off hardys rejoinder im just delivering the message here i didnt think this up dyson says hes worried about his shareholders who tend to notice these things hes afraid the company wont look as good on paper as it could as it is hardy heard his warning bells going off and theyre offering stock options no actual shares im inclined to accept i think were looking at a large recovery down the road and well do better than all right the problem is i wont be able to keep paying you for your hours or at least not as many of them brunei might manage halftime hourly cash for one employee id call that a rather substantial problem david if im not paid i cant work what am i supposed to live on i know know but even for a few months jesus i dont know david if it turns out to be worthless paper yeah well bruneis story is it could work out to be a very lucrative deal what else is he going to say that it probably wont work well all get stiffed but hardy realized he was just whining he might as well hear the complete proposal so whats the offer they discount their shares to two and deal you twenty thousand to carry you through say september thats very generous the ironic tone was thick whats the stock going for now three and an eighth freeman spread his hands i know its low but dyson says thats all the better for us wed get more of them its been as high as nine maybe its going there again maybe higher it could be worth a fortune way beyond your billables im keeping the firm in if thats any consolation its not a matter of consolation and in truth if the tryptech ship wasnt going down the way its container had hardy knew that potentially this was a great deal at todays price dyson was offering him sixty thousand plus in stock far more than he would make in the next four months but he also knew that the operative word was could unfortunately the stock market like any given jury was notoriously unpredictable its not that i dont believe it could be lucrative he said but im a working stiff who kind of depends on a paycheck every month freeman was silent for a beat you really might want to do this diz he said at last as a longrun move it could really work out hardys brow creased as a matter of course he knew that david had run a standard poors on tryptech before taking them on as clients and if david still thought the company checked out it would probably survive it wasnt the biggest manufacturer of computers and parts but it wasnt the smallest but even david freeman had been fooled before and after having worked with him for the better part of a year already hardy was of the opinion that dyson brunei wasnt americas most honest man the offer more than worried him could tryptech have gotten to the point where it could no longer pay any of its contractors not just its lawyers if that was the case they were dead and soon plus restructuring was a scary word it meant they were laying off employees hardy knew this had been going on at tryptech with increasing regularity of course as long as the company was in business at all it would need legal help but this lateintheday finagling to get his services essentially for nothing in exchange for stock that had been in free fall for months struck hardy as desperate if theyre strapped for cash he suggested maybe we could talk about getting the port to settle hardy thought he could probably negotiate something like million in a long weekend of course tryptech was hoping to get nearly three times that when all was said and done but it might be birdinthehand time i dont think so david said i suggested that to dyson of course hes not ready to go that way not yet another pause he said he had all his people to consider customers shareholders contractors everybody hardy chuckled this coming from a man who was laying off workers and probably dissembling which was the lawyer word for lying about the actual number of computers hed lost in his container struck hardy as plain silly well thanks anyway david but youll have to tell brunei i dont think so a disappointed sigh all right but if you dont mind im conveying the same offer to michelle hardy left the room shaken suddenly his main source of income looked good to be drying up what drives me nuts is i go into this litigation game for the security of it theres your problem frannie told him there is no such thing as security it is a pure myth his wife knew whereof she spoke orphaned as a young child shed been raised by her brother moses then her first husband had been killed within a week of her discovery that she was pregnant with the baby who turned out to be rebecca this is why my poor suffering husband we should really really try to recognize and enjoy things when life is going well like now for instance this minute there was a blanket under them and another one over them as they lay on the rug in the living room the shades in the bay window were drawn the kids were asleep and the elephants on the mantel had circled and were at rest tony bennett was on low singing some billie holiday a fire threw a flickering light this minute isnt too bad he admitted why are we in the living room sexual urgency she said that was it hardy agreed i remember now he leaned over and kissed her i love you well all right if you must i must her head was on his shoulder a leg thrown over his a long moment passed and youre okay with all this with what all these changes coming up its going to be different youre still going to be here right im considering it so nothings really changed you just think it might be changing but youve been dying to get out from under tryptech anyway i just worry he said frannie went up onto an elbow her red hair glowing in the firelight you youre kidding she leaned up against him dismas everything changes all the time dont you think life would be pretty boring if it didnt boring would be nice he said i could live with boring youd hate it your boredom tolerance is zero you just want to guarantee everything and whats the matter with that nothing except you cant guarantee anything i hate that part he said the good news though is youve got a client you believe in whose parents seem to want to throw money at you which im not sure i can take she was quiet for a minute lets play a game she said ill say something and then you try to think of something positive to say about it instead of how it could all come back and bite you on the ass sounds like fun it is she kissed him you should try it eventually they got to the bedroom hardy was in a deep sleep when the telephone rang next to the bed hello he looked at his digital clock elevenfifteen mr hardy im sorry to wake you up this is sergeant evans we need to talk adrenaline jolted in and suddenly he was awake throwing off his blanket grabbing a bathrobe just a minute he whispered carrying the portable phone into the kitchen closing the bedroom door behind him he flicked on the light and pulled out a chair at the kitchen table is graham all right hes fine i just talked to him hardy tried to process this but he must have been more asleep than he thought because he couldnt do it you just talked to him when just now he called me from jail he was asking stupid questions of course hed phoned her from jail thats where he was we decided we had to tell you hardys first thought was that graham had confessed to the pretty young cop she knew hed be at his low ebb lonely depressed and scared and had gone back to nail him on his first night in the slammer and succeeded were together again hardys brain didnt seem to be accepting the data it was getting youre together in what way he asked i guess the usual way hardys experience with murder suspects and homicide inspectors who got together in anything like an interpersonal relationship was limited if you didnt include one shooting the other im in love with him youre in love with graham yes okay frannies words came back at him nothing was guaranteed nothing was predictable it wasnt just the stock market or juries it was everything okay he said again i know its a little weird ill get used to it hardy said so does this mean you think hes innocent he didnt kill his father no i dont think so either but somebody did do you know that for a fact id bet on it in fact i am betting on it do you know who it was no if i did id arrest him get my man out of jail but theyve pulled us off the case its all politics if theyd let us look id find him theres something i know that more than youve seen maybe not hardy said i got another pile of discovery today there was a brief silence then evans said this wont be in any discovery she outlined the efforts of both herself and lanier the fish supplier pio whod died within the same week as sal the fact that sal had been a cash courier for some highstakes gamblers this guy soma just hates graham and decided to go get him when he had enough for that we got called off hardy was silent for so long that she said his name im still here im just wondering what you want to do i want to help graham she said it can be on my own time i dont care find out where these other trails go the only thing is i cant id have to come to you not my boss i couldnt go to him that would be glitsky yeah you know him jesus hardy said what oh nothing just a little latenight humor yeah i know glitsky you could say that i think hed fire me no i think hed shoot me i think youre right so can we do that me and you keep it between us and graham of course could i have a free investigator working with me to help my client could i do that call me crazy but i think so sarah hung up the telephone in her kitchen and sat at the table with her hands shaking shed done it joined the enemy shed told hardy she was betting on graham being innocent but that was putting it mildly in reality she was risking everything on it her credibility her career over the past few days shed tried to take the long view of the developing situation between graham and herself if she were a man this always stopped her for of course she wasnt but if she were she might be able to get away with having a relationship with one of her suspects if she were a male cop the old boy network would close in around her and though she might take a lot of grief about it it would never become a public issue sarah had known three men on the force in her career who had dated their suspects if memory served one of those had even been a murder rap one of these liaisons not the murder got to marriage but if it came out about graham and her she had no illusions she was going to be finished even if the police officers association went to bat for her glitsky would see that she was reassigned out of homicide she hoped that by calling hardy she was doing the right thing although she was no longer sure what the right thing was anymore now wide awake hardy sat at his own kitchen table it had been an amazing day grahams hidden allies appearing with no warning the parents wanting to help pay for his defense sarah evans volunteering to help with his investigation sarahs suggestion that someone else altogether might be involved widened the scope of things dramatically it also provided him with a tactic that always played well for a jury the socalled soddit defense an acronym for some other dude did it sarah wouldnt even have to find another suspect if hardy could point clearly enough to where there might be one he might be able to churn up enough doubt to get to reasonable but the thought that really refused to leave his mind was david freemans magic trick with the newspaper of the other day context context context todays discovery documents included a listing of all tagged physical evidence so far in the case hardy would have lots of time in the coming months to go to the evidence locker and physically examine every item on the list but the list itself had provided at least one important or potentially important bit of context he had already known that the sal had kept in his safe the money in grahams safety deposit box had been bankwrapped seventeen years before what he hadnt really considered until now was the fact that he had an exact date april fifty thousand dollars was a lot of money now and seventeen years ago it had been a fortune where had it come from had there been a bank robbery a kidnapping something that might have been in the newspapers he didnt know but the chronicles archives would be open tomorrow and he was going to find out he started six months before the date the bills had been wrapped skimming the headlines he didnt have to go very far when he came to the first week of november he figured hed gotten what hed come for and stopped right there nearly running out of the archives in his hurry to get to a telephone judge giotti please dismas hardy please tell him it relates to graham russo this is mario giotti hardy had never expected the judge to pick right up you didnt just call a federal judge and have him come to the phone but thats what giotti had done maybe he had some personal interest hardy introduced himself im representing graham russo ive got a few questions if you could spare some time of course sal was one of my oldest friends i assume you want to talk about the condition of the scene when i found the body i can assure you i didnt touch anything hardy knew there wasnt going to be any way to finesse it well your honor in fact what im curious about is the fire at your fathers restaurant the grotto for a long moment there was no answer then you said this relates to graham russo i dont know if it does i cant imagine how it would that was years ago yes sir hardy waited and the judge didnt let him down if youre free for a while why dont you swing by here im not due back in court until onethirty even after the long walk through the seven rooms that comprised the judges law offices half a city block long hardy wasnt prepared for the majesty of the judges private chambers he was used to the hall of justice where the rooms were to human scale here at the federal courthouse deities reigned giottis room measured about forty by fifty the ceilings began halfway to the sky there was an enormous fireplace incongruously appointed with an artificial heating unit with carved wood exposed beams inlaid marble an entire wall of books and three separate seating areas the room underscored the power of the position a federal judgeship was the job god wanted certainly his own celestial throneroom couldnt have been much more imposing as hardy entered giotti had gotten up from his beautiful shakerstyle desk and was moving forward with an outstretched hand mr hardy nice to meet you did my secretary get the name right the good thief dismas thats right also the patron saint of murderers if im not mistaken hardy nodded youre not although graham russos not been convicted no of course not i didnt mean to imply that and perhaps more to the point im no saint a wider smile then we ought to get along just fine im not much of a saint either cup of coffee would you like to sit down hardy said that coffee would be fine and chose the seating arrangement closest to the fireplace with its space heater turned up i know giotti said these enormous rooms you cant heat them with all these fireplaces all of us judges have them you know and in this entire building only one of them is functional how did you decide among you who got it the same way we decide anything seniority hardy clucked and were always hearing how federal judges get anything they want we get eighteen percent more than average mortals but thats the limit another illusion shattered may it rest in peace giotti intoned as the door opened and the secretary brought in a coffee service after shed gone the judge sipped and sat back balancing his cup and saucer on his knee after making sure hardy was comfortable he moved along you want to know about the fire at the grotto id be curious to know how it even came up hardy explained the admittedly tenuous connection out loud it sounded lame youre saying sal had a great deal of cash fifty thousand dollars hardy said giotti waved that off the exact figure didnt matter to him all of it bankwrapped and dated so you went through the chronicles archives and ran across the grotto fire five months before that date yes your honor thats what i did and you surmise that theres a connection of some kind between these two elements i dont know hardy said this is the third time your name has appeared in this case the third a nod you found sal then the bomb scare earlier that same day the day he was killed how did my name appear there not your name precisely your honor some connection to the courthouse here but then back to my name my fathers name in any event with the grotto fire hardy could understand it if giotti grew impatient with this although he didnt show any sign of it he sipped his coffee again a benign expression on his face waiting for hardy to tie together at least some part of these strings which he couldnt do spreading his palms he smiled sheepishly i dont even know what i came to ask specifically he said there seemed to be some some connection yes i suppose so to what i dont know hardy carefully placed his cup into his saucer feeling very much a fool im sorry your honor im wasting your time quite often i actually think before i roll into gear evidently this wasnt one of those times giotti didnt seem to mind he gestured expansively dont feel like you have to leave mr hardy this might not be a waste of anyones time im curious as to how you plan to approach the overriding legal issue in the case assisted suicide the judge nodded you know that here in the ninth circuit we expect to be in a bit of a war with the supreme court over this whole righttodie question its not unlike what seems to be going on between sharron pratt and dean powell he leaned forward placing bis cup and saucer on the coffee table weve already come down in glucksberg on the side of the angels but were going to be overturned at least thats my prediction its my hope the court doesnt compel a blanket prohibition by the states but they might on assisted suicide you mean yes hardy was extremely surprised stunned even that a federal judge would discuss such an issue with someone who might someday appear in his court as a litigant he took his time framing an appropriate response are you among the judges in favor of it giotti smiled in a weary way lets say im against prohibiting it for terminal patients in legal terms and casey agrees with me its a liberty interest issue not too dissimilar to abortion provided of course youve got cruise control cruise control suddenly they were talking about cars giotti laughed sorry jargon acronyms cruis competent rational uncoerced informed stable you got a terminal patient on cruise control hes got the right to take his life hardy ran through the litany and a question rose did sal russo fit your definition i think so when he formed the original intent recently no id say not so you knew him pretty well both for a long time and pretty well and those are not the same things at all giotti sat back and crossed his legs comfortable i talked with him at least twice a month sometimes more often he pointed vaguely out there in the alley once in a while in his apartment selling fish giotti nodded thats what he did he was a great guy did you know him i met him a few times hardy wasnt sure where to take this giotti seemed to want to talk perhaps reminisce although it could be he was simply taking his lunch break and enjoyed talking to somebody hardy thought that his daily life here must be fairly isolated proscribed i know graham a lot better this brought a frown quickly suppressed yes the judge said i suppose you do hes not the most popular man in this building hardy smiled id heard some rumor like that you dont walk away from a clerkship i dont think its ever been done it raised some hackles yours giotti considered this to be honest with you yes i had a lot of hopes for him through sal you know what im saying your friends kids you hate to see a terrible cycle repeating itself i didnt want to see graham turn out the way sal had although he was your friend sal i mean well not like when we were younger giotti let out a deep sigh sal failed in life id hate to see that happen with graham though thats the way it looks like its going so what happened with sal he wasnt always a failure was he no when he married helen have you met helen hardy nodded gorgeous woman wouldnt you agree well that needs no discussion when sal married her the whole town envied him he was a gifted athlete had this wonderful personality ran his own business had three beautiful kids so what happened i dont know maybe he was living a lie doing some highwire act and pretending he could keep his balance until something gave him a good knock and he went over on the other hand helen married leland pretty quick she might have cut his heart out he disappeared for a few years after he came back he wasnt ever the same he was beaten with no idea what possessed him hardy played a hunch and you helped set him up as salmon sal giotti shifted in his chair his eyes sharpened then he broke a grin say what you will about lawyers i love how their minds work yes well sal was my friend i felt sorry for what had happened to him although set up is perhaps a little too strong perhaps people were more willing to know sal because i did and he never talked to you about the money a cock of the head what money remember he had fifty thousand dollars so he didnt have to work he had all this cash how do you know he had it back then i know its dated back then but that doesnt mean it was in his possession you know thats a good point suddenly the bills had been wrapped and dated but that said nothing about their history over the past seventeen years in fact maybe this was the money that sarah evans had suspected sal had been delivering for one of her gamblers would graham know anything about that did he suspect as much himself hardy would have to ask him and then the horrible thought grahams retainer money where had that come from meanwhile he felt the judges eyes on him was pulled back by a comment he was very sick by the end you know in a lot of pain but no longer as you say on cruise control thats true the alzheimers was getting pretty severe you couldnt miss it he couldnt make his own decisions but you say that sometime earlier he might have told graham he wanted to die to take his own life when it got bad enough the judge ventured another smile did i say that im his attorney it might help to know if he did so you are going with assisted suicide weve already pled not guilty to murder one giotti blew out heavily murder one is ridiculous a grim smile thats my position too i hope the jury agrees with us get it in front of them and it cant fail not in this town not that i should comment on this at all i dont hear any comment hardy said making explicit their understanding but ive got a problem with graham who wont admit to being there he didnt want to mention his other problem that he was fairly certain graham had not helped his father die at all that he was telling the truth on that score he was there giotti said simply that day you know that but giotti backed away from that i cant say that day for sure but he came all the time sal told me he saw him a couple of times a week graham says this wasnt one of the days have him change his mind and hell walk meaning he wouldnt be convicted hardy leaned forward elbows on his knees he wont admit anything judge he is one stubborn fellow he thinks theyll pull his bar card giotti considered that a moment all right so you admit it for him now the judge too leaned over the coffee table and lowered his voice it wouldnt be grahams fault thered be no ethical problem with the bar if the jury came back with not guilty just bought assisted suicide and let him go graham himself would never have to admit anything the bar couldnt yank his card if it was his attorneys argument not his own testimony all youve got to do mr hardy is keep him off the stand this was suddenly as strange a conversation as hardy could ever remember having a federal judge counseling him on his defense and it was a strategy he realized that had every hope of success not too dissimilar to leland taylors suggestion of the day before if only he could convince his client that might work judge if it doesnt and again i am not commenting directly here giotti waited and hardy nodded his assent at least then youve based your case on the constitutional issue and i can assure you with reasonable confidence that this circuit would tend to look favorably on any appeal the moment froze hardy struck with an almost surreal awareness the white light out the window the space heater suddenly clicking off a portrait of some native american chieftain on the opposite wall if hed heard it right mario giotti had just told him that if hardy lost grahams case the judge would see to it that the conviction was overturned on appeal he didnt dare ask if hed heard it right he had any more direct confirmation would be collusive downright indictable nodding like a puppet setting the frame in his mind he stood up well your honor i want to thank you it was very nice to meet you my pleasure the judge said its not every day i get any personal time i appreciate it they were moving to the door when hardy stopped can i ask you one more thing very fast giotti trotted out his smile again you can ask it slow if you want what is it you said sal was unable to make a decision at the end the judge corrected him an informed decision and this was obvious to anybody who did any business with him maybe not but certainly to anyone who had known him hardy frowned the judge asked him what he was getting at im trying to get a picture of the last moments if he was lucid one second had made this decision then in the middle of it changed his mind that could account for the trauma they found around the injection site the judges eyes went to the corner of the room the filigreed redwood moldings hugging the distressed drywall lips pursed his eyes went dull for a long beat he knew it was getting toward the time he used to tell his bad alzheimers jokes you know then lately hed stopped doing that which i took as a sign that he was getting serious about it but suddenly this tumor was going to end things quickly giotti waited and and so he wasnt facing the same thing instead of a long slow advance into dementia where hed lose his dignity his new reality was about dealing with pain okay which from all ive heard about him he was macho as hell im just trying to get to his state of mind he wasnt going to let pain beat him even great pain giotti took that in that flies he said i remember one time we were out on the bonus wed just landed a salmon and he slipped on the deck and the gaff went through the palm of his hand all the way through yow no kidding sal gave one good yell then just twisted the gaff back out and wrapped his hand in an old tshirt didnt even head the boat back in we fished the whole day and he never mentioned it again thats what i mean hardy said i dont see him deciding to die over the pain maybe the combination the judge replied that and the alzheimers whatever it was something clearly got to him it must have dont you think must have hardy said it must have he says its an emergency phylliss clipped tones came over the speakerphone filling his office hardy was huddled with michelle catching up on the everfascinating world of stress tolerance in various metals it was wednesday afternoon almost evening certainly after five at any rate way too late for what he still had to do he hadnt even been to see graham whod no doubt been languishing in his adseg unit all day wondering what if anything his lawyer was up to and hed been working on russo all day after giotti over to the hall for more discovery a look at the actual evidence the materials from the safe the money baseball cards old belt then the syringes and vials with their labels stripped off he had a lessthanamiable chat with claude clark in the hallway when hardy had stopped him honestly trying to help perhaps to make amends about the blown deal with pratt he told clark that barbara brandt was a liar not true clark had countered and even if it were hardy made deals he couldnt keep clark would take a liar anytime at least you knew where you stood he really ought to go stop in and see graham but it was threethirty before he gave up waiting for another opportunity to apologize to glitsky and began to brave the abysmal traffic back uptown to sutler he had had a two oclock with michelle which hed rescheduled to three and then four and he was going to be late for that too even if someone hadnt parked in his space under his own building staring at the unfamiliar car in the spot for which he paid a fortune each month he marveled anew that anyone could oppose capital punishment surely stealing someones parking place was a deathpenalty affront to civilization just to add a certain je ne sais quoi of tension to the equation he had a date with frannie in less than two hours and at least another hour here with michelle so hed told phyllis no more calls the last time shed put one through a reporter if it wasnt dyson or frannie he couldnt talk to anybody and now shed buzzed him back interrupting again he shook his head in frustration sorry michelle then out loud who is it phyllis a dr cutler i dont know him its about the russo case what isnt he asked it to himself getting up to cross to his desk but an answer came from an unexpected quarter this it was a flat statement from michelle with a harsh finality that nearly startled him he suddenly realized that she wasnt thriving under his tutelage she was doing fine with the details and strategy of the case but since her interaction with him was constantly being subverted by graham russo she was getting understandably impatient he gave her an ambiguous gesture picked up the phone and said hello he heard papers rustling and turned to see her going out the door closing it behind her so he missed his callers introduction im sorry could you repeat that he heard a sigh hardy wasnt making many friends my names russell cutler i play ball with graham my secretary said dr cutler that too there was a small pause the sound of a breath being exhaled i prescribed the morphine for sal russo ive been trying to live with it and im not doing very well i thought telling somebody might help hardy took a moment it might but then another thought occurred to him and it nearly turned his stomach his client had lied again to him maybe to his lover certainly to the police and to time magazine if this doctor played ball with graham then the medical connection to the morphine was not through sal as hardy had reluctantly come to accept but through graham himself jesus christ he thought would it never end struggling for a calm tone he fell back upon his job his role the lawyer have you mentioned this to anyone else the police for instance no i thought it would be better if i told my story to grahams side you know that was a good thought hardy conceded where are you located cutler told him he was a resident at seton medical center in daly city he lived in san bruno had graduated from ucsf medical school he had played baseball for arizona in college and had been drafted by craig ising when he showed up in the city playing haphazardly but as often as he could get the time he hit the long ball and it was great money so graham and i became friends and he kind of told me about sal he was afraid to go to public health because he thought theyd report him because of the ad hed lose his drivers license among other things theyd put him in a home you know the drill the indigent sick its appalling ive heard hardy said although he was daily getting a new appreciation for how bad it must be so you what with sal there wasnt any answer for a minute although the connection hadnt been broken when cutler came back his voice was muted look im in the lounge here and you cant talk a false cheer the voice back to normal good right yeah so when can we get together this is always my favorite part its why were such a great couple hardy said youre always so eager to share the excitement frannie nodded that must be it hardy felt that there hadnt been any choice not that this was any consolation to frannie nor had it been to michelle either judging from the gone home postit note on her office door when hardy had finally stopped by to resume their stresstolerance discussion his trained legal mind intuited that she was displeased with him as was his wife now at his decision to meet with a witness at the little shamrock on date night her brother moses having poured a round for a group in the front window was back into earshot before hardy was aware of it hardy was trying to explain it couldnt be helped frannie the guys got eight hours off tonight and then hes on call all the rest of the week what am i supposed to do his wife nursing a chardonnay feigned pensiveness heres a radical concept but what about waiting till next week what do you think mose a thoughtful pout never put off until tomorrow what you can do today hardy approved of this support see pure wisdom your brother has a doctorate you know he must be right frannie cast a look between them you know what they call the person who comes in last in the class in med school i give up hardy said doctor frannie smiled mcguire looked hurt im not that kind of doctor anyway hardy wanted to get back to the topic besides frannie anything could happen in a week what if my witness dies in the interim frannie histrionically slapped her palm on her forehead silly me she said i forgot all about that possibility which is pretty likely i suppose the guys what twentyfive thirty death must stalk him like a panther i didnt say it was likely im trying to be careful hardy was sticking with club soda until hed had a chance to interview russell cutler who should be here any minute he hoped if he didnt chicken out he was already fifteen minutes late frannie suddenly put her hand over his im teasing you mostly but we are going out to a real restaurant later and eat real food that i dont cook right right were in complete agreement total all right im with you then she looked over her husbands shoulder at the doorway this witness is a doctor yeah i think hes here dr cutler still wore his light green scrubs maybe as a means of identification if so it worked hardy left his wife with her brother and the two men shook hands at the door the little shamrock was san franciscos oldest bar established in twenty feet wide from side to side it extended back three times that distance antique bicycles fishing rods knapsacks and other turnofthecentury artifacts hung from the ceiling and there was a clock that had stopped ticking during the great earthquake of tonight wednesday at seven twentytwo there were two dozen patrons half of them at the bar the rest were shooting darts or sitting at tiny tables in the front the beach boys were singing dont worry baby on the jukebox hardy took cutler to the back of the place here three couches were arranged sittingroom style tiffany lamps shed a feeble light the bathrooms were behind some stainedglass screens and people with a highly developed olfactory sense tended to avoid the area at least until the place got rockin and the beer smell overlaid anything else but cutler didnt seem to mind or even notice i have trouble believing ive let it go this long he began before hed sat down with all the articles the media its all right youre here now thats what matters you know why i told your secretary it was an emergency i thought if i didnt get it out today i never would frannie had been right cutler was between twentyfive and thirty at this moment there were black circles under his eyes and the outline of stubble on his cheeks but hardy guessed that when he was rested and shaved he would be freshfaced even boyish he was neither as tall nor as broad in the shoulders as graham but possessed that same athletic grace of movement although his cropped black hair made him appear more a marine than a jock im a wreck about this i dont think ive slept since graham was first arrested the first job would be to reassure him why dont you just tell me the level of your involvement with sal im not the police you know what you tell me doesnt necessarily have to go any farther cutler sighed he kept opening and closing his hands finally he linked them and leaned forward graham was kind of being sals caretaker toward the end kind of waiting and watching they had made some deal about the ad and i think were both okay with it graham was going to help him die before he got before he went to a home i guess but then sal started getting these headaches the cancer cutler nodded but we didnt know that at first so i ran the cat scan we got a second opinion then a third there wasnt any hope we couldnt operate we were convinced the size and location of the tumor was increasing his intracranial pressure that appeared to be what was causing the headaches as the story came out hardy realized that it had been as hed begun to surmise sal was actively fighting the pain not obsessing about the progress of the alzheimers so i wrote up a scrip for the morphine we tried oral painkillers first of course but they became less and less effective over his head hardy faked a laymans understanding of course added but you finally got to the morphine so sal could use it to kill himself cutler nodded eventually down the line but you wrote the prescription so theres a record of it anyway this made cutlers hands clench but his voice was under control yeah but well i wrote the prescription to graham in grahams name he picked it up at the pharmacy at seton i guess he thought it was out of the city it wouldnt be as easy to trace okay but why the secrecy you have a sick man youre his doctor and you prescribe drugs whats the problem there wasnt one not by itself he shook his head its all so stupid i shouldnt have done it the way i did thats all what way was that i wanted to refer sal to a pain management center but he refused they have more sophisticated techniques and medications that could have kept him from having to give himself so many injections but in the end you stayed with the morphine why was that basically it was because the old man was a pain in the ass we started with morphine a couple of times and it worked and he wasnt going to take anything else cutler looked imploringly at hardy as though he hoped for absolution look im in the last year of my residency im really not supposed to follow my own patients independently i mean its not illegal but its frowned on in real life strongly frowned on id be screwed and after this many years its kind of important i get to the end see graham didnt want his dad in the system in any way either sal was just terrified that somehow somebody would decide he had to be institutionalized so i did all this on my own what about the other opinions howd you get them a shrug that was easy i got a tech buddy helps me with the scan itself then a specialist gives me a curbside consult and verifies its terminal and inoperable theres nothing that can be done anyway so what are we supposed to do see hardy saw so you knew or thought sal was going to kill himself lets just say we wanted to keep that option open and so graham scratched your name off the vials youre doing him a favor and in return he agrees to keep your name out of it so you dont get screwed at work yeah thats it i figure its bad enough if i follow a patient independently if i even appear to assist at a suicide on top of it then best case id be looking for another residency worst case theyd take my license hardy had to appreciate the similarities in the problems of the two young men no wonder they became friends their professional concerns were nearly identical but you didnt help sal kill himself no i did prescribe the drug though he shrugged we should have just been up front with it i suppose now i see graham in jail charged with murder and hes still protecting me i figure ive got to say something maybe itll help him and having said it suddenly he appeared to grow calm sitting all the way back on the couch he let out a deep breath i bet they serve beer here i could go for a beer ill get it hardy got up went behind the bar and pulled at the bass tap when he got back cutler thanked him for the beer so what do we do now hardy sat across from him when is your residency over midjuly why because the trial starts in september as soon as i put you on my witness list people are going to want to talk to you but we ought to be able to keep it between us until then you didnt break any law did you not that i know of okay then and the police havent asked the mystery doctor thats you to come forward have they no so put it on hold dont worry about it my main concern to tell you the truth is that these are more lies graham told but he was just protecting me i understand that hardy wasnt going to go into it grahams penchant for benevolent falsehoods might well wind up hanging him but back to you i wont have to list you as a witness until just before the trial so by the time any of this comes out youll be clear with your residency i shouldnt have done it cutler repeated i dont know about that you did the right thing the morphine helped sal while he was alive didnt it hardy could see he wanted to accept this but still had doubts he leaned forward and patted the young mans knee this legal stuff forget it nobodys going to bust you for what you did you tried to ease someones suffering thats what doctors ought to do dont you think a sip of beer a lopsided grin i dont remember anymore i used to think so when i had a life hardy patted his knee again believe it he said now enjoy your beer then go get some sleep and thanks hardy and frannie stayed in the avenues at the purple yet wah a chinese restaurant not fifteen blocks from their house eating their way through the appetizers pot sticker calamari egg rolls paperwrap chicken barbecue pork rib deepfry shrimp and half a dozen more dishes they were back home by tenfifteen hardy had five messages waiting glitsky left his name michelle was really sorry shed snapped at him and left so abruptly they had a lot of work to catch up on tomorrow maybe he could set aside a little tryptech time graham russo had understood that hardy would come by every day what was going on why hadnt he come in was everything all right his only visitor that whole day had been his mother hed been thinking and maybe hardys decision not to mention joan singleterry the phantom woman from sals past was a mistake graham wasnt making her up sal had really wanted to give her the money please call jail is hell graham again same thing going nuts the last call was from sarah evans ten minutes ago she had talked to graham again and gotten an idea and thought maybe she was on to something there was a muted tone even in the public areas of baywest bank this would have been noticeable even if the building werent located on such a blighted and vulgar thoroughfare since it was on market street though with its bums and garbage its debris and stench its fumes and pornography the contrast was especially striking the other day when hed come to lunch here with the taylors hardy had passed right through the lobby to the elevators and had scarcely looked at the surroundings now his business was here and he took them in polished floors burnished dark wood tinted windows to the outside there was nothing so obviously crass as a waiting line in the lobby here at baywest when you entered through the revolving front doors you were greeted by a young man in a business suit and asked your business if you needed to see a teller of which there were only three you were given a number and asked to have a seat in one of the upholstered chairs tastefully arranged around the lobby hardy identified himself as graham russos lawyer and said he would appreciate a few minutes with george although he didnt have an appointment it was ninefifteen am mr russo was at a meeting hardy said he would wait and was directed to another armchair in the back of the lobby the banks officers lived in cages as they do almost everywhere the burnishedwood motif from the public area was carried over here in the back creating halfhigh walls around each unit the upper half was glass and hardy getting to his wingback chair looked into georges office for a quick glimpse without the nameplate he could have picked him out from a hundred people dressed in a different style than graham sitting in a posture behind his desk that hardy had never seen in graham george still bore a remarkable resemblance to his older brother as he waited hardy made a few notations on the yellow legal pad hed begun carrying with him everywhere he went there was so much to remember so much to organize and he only had three months before the trial an absurdly short lead time that hed argued bitterly against at the calendar hearing but his old colleague tim manion the judge though inclined to sympathy on the bail issue had proved intractable in scheduling the trial after hardy had argued for a couple of minutes manion had summoned him up to the bench and given him a little lecture i understand you turned down a very reasonable settlement offer mr hardy no diz on this topic so i assumed your client would be anxious to tell his story and clear his name but your honor three months the gavel a tight smile unless youd like to start in sixty days as the law provides so hardy had until september he knew he had to explain this to michelle pretty soon too he moved her to the top of his list he owed her that much hed worked for bosses who didnt tell him what they expected or what he could expect in terms of their support and he had thought them cruel he didnt wish to leave michelle with that impression of himself but he didnt dwell on tryptech the grand jury indictment notwithstanding he was actually going to file a nineninefive motion for dismissal that he would lose but he felt he had to get on the boards with the fact that there was not enough evidence to justify holding graham at all there were signs that sal had been murdered perhaps but no reasonable attempt to connect that murder to graham by physical evidence so hed try make the point get laughed at he made another note today he must remember to place ads to run for a month or more in the local newspapers in the la times the san jose mercury and also being thorough in the various regional editions of the wall street journal maybe in the new york times book review asking anyone with information on a joan singleterry to come forward he wouldnt risk introducing her before a jury grahams story about her even if true in all respects smelled bogus but graham was right they would be unwise to abandon the search for her if she could shed some light on sal or on the money if any part of grahams story was true and hardy could verify it it could destroy the prosecution case as least insofar as the special circumstances then there was sarah evans and her pursuit of the gamblers and fishmongers he had to coordinate that more closely it wasnt merely a matter of his soddit defense he didnt need sarahs information so much for the jury as he might to get to the truth which was why he was here now he raised his eyes the door had opened and george was saying his name a concerned look on his face hardy threw his legal pad into his open briefcase and stood up tried a smile mr russo how are you im representing your brother i know who you are he said and how i am is busy what does my brother have to do with me the tone made it even ruder than the words hardy cocked his head trying to get a read on george but it didnt look like he was going to get much of an opening i havent seen my father in ten years i dont talk to my brother im not interested but his color was high like it or not his emotions were engaged hardy retained an even tone of his own i understood you saw sal when he came to your mothers house a month ago so what so you just said you hadnt seen him in ten years georges eyes narrowed it wasnt clear whether it was with fear or rage he pointed a finger at hardy thats a lawyers trick turning my words hardy made the snap decision that he wasnt going to score any points here with sweet talk heres another one he said where were you on the afternoon your father was killed this stopped him dead he opened his mouth to speak thought better of it closed it again he glanced toward the lobby some customers had turned their heads noticed the confrontation hardy pressed what he took to be his advantage it might be more comfortable in your office they were inside hardy pulled the door to behind them while george retreated behind his desk hed obviously had enough time to think by the time he got seated i dont have to answer any of your questions do i youre not with the police no thats right of course i could go to the police and tell them you were uncooperative and acting suspicious that you didnt have an alibi for the time of the murder and you had a great motive plus you look enough like graham that anyone who thought they had seen him at sals might have been confused hardy sat back and crossed his legs then you would have to answer them i had nothing to do with my fathers death i didnt say you did you just said i had a motive and no alibi hardy shrugged maybe im wrong he waited georges tone shifted suddenly the arrogant banker gave way to a frightened child what made you come here i dont even know why youre talking to me sitting back hardy decided hed played enough hardball he could ease up a little your mother a confused betrayed look what about my mother she told you to talk to me hardy walked him through it leaving out any reference to sarah his secret agent whod been the conduit your mother went to see your brother in jail yesterday and told him among other things that she was worried about you youd blown up at some family gathering a couple of weeks ago didnt you you were so hateful to your father he was hateful to us he just walked out on us yes he did and you could never forgive him could you why should i hardy let that question lie instead your mother thinks its possible that you killed sal jesus what are you saying george took a handkerchief from his lapel pocket and wiped his forehead you told your father you went to some clients but you didnt go there did you how do you how can you say that your mother said it she told graham he told me hes a liar maybe it runs in the family where were you george ran a hand around under his collar gradually though over ten seconds or so he got himself back under control i was at a clients on a confidential matter he checked his watch and i am very busy this interview is over hardy didnt move do you want me to go to the police with this you think i ask hard questions you should see them but the younger brother had made his decision i dont think you ask hard questions and you can inform the police or not i didnt see my father i didnt even know where he lived he picked up the phone if youre not ready to leave i can call security hardy was sitting in the jails visiting room and graham was in his orange jumpsuit standing by the window hardy had just told him about helen and lelands offer of financial help graham finally he turned around they want something but i dont see how i can tell you no maybe they want to help you no they want to buy me they wouldnt even be buying me only some of my hours i made it clear id be working only for your interests not theirs graham eased himself onto the corner of the table he wore a weary smile and was shaking his head thats not how it works leland pays you and then eventually you come to see where your interests lie ive seen it happen a thousand times his hands crossed in front of him hardy met his clients gaze ill rise above the temptation then more seriously ive thought a lot about this graham a lot believe me its the only way i defend you and not go broke which of course id gladly do on your behalf although not if i didnt have to but i leave it up to you hardy watched the young man wrestle with it family ties and financial bonds he sighed my mom sure puts the fun in dysfunctional doesnt she i dont think shes dysfunctional confused maybe you interested in my call on this really sure she sees your dad in you apparently a lot of people do its her second chance that way she wants to give you a chance to make your life turn out all right to save yourself and the only language she has is money you dont do things her way lelands way but something in her wishes that that way your way could work she wants to help and what about leland he doesnt have to matter if you dont let him all right he said take the damn money carefully keeping any elation out of his voice this really was a critical decision that would keep them both afloat hardy felt his shoulders relax he turned to his legal pad oh by the way i had a nice talk with your friend russ cutler last night funny how you forgot to mention him graham didnt shrink from it caught again oh well i had other things on my mind i tried to go off the record and tell sarah she wouldnt let me its going to come out as more lies graham shrugged i promised him i wouldnt bring him in what was i supposed to do betray the guy i dont know if id characterize it as betrayal maybe telling your attorney trust that he could keep a lid on it graham accepted the rebuke youre right im sorry hardy smiled you gotta love a guy whos so consistent but last night i passed a few pleasant moments plotting to kill you after i get you off he shrugged it passed but i really would love it if you had any other little secrets youve been keeping up to now if you wanted to share them this would be a good time still sitting on the table graham swung his legs under it like a child craig isings holding ten grand for me my money hardy had to laugh you are a piece of work embarrassed graham remained matter of fact one way or the other this things over in six months i figure i didnt want to lose my apartment so craigs keeping up on the rent if im in jail it doesnt matter but if i win then what in spite of himself hardy thought he had a point in fact he had wondered what grahams plans might be regarding his wonderful place it was human nature to protect his own hearth before he worried about hardys home and family not that it didnt rankle just a bit so thats it he asked i realize weve got the proverbial loaves and fishes of falsehoods here but maybe we keep at this long enough well run out you didnt run off on your lost weekend and get married to evans did you no you dont know anything about your fathers money except what youve already told me about joan singleterry whoever the hell she is right and you dont know who she is no idea and if i catch you in even the smallest fib i get to stick an icepick under your kneecap both of em you swear on your fathers grave this sobered him as hardy had meant it to i swear he intoned this would have to be good enough and hardy took it okay now lets talk some matters of law without naming grahams stepfather as one source of the idea hardy outlined in some detail the suggestion that both leland and giotti had proposed as a defense as a lawyer himself graham seemed to appreciate the distinction between admitting hed done something and having a jury conclude hed done the same thing if he never admitted it ever to anyone he would be legally blameless he could resume his life with a clean slate they discussed the strategy until the lunch bell grahams acquiescence was a nice surprise especially after his earlier refusal to plead to essentially the same thing but as graham pointed out they werent the same thing at all not in the eyes of the law of course there were great risks graham was charged with firstdegree murder and if convicted with special circumstances would spend the rest of his life in prison but giottis offer seriously mitigated that risk they left it unresolved but kept the door open driving back uptown hardy was going around with it it was starting to look as though his defense would be to admit that graham who couldnt admit it himself had committed a murder that in fact he hadnt committed for a reason that he didnt have and this if it worked might set his client free the law he thought was a sublime and terrible thing sarah evans planned to take full advantage of yet another beautiful wrinkle in the system the city and county of san francisco were physically coterminous they shared the same geographic boundaries this created interesting possibilities in the always complicated world of legal jurisdiction practically one of the results of this arrangement was that the jail was controlled by the county sheriffs office not by the citys police department although it was directly behind the hall of justice in what used to be part of the halls parking lot the jail might as well have been on the moon for all of its official connection to police events at southern station which was the citys name for the police presence at the hall sarah told marcel lanier she had some reports to catch up on after their shift shed hitch a ride home later he left her working at her desk in the homicide detail at some time between six and seven the coming and going of other homicide inspectors slowed down and sarah cleared her desk took the back steps out of the hall and walked around to the entrance to the jail flashed her id and told the admitting deputy that she had to see russo she signed in knowing that her bosses in the pd were unlikely to review the log attorney room b would be all right she checked her weapon at the desk i cant come here very often they sat across the table from each other now inspector and prisoner graham longed for her hands over the table but knew he couldnt a silence settled they simply looked at each other graham told her he loved her she bit at her lip and found she couldnt respond whats it like out there he asked finally outside windy ive got a game tonight you know thursdays she sighed how are you holding up better now but he couldnt hide his uncertainty about it i think i got the right lawyer sarah nodded did he tell you he talked to your brother george wont say where he was a shake of the head georgie didnt kill sal okay she didnt want to argue about it she thought it was entirely possible in fact that george had killed sal nothing hardy had told her ruled him out in any way and her training was to keep pushing until you got to something but i wish i could talk to him id shake his tree a little harder than hes used to so why dont you i cant ive got no case if i shake him down off duty and he complains which he would its harassment and there goes my job hardys trying to get my boss to move on it your boss lieutenant glitsky he and hardy know each other but it wont matter glitsky wont do it theres nothing to move on especially since glitskys already got a suspect in jail dont remind me i am looking at the other things graham craig isings friends the fish stuff i know then quietly i know you are she could see him being brave and it was tearing her up say what she would about his chances at his trial the fact remained that he was locked up a prisoner he wasnt going out to play ball tonight the way she was he was here alone scared she felt like she had to hold him he needed her but she couldnt do that although if she stayed any longer she might ive got to go she said the headache had been bad this morning and hed gotten a call near dawn he came right on down and gave sal his shot his father hated to shoot himself up hated it after that sal slept and graham read for a while some magazine passing the time dozing a little himself he didnt have to be in at work until midafternoon and had come to love these times with his dad even to depend on them difficult as they sometimes were in his dads presence he felt like he belonged somewhere he was loved for who he was he felt important needed it was as simple as that he didnt feel that way anywhere else he heard sal stirring in his room down past the kitchen and a minute later he appeared good boy he said still here how about i take you down for lunch at the grotto i love their cioppino nobody makes cioppino better than bruno giotti halfway out of his chair graham sat back down his stomach churning and not over the mention of food since his fathers headaches had started the bouts of forgetfulness had become more frequent as well but this morning was more than forgetfulness this to graham was new dad the grotto isnt there anymore its stagnolas now remember sal laughed what kind of boy am i raising here what are you talking about you dont know your own backyard come on get up fish dont bite all day to look at him there was no change he d even dressed for sal with a degree of proper conservatism tennis shoes and khaki slacks and a blue workshirt that had been pressed before he d taken a nap in it so we going or not graham was going to have to talk to russ cutler he thought he didnt know what to do how to handle this humor sal or dig his heels in he just didnt know yeah were going he said hed stick with him until this passed if it did in the alley getting into the truck sal had another idea hey why dont we swing by the manor surprise georgie and deb take em out with us they love the grotto they went out with mom shopping remember sal didnt seem entirely sure but said oh thats right well we can still go sure ill drive okay again sal hesitated before accepting this but finally climbed up into the cab that fucking mario he said conversationally who giotti the judge sal gave his boy a look what are you talking about the judge no im talking mario giotti brunos kid he gave his son a hard whack on the arm you been smoking something bambino no sorry what about mario graham was heading east on mission down to the old embarcadero now herb caen way hed turn north at the bay and head up along the piers to fishermans wharf maybe by the time they arrived sal would know where he was what about mario he repeated sal was smiling remembering something that fucking guy hes in at work last night in his suit and tie cutting garlic tomatoes cant decide if he wants to stay and help his old man or go on in the law i tell him stay and help his old man family huh thats what counts graham nodded let his lungs go yeah you went to the grotto last night yeah shit after work get some courage before i go home your mother well i wont say anything bad about your mom but this life me you kids its the only one shes got you know her mom and dad fucked her up so bad wasnt for me shed be some driedup old society lady only sometimes she forgets that and i gotta remind her sal was right graham thought helen never should have stopped loving him no matter what sal had done family counts she should be here with them now in this truck she should see this help them both but she wasnt couldnt be not now not anymore and graham knew it was a tragedy for her as well he reached over and laid a hand for a moment on his fathers knee she loves you sal i know he answered breezily this man who hadnt seen his wife in fifteen years but got to talk to her straighten her out she s all mixed up we ought to go home maybe they were getting to the wharf after lunch it wasnt yet noon in midweek and there were plenty of places to park in the lot the ferry had just disgorged a stream of commuters and sal bounced out of the cab we better shake it graham hustled next to him to keep up this crowds going to beat us we dont get a move on smell that cioppino i love that smell nothing better they came to the door of stagnolas and stopped sals face dropped and he reached a hand out to graham as though he needed to be steadied whats going on he asked this isnt the grotto i know dad the grottos closed well thats just bullshit i was here last night mario was in the kitchen in his suit cutting tomatoes graham said nothing he put his arm around sal but the old man twisted away and walked out into the street turning back to look at the building he stood there a long time squinting in the bright sunlight graham walked out to him and put his arm around him again this time his father leaned into him this aint the grotto he whispered hoarsely his voice skirting the edges of panic what the hells going on graham shot up in his cot breathing hard hed almost been asleep almost been dreaming wasnt sure which in the jail most lights were out but even here in his adseg unit there were always noises always shadows sal had slept in the cab again another nap and when he woke up hed pulled out of it that day graham knew he should have done something right then sal had told him he would be going by the manor looking up helen he should have believed him he should have done everything differently but he didnt want to believe it it was too hard it was easier to deny the progress of the disease to believe that sal wasnt quite gone yet mentally he had more time graham had more time with him he lay flat on his back his arm thrown over his eyes he missed him horribly this was the only time he had with sal anymore memories part four dismas hardy checked his watch where was the judge he was five minutes late the bailiff had even pulled graham from the holding cell and sat him next to hardy unshackled and in his trial clothes rather than the jail jumpsuit david freeman was sitting at the defense table with hardy and graham and doing it for free he had joined the defense team wheedling his way in hardy was grateful not only for the legal assistance but for the company they in were department in the hall of justice on a monday the third week of september as in all of the courtrooms at the hall there was no hint of the weather outside but the morning had been warm and still unusual in the city for most of the year but relatively normal in the weeks after labor day grahams trial clothes were a pair of slacks and a sport coat freeman and hardy had decided that a business suit would strike too formal a tone for the jury they wanted to play up grahams regular guy image so for the past week during jury selection the defendant had appeared in court in a respectful coat and tie anything but a stuffy threepiece lawyers uniform hardy was fighting his nerves freeman and graham were talking quietly to his left he was half turned away from them peripherally aware of drysdale and soma at the prosecution table across from him on the other side of the courtroom he swiveled further to check out the gallery now filled to bursting for the opening fireworks jury selection had taken nearly ten days with the final juror selected last friday just before the evening adjournment the trial proper was beginning any moment with opening statements the first evidence hardy was damned if he was going to spend these last seconds reviewing his notes one last time when his moment arrived after hed listened to somas opening statement he was reasonably confident that the right words would come in for him his notes were just that key phrases high points several dont forgets he never wanted to see the damn things again his eyes raked the gallery rested for a second on frannie whod surprised and delighted him by saying she wanted to come down to root for him at least for his opening statement the kids were back in school she might bring him some luck he gave her an imperceptible nod touching hand to heart as though he were straightening his tie she saw it and nodded back in front of frannie grahams mother helen whod come to court for every day of jury selection imitated a trompe oeil statue hardy stared at her for several seconds during which time she did not so much as blink her ashcolored hair was off her face hands clasped on her lap a general murmur hovered over the courtroom people talking speculating arguing but grahams mother was by herself alone selfsufficient neither her husband nor her other son was there nor had they appeared last week hardy recognized other faces on grahams side of the gallery several staff from his office these were freemans acolytes here to see the show especially the opening statements freeman had shamelessly pimped hardy to these young turks as a master and theyd come to see him work his magic hed never lost freeman had told them all and hardy had rushed in with the clarification that hed only fought twice never losing would have a lot more punch six or eight trials down the line but theyd come anyway conspicuously absent was michelle who had assumed much of the daytoday responsibility of tryptech she was clearly resentful of the trial of the way graham russo had come to consume her bosss life over the past months but hardy thought it was actually working out very well for all concerned never a trial lawyer michelle was superb in her new role as corporate litigator hardys billings on tryptech had dropped to about five hours a week bruneis limit on cash outlay and michelle was taking her pay in discounted stock hardy hoped that she wouldnt wind up impoverished by that decision but she had made it on her own on his side also and it surprised him was sharron pratt herself the newspapers had it that she planned to attend as much of the trial as her schedule allowed barbara brandt too the perhapslying lobbyist a redundancy whose face had become familiar talked nonstop to her contingent by the back doors on the other side behind the prosecution table in the first row and far to the side sat dean powell the attorney general of the state of california like pratt he was here to observe to be a presence hardy glanced over at freeman and his client still head to head chatting amiably hardy was too tightly wound up even to feign listening he blew out heavily then stopped midway in the breath lest any sign of his nerves get misinterpreted by the jury he must forever appear confident though not too grave friendly juror thomas kenner was looking at him and hardy met his gaze nodding as if they had been acquainted for ages leisurely he took in the rest of the panel jury selection had not gone well in one important sense the final panel failed to be a representative crosssection of the citizenry of san francisco and that had been hardys primary goal in spite of the jury experts he and freeman had hired they had nearly been unable to counter the prosecutions strategy by the bad luck of the draw the jury pool had contained a huge preponderance of men and though hardy and freeman had used their peremptory and other challenges to eliminate as many as they could still the final panel had eight men six of whom were white it was a generalization but hardy had no illusions these working class men would not be as sympathetic as women would be soma and drysdale had been shamelessly gender biased about wanting men on the jury all men gender bias was okay if you won anything was okay if you won of the four women hardy had a young asian mother an africanamerican thirtiesish schoolteacher a divorced white secretary in her fifties and a young gumchewer with short hair dyed a bright carmine who read meters for the gas company friday night after the adjournment after the jury had been empaneled hardy and freeman were having a consolation drink in one of the back booths at lou the greeks soma and drysdale had come in and sat at the bar up front they were in high spirits raised their glasses and toasted one another hardy heard them clearly enough heres to the best jury in america freeman his liverspotted lugubrious face buried in his bourbon raised it enough to nod knowingly good thing youre motivated by a challenge hed said id say you got one understatement freemans forte gil somas stridency at the bail hearing his sharpedged ironic tone when hed been with drysdale and first met hardy his obvious vitriolic hatred for graham russo these examples had all worked to convince hardy that somas courtroom behavior would not help his case jurors would not warm to him but this appeared now to have been wishful thinking soma was neither arrogant nor stupid and his easy manner in front of the jury showed that he was aware of his personal shortcomings and had learned to harness them now attired in his charcoal suit his muted blue tie his artfully scuffed shoes for the common touch an old freeman trick he stood quite close to his mostly male jury and spoke to them quietly without histrionics sincerely convinced of the justice of his position ladies and gentlemen of the jury the defendant graham russo murdered his father for money there was a minor stir in the courtroom at the drama of the words but it subsided before judge jordan salter had to intervene somas eyes never left the jury box calmly surveying them in this trial in the coming days and perhaps weeks well be presenting a great deal of evidence an overwhelming array of both direct and circumstantial evidence that will prove to you and prove beyond any reasonable doubt that early on the afternoon of friday may ninth the defendant sitting right there at the table to my left and here he pointed as naturally as if it had been at a lovely sunset meeting grahams hard glance with a calm one of his own came to his fathers apartment and while there he killed his father with an injection of morphine took money and property and fled there may be evidence that salvatore russo sal the defendants father was suffering from alzheimers disease and from brain cancer no one disputes these facts there may be evidence that on some days the defendant came to his fathers apartment to administer morphine to help sal deal with his pain no one disputes this either but on may ninth the defendant came not as a helper but as a thief not as a healer but as an assassin the defense may suggest that sal russo was in pain that he was dying anyway that somehow the defendant graham russo was entitled to decide whether he should live or die but whether through simple greed or some twisted sense of loyalty graham russo took his fathers property and his fathers life this the law calls robbery and murder regardless of motive we will introduce witnesses who will testify that the defendant was a trained paramedic skilled in giving injections that he had nearly constant access to and in fact provided the syringe that was used in this fatal injection that he obtained under his own name a prescription for the morphine he needed to kill his father we will bring before you a witness ms li a teller at the defendants wells fargo bank branch who will testify that on the very afternoon of sals death defendant placed into his own safety deposit box and here soma paused and lowered his voice fifty thousand dollars in cash and a collection of baseball cards from the early s worth another many thousands more hardy had been worried sick about alison lis testimony but freeman had noticed a crucial failing in everybodys reading of alisons transcripts and they had the videotapes anyway but the jury wouldnt get to freemans argument or to the tapes for several days and right now somas monologue was casting its spell graham shifted in his chair subtly hardy moved his hand over grahams sleeve giving a little squeeze a message that this was okay they had known it was going to sound bad at first graham was going to have to keep himself under control soma was smoothly proceeding sal russo had his own safe underneath his bed in his apartment we will show you a letter from sal to defendant on the bottom of which is written in defendants own handwriting the combination to that safe several of the jurors made eye contact with one another somas rendering made an impressive litany of connection hardy had to admit we will show you that defendant was in desperate need of money he had quit one job and lost another in the space of a couple of months his work as a paramedic did not begin to cover his monthly costs he drove a bmw sports car the young attorney was laying out the case in textbook fashion to the jury who gave every indication of believing him soma paused finally im going to ask you ladies and gentlemen to listen to police inspectors as they will recount for you the many many times where they gave the defendant the opportunity to explain his actions his motives his behavior and time and again you will be struck as i was by the defendants absolute disregard for the truth he has lied and lied and lied again i will ask for your patience as i walk these inspectors through their interviews with the defendant before he had even been charged with any crime and you will hear lie upon lie upon lie we will prove his lies we will prove his actions we will prove his motive we will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant graham russo killed his own father out of simple greed for the money and baseball cards in his safe soma pointed to graham one last time his voice flat and uninflected relating pure rational passionless fact there sits a murderer at the bench in the hush that followed salter made a few notes then looked up mr hardy freeman leaned over around graham at their table and whispered that they should ask for a short recess indeed thats what hardy felt like actually he wanted a long recess say two to three weeks to rethink everything he thought hed had clear before naturally he and freeman had rehearsed all the probable scenarios they could devise about somas opening statement they had in fact nailed down a close approximation of what theyd just heard after all they knew the evidence and that was all the prosecution was allowed to talk about somehow though on this day with somas lowkey delivery which they hadnt predicted the case felt different suddenly the jitters gripped hardy terribly his stomach roiled with tension the worst thing he could do he realized would be to delay if he hesitated at all his nerves would begin to throw off sparks visible to the jury and his opponents his doubts about his client and strategy would choke off his words his throat his breathing worst of all the jury could use these precious moments to savor and digest the rich nourishment that soma had just provided them in california the defense has the option of delivering its opening statement immediately following that of the prosecution as a form of instant rebuttal or waiting until later at the beginning of the introduction of its own caseinchief hardy had planned all along to deliver his opening right after somas but suddenly it seemed even more crucial he had to get up now to start brusquely he shook off freemans hand not even seeing him really he was on his feet aware of a jelliness in his knees a lowpitched roar in his ears at the same time he mustnt forget that this was performance he had to appear loose especially in front of all of these men if they were like hardy and at least a few of them had to be thats what they would relate to and respect he felt trapped in the endless psychic toll of maleness weakness kills anger though was all right and was the closest hardy could get to anything positive grim lipped he got to the jury box and turned all the way around to face soma the message was controlled anger mixed with derision a shake of the head hardy was disgusted by the untruth of what hed just heard he was back facing the panel he tore a page out of somas book subtly mocking his opponents only bit of flamboyance pointing his own hand at his client graham russo he began cared for his father protected his father and loved his father these are the primary facts in this case it is an obscenity that he has been charged with murder at all here is the true version of what happened on may eighth and ninth of this year in the course of the trial hardy would call his client by his first name much as soma had referred to him only as the defendant its true that graham was a regular visitor to his fathers apartment he went there to administer shots for sals pain but he also went there to visit to take his father to dinner to organize and clean and help with the laundry he did this regularly for nearly two years and much more frequently in the last six months of sals life as the alzheimers progressed and the cancer in sals brain became more debilitating over the last few weeks sal had suffered some rather more serious bouts of forgetfulness sal was terrified of being placed in a nursing home he didnt much trust the system incidentally he passed that trait along to his son here hardy risked an insiders smile confident that at least some of these jurors would share the feeling that bureaucrats were perhaps not the earths most exalted life form so what have we got here weve got a simple italian fisherman who didnt want to end his life in lonely destitution on may eighth he was lucid and spoke to his son he had some money in the safe under his bed money hed saved for a long time his son should take it and put it in a safe place so he could use it for pain medication for sals rent for private nursing care in his apartment if it came to that before the cancer killed him anything sal said just dont leave him alone in a home to die freeman graham and himself had argued for hours over the entire singleterry question and finally had decided that hardys instincts were right twentytwo hundred dollars in ads all over the country had resulted in a whole lot of responses but no joan sals request to graham might have been genuine certainly graham seemed to believe it but it wouldnt play here before the jury so the defense team had reached a consensus joan singleterry must have been someone in sals past dredged up by the alzheimers by now quite possibly dead she wasnt going to get mentioned at the trial hardy took a beat realizing as he did that his legs were now firm under him it was a relief he looked up and down the panel making some eye contact where it seemed natural so yes graham had his fathers money we will show you that it was on that day may eighth that graham took this money and the baseball cards to his safety deposit box on may ninth his father called him again twice the pain was terrible could graham come right over when he got the message the dutiful and caring son he did go to his fathers apartment one last time and hardy thought here is where it gets tricky he took a deep breath youre going to learn that sal russo died of an intravenous morphine injection he had had a few drinks dr strout our city and county coroner is going to tell you that his death was quick and relatively if not completely painless sals doctor had earlier prescribed for him a form called a dnr it stands for do not resuscitate its kind of like a medic alert bracelet that instructs paramedics to let a person die if that is natures course sal had his dnr sticker out when he was found he was a very sick man in great pain every day terrified that he was losing the last of his mind afraid of being sent to a home this was the man who died the victim his son graham loved him no murder for money was done here no murder at all the prosecution cannot and will not prove to you that graham russo killed his father the evidence will not show that graham is guilty because despite all the prosecutions desperate rhetoric and their urge to make headlines he is innocent hardy paused nodded at the empaneled jurors and realized that he was done that little fuckers pretty good freeman contentedly chewed his lo mein his chopsticks poised for the next attack they were sitting in the holding cell the only place they could talk to graham privately during recesses and lunch breaks the cell was furnished with two concrete shelves that served as benches built into the walls and an open toilet there was nothing for an inmate to steal or vandalize the place was littered with cardboard cartons from the takeout that freeman had ordered up earlier in the day as a special treat from chinatown there were also containers of vinegar mongolian fire oil packets of soy and other sauces extra chopsticks paper plates and napkins gils not dumb he was the star at drapers graham was dipping a duck leg into some plum sauce hardys own appetite had disappeared even without the stink of the holding cell ripe and cloying his opening statement had left his stomach hollow unsettled he couldnt imagine putting any food in it freeman noticed he raised his eyes from his lunch you all right diz standing at the bars arms crossed over his chest looking back toward the courtroom hardy lifted his shoulders nerves you did fine laid out the boundaries drew the lines freeman popped a pot sticker whole into his mouth chewed a moment its all alison li there is no evidence that graham put the money in the bank within months of sals death thats it we dont have to prove anything except that theyve got to prove what theyve got no evidence for and they cant do that right graham was all agreement back to a carton hed missed on his first pass cant be done hardy gave them both a weary smile well then thats settled i think ill go say hi to my wife bring her in here freeman said hardy threw a quick glance around at the depressing cell shaking his head hardy was moving toward the door i dont think so shed waited in the gallery now nearly deserted during the lunch hour greeting him with a kiss on the cheek she read his mood dismas it wasnt that bad he pulled down the seat next to her and sat i can see the chronicle headline tomorrow russo defense not that bad it was better than that she put a hand on his knee and squeezed it youll do fine youre doing fine but i notice our friend abe isnt hanging around frannie knew about the original disagreement of course but the summer had intervened the kids home all day classes and camps and soccer and baseball and shed been assuming it had more or less blown over are you still in a fight hardy shrugged i guess so you ought to go see him ive tried i dont know what else i can do he thinks ive sold out somehow that im not the same person but you are no im defending somebody he arrested not once but twice he really believes grahams a killer and not some kind of a mercy killer either a bonafide stone murderer which is of course how cops are supposed to think but hes always been a cop i know and ive always gotten the benefit of the doubt but now abe thinks ive sold myself a bill of goods too that graham suckered me and im an idiot for believing him frannie crossed her arms and looked away what nothing just that i hope you didnt youre not hardy shook his head no way im not he checked the courtroom making sure it was otherwise empty look at evans shes a cop too but shes in love with him she wouldnt have let herself get there if she didnt think he was innocent he took in his wifes expression i love that thing you do with your eyes when you think im full of it frannie smiled at him all im saying is that she could have found herself attracted to him and because of that convinced herself that he couldnt have done it that kind of thing has been known to happen i fell in love with you for example before i knew everything about you he grinned back at her and now that you know if youd known back then it probably wouldnt have made any difference which is my point hardy said no frannie countered its my point sarah evans is a cop and she loves him she doesnt care if hes a murderer or not hes not i hope not dismas i hope youre both right but listening to mr soma i have to tell you im not so sure there it was hardy thought an honest take on the respective opening statements and from his own wife no less who might have been expected to give hardys side the benefit of the doubt if frannies reaction was anything like the jurys and he had to assume it was close he was in more trouble than hed realized and hed thought hed been in it up to his eyeballs from his days as a prosecutor hardy knew that one of the first orders of business in a murder trial prosaic as it might seem was to establish the fact that a murder had taken place for this reason he predicted that dr john strout the coroner for the city and county of san francisco would be the first witness soma would call but he was wrong it was the first workday of the week it was directly after the lunch recess drysdale and somas first witness was mario giotti apparently even salter had known of this arrangement the two jurists entered the courtroom from salters chambers maybe theyd even had lunch together hardy surmised that this timing had been arranged entirely for giottis convenience he could come down to the hall from the federal courthouse during his lunch break testify immediately say his piece for the record endure a hopefully brief crossexamination and be back in his chambers by two oclock what galled hardy was that he and freeman had been kept ignorant while every other principal in the trial had known about this arrangement but there wasnt anything he could do about it now giotti was on the stand taking the oath judge salter had restricted the attorneys access to the witness box he didnt want either hardy or soma to intimidate any witnesses by getting too close to them physically they were to ask their questions from the center of the courtroom soma stood there now mr giotti soma began can you tell us your full name and occupation please when he got to federal judge there was an audible buzz in the courtroom several members of the jury glanced at one another a lot of juice up there soma shamelessly obsequious asked salters permission to address the witness either as judge or your honor trying to make a gracious joke salter said he would allow it if the court reporter had no objection he leaned over the podium and asked her approval she wouldnt get confused everybody had a chuckle the universe bending over backwards to be nice to the federal judge hardy dared not object what would he object to it would alienate salter and possibly giotti and it was better luck to be hit by a truck than to get a judge mad at you judge giotti soma began on the night of friday may ninth of this year can you tell us what you did giotti knew a thing or two about how to give testimony and he looked at soma then the jury then sat back and told his story although technically witnesses werent permitted to give long answers the lawyer was supposed to ask a series of questions giotti evidently wasnt inclined to do it that way and soma let him go on i went out to dinner with my wife pat to lulus after we finished she took her car back home shed been downtown earlier in the day and i decided to pick up some papers that id left at my office so i could review them over the weekend my office is at the federal courthouse on seventh street which happens to abut the alley where sal russo had his apartment mr russo and i had been friends for many years and id made it a habit to buy fish from the back of his truck on fridays put it in a cooler in the trunk of my car take it home for the weekend on this friday sal hadnt shown up so i thought id go check and see if he was all right i knew hed been sick i was in the neighborhood anyway and what did you do then soma prodded the heavy brow clouded giotti didnt appreciate getting prompted he knew what he had to say and hed get to it the scowl faded slowly as he went on i walked up and knocked on his door there was a light on inside but no one answered so i tried the doorknob and it opened and i saw him sal lying on the floor in his living room he was lying on the floor soma asked giottis eyes narrowed soma wasnt scoring points with the judge i said that didnt i trying to recover soma stammered yes you did im sorry your honor so sal russo was lying on the floor what did you do next giotti had delivered his message to soma hardy wasnt about to object the judge went on without interruption for another couple of minutes hed called waited for the paramedics and the police first two uniformed officers and then the inspectors noticed the dnr sticker on the table the syringe and vial the bottle of whiskey he didnt touch anything he knew the drill so he just waited then answered the police questions and went home though hed guessed wrong on the timing hardy had assumed that soma would call giotti as a witness at some point not because of any real strategic reason but simply because it was natural that the person who first came upon the body would be a necessary step in drawing the picture of what had happened giotti would fill in that blank but that was not somas only rationale after asking giotti one or two innocuous questions a chair had been knocked over in the kitchen the syringe and empty vial were on the low coffee table he got to some meat your honor youve testified that sal russo was lying on the floor is that right yes was there a chair or something nearby he could have been sitting on giotti closed his eyes visualizing his chair he had an old recliner he liked he was on the floor in front of that in other words between the recliner and the coffee table yes soma went back to his table grabbed a photograph passed to him by drysdale had it entered as peoples exhibit one and asked giotti if the picture captured the reality hed witnessed upon entered the apartment thats the way it looked he agreed sal was on the floor on his side just like here the image was clear and damaging its message undeniable if something benign had happened wouldnt sal have been sitting in his favorite recliner at least wouldnt his deliverer have tried to make him comfortable in his last moments instead the victim lay on his side in a hump on the floor as though hed been poleaxed soma left the jury to ponder all of these things hed gotten what he wanted so he thanked the judge and sat down hardy felt that he and the federal judge were basically on the same side although giotti was technically a witness for the prosecution his testimony in a fair world ha should have come a little later in the trial and hardy had been almost looking forward to it he thought hed be able to put some points on the board but first now hed have to undo some of somas damage judge giotti he began you were good friends with sal russo werent you a nod genial id known him for years although we didnt socialize much anymore we were close acquaintances and as his close acquaintance did you see him often giotti considered this as i said almost every friday id pick up some fish when i wasnt traveling once or twice id gone up to his apartment and had a drink with him end of the day end of the week on your visits to sals apartment for drinks did he sit in his recliner sure yes then giotti threw him a bone sometimes but not always no where did he sit other times your honor soma spoke quietly reluctant to intrude upon giottis testimony this is irrelevant but salter didnt think so overruled hardy repeated his question about where sal sat hed sit anywhere giotti said sal was a free spirit hed sit on the coffee table on the recliner the couch the floor hed move around so he could have been sitting on the floor when he received this injection and objection this was drysdale citing speculation and this time salter sustained him hardy turned back to his table and freeman was surreptitiously motioning him over so he pretended he was getting a drink of water what armed with freemans quick advice and the photograph he returned to the witness judge giotti he said looking here at peoples one is the reclining chair in a reclining position freeman of course had spotted that it wasnt in the picture it appeared to be straight up and giotti said as much now to the best of your recollection was it like this when you entered the room giotti closed his eyes again briefly id say yes i dont remember it being down i would have had to push it up to walk around it and i didnt do that this was good enough and hardy would take it he could later argue that sals body had simply either fallen out of its chair or better that hed been seated on the floor when the injection was given in all he was heartened giotti had helped him the jury would at least have some possible alternatives to consider he considered it was time to move to the other point hed originally intended to bring up judge giotti youve testified that you were aware that sal was sick did you know he had alzheimers disease not for sure no did you know he had cancer your honor soma was behind hardy objecting his voice developing its telltale shrillness i fail to see relevance and of course in a legal sense there wasnt much but hardy felt he had to get some human feeling for sals pain into the proceedings he had a sense giotti would cooperate first though salter had to be gotten around and the trial judge seemed to agree with soma hardys questions were irrelevant and unnecessary but giottis authority cut both ways in the courtroom and when he looked up at salter and told him he didnt mind answering though this was beside the point salter acquiesced and overruled the objection giotti turned back to hardy the headaches were evidently pretty horrible sal told me now giotti looked over to the jury speaking to them half kidding but you knew he meant it that if i didnt see him for a few days i should check his apartment he might be dead if he didnt die from the pain he might just kill himself and is that why you did just that on may ninth stop by his apartment essentially yes i think hed planted that seed hardy nodded pleased that hed gotten it in he knew he was going to die soon is that what youre saying drysdale objection speculation sustained hardy ill rephrase your honor judge giotti did sal russo ever seriously tell you he thought he was near death drysdale again objection but salter overruled this one and giotti nodded yes he told me hed be dead within a couple of months he knew that he thought he did yes thank you your honor thats all he turned to soma redirect but the prosecutors realized that perhaps for all their fawning giotti was not exactly in their pocket and they passed the witness as soon as the judge had left the stand before he was through the bar back into the gallery salter pointed down at soma with his gavel your next witness the people call john strout the tall man with the deep south accent moved from the gallery into the bullpen took the oath and went around to the witness chair strout testified about once a week in one case or another and was a recognized forensic expert throughout the country he often traveled to other jurisdictions to render second opinions on ambiguous causes of death so he sat back legs crossed languidly at home on the stand while soma got his name occupation experience on the record asked the first few predictable questions then in other words dr strout are you saying that twelve milligrams of morphine injected directly into the vein is sufficient to cause death hardy thought if strout were any more relaxed up there hed be dead which didnt mean he wasnt paying attention he corrected soma twelve milligrams intravenous could be sufficient to cause death especially if there were other factors such as alcohol and was there alcohol in the case of salvatore russo yes how much well his blood alcohol level was point one oh and is that a lot doctor was sal russo drunk in california he was legally drunk yes hardy didnt have any idea where soma was going with all these questions about sal and drinking and that worried him so what if sal had been drunk how did it relate to graham how could it hurt him now doctor could the alcohol level in the victims blood contribute to the effect the morphine might have strout took his time wanting to be precise after a moment he uncrossed his legs and leaned forward in the witness box yes it could have in what way with that much alcohol aboard the morphine would have caused his blood pressure to drop rapidly almost instantaneously strout nodded almost and then what would happen well with no blood pressure you get no blood to your head and you pass out this was the answer soma expected and he nodded pleased but if sal russo injected himself and went unconscious he would not have had time to remove the needle from his arm is that correct yes and in this photo soma entered the polaroid print into evidence can you see the syringe on a table near the body with the cap in place over it doctor yes then assuming that the needle was found as shown in the photo and assuming further that mr russo did fall unconscious from the combined effect of alcohol and morphine it is true is it not that this scenario is not consistent with sal russo having administered the morphine himself yes strout replied assuming those facts as true this morphine was not selfadministered hardy scribbled a note he would hammer strout with all of this consistent and inconsistent in his crossexamination but he understood somas point and he thought the jury would too soma made it sound as though strout were saying that someone had killed sal russo it wasnt a suicide but soma well on his way to establishing that had more and not in the category of maybe dr strout was there any evidence of trauma on the victims body strout nodded going on about the bruise to the head behind the ear could this bruise have knocked the victim out briefly yes i think so do you know what could have caused this bruise hardy objected citing speculation but was overruled this fell well within the doctors realm of expertise well whatever it was didnt cause a concussion and left no imprint on the skull i can say only that it was a relatively heavy blunt object without sharp edges such as a whiskey bottle objection this is speculation your honor overruled yes strout answered this would be consistent with the whiskey bottle at the scene soma kept at it staccato style barely taking time to draw breath between questions how about the injection site how did that look well there was trauma there too what do you mean by trauma in laypersons terms the skin and muscles were slightly torn as the needle was coming out like a deep scratch not as the needle was going in no definitely not a small but important point since a skilled shotgiver like graham wouldnt have botched the injection itself whereas a jerk or a struggle after the needle was in could happen to anyone soma thanked strout and walked back to the prosecution table where he glanced at some papers on the desk hardy was ready to pounce with objections should soma as he expected try to wrap it up the picture hardy thought was clear enough somebody loaded the victim up with alcohol then hit him on the head knocking him out long enough to get the shot in the vein in the middle of which sal jerked either in spasm or waking up all of that would be speculation on strouts part and not admissible but hardy didnt get his opportunity to object soma simply turned to him amicable and professional for the jurys benefit your witness hardy took it right to him dr strout did sal russo kill himself or did somebody kill him crossing his legs to get more comfortable strout settled in the witness chair well from the pure forensic evidence it could have been either are you saying there is no way to tell from a strictly medical standpoint whether sal russo killed himself or someone else killed him yes thats what im saying strout waited an experienced witness he wasnt about to lead an attorney so he could be interrupted and made to look unprofessional hardy nodded apparently intrigued with these unearthed truths is there anything in the forensic evidence doctor that would lead you to think one is more likely than the other strout thought this over briefly no what about this bruise on the head weve heard about did that contribute to sal russos death in a medical sense no not at all no not at all it was possibly enough to knock out mr russo but it had nothing to do with his death hardy feigned a small surprise bringing in the jury doctor did you just say that this bruise was possibly enough to knock out mr russo yes it could have and are you saying it might not have thats right too strout was showing a hint of impatience i said it wasnt very serious yes you did thank you doctor essentially it was just a bump on the head isnt that right yes now was the head trauma suffered before or after the injection i cant say so sal russo might have injected himself fallen over and hit his head yes and if the head injury happened before the injection can you tell how long before could it have happened strout thought for a moment only from the bruising within a day or two hardy feigned shock and disbelief doctor do you mean you cant even say that sal russo got the bump on his head on the same day as his death not for sure not for sure well then doctor is it correct to say you dont know if this bump on the head has any connection at all to sal russos death yes that would be correct good soma had wanted to use strouts testimony to prove that a murder had taken place but hardy didnt think it was going to work he started hammering at another nail youve also told us about a trauma at the injection site you said it was consistent with someone injecting sal with the morphine yes correct but its also consistent with sal russo injecting himself isnt it yes thats true too sal russo might have jerked as he was injecting himself mightnt he objection soma stood which hardy took as a good sign the trial had barely begun and already the younger attorneys placid demeanor was showing signs of turbulence speculation your honor this was overruled hardy tried to keep his face neutral strout said he was correct sal might have jerked as he was injecting himself hardy nodded genially and pressed on doctor theres one last point id like you to clarify didnt you tell mr soma that sal russo had a blood alcohol level of point one oh and that because of this he might have become unconscious while the needle was still in his vein and therefore not have been able to withdraw it yes thats what i said you said this scenario was consistent with your finding didnt you yes but consistent only means it could be true not that it is true you cant rule out other scenarios can you no so even with sal russos elevated blood alcohol might this just as easily not have happened yes in other words doctor just to be perfectly clear about this there is nothing in your findings or testimony that indicates that sal russo did not kill himself would that be an accurate statement yes this could be a simple suicide couldnt it yes salter was frowning and hardy liked the look of it when you get a coroner saying you dont necessarily even have a crime an overworked judge might find himself wondering why he was presiding over a murder trial hardy thanked the witness but before hed gotten back to his table soma was up on redirect dr strout he said youre not saying that this was a suicide are you no and why was that strout shrugged a drop of impatience finally leaking out there was just no way to tell one way or the other hardy went home for dinner stayed for most of two hours kissed his little darlings goodnight then headed downtown again first to the jail to keep graham company and discuss the days events and their ongoing strategy then back to his office for a more critical postmortem with david freeman when he got back home at elevenfifteen he was ready to collapse and not altogether thrilled to find sarah evans at his diningroom table talking with frannie over coffee cups if thats decaf he said ill have some though im philosophically opposed to the idea of it his wife offered a cheek for a kiss in the past months evans had become sarah the midnight phone calls gave way to the occasional meeting here at the house she and frannie close to the same age had interests in common sarah was talking about getting married having babies frannie now about joining the police department both wanted all this to happen in the future sometime theyd had some good discussions frannie said sarah and i have decided that when the kids are gone i should be a cop not a family counselor after all hardy pulled up a chair good idea i mean it fast times great benefits a really swell clientele youd enjoy it but do you want to hear my idea about after the kids are gone okay what you travel the world and go to exotic ports with your retired husband and be his love slave frannie put a hand over his the reason i love him she said its that wacky sense of humor frannie parted his hand hes had a long day mentioning hardys day brought them all back to reality but especially sarah it was why she had come over as a witness she wasnt allowed in the courtroom shed worked in the field all day and by now was a wreck needing to know how it had gone hardy was honest with her its somas turn he gets to lay out his case first later i show up and slay him not amused sarah sighed i just dont feel like ive done enough youve done more on this case than any cop ive ever heard of sarah it still doesnt feel like enough if theyve only got one suspect and thats graham then all somas got to do is make the murder and theres no other option hardy knew that this was mostly true and it wasnt much comfort to him either and he didnt even want to start on his fears about the jury putting a good face on it he kept his tone light he wont make the murder but dismas it was a murder you and i both think it was a murder you do frannie suddenly asked uhoh hardy thought he hadnt consciously been trying to hide anything from frannie but neither had he wanted to burden his wife with all the ins and outs of the case she had her own life she was handling here on the home front and much more efficiently he felt than he was handling many parts of his he had outlined for her the general theory of his defense and told her that he honestly believed that graham hadnt done it but not that someone else had one of frannies main complaints about her husband being involved with murder trials was the fact that he would be working with someone who had killed someone on purpose and thus had a slightly betterthanaverage chance of doing it again perhaps to his attorney andor attorneys family now hardy shrugged it could have been we knew that frannie played with it for a while then balled a fist and brought it down on the table shit she said just shit what sarah asked didnt we know it we knew it hardy assured her frannie didnt sarah reached a hand over the table thats what ive been looking for all this time fran who killed sal her flat stunned gaze went from one of them to the other she let out a deep breath im going to bed and she was up and out of the room sarah started to rise to follow her let her go hardy said its all right ill talk to her she sat back down arms crossed im sorry i thought i should go no he said sharply i want you to understand that weve got an outstanding defense going here even david freeman thinks its good and hes mikey as far as im concerned its going to work i believe it will work and what if it doesnt he didnt answer there wasnt an answer sarah had her elbows on the table and blew into her steepled hands i could just quit my job she said i could work on it full time hardy shook his head youre better inside im no good i havent found anything sal wasnt carrying anybodys money that i can find hadnt for years not even a sniff of it nobody killed whatshisname for his fish business pio hardy said hating his damned memory i should go strongarm george grahams brother shake him down find out where he was and get fired it doesnt matter if he did it hardy reached across the table and touched her elbow slow down slow down take a breath he waited listen this is always the worst after youre committed and you dont know how its going to go you just got to believe you made the right decision thats how its going to work but i cant just sit here i cant grahams just sitting there this seemed to hit home she took a breath let it out heavily so what then i cant believe weve got a righteous suspect with no alibi and nobodys even no we dont whos that george hardy shook his head george is not any kind of suspect he doesnt need an alibi nobody saw him near sals ever theres no prints no medical background no real knowledge of his fathers situation even if he was going to kill sal out of rage he would have done it differently if he knew he was going to die soon anyway why would he do it at all besides he wouldnt let his brother go to prison for the rest of his life i bet he would if it came down to either graham or him hardy pondered a moment look sarah it wasnt graham right of course he really didnt do it thats what you think she stared at him you do no as a matter of fact i dont he didnt do it so im going on the assumption that they cant prove he did thats the system ive got to believe in it in fact hardy had serious doubts about the system and supposed that sarah did too but this wasnt the time to air them look he said if it makes you feel better use some police magic and see if you can find out where george went get some hard evidence maybe he used a credit card made a phone call i wish abe hardy shook his head stopping her abes got a suspect in custody how is he going to justify continuing an investigation sarah sighed i know she said at last i know its just so frustrating and youre on the list for tomorrow right meaning the witness list she would probably be called the next day you ought to get some sleep itll look better with a little rest she sighed a last time and stood up do you want me to go in and talk to frannie thats all right hardy said well work it out frannie was asleep lying on her side facing away from his half of the bed her breathing was neither regular nor heavy but she was asleep that was her story and she was sticking to it hardys official workday the next morning carried over the tension from his kitchen hed finally fallen asleep after one oclock and was up at fivethirty going over his notes trying to secondguess what would happen in the courtroom that day frannie did not get up to make his coffee he was out of the house he had to be out of the house by seventhirty just as the kids and his wife were getting to the breakfast table kiss the kids goodbye all he was doing anymore with them eyes from frannie no words in front of the children tonight maybe then at the hall waiting and waiting for his partner and costrategist david freeman who hadnt arrived by the time the bailiffs brought graham into the holding cell surfer hair combed back neatly he was putting on his civilian coat and tie at a few minutes after nine oclock wheres yoda graham had christened freeman after the star wars gnome hardy thought it a fairly astute characterization i dont know probably doing a little coldfusion work keep his hand in studied nonchalance in truth though freemans absence left him with a lowvoltage sense of unease a goodluck charm misplaced as though he needed any more bad vibes but there was no point harping on it other matters pressed hardy looked around behind him lowered his voice you talk to sarah this morning she came by my house last night she wants to go after your brother i know we talked about it grahams massive hands were making confetti from the edges of a yellow legal pad i dont think its a bad idea you dont you did last time i asked in the early days when hardy was gearing up for his some other dude did it defense hed questioned graham about georges motives and opportunities graham had laughed at him there was no chance his brother could have been involved now he was singing a different tune graham looked as though hed eaten some bad cheese maybe im finally getting pissed off ive been thinking about me you know my situation here he motioned toward the door to the courtroom all this but you know what the eyes seemed to reach all the way into his soul this was no act or if it was it was one hardy hadnt seen before in nearly five months of daily contact what hardy asked but quiet okay he raised his eyes suddenly aware of voices from the courtroom from the jury box which was haphazardly filling up graham leaned in toward him somebody did kill sal diz thats the thing with all this concentration on getting me off we kind of pushed that under the rug now i think about it i want the son of a bitch i dont care if its georgie and you think it is id like to make sure it isnt lets put it that way you know what i think you know how i told you if leland pays you he gets something for it yeah what hes getting here is keeping you off his favored son maybe on more sleep with freeman at his side and his wife not mad at him hardy would have reacted more coolly but he felt a rush of blood heard a pounding of it in his ears he clipped it out i hope im not hearing you say you think im in lelands pocket easy diz i dont think you meant to be im just too stupid to see it right part of it of course suddenly clear was that it could have been true and hardy in fact hadnt seen it by paying hardys bills for grahams defense leland taylor had effectively defused any investigations hardy might have otherwise considered pursuing within the taylor family graham shrugged its an obvious stone and its unturned theres no way to turn it hardys voice echoed in the holding cell glitsky wont look at it sarah risks her job if she he shook his head you know this theres no way graham remained calm for one of the very first times hardy got a glimpse of the legal mind that had gotten his client his federal clerkship theres no way without alienating leland thats true and hes set us up so we wont its subtle and its sweet and thats the way my stepfather works you think hes protecting george another shrug i know from mom that he doesnt know where george was i know it worries the shit out of him and leland thinks a couple of other things like what one theres bettable odds youre going to get me off so theres no real risk anyway just a few more months of my already wasted life im a pawn hell risk losing to save his bishop whats the other one sals death wasnt any great loss he was old and feeble and a pain in the ass if georgie killed him it wasnt like a real murder more like putting down a dog sal was a nonentity when he was alive he didnt count not to leland and he would be dead anyway in a couple of months what does it matter hardy sat back in his chair ran a hand through his hair shades of dean powell tell him graham said see what he does tell who leland tell him youre going to be looking into georges alibi see if he cuts off the money or even better offers you more if you dont then at least well know we wont know about george but well know for sure why lelands in this is money after all thicker than blood georgies the heir apparent to the bank if he killed sal hell any scandal goodbye line of succession ill tell him hardy said he dug his thumbs into his eyes a wave of exhaustion washing over him he suddenly wondered if he wouldnt be wise to plead some kind of personal crisis toothache migraine chest pains and ask salter for a oneday continuance but this was only day two of the marathon that was the trial proper it was unimaginable but he knew hed be more fatigued than this before it was over if he was going to beg a day off highly frowned upon it should at least be when the danger of dropping dead from exhaustion was a real possibility but he couldnt give in to any of this it was the devil i might as well tell him were looking at debra too my sister debras a big reason youre here graham shook his head i dont think so believe it hardy said i was reading sarahs reports this morning getting ready for her testimony first phone call she made on the case was to debra and what did debra say she told sarah you were probably lying you couldnt be trusted she was the one who brought up the baseball cards before anybody even knew about the money she got sarah looking at you graham thats what started it shes so stupid he said flatly she also works at a vets right she gives shots to animals my guts tell me a lethal injection is more a womans way to kill than a mans debra needs the money more than anybody else graham had his head in his hands no no no thats not it its nothing like that whats it like then you tell me sitting back crossing his arms graham came back to hardy his voice low deb and i were close until i was out of law school she didnt buy into the taylor magic the way mom and georgie did so we were on the same team then she married brendan so two years after shes married im at this nightclub and i look over and heres brendan flossing the tonsils of some babe who is not debra so i go over a little closer make sure yep its brendan hes cheating on my sister so what do i do the good brother first i kick brendans ass then i go tell her he let out a long sigh so shes got two options right she either believes me and confronts brendan or she wimps out and tells herself some other story like her brothers lying to her instead of her husband but why would you lie to her i never liked brendan i didnt think he was good enough for her which ps he isnt im trying to ruin her marriage he spread his palms so anyway brendan got home before i went to tell her and made up his own story first he told her id been drunk and just teed off on him for no reason so she blew up at me for beating up the son of a bitch threw me out of her house called me a liar i wasnt happy in my life and couldnt stand it that she was so thats it thats it im a liar brendans a good husband who loves her end of story promptly at ninethirty salter pointed again at soma and he rose at his table the people call sergeant philip parini david freeman still hadnt made his appearance this was the first hardy had seen of the crime scene investigations specialist whod drawn the russo case although hed read his reports the man himself was slight of build and precise of movement his tailor had done a very good job on the dark blue suit parini parted his wispy crown of black hair in the middle of his head a ramrod in the witness box he rested his folded hands on the wooden railing in front of him from the middle of the courtroom soma was ready once again to try to establish that a murder had taken place sergeant parini was your unit the first to arrive at the scene sal russos apartment at the lions arms oh no not at all judge giotti was there we also had paramedics a couple of uniformed officers who had secured the scene and inspectors lanier and evans and can you tell the jury what you found there parini cleared his throat but there was no sense that it was out of nerves he wanted to be clearly understood that was all first i doublechecked with the officers that nothing had been disturbed the paramedics had arrived a few minutes after the officers and had been apprised of the dnr situation the victim was clearly deceased the lead emt told me that the body had already cooled perceptibly by the time they arrived this was hearsay but hardy didnt object it wasnt the issue and would you describe the body then as you found it parini ran his proforma description which he then verified against the photograph that was peoples one as this was going on freeman pushed open the swinging section of the bar rail patted hardy on the shoulder and sat down at the defense table on the other side of graham hardy shot him a questioning look and freeman mouthed later soma in the center of the courtroom didnt even notice the minor interruption he was back at the witness so sergeant parini based on your training and experience did the position of sal russos body look like a suicide to you objection hardy remained seated speculation from his bench salter was a bit of a ramrod himself no this is informed opinion mr hardy your objection is overruled sergeant parini you may answer the question parini nodded the drill of the witness stand had its own rhythm and the sergeant was familiar with it he waited while the court reporter reread somas question and then picked it right up yes my initial impression from the body not just that it was on the floor its position was unnatural unnatural how it seemed to have been dropped there soma did some light pantomime sharing the import of this fact with the jury did you find anything else sergeant that led you to conclude that this was a homicide yes i did there was a whiskey bottle old crow bourbon on its side on the floor under the table its cap wasnt on tight and quite a bit of the whiskey had seeped out onto the floor and what was the significance of that in your opinion hardy thought he could object but hed be overruled again in the view of the criminal courts crime scene investigations inspectors so long as their training and experience was ritually invoked had nearly the authority of expert witnesses they were allowed a wide latitude in what would otherwise be speculation so hardy kept quiet and listened to the words all the more damning because he thought the theory they supported was what had in fact happened it just hadnt happened with graham parini went ahead with the confidence of someone whod thought it all through carefully i think the most reasonable explanation was that it was either knocked over in a struggle or perhaps kicked over in an assailants haste to get out of the apartment it was still dripping slowly when i got there did you find the syringe sergeant yes it was right there on the top of the coffee table capped along with an empty vial in other words the needle was not in the victims arm was it no and what did you do with this syringe and vial i bagged it and sent it to the lab for analysis fingerprinting and so on and can you tell us sergeant what the lab found that the vial had contained morphine and that there were fingerprints on both it and the syringe and did you identify these fingerprints yes we did they belong to the defendant graham russo parini stayed on the stand for the better part of two hours he described the chair on the floor in the kitchen the scratches on the cabinetry the safe grahams fingerprints all over the place even on the dnr tube soma entered the vial the syringe the bottle of old crow the tube and sticker into evidence it all took time and salter called a halt for lunch before hardy could begin his crossexamination hardy gathered his papers asked graham what they wanted to order for lunch freeman was uncharacteristically silent brooding leading the way for the three of them back to their holding cell behind the courtroom when they got there freeman waited and let them both pass then told hardy that maybe he ought to sit down graham took off his coat and was twisting his body back and forth exercising hardy cricked his own back ive been sitting all morning david whats up freeman shrugged it had to come out anyway and if hardy wanted to stand so be it i got a call at the office one of the associates in crisis he paused michelle as a matter of fact hardy made a face some kind of blowup with tryptech had been bound to happen sooner or later theyd been in waitanddelay mode for so long some judge had probably decided enough was enough and set a hearing date in the next couple of weeks but then another thought occurred why didnt she call me freeman blew out a breath well she feels a little awkward graham stopped his calisthenics listening something in freemans tone you know ovangevale networks this was like asking hardy if hed heard of disneyland ovangevale had come from nowhere and grown like ragweed in the last five years with its internet applications they were the new kids on the block and a powerhouse in the industry hardy swore they stole her didnt they not quite graham looked over at hardy i love the way yoda strings it out dont you you want to go out for the sandwiches david let us have a guessing game till you get back what hardy asked simply freeman rolled his eyes theyre buying tryptech he said no theyre not thats impossible hardy flatly didnt believe it not with this lawsuit hanging theyd their own lawyers did some backdoor contingency deal they got the port of oakland to go along if tryptech would settle for twelve five twelve five hardys voice echoed in the tiny space we can get close to thirty and theyre freeman held up his hand its an albatross diz they dont care about the shortterm loss they just want it out of the way get on to new business move ahead so how long has tryptech known about this he whirled with nowhere to go ive got to call michelle why didnt she call me although he knew at least one reason why he hadnt been there for her over these last months well thats the other thing freeman said he took in a breath the tender offers at fifteen a share shed been getting paid now for four months in discounted shares as you knew yeah i knew hardys head was going light hed turned down the same offer but michelle didnt have a family to support she could afford to take the risk he found himself sitting down finally on the concrete bench freeman was going on one and a half he said one and a half what the discounted share price the original talk was two you remember but it finally went out at one and a half michelles got over forty thousand shares hardy was still trying to make sense of this sluggishly his brain tried to compute the numbers but the zeroes slowed him up and graham had him by several seconds thats six hundred thousand dollars he said never looking more like yoda the infinitely kind infinitely wise infinitely sad freeman met hardys eyes she feels really bad about this diz she wanted me to break it to you a sense of unreality hung over the afternoon one part of hardy realized that of course he was standing in the middle of the courtroom in department asking parini questions most of him though felt as if it were floating somewhere in the ozone disembodied the precious silver astral cord snapped forever six hundred thousand dollars for four months work sergeant does the fact that you found graham russos fingerprints on many surfaces in the room mean that he had been there on that day no parini remained an eloquent robot although police inspectors tended to be witnesses for the prosecution he was answering the defense counsel with the same cooperative efficiency fingerprints are oil based theres no real time limit a fingerprint on something only means that sometime the finger came in contact with it so are you saying that graham might not have been in his fathers apartment on that day at all yes there would be no way to tell all right nothings all right he could have had that money hed be free id like to ask you a question about this whiskey bottle if i may dr strout has already testified that sal russo was legally drunk at the time of the injection was the bottle under the table within reach of his arm yes id say so so that as sal was lying there he could have reached for the bottle and knocked it over would that have been possible yes and yet didnt you tell mr soma that the bottle had probably been kicked over or knocked over during a fight that was a surmise parini said there might not have been a struggle at all is that what youre saying that conclusion isnt inescapable from the whiskey bottle yes thats what im saying hardy put on a smile who could smile at a time like this he included the jury good a last question about the bottle did you find anything on it that indicated it had been used as a weapon of any kind to hit sal behind the ear for example no we didnt none of his hairs no blood no neither any fingerprints that werent sals no but you did find grahams fingerprints did you not on the vial of morphine and on the syringe yes we did hardy thought this was clear enough certainly it would be absurd to believe that graham had come in wearing gloves against leaving his fingerprints picked up the bottle and knocked his father out with it then taken off his gloves to administer the shot it was time to move to the next point now id like to ask you about the kitchen where the chair was on its side how wide is this room not wide at all eight feet or so and where are the stove and refrigerator theyre both against the right wall and is there a sink and counter yes a sink at the end and a wraparound counter against the opposite wall so are you saying there is a kind of corridor between the sinks counter and the stove and refrigerator yes thats the way it was set up with a window at the end over the sink it must be a narrow corridor isnt it parini knew that narrow was open to interpretation he clarified it four feet maybe less but wasnt there a table in the kitchen too set into this corridor yes there was and did it appear to be in its normal position in the room parini gave this question a bit of thought as though the idea hadnt occurred to him perhaps it hadnt yes it was centered about where id expect it to have been so are you saying that it didnt appear to have been knocked sideways or in any way out of position in this purported struggle in the kitchen that was so violent it knocked over the chair and scratched the cabinets no it was in the center of the corridor and besides the chair and the scratches in the cabinetry were there any other signs of struggle in the kitchen no just a chair lying on its side thats all were there dishes on the drain cups glasses plates yes there were and had any of these been knocked over by this supposedly violent struggle between two large men in the relatively tiny enclosure of the kitchen soma was up behind him objecting leading the witness your honor but on crossexamination the defense attorney is allowed to do just that salter knew this and correctly overruled soma was there anything you saw in the kitchen sergeant parini that would rule out the possibility that sal russo drunk as he was could just as easily have staggered against the chair knocked it over and simply left it there this was the crux and soma knew it he objected again on grounds of speculation and hardy waited in suspension for salter to rule hardy was coming back to the present though still sick in his heart walking an invisible tightrope between very close interpretations of the same evidence he thought hed phrased the question well for his purposes all he needed was doubt about the struggle someone else could have been with sal could have helped him die but there must not appear in the minds of the jurors that there had been any fight the judge finally spoke no the question stands ill overrule the objection sergeant you may answer the reporter read it back and parini gave it a reasonable amount of time no he said he could have stumbled against it just as easily nothing ruled it out all at once his frustration over michelles tryptech treasure gave way to enthusiasm to plumb the vein hed hit with parini in the midst of these emotions hardy made a cardinal mistake forgetting one of the first precepts of crossexamination which is never to ask a question for which you dont know the answer he said in fact sergeant isnt it true that there was nothing in the apartment that pointed to a struggle between sal russo and some purported assailant well no that isnt true there was the position of the body covering quickly hardy strolled back to his table and stalling took a drink of water thats right sergeant the position of the body you said earlier that it looked like sal russo got dropped do i have that right thats right hardy was moving to the exhibit table having dug himself this hole he remembered that the chinese used the same word for disaster and opportunity he picked up peoples one do you mean that the victim was not in the same position as shown here parini glanced at the photo no thats how he was and to your mind does that look like he was dropped yes or fell after being hit knocked out yes he was sort of crumpled hardy knew where he was going and he picked up the pace looking now at peoples one sergeant where the victim is lying sort of crumpled as you put it by this do you mean his legs are curled up under him not stretched out yes as they might have been say if hed been sitting on the floor and then collapsed with loss of consciousness parini did not answer the unflappable witness darted a quick glance toward the prosecution table hardy didnt wait for him isnt it true sergeant parini that sal russos position is exactly consistent with a collapse from a sitting position well it would yes or no sergeant isnt that true yes i suppose so and having collapsed in this unnatural position with his legs under him might his arm have fallen in such a way to knock over the whiskey bottle weve heard about that was under the table it might have but is that a yes sergeant yes it might have parini hated it but he nodded yes hardy took a breath all right one last point youve testified that the syringe and vial were left sitting on the coffee table would you describe for the jury in what way if any these implements show any evidence of a struggle or haste or violence parini studied his lap for a moment then met hardys eyes there was none and the lamp in the room sergeant had it been knocked over no had the glass been knocked off the table no was the table itself knocked over no hardy nodded walked over to the exhibit table and picked up a handful of polaroids sergeant parini as weve seen these photos show dozens of objects in this room do they not was any one of them broken or out of place or disturbed in any fashion that you could tell parinis scowl was profound no so would it be fair to say that your opinion that this scene shows a struggle is based entirely on the position of the body and a whiskey bottle out of the place on the floor parini hesitated but couldnt think of anything else to bolster his testimony thats right i suppose you suppose i see and youve already said that both the position of the body and the whiskey bottle can be explained without reference to any alleged struggle isnt that true hardy felt he couldnt have scripted parinis reaction any more perfectly the sergeant crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back in the witness chair intransigence incarnate or hardy thought bullheaded stupidity well counselor its my opinion there was a struggle precisely hardy said thats your opinion hardy hadnt said a word about the safe about all the evidence of grahams presence there were a dozen areas into which he could have wandered but only one that did his client any good hed damned well rebutted the argument that two grown men had left any sign of a struggle in the apartment this didnt mean that sal russo hadnt been coldcocked from behind with the whiskey bottle and fallen like a lump which hardy believed was what had transpired but that there was no evidence to support that theory hed leave it at that sarah was next the prosecution might have a secretly hostile witness in the female inspector but she couldnt do anything about the cards she held they were excellent for grahams enemies directly after the midafternoon recess after stretching and coffee or cigarettes the men on the jury were especially unlikely to lose interest with a pretty woman on the stand she wasnt in one of her cop suits which were purposely formless and without style knowing that shed be testifying sarah thought she should look as good as she could so she was wearing a red silk blouse that showed no skin but shimmered tantalizingly over her breasts with each breath with the beating of her heart a short combed woolen skirt and low pumps flattered her good legs her hair was off her face falling to her shoulders when she came through the bar rail hardy put a hand over his clients arm squeezed hard enough to draw blood look down he whispered she catches your eyes youre both done for inexplicably perhaps ominously art drysdale rose and walked to the center of the courtroom hardy caught a worried glance from sarah but like his client could make no sign that it meant anything he looked across to freeman who shrugged again but beneath the nonchalance hardy detected a note of concern could they have found out would drysdale in his homespun way hang sarah out to dry if so there was no immediate sign drysdale quickly introduced himself to the jury and to sarah and started in as he was going along with it hardy began to see the logic behind choosing drysdale for this witness endlessly affable he would remain the same calm and reassuring inquisitor as he drove home lie after lie after lie soma on the other hand by about the fifth lie would have his adrenaline running unable to stop himself he would speed up and this was evidence to be savored lingered over this was a lovely young woman putting stake after stake into the heart of a handsome man it would have been a very difficult q a even if shed had no feelings for him and no one would suspect that she did the more her answers seemed wrung from her the more devastating they would be inspector evans youve had a great number of opportunities to interview the defendant personally have you not sarah nodded then spoke her voice a tempered contralto yes sir i have when did you first speak with him at his home on the day after she paused and searched for a neutral phraseology the victims death that was a saturday was it not yes and did you ask the defendant if hed seen or talked to his father the day before yes i did and what did he say sarah looked over at graham hardy thought he saw a flush creeping into her complexion but in a moment she was back at drysdale he said no he hadnt seen or talked to his father the day before and so it began to get to most of the answers drysdale had to use the same approach hed used on the first question did you ask what did he say throughout sarah managed to retain her composure hardy had coached her that her testimony would not ultimately affect the verdict she should tell the truth and hed explain the falsehoods in his closing statement but hardy had to admit that listening to this almost unbelievable litany of lies was more than disheartening he prayed that the jury would buy his version of why graham had lied but perhaps hed underestimated how much people valued the truth he saw it in the eyes of almost all the jurors say what one will about evidence juries were often helped along in their deliberations by a perception of the kind of person who was charged with the crime and graham with this testimony looked very very bad under drysdales patient and meticulous examination the jury learned that graham had lied to the police about being close to his father about knowing what was causing sals pain about the number of phone calls hed received from sal about the morphine supply and the doctor whod supplied it hed lied about giving the shots themselves hed lied to his own brother about the existence of the money to his sister about the baseball cards hed denied knowing about his fathers safe professed ignorance of his own bank to say nothing of his safe deposit box denied that he and sal had ever talked about money to pay for doctor bills it was fourtwenty and drysdale had to be getting to the end hardy couldnt even remember any more lies that graham had told him although he was sure that given time he could come up with some finally he heard those magic words your witness freeman reached over around graham and touched hardys sleeve let me take her he whispered graham joking poked him with an elbow shes mine he said and hardy told him to shut up again freeman didnt let go i can undo it soma sat down for her and let drysdale do it you can sit down and let me hardy wasnt sure what freeman had in mind but the old man had a welldeserved reputation in the courtroom he shook things up often with great success indeed this was precisely the reason hardy had agreed to let him sit in with them and now he wanted to play hardy nodded go for it freeman wasted no time he stood up at his place at the table and as drysdale had done introduced himself and began inspector evans he asked in your opinion and based on your training and experience as a lawenforcement officer is the defendant here graham russo a man that you can trust there was a long dead pause of shock in the courtroom freeman had obviously given this question a lot of thought during the ninety minutes or so that drysdale had kept sarah on the stand and hardy thought it was perfect pure freeman he would never had thought of it of course it was inadmissible it was speculation it wasnt based on evidence it was from any legal perspective a just plain dumb question but hardy had a sense and freeman probably knew that neither drysdale nor soma would object after all they had a police officer up on the stand who had just recounted what seemed like a million lies the defendant had personally told her what was she going to say how could she possibly say that yes she trusted him sarah bit her lip looked at drysdale then graham finally freeman hardy threw a look up to salter who seemed to be waiting for the objection that did not come yes she said in the room itself order of a sort was restored in time for salter to call an end to the days proceedings but as the gallery began filing out the orderly queue trying to get through the double doors dissipated into pushing and namecalling the fireworks picked up out in the hallway and overflowed out the back door the legal professionals exit from the building hardy went with graham back to the changing room the defendant would be sleeping as usual in his jumpsuit pleased that freeman had so beautifully undercut sarahs damaging testimony hardys mind nevertheless kept going back to michelle and frannie and what in the world he was going to do with the rest of his life so twenty minutes later accompanied by the bailiff and graham he was surprised when they got to the corridor behind the building on the way back to the jail and were stopped by the gathered crowd of at least eighty people the reaction to sarahs testimony pratt was in the thick of it the district attorney had been in the courtroom and had raised her fist and said yes very audibly right after sarah had uttered the same word now back behind the hall it was a mob scene hardy saw freeman standing over by drysdale barbara brandt was there soma a bunch of cops in uniform tons of press in nearly twenty years under a great variety of stresses and burdens hardy had never before seen art drysdale really lose his temper but hed lost it now with sharron pratt the person whod fired him a few months ago ill tell you what you are sharron his voice carried all the way back to where hardy stood with graham and the bailiff at the doorway you are an absolute disgrace to law enforcement in fact youre not in law enforcement at all youre in social engineering to pratt this was a badge of distinction youre damn right i am the people elected me art you know why they were tired of the letter of the law and the spirit be damned they were tired of deals getting cut in back rooms the bailiff decided he ought to get graham back into the jail to his cell but hardy stopped him youre going to want to hear this carl so they stayed flies on the back door cameras were rolling microphones were pointed hardy saw sarah next to marcel lanier inside the knot of acrimony she hadnt been the grenade but she was the pin that once pulled had led to the explosion we didnt cut any deals in back rooms drysdale was raving standing on a concrete planter box he stormed at the crowd this woman has no clue doesnt anybody see that pratt shot back at him you put graham russo on trial for murdering his father when you know he didnt that says it all the da played it for the crowd raising her own voice anybody out here think this wasnt an assisted suicide anybody think this was a murder im waiting hardy didnt miss the irony in the fact that the defense team and sarah were probably the only ones who did think sal had been murdered but this wasnt the time to bring it up taking his cue from pratt drysdale struck again ask your friend barbara brandt sharron ask her if shes ever met graham russo ill tell you what she hasnt we checked her out sharron its all made up brandt yelled out thats a damn lie thats drysdale shouted her down but dont let the truth get in your way it never has before suddenly even sarah was in his sights he turned to her and pointed and while were at it what reward are you giving sergeant evans for her testimony today you going to let her be your chauffeur freeman in the unaccustomed role of peacemaker reached a hand up to drysdale thats out of line art come on down this is a travesty this is a goddamn travesty the climax was over hardy heard pratt say something about sore loser loud enough for the crowd but the public faceoff wasnt good politics and evidently this had finally occurred to her drysdale was pushing his way soma in tow to the back lot suddenly abe glitsky was standing at hardys elbow whats going on what was art doing hardy looked over evans went sideways art thinks sharron had something to do with it hes a little worked up how sideways not much hardy lied shackled next to them in his jumpsuit graham wasnt intimidated she said she believed me the scene shifted for glitsky registered how special for you he said then to the bailiff carl whats this guy still doing here carl could take a hint he was moving with his prisoner before the question was over hes on his way to adseg in front of them the crowd had thinned part of it some reporters and supporters and david freeman had followed soma and drysdale pratt enjoying the photo op had led another group off on a different walkway evans and lanier stood by themselves alone arms folded and watched as graham was led by them all politics aside abe youll be happier in the long run if you look into george russos alibi hardy said grahams brother i know who he is you know where he was when sal bought it i dont need to well dont say i didnt try but neither of the men moved away hardy had his hands in his pockets wondering if sarah was going to come over and say something glitsky his jaw working the scar white through his lips stood with his arms crossed feet planted eventually his chest heaved evans said on the stand she believed your man she said he was trustworthy how did that come up howd the judge let it in freeman the guys a wizard it was just one word drysdale objected afterwards and got sustained but who cares the jury heard it howd freeman guess about evans hardy shrugged unable to divulge what he knew instinct i suppose he was right ive got to talk to her she doesnt think graham did it thats the impression i got why not i dont know lies lies lies he wanted to tell abe but didnt dare the higher priority at the moment was protecting sarah and graham he wasnt happy about it but felt he had no choice youll have to ask her frannies saving grace was that she didnt carry a grudge in this way she was the polar opposite of her husband who could nurse a slight for decades if the stars were aligned just right beaten down or not and hardy felt utterly tromped upon it wasnt his style to slink he let himself in his front door put down his briefcase walked into the living room and stood in the middle of it after a few seconds letting out a long breath he went over to the mantel and moved the elephants around he smelled baking bread he heard the kids in the backyard several neighboring youngsters out there with them hed come directly home there wasnt any point in going by his office and checking up on tryptech talking to freeman reviewing anything he wanted to be with his family everything else was truly out of his control the weather continued warm a breath of seascented air wafted through the open front windows frannies arms were around him from behind why did you marry such a ballbreaker she asked he turned his arms around her i didnt mean to keep anything from you there was just so much going on i forgot leaning into him she was barefoot wearing cutoff jeans and a blue tanktop no bra i was tired maybe jealous of all the time you spend with sarah both of you knew something i didnt she shrugged im really sorry dismas it just hit me wrong kissing her he said hed punish her later meanwhile want to hear a fun story about tryptech maybe youll want to sit down they were in the living room again but four hours had evaporated into the childrens routines taking that essential half hour to brief frannie on michelle and tryptech and his lost fortune never mind any emotional reaction to it had cost them all of their potential down time and because they hadnt called their children in early from the backyard the games with the neighborhood kids went on until well after six late dinner brush teeth pajamas then for an added bonus vincent remembered that hed forgotten his homework he had to write a poem at least sixteen lines and it had to rhyme and his parents werent allowed to help him except that he needed his dad to approve every word but not give him any of his own daddy no help allowed eyes overflowing the glare it has to be mine you dont think i can do anything myself frannie had earlier decreed that this would be a bath night too rebecca decided to take a shower no more bath with her little brother more weeping and gnashing of teeth from vincent it wasnt fair everybody hated him rebecca got everything she wanted vincent hated everybody and was going to run away and live with the wolves or balto or somebody who cared about him finally ninethirty hardy pulled the windows down drew the blinds against the darkness a chill evening breeze had freshened the breath of autumn well that was a good time with an exhausted sigh frannie dropped onto the couch in the front room no kidding i am going to drink a glass of wine she announced perhaps two would you like to join me gin hardy said three fingers one ice cube no olive the television was all over it the war between the prosecutors cops divided among themselves sharron pratt and barbara brandt and social engineering art drysdale and david freeman with their sound bites on sarah drysdale sharron pratts wrongheaded policies have so permeated the system that good cops dont even know what the law is anymore freeman inspector evans knows the truth in her heart graham russo loved his father hardy hit the remote killing the picture god bless david the gin was nearly gone hes got his lines and he rides em like a racehorse but sarahs in big trouble isnt she that could be although in todays climate if pratts got anything to do with it she might get a medal hardy sighed its serious down there isnt it as bad as ive seen it its civil war brothers against brothers sisters against sisters everybody hates everybody ive got one last problem too fairly serious she looked over at him sympathetically not a new one he smiled wearily this ones almost ancient seven eight hours leland taylor he hasnt stopped paying you not now no hardy said but he might he told her about his morning discussion with graham that he really should tell leland he was going to be investigating the family leland would cut him off and if youre doing the math my love youll realize that hes my last regular source of income he tipped up the glass of gin the last drops i cant tell him not after today do you need george he shook his head i tell myself no but thats just what i want to hear if we found out he killed sal then grahams free and we won so of course we need him ive got to find out about him and if i even start to look im dead suddenly there was a knock on the door hardy looked at his watch tenfifteen it must be sarah he thought wrecked over her testimony today needing more counsel and comfort hardys day had begun at fivethirty after last nights late one and the tension with frannie hed actually considered asking salter for a continuance this very morning for fatigue and that was before he learned hed missed out on more than half a million dollars before the long day in the courtroom the marathon with the children it had to stop he thought he couldnt continue like this but if sarah needed him he had to be there for her she was doing so much work for him and doing it well he couldnt abandon her now and wimp out willing himself out of his chair he got up and opened the door weve got to talk it was glitsky sarah thought the car ride into town was about as free from tension as a dentists waiting room marcel was driving silent hed turned up the squawk box which he never did the dispatcher was sending squad cars to potrero hill for a domestic disturbance there was a robbery in progress at a fastfood store down by san francisco state a couple of backup units were needed at a fire site in chinatown finally sarah reached over and turned the thing down get over it she said ive always told you he didnt do it not the point her partner said were on the stand we are with the das they might fuck up our cases they might be assholes but theyre our assholes maybe yours not mine and glitsky finally woke up lanier cast her a disgusted glance quick then brought his eyes back to the road what elses he gonna do you rub his face in it makes him look like a horses ass for not pursuing it sooner even though there was no way he could have done it ill tell you he stopped biting his tongue what nothing doesnt matter nothing doesnt matter she mimicked he set his teeth maybe it does then ill tell you something sarah youre the first woman we got here in homicide and if you werent one youd be out of it so dont tell me glitskys your pal now you showed him up and hes covering his ass i didnt make it here on some kind of gender quota marcel if thats what youre saying he was silent and she raised her voice is that what youre saying im saying a man pulling that shit on the stand would be directing traffic out in the taraval i was right yeah well join the crowd pratt thinks shes right too always sarah had an arm resting on the open windowsill and stared out at the grimy tenderloin streets look marcel what if we go out now with glitskys blessing and find a killer here what if the wrong guys in jail and we put him there that bother you at all ill tell you what bothers me sarah what bothers me is youre my backup and suddenly im seeing youre not there for me thats what bothers me how am i not there one word yesterday they were at a red light and it afforded him the opportunity to turn and face her its a team game yeah one word puts you on the other side her lip quivered but she was damned if she was going to break im not on any other side ive always said graham russo didnt kill his dad ive always told you that thats me here privately thats in the family a witness stands a whole different thing what about you looking at tosca what was that all about youre telling me thats different that was on my personal time doing a favor for the ag yeah its different so we dont care about getting the right suspect yep we do all right so so we got him my name is blue i work as a model im sorry soma said your full name please blue is my full name sal russos downstairs neighbor stared at the young prosecutor as though daring him to ask her again she was dressed in a black leotard and a black sweater she was leaning forward resting her hands on the rail at the front of the witness box tapping her metallic blue inchlong fingernails in the mornings session at the hands of art drysdale marcel lanier had run through the kind of grilling that sarah had gone through yesterday hed recounted grahams lies again for the jury definitely leaving the strong impression that at least one of the investigating officers the man the guy who identified with the jury as a workingstiff cop did not find the handsome young defendant trustworthy at all hardy and freeman had let his testimony go without crossexamination but blue was going to be different blues testimony was about the struggle that had undoubtedly occurred which hardy had to keep her away from connecting to graham now ms soma had talked to blue a minimum of half a dozen times in preparation for her testimony today but apparently he was having a hard time with the concept of formally addressing a onenamed witness on the stand and this worked to hardys advantage blue was somas baby and he was making her impatient and cross with him from the outset just blue she snapped blue is my legal name i had it changed like five years ago all right blue i apologize soma gathered himself tugged at an ear cleared his throat can you tell us your address please she did and where is this apartment in relation to the deceaseds apartment sal russos apartment somas tongue was tripping him up hardy thought he must have done far better in moot court appearances during law school or he never would have gotten selected for his clerkship this was not his finest hour and hardy thought it couldnt have come at a better time right underneath it one floor below another exasperated expression from blue what the hell else did right underneath mean if not one floor below but she answered him yeah my ceiling was his floor good now on may ninth the day sal russo died were you in your apartment during the afternoon yeah i had a session modeling one session all afternoon again soma trying to make it crystal clear to the jury was stomping on her toes blue stiffly pulled herself up straight yes sir and did you hear any unusual noises from sal russos apartment yes sir can you tell the jury what they were with obvious relief blue turned in her seat and faced the panel i heard some stomping around then sal yelled out no no no like that she did a good impersonation of it herself waking up anybody whod been dozing and then there was this bumping which i guess i heard was like a chair getting knocked over hardy stood objection your honor speculation salter overruled the objection and soma nodded then continued you heard a loud thump yes and voices yes did you hear other voices besides sals again hardy stood objection speculation he knew this would be overruled but he thought it would be important to focus the jury right away on his position that there was no way blue could be sure that voices came from sals apartment salter knew what hardy was doing making unfounded objections to argue his case to the jury he didnt like it and as expected he overruled him blue got the question again and nodded yeah there was somebody else there and this other voice was it a male or female voice objection hardy might be alienating her and the judge but so be it he had to try again your honor the witness could not possibly know for a fact that these voices came from sal russos apartment much less that it was mr russos voice similarly she couldnt know for a fact if the voice belonged to a male or female salters tone was brusque mr hardy thats why we have crossexaminations you know the part where you ask questions im sorry mr soma proceed soma asked about the upstairs speakers gender again it was a man hardy was up again objection the witness couldnt possibly be sure it was a man your honor blues insistence upon her career as a model got shaky she shot back at hardy across the courtroom i know mens voices sugar this brought a little titter to the gallery quickly squelched by a look from salter who then took off his glasses and tapped them on his podium blue he said please dont talk to the attorneys out there on your own lets have counsel approach the bench he waved them forward hardy got up with freeman drysdale walked forward with them and met soma at the podium salter leaned down mr hardy ive already ruled on your repeated objections lets move along i guess im asking you to reconsider your honor blue may well have heard voices and they may just as well have come from sals apartment but she cant state that as fact freeman true to form stuck in his two cents as a matter of law judge hes right ask art hell tell you the judge glared down at him i dont need him to tell me david or you either in a murder case the specter of a verdict being overturned on appeal due to judicial error hangs like a scimitar over the neck of every trial judge salter put the ear ends of his eyeglasses into his mouth and considered carefully by repeating the objection over and over hardy had bullied him into secondguessing himself on reflection i believe mr hardy has a point im going to sustain his objection and reverse my decision on the previous objection soma threw his hands wide but your honor the judge stopped the histrionics with a pointed finger drysdale helped laying a soft hand on his partners sleeve salters first ruling had been right but having already changed his mind once he was never going to change it back hardy had stolen one salter put his glasses back on all right gentlemen thank you when the attorneys had all returned where they belonged the judge turned to the jury you will disregard blues statement that she heard voices from mr russos apartment or the gender of those voices back to you mr soma the prosecutor went back to his table for a sip of water trying to buy himself the time to think of another tack he took a deep breath threw a look at the ceiling then turned back to the witness blue he said have you ever seen the defendant before yes sir she said would you please tell us where oh lots of times he come by the apartment be out in the alley with his dad like that lately he be there all the time and did you ever talk to him couple of times say hi like that nothing really to speak of soma was about to ask another question perhaps in this same vein but drysdale had a small coughing fit and raised his hand asking the judge if they could have a couple of minutes recess which was granted when after five minutes court was called back to order soma announced that he was through with this witness shed given him nothing but she was going to give hardy quite a bit he knew why drysdale had had his coughing fit soma flustered by the reversal on salters objection ruling and floundering while he thought up another line of questioning had asked a question for which he didnt know the answer and it had opened a door for the defense the coughing fit had tried to slam that door shut but it hadnt come in time blue hardy wasnt going to go formal on this woman get hung up over nomenclature and make her mad he smiled at her during the many times you saw graham with sal did you ever see them fight no nothing like fighting what do you mean nothing like fighting well they was always laughing more you know most the time sometimes they just be sitting on the back of his truck talking mostly thats when i see em just talkin laughin sometimes in the lobby the halls like so you would say they acted as though they liked each other is that right objection conclusion soma knew he had brought this on himself by degrees his vocal register was going up his objection was sustained but hardy didnt care he smiled at the witness again blue during the time you lived below sal did you ever hear any other bumps things falling over stuff like that sure sometimes maybe he bump into some lamp something like that did you ever go to his apartment she showed her teeth not on business another ripple of laughter couple of times he told me he had some good salmon i could come and get it i love that salmon me too hardy said and during those times you went to his apartment did you notice if sal was a good housekeeper if the place was clean and uncluttered lord no she said there was magazines and boxes and stuff everywhere any of which he might have tripped over as he was walking around isnt that true soma objected again got sustained again but hardy felt he was making his point to the jury and pressed on all right blue now id like you to try to remember the day sal died and you heard this noise upstairs like something falling do you remember that i said i did thats right you did then you told inspector lanier that sometime later you heard the door upstairs closing isnt that right thats right now to the best of your recollection how much time passed between this bump you heard and the door closing hardy wanted to establish a temporal distance between the two events the longer the lag between the bump and the door closing the less likely there was any causal relation between the two therefore a struggle became a less likely scenario blue sat back in the witness stand pulling her hands off the rail methodically she began cracking her knuckles one at time her eyes were far away i hear the bump i hear him kind of moaning no no no pretty good amount of time i spect hardy pounced on this while you were hearing these noises upstairs you were having a modeling session is that what youre saying thats right thats why i dont go up there see whats the matter when i hear this bump and him saying no all right blue now this pretty good amount of time youve just referred to could it have been more than a half hour could have been she paused obviously nervous that shed get caught in a lie so she decided to come clean i fell a little asleep she leaned forward now looked at the judge down into her lap hardy played the card hed picked up from sarah it had not been on any of the transcripts but lanier had mentioned to sarah his feeling about the smell emanating from blues place blue did you smoke marijuana this day is that why you fell asleep cornered blues eyes were all over the room it wasnt that long she said ambiguously you mean that you were asleep and afterwards after he was gone i went up but nobody answered you didnt try the door no do you clearly remember that the sound of the door closing was after you woke up from your doze yes and was the scraping or bumping before yes sir it was so it might have been as long as an hour between the scraping and bumping and the entirely separate sound of the door closing is that right another objection this one overruled in salters view this last point wasnt speculation blue could make a reasonable estimate of how long shed been asleep she told hardy he was right the sounds werent really all that close together thank you blue thats all my questions soma got up on redirect and tried to repair some of the damage blue ive got here a transcript of your interview with inspector lanier it says and i quote i hear the door open then the ceiling creaks somebody else there thats right good now continuing with the transcript you told inspector lanier well maybe you can read what it says here would you do that blue took the paper and read the highlighted text and then some other noises soma patiently nodded leading her through it in other words blue arent you saying here that the noises occurred after this someone arrived upstairs her face took on a pained expression no i dont mean that but didnt you say then some other noises blue was shaking her head but i dont mean then like meaning after i mean then like next thing i thought this was bad news for the young attorney who hadnt given much thought to the womans syntax shed said then which to him meant after in this context thats all the word meant to him to someone with a little less education than soma however the word could be almost endlessly fluid as hardy had discovered when hed talked to blue preparing for his cross but soma couldnt leave it it struck him as unfair he had the right meaning and he was somehow wrong he turned to the jury including them his voice getting that familiar stridency but then means after blue isnt that the meaning of the word hardy could have objected that he was badgering the witness but soma was shooting himself in the foot anyway and hardy thought hed let him do it blue pulled herself up sometime it might but thats just not what i meant during one of the afternoon recesses a uniformed police officer stuck a note in front of hardy glitsky wanted to know where he could meet hardy in moderate privacy after he got off today hardy thought a moment then scribbled his reply and sent the officer on his way glitsky had saved hardys bacon by authorizing sarah to look into george and debras possible connection to sals murder hed relieved hardy of any obligation to tell leland that his money was being used to investigate his own family it was a police matter now hardy and glitsky hadnt said a lot of words the previous night about their ongoing feud it was behind them leaving its slightly bitter residue instead they mostly talked about the lieutenants long interview with sarah evans which had led him to reconsider his earlier decision to drop the investigation the rest of hardys afternoon was taken up by four witnesses various other residents of sals building people whod seen graham in the vicinity hardy asked each of them the same questions had they ever witnessed anything like a fight between sal and graham did they see or hear a struggle of any kind in or around sals apartment on may they all said no to everything the breeze was stiff out of the west bending the cypresses in the park as the lieutenant headed west along lincoln a fitful sunlight struggled through the intermittent cloud cover and when it could cast long shadows traffic was heavy until he turned on masonic winding his way back up to edgewood he parked and got out of his car there was no sign of any wind up here though in the sky some angels had raked the cirrus into neat rows he crossed the street and walked up to the address hardy had given him hardy was leaning against his car his arms crossed over his chest you said private i thought youd like it here the lieutenant threw another look all around what is this place graham russo lives here glitsky nodded i wish i did then evans and i had another talk today we didnt do this right i know that you know about tosca and this guy ising grahams mentioned them both you didnt hire an investigator find out what theyve been up to hardy told a fib of omission moneys tight abe im barely breaking even he shrugged i cant worry about who did it its my job to get my client off what i hear you might be doing that again a shrug it could happen though we got a bad jury for it so what are we doing up here me and you this time of day theres lots of eyes at the hall glitsky looked around the quiet street as though checking for spies he took his time answering i wanted to let you know were going to keep looking evans wants to go and question the brother and sister directly but that gets squirrely wed have to give them a reason and then what ive had the same problem and these possible money angles glitsky shook his head contrary to popular belief i dont want to ace the wrong guy times running out abe it might be too late already i know glitsky said but for the record there was only a slim chance it would do much good in the time he had left still it was a grand gesture for a professional cop and administrator for the record hardy said i appreciate it frannie was asleep by nine hardy tossed until eleven then got up and turned on the news after yesterdays humaninterest bombshell with sarah and the fallout from her testimony the trial was back to hot copy hardy learned that evidently hed done well with blue today the newscaster reported that one of the prosecutions major witnesses had failed to establish that any struggle had taken place in the apartment between sal russo and his son but tomorrow is alison li the bank teller who hardy hit the remote and decided to give sleep another try this wasnt possible hardy was telling himself could it be that his own stupidity was going to cost him the case it looked that way right now the four attorneys were in salters chambers talking about the admissibility of the videotapes freeman might believe that the defense didnt need them that the entire moneybank issue was beside the point but to hardy they were the equivalent of a smoking gun for the defense if the videotapes were admitted after soma had gone to great lengths to prove that graham had for whatever reason come to the bank on friday hardy had proof that he hadnt it would devastate the prosecutions argument but now it was looking as though it wasnt going to happen drysdale and soma hadnt questioned the tapes admissibility in any of the pretrial hearings but now with alison li coming up next theyd requested this hearing in chambers charging that hardy couldnt lay any foundation for the tape what it was where it came from how it was relevant it should be ruled inadmissible judge hardy was on his feet in front of salters desk i got this tape months ago it was in my discovery that i shared with the prosecution mr soma and mr drysdale have had every opportunity to review it it clearly shows that my client didnt go into the bank on friday which is one of the cornerstones of their case if hardy wasnt so hot himself he might have been concerned by his partner david freemans posture the old man was in a corner of the room seated arms crossed keeping out of it a bad sign in itself drysdale too had recovered from his explosion of the other afternoon he was lowaffect here and he did most of the talking soma stood next to him barely concealing his smugness drysale was talking we have no problem with the original tape judge our problem is with mr hardys copy all right so lets use the original hardy said giving up a point far too quickly the greatest enemy in any trial was surprise and hardy had just opened himself up for another one we were told the originals been erased soma couldnt keep the note of triumph out of his voice hardy had no idea how long soma had known this or for how long hed been planning his ambush but he was obviously enjoying the hell out of it now hardy turned to him it has not been erased but even as he said it he knew it had to be true soma wouldnt have any reason to bluff i asked the bank to save it he had figured he had the copy hed even copied the copy to give to soma and drysdale the efficient and personable ms reygosa the manager had assured hardy that the bank would keep the original as backup with his infuriating calm drysdale was back at salter naturally we wanted to review the original for accuracy after wed seen mr hardys copy your honor evidently the bank misinterpreted mr hardys request and thought that once the tape had been copied they would be free to reuse it hardy pressed his fingers against his temples this could not be happening it was completely his incompetence he couldnt believe it and there was no one to blame but himself your honor i have the copy and it has remained unedited and in my possession soma cut him off shaking his head in disagreement the copy could have come from blockbuster your honor theres no date or time on it it could be anything ill get ms reygosa to testify it is a complete and accurate copy of the original thats been erased your honor thats sufficient foundation alas mr hardy somas dramatic reading made hardy want to punch him ms reygosa didnt make the copy the copy was made by one juan xavier gonzalez who has returned to his native honduras after somebody took a hard look at his immigration status you son of a look diz this was drysdale serious now cutting hardy off before he talked himself into a contempt fine technical inadmissibility aside your tapes are supposed to cover three working days right twentyfour hours we all know this hardy said except theyre only a little over twentytwo and a half hours long theres an hour and a half missing hardy well remembered his day of fastforwarding the videos to the good parts evidently soma hadnt let his own boredom make him sloppy drysdale went on this guy gonzalez not only erased the originals he couldnt have given you full copies he turned to salter theres no foundation judge and more to the point these tapes dont prove a thing drysdale didnt have the gloating tone but the words alone were enough unnoticed by hardy freeman had pulled himself out of his chair hardy felt a hand on his shoulder reassuring salter had heard enough the tapes were inadmissible gil soma started on each witness with an enthusiasm that hardy found daunting especially so after the defeat hed just suffered in chambers no videotapes after all of his effort to procure them what a fool he was now on thursday afternoon soma was approaching the end of his case in chief from his selfconfident demeanor it was clear that he barely if at all felt any of the wounds that hardy had inflicted alison li started out as nervous as shed been at the bank on the day hardy had first interviewed her soma was gentle with her leading her through the standard witness questions name place of business and so on gradually getting to the meat ms li do you recognize the defendant here pointing graham russo yes i do hes a customer at the bank where i work pleased out of all proportion soma slowly walked back to his table and picked up a piece of paper and entered it into evidence now ms li id like you to look at peoples fourteen here and tell us if you recognize this document she took the paper and scanned it quickly yes this is a signin form for customers holding safedeposit boxes and did you see graham russo the defendant sign this document yes i did now soma put his enthusiasm to good use ms li arent customers supposed to sign in and date this form yes but as we see here mr russo didnt do that did he no did you ask him to do it yes and yet he didnt hardy wanted to break up the rhythm so he stood up asked and answered your honor perhaps salter was sympathetic to hardys despair this wasnt much of an objection still the judge nodded true enough sustained move along mr soma but soma had a knack for the small and telling variation did the defendant give a reason why he wouldnt put the date on this form no i didnt notice he said he would and i thought he did but he didnt and so it went by the time hardy stood to begin his crossexamination alison li had drawn the picture clearly graham russo had come in sometime that friday afternoon and deposited something in his safe deposit box he appeared nervous he was in a hurry they thought theyd have the videotapes to fall back upon and without them hardy was forced to bring david freemans argument into play the defense team had prepared extensively for it and hardy was possessed of a near ethereal desperate calm as he walked to the center of the courtroom he brought a smile forth and showed it to the witness ms li you have testified that graham russo brought a briefcase with him on the afternoon in question at any time did you see the contents of the briefcase alisons nerves were back in play she shifted in her chair looked at the jury then at soma finally back to hardy i never said i did i didnt say you did either hardy kept any threat out of his voice they were having a conversation that was all but i am asking you now did you see what was in the briefcase no not at any time no never so you dont know what was in the briefcase or in fact if anything was in the briefcase isnt that true hardy took the moment to get a read on the jury obvious as this question was it did what freeman had predicted poked a hole into one of the prosecutions main assumptions its scenario of the day of sals death he saw several members of the jury sit up digesting this alison li nodded her head and told him that yes it was true she didnt know what was in the briefcase hardy was making the point that graham had not necessarily taken the money and baseball cards from sals apartment and essentially hidden them in his safe deposit box there was no proof that graham had deposited the money or anything else within months of sals death in fact hardy believed grahams version completely he had had the money and the baseball cards in the briefcase and hed put them into his safe deposit box on thursday but the truth here did not serve the ends of justice hardy was beginning to wonder if it ever would in this case so he jettisoned the truth without a backward glance hardy continued he was going to nail this down did you personally ms li ever get a chance to see the contents of graham russos safe deposit box no customers generally go into a private room so to your own personal knowledge do you know how long the baseball cards and money were in mr russos box this slowed her to a stop her mouth opened and closed a couple of times and she looked at the jury as though asking for help i dont know could it have been weeks yes possibly months i dont think so hardy had gotten what he wanted to the jury hed gotten to reasonable doubt about whether graham had killed sal and then taken the money and run it to the bank to hide it his own confidence was beginning to come back and he still had another point to make do you remember talking to me at your bank last may sometime at this line of questioning alisons eyes took on a defiant glow of course and during our discussion didnt you tell me you thought that graham russo had come in to make his deposit on thursday no i said i wasnt sure i thought it might be thursday or friday hardy tried again this was either an outright lie or a faulty memory you dont remember telling me it was thursday no he took a breath pausing all right ms li so you say it was friday that graham came in is that right yes it was friday evidently shed spent enough time repeating it to the police that shed come to believe it do you remember that clearly yes all right then ms li since you remember it so clearly perhaps you can remember what time it was on friday can you tell us that she thought a couple of seconds it was the afternoon the late afternoon early afternoon when he didnt much like to do it but she was defensive and still defiant and he could play that against her she was starting to snap her answers out at him later after three after four it seemed like it was near the end of the day thats because it was hardy thought but it was thursday not friday he had her the jury would know that graham had been working on friday afternoon youre sure it was near the end of the day i just said that yes im sure after three definitely at least after four it seemed like it maybe yes on friday was it she almost screamed in her anger yes on friday thats what i said didnt i hardy smiled at her now a genuine smile yes you did ms li friday late in the afternoon after four thank you no further questions salter nodded pointed to the prosecution table whose inhabitants looked a little glum asked for redirect soma stood up no redirect for this witness he leaned over and conferred a moment with drysdale the prosecution rests your honor hardy had shown them his adrenaline had kicked in after losing his videotapes and hed turned it on them he dared half a grin at soma flashing on a sign hed seen affixed to a motorcycle outside a bar someplace this harley belongs to a hells angel fuck with it and find out that was pretty sweet graham was saying they had adjourned for the day and had gathered in the holding cell friday i was at work after three i can prove it you got her i think i did hardy agreed not that it matters freeman grunted he had boosted himself up onto the table and was swinging his feet yoda unhappy graham said yoda sad im not unhappy it was a good show but im saying it doesnt matter if i were soma no i dont want to be soma if i were drysdale i would simply amend my story its not too late if the jurys leaning toward him anyway to what hardy asked oh i dont know pick one hows this graham has the combination to the safe and thinking sal never even looks in it anymore he waits till his dads out of the room and takes the money it doesnt matter when and puts it in his own box at the bank so on may ninth sal happens to check the safe and sees its gone thats why he makes the two calls to graham that morning thats why graham rushes over thats why he has to kill him hardy had had little enough to celebrate this week he didnt need to get his parade rained upon right now theres no proof of any of that freeman twinkled exactly right my point theres no proof of anything there is no physical evidence somas just drawing you both into a pissing contest dont go there you dont need it graham let out a deep sigh i just enjoyed watching mr hardy here kicking a little butt dont get me wrong nobody likes fireworks as much as i do graham but thats not what its about its about evidence keep focused on that diz youve got to write your eleven eighteen get it to salter tonight argue it tomorrow morning freeman was referring to a motion routinely made by defense counsel after the prosecution has rested under section of the california penal code it is nearly always rejected by the trial judge the motion called a directed verdict of acquittal asks the judge to dismiss all charges against the defendant on the grounds that the prosecution has failed to provide probative evidence sufficient to justify a guilty verdict hardy had considered it of course but it seemed a waste of time in this case he turned to his old partner its not worth it david salters going to turn me down anyway he couldnt direct a verdict not with all the big guns out freeman nodded he sure could i dont think he will either but stranger things have happened when graham asked joking freeman slid off the table we cant get complacent to quote the great yogi berra its not over till its over and sometimes not even then that wasnt berra who said that was it graham asked the first part i think wasnt it berra hardy picked up his briefcase you titans work on that one im going to write the damn motion it was after five oclock on a thursday night and he came up through the main office past the reception desk where phyllis answering telephones ignored him he looked in at the solarium hoping to see someone but all of the associates were in their cubicles working or maybe avoiding him theyd have heard about michelles coup or his idiocy and in his mind they pitied him or had decided he was a terminal loser either way no one stepped out and greeted him and he trudged up the stairway to his office carrying the briefcase that from the feel of it was where he kept his barbells dust had settled heavily over every smooth surface the window hadnt been opened in a week he turned on the desk light a greenshaded relic from the days when what was now rebeccas room had been his office at home then turned around and threw up the sash from sutler street wafted the smells of diesel and coffee and more subtly patchouli and crab the city the letter from michelle was centered in the middle of his desk sitting in his chair he opened the envelope and gave it a onceover no new news he got halfway through his second pass on it before balling and throwing it toward the wastebasket it missed running his palm over the wide expanse of his desk he cleared away a path of dust then put his feet up he had no idea how much time went by he wasnt thinking in the sense of having discrete thoughts nor was he relaxing not precisely he was on charge listening or feeling for something that he wasnt sure maybe just letting the mass of facts settle the stratagems issues distractions something the weight of all of it had simply stopped him was he missing something of course you always did he couldnt see the killer of sal russo and someday he would need that this he knew on a level beyond reason he was kidding himself if he denied it he would need the closure even if it didnt help grahams verdict and in spite of the mass of detail he had internalized he knew he needed more facts and worse some sense told him he already had access to what he needed to know he just didnt recognize it so he shut down the cogs locked he wouldnt be able to move until one of them shifted slightly it had gotten measurably darker and he hadnt noticed he spun his chair so he could see out the window above the street through the canyons of the buildings the sky burned a dark turquoise the line of traffic below had disappeared his green bankers lamp threw a pool of light onto his desk the only light in the room he stood and walked around to the dartboard pulled the three darts and began throwing in the semidarkness sarah always prided herself on being far too tough to cry but the past two days since shed told the world she believed in graham shed felt like it often enough it wasnt just her partner shed worked hard for some grudging acceptance among the men in the detail and thought shed made inroads now all of that had vanished after the yes heard round the city as jeff elliot had called it in citytalk sarah got called into glitskys office he appeared to listen to everything she had to say though it ran counter to the company line she told him shed come to the conclusion that while sal had been murdered it hadnt been his son whod done it she admitted that she had talked to him personally the softball connection the time magazine moment in his apartment and thought she had some sense of who he was all of grahams lies she explained misguided as they might have been were reducible to one impulse and then as lies will theyd had to multiply to cover each other he hadnt killed sal somebody else had glitsky had sat back slumped elbows resting on the arms of his chair he spoke so quietly she could barely hear him if this turns personal sergeant or is personal and anybody finds out you realize you screw your partner me the whole department you know that sarah had felt sick glitsky knew she was dead meat but he didnt go that way instead he drew a deep breath and sat himself up okay you want to find your killer if she did hed turn her loose on it glitsky had approved hours for sarah on the russo case though they would be billed to administration now at least she was getting paid for what shed been doing anyway but her lieutenant had severely restricted her movements glitsky wasnt about to get his rear end put in a wringer by dean powells troops if word got out that now with the trial almost concluded the police were checking witnesses maybe looking for another suspect she started with george russo when shed first revealed herself to hardy and begun helping him shed gone to georges bush street victorian half a dozen times on random nights george shed concluded had no life it might be that he was genetically wired for rage at his natural father he could have rushed out at lunch one day and killed sal over the imagined slight to the honor or peace of mind of his mother that sarah thought was in the realm of the possible but whatever else might be going on george kept his nose clean he was the heir apparent to a banking empire and his role transcribed his life he did not party with anyone outside of his ordered little universe stalking him she was convinced was a waste of time and shed stopped but tonight with nothing else substantive to pursue she was going to try again marcel had been only too happy to dump her off early at the hall and shed taken her own car up to baywest bank on market street and waited as always george was a dream to tail he was big and dressed handsomely in spite of the relative warmth of these september evenings he sported what she thought was an enormously affected homburg over a cashmere overcoat at a little after six he had left the bank on foot hands in pockets hed strolled purposefully a few blocks never slowing or looking behind him through the tenderloin district pimps and whores and derelicts she wondered about the route this wasnt georges turf by any stretch but the question resolved itself when he turned into a small expensive french restaurant on polk where he sat in the window and ate his dinner alone there was nothing for her to do but wait for him to come out and see what he did next now it was almost eightthirty and she was sitting in her car alone and suddenly the tears threatened exhaustion was killing her she hadnt been alone with graham in over three months she hadnt had time for any exercise shed almost forgotten the physical connection between her and graham had it been as real as it felt or would all this have been for nothing would their love still exist when he got out if he got out this was the specter that haunted that she tried to ignore graham might not get out not ever hardy and freeman and admit it she herself might fail him graham had a very real opportunity to spend the rest of his life in jail and then what of her how could she continue to be a cop knowing that the system she was sworn to uphold had ruined her life glitsky hadnt told her anything she didnt already know she was way over the line and if she couldnt be a cop what would she become she was saved from further introspection when george exited the restaurant and walked by his earlier route to baywest where he retrieved his car in the parking lot sarah was ready to follow him back to his home when he turned right off market surprising her back into the lower tenderloin by now it was full dusk the few streetlights that still worked in this part of town had come on george drove slowly up eddy to polk hung a right then another one and started back uptown he turned right again and again going in a circle suddenly her pulse beginning to race sarah knew what george was doing he was cruising reaching for her handheld she put in a call to her dispatcher i need an adam unit a blackandwhite patrol car asap for backup at when george pulled over and the woman got into his car she was ready she waited until he had pulled into an alley then told her adam to roll she was right behind the squad car and so had a birdseye view as the two uniformed officers came up to georges car and knocked on the windows one on either side shining their flashlights down illuminating what was going on inside finally a wedge the two uniformed officers took the prostitute over to the blackandwhite car fifty feet up the street sarah kept george back by his car it was doubtful he would have recognized her in any event but clearly now in darkness and in terror he didnt know who she was except trouble hed taken off his coat for the business and now he was visibly freezing in the wind she thought it was good for him sarah had his wallet in her hands was ostensibly checking over his id george russo do you know its illegal to traffic in prostitution he decided to try a ridiculous bluff i dont stopping shes a friend of mine sarah smiled at him and yelled up the street hey guys this john says he and the girl are friends ask her if she knows his name she turned back to him im betting not george you know her name george had the eyes of a spooked horse he glanced out behind sarah as though searching for something salvation maybe sarah gazed levelly at him linda julie what from the other car one of the officers called down she says he can go to hell she doesnt know him look at that sarah said i won my bet all right so what now i pay some fine what sarah could waste a lot of time putting him through hoops but she knew exactly what she wanted and the best way to get it she told him a lie you know weve got a new program to cut down on this vice traffic george its really getting out of hand and you johns tend to just walk away so you know what were doing now were putting names and pictures in the paper you dont do that she nodded we do now its a new program didnt i say that i cant have that you dont get to choose she hardened up her voice put her hand on her gun all right come on along with me where are we going to my car im parked right behind my friends there then we all go downtown where do you think are you saying im under arrest again she gave him nothing and he stammered into the breach look i cant let this happen to me i cannot get arrested for prostitution i dont care what that girl says shes a friend of mine ive got to call my lawyer if youre going to call your lawyer you can do it just as well from the hall of justice he lowered his voice look what if i mean cant we take care of this here maybe we can she cut him off dont make it worse george attempting to bribe a police officer is a crime too maybe you didnt know that lets pretend that for now huh now lets go he was cracking no look please she raised her voice again hey one of the officers stopped what he was doing and began trotting down to her everything all right inspector she held up a hand keeping the officer out of earshot distance one minute thanks stay close she looked back to george turn around she said put your hands behind your back the officers wanted to put him in the blackandwhite where there was a screen and no handles on the back doors but sarah was a homicide inspector the top of the hierarchy and they knew it from the call number the dispatcher had given them h she told the uniforms they could drive the hooker around the corner and let her go the john was a witness in a homicide investigation and she was going to squeeze him now in her car he was in the backseat handcuffed shivering with fear or cold or both she got into the front seat and spun around id like to make you a trade a born trader himself george narrowed his eyes at the unexpected gambit sarah didnt let him get an answer out my real interest is your brother graham whats graham got to do with this this is going to make you tell me where you were when your father got killed fuck you why should i sarah looked flatly at him for a minute then turned around and started the car wait a minute wait a minute we can talk downtown no no i was just being an asshole yeah yeah im sorry what do you want to know about graham she turned the cars engine off i dont want to know anything about graham i want to know about you graham didnt kill your father my father isnt dead george said i work with him every day sal she clipped it dont get even slightly cute with me one more time or this discussions over understand george didnt give much away but he did nod okay graham didnt kill sal so what okay so somebody else did im eliminating suspects he leaned back the haunted look in his eyes giving way to something else shrewdness a deal in the making you cant think i had anything to do with that i didnt even know where sal lived thats what youve said but i dont know its true you wouldnt tell grahams attorney or anybody else where you were that afternoon why should i its nobodys business you cops never asked well its my business im asking now you can tell me where you were and ill go away and thatll be the end of tonights little adventure or not and i can write you up fill out an incident report you get to see your name in the newspaper she leaned forward look all i want to know is where you were you dont tell me im going to become a lot more interested in you as a murder suspect every minute of your last year is going to get a profile i dont on the other hand you tell me where you were and if its got nothing to do with your father then this moment tonight your girlfriend everything it all stops here you dont write it up or whatever it is you do i wont do anything my father especially he cant know this phraseology slowed her momentarily until she realized george was talking about leland not sal he wont infuriatingly as she was closing in he skittered away again how do i know i can believe you she smiled well the truth is george you cant either way youre no worse off than you are right now her voice became conversational she knew the battle was hers if she kept it cool there was no need for the heavy artillery enough hits with the light gauge would accomplish the same thing look george its simple youve got nothing to lose just tell me he closed his eyes and swallowed then mumbled it out mitchell brothers what he repeated it the mitchell brothers had been san franciscos kings of pornography for years until one of them had shot and killed the other one which threw a damper on their partnership still the original mitchell brothers theater five or six blocks from baywest bank continued to thrive under the original name in terms of sexual provender it went a good deal farther than the titillating nudity of the north beach tourist shops featuring hardcore live sex shows private booths oneonones and kinkiness of every imaginable kind it was as raunchy a place as san francisco could provide its my rotten luck george was slumped now going on the one day i do anything the one hour thats when sal dies and everybody wants to know where i am where i was and if leland finds out where i was he shook his head hed cut me out too like sal did then it would really be over what would my life he said my career everything hes raised me to do she had to ask so why did you risk it whyd you have this girl tonight why dont you get yourself a girlfriend this was torture theres no leland wouldnt like any of them approve he shook his head i cant make any mistakes she tried to understand george blamed himself for being abandoned if he had been better or more lovable or something it might not have had to happen he might never understand the way it had formed him but now he was an adult with an adults needs and desires and stunted by the fear of rejection he was afraid to pursue them legitimately it saddened her so she spoke gentry im afraid youre on the wrong planet for no mistakes george everybody makes them here on earth theyre allowed not to me you dont know but the defenses were coming back up he straightened in the seat his eyes narrowed again seemed to focus more sharply the slackness went out of his face so anyway thats where i was he said is that what you wanted do we have a deal yes you wont tell my father thats right but sooner or later you know something else like this is going to happen hes going to find out no he said its going to stop just what he needs she thought as though he werent already one of the most repressed young men shed ever met but she wasnt his counselor shed tried even against her instincts cared for a moment someday hed change or he would implode or he might stay the same and live a miserable pinched life of money and toys either way sarah wasnt going to have anything to do with it she didnt know how she could check it out but for the moment george had given her a believable alibi and this solved one of her immediate problems but it hadnt solved grahams hardy smelled bacon and felt the soft touch of his wifes lips against his cheek i turned off the alarm and gave you an extra half hour youre my savior i know come eat and get dressed after it was five fortyfive he stepped into a pair of jeans and threw a jersey over his head out their bedroom window he could discern the outline of the oakland hills so the sun must have been somewhere behind them but it hadnt marched into the sky yet his coffee was poured in an oversized mug eggs were scrambled and steaming on his plate with six fat strips of bacon english muffins and marmalade he loved marmalade and for some reason never thought to eat it he sat down did i already mention the savior thing she smiled what time did you get in twelvethirty one something like that i finished the motion salter might she stopped him putting her hand over his later trial later she pointed breakfast now eat he closed his eyes and nodded smiling she was so right good plan he said everybody needs one at seventhirty am the sturdy jogging figure appeared in his running clothes at the end of the alley hardy waiting at the automatic gate to the parking lot behind the federal courthouse was dressed for court in a dark suit and blue tie with a good sweat worked up giotti didnt stop until he was almost upon him he didnt expect any interruptions on his morning run through the downtown alleys certainly not from a lawyer on business morning judge giotti was breathing heavily but managed a halfsmile of welcome he took a moment recognition not quite there mr hardy youre up early to hardy it felt like high noon ive got to deliver a motion at the hall before eight i wanted to catch you first i remember you said you jogged most mornings not enough he indicated the gate behind them which had somehow swung open a guard watching for the judge a remote switch in his pocket you want to go inside no heres fine ive only got a minute okay how can i help you do you know if sal knew anybody named singleterry joan singleterry this was the cog that had slipped for hardy last night he and graham had spent hours in the past months surmising about sals early life the mysterious singleterry woman and had come up with nothing but suddenly in his openvessel state at his office hardy remembered that giotti had actually known sal russo during those early days had fished and worked with him played ball and partied with him hardy was starting to have a feeling that joan singleterry might have a bigger role here than hed understood and giotti could be the key to her identity did he imagine it the judges clear gaze seemed to flicker for an instant but then he was back as hed been still catching some breath thinking about it dashing hardys hopes i dont think so she wasnt an old girlfriend before helen maybe giotti pondered some more shook his head no im sorry is it important whats this about keeping it vague hardy said it was just a name in discovery that led nowhere he was starting his defense today and needed everything he could lay his hands on if this singleterry woman was a source of the money something like that it might lead to another suspect he must have betrayed a little of his disappointment the judge gave him a manly pat on the shoulder i dont know if youre going to need any suspects ive been following the trial pretty closely it seems to me its going pretty well itd go better if i could produce a killer giotti appreciated the sentiment well that sure but you kept the struggle out pretty good i thought i meant to thank you for that the idea the judge shrugged i just told the truth there was no physical proof of any struggle since i know your strategy ive got an inside track but i get the feeling soma and drysdale dont have a clue what youre up to hardy allowed himself a small smile well wouldnt it be pretty to think so giotti broke a true grin hemingway allusions yet youre a wellrounded human being for an attorney mr hardy when this is all over if you dont appeal again the reminder we ought to have a drink sometime you could probably twist my arm the judge nodded i might do that a kind of wistful look came over him i just remembered how i miss sal isnt that funny how is that perhaps he shouldnt say his mouth tightened his body language briefly saying no never mind but then that pose broke and he smiled sheepishly do you have a lot of good friends mr hardy hardy shrugged a few im lucky with that i suppose i used to be too thats what they dont tell you about this job whats that well to get it and dont get me wrong its all ive ever wanted but to get it youve got to how can i put it develop friendships you make real friends when youre on the rise some would say on the make you give parties go to them hobnob you impress people with your brains your legal knowledge and learned opinions and quick wit its heady id imagine it would be though hardy had no idea where giotti was going with this or why he was divulging these intimacies to him then you get appointed giottis expression said a lot about disappointment the alternate roads not taken it all ends youre cut off some of the more cerebral judges they do fine others miss the friendships but friendships arent on the docket too much opportunity for conflict of interest see and these are the very people who put you here suddenly you cant fraternize anymore certainly not the same way you wind up pretty much alone hardy suddenly understood except sal the last one of my old friends i could go up and just he instinctively looked around for other people other ears and just bullshit with him i think it must have been you digging up that hemingway just now that was sal he knew a lot he was funny i could be who i was around him hardy motioned behind him toward the federal courthouse you brethren dont play a lot of practical jokes on each other in there huh the judges voice rasped its a serious life mr hardy dont let em tell you different giotti gave himself a last beat of reflection then put it behind him he was too busy for any more of this so someday maybe you and i well go have a drink somewhere ill call you dismas hows that sound ill still call you your honor giotti laughed out loud thats what i mean he said thats just what i mean hardy handed his directedverdict motion over to salter in his chambers and sat in exquisite suspense while the judge read over the five pages this was a murder case discussion of hardys motion would be on the record so over by the judges window soma drysdale and freeman quietly kept up the flow in the mighty stream of law gossip theyd all previously read hardys motion out in the hall and made informal small talk about it before the judge had them come into his chambers the court reporter sat in the chair next to hardy ready to catch any precious pearl should one fall hardy thought he had done a more than competent job on his motion clearly laying out each factual allegation made by the prosecution and then demonstrating in turn how they had failed to prove any of them they hadnt placed graham at the apartment they couldnt prove a struggle they couldnt even get the coroner to state unequivocally that it had been a homicide there was no temporal connection or relevance to the money or the baseball cards alison lis testimony was meaningless the prosecution had nothing by contrast judge salter had a lot he had a multiphotoop hotpotato case of the very first order handdelivered to his courtroom by his good friend and political crony dean powell he had an indictment by the grand jury that had brought things to this pass he was privy to the backstage maneuverings of the attorneys the motions here in his chambers the lies of the defendant he also had social relations with federal judge harold draper grahams old boss not quite enough to compel him to recuse himself from the case for conflict although hardy would make that argument should it come to an appeal none of these were matters of law all of them taken together mattered more than the law hardy had no doubt that one day salter would leave the bench to pursue a political career he had the bland good looks the social connections the inoffensive public personality he was unfailingly polite even friendly in an impersonal way now he had finished reading hardys motion and he took off his glasses squared the pages on his desk and laid them there the frown that meant im in deep thought gave way to the smile that said were friends here gentlemen he motioned the other attorneys over then gave his attention to hardy this is one hell of a wellwritten motion diz i mean it you make a very colorable argument colorable hardy thought uhoh he exchanged a look with freeman who shrugged it was expected and it was over but salter was observing the niceties do you want to add any oral argument theyve failed to prove anything judge certainly not robbery which is why weve got the specials theres no causal relation between the money and the death theres no paper showing when graham got the money or the cards the boy was taking care of his dad he loved him out of the corner of his eyes hardy could see that soma was moved to comment but drysdale laid a hand on his sleeve cutting him off before he began salter let a small silence build it wouldnt do to reject such a wellwritten colorable motion out of hand an important ruling such as this one although almost foreordained by its very nature demanded at least some minutes of cogitation la politesse i dont know though salter finally admitted im still very concerned about all the lies i think ive covered them judge he panicked and then had to backfill but why did he panic if he had done nothing homicide coming to his door he freaked it happens all the time this was all pablum totally irrelevant and everybody knew it salter was going to turn him down because hardy didnt have enough to compel him not to he didnt have the murderer he didnt have strout saying it was definitely a suicide anything less wouldnt get it done salter paused again then drew in a lungful of air and let it out another smile among friends i think were going to have to let the jury decide diz im going to deny the motion i want you to visualize something freeman said they were waiting for salter to enter the courtroom graham sat between them at their defense table behind them the gallery was its usual din before court was called to order although the noise was so familiar by now that no one noticed it no i mean it close your eyes if i close my eyes i will be asleep when the judge comes in i guarantee it ive done experiments graham looked back and forth between them settled on hardy better what yoda says do otherwise he use force you die part of hardy was relieved by grahams tendency to keep things light he rolled his eyes then closed them see what did i tell you im asleep youre talking graham said in my sleep happens all the time diz he heard freemans voice youre on a diving board a high one youre going to try a one and a half forward flip you with me im there hardy said freeman kept on think the dive through commit to it youre going all the way around and then halfway around again a long time in the air all right ready think it hardy forced the image all right now jump tuck hard spin you feel it dont pull out dont pull out hardy rolled with the dive it was a long way around but he held his tuck entered the water cleanly opened his eyes okay you get around no splash hardy said cut it like a knife graham looked from one to the other again you guys are crazy he said but freeman had a valid point this morning hardy would open the caseinchief for the defense he would be calling his defense witnesses and this was where their strategy could not waver it would seem that they were hanging in the air spinning for a good deal of the time they werent going to try to get the judge to instruct on lesser included offenses the jury would have no option to convict graham of manslaughter as a compromise graham wouldnt take the stand to appear sympathetic and likable there was going to be no chance for a couple of years in prison and a life resumed it was to be murder or nothing life or freedom this was the agonizing crux of it as it stood now some members of the jury might still believe that graham had had no part in his fathers death after hardy presented his caseinchief however no one would doubt graham had done it an it that the law defined as murder the deliberate taking of a human life what the defense needed to do was to polarize the jury to convince them that if they did not believe graham had killed his father for money then they should acquit rather than convict on a lesser offense the prosecution had emphasized the financial motive for the killing to bolster their charges of a firstdegree murder conviction hardys gambit was going to make the game winner take all first or nothing this course was fraught with tremendous risk although they all agreed that it was their best chance for acquittal but it would destroy the defense if hardy forgot even for a moment and began to pull out of the spin before he reached the end he could not allow himself the luxury of bringing up his possible other dudes he had one and only one story and he had to commit to it now before he began or they would lose dr russ cutler was the young man hardy had met and questioned for the first time at the little shamrock back then hed been unshaven and exhausted draped in his medical scrubs and his guilt over not having come forward about prescribing the morphine now he had finished his residency and gone into private practice he had also spent a good deal of time rehearsing his proposed testimony with freeman and hardy in a tan linen suit and maroon tie well rested and confident he took the stand and swore to tell the whole truth and nothing but dr cutler would you please tell the court your relationship to graham we play softball together on the same team i consider myself his friend i was his fathers doctor at these last words the white noise in the courtroom went away hardys voice cut into the silence now doctor as sal russos physician did you examine him in the last six months before his death yes i did graham told me that he had a sick father and asked if i would look at him and would you tell the jury what you found cutler was happy to hardy thought him the perfect witness for his maledominated jury first he was a guy himself neither too young nor too old he was dressed neatly enough for authority but not much more with solid features he wasnt quite handsome though he showed a lot of teeth when he smiled easy and approachable thats what cutler was even better hardy realized he cut nearly the same figure as judge salter except that he was twenty years younger and he was sincere and when you discovered what you thought was a brain tumor on the cat scan what did you do well then i went to an mri with hardys nudging cutler explained a little about magnetic resonance imaging and what did that reveal what i had suspected and feared that the cancer had advanced beyond any ability to treat it it was terminal behind him hardy heard drysdales voice your honor excuse me may we request a sidebar hardy didnt like this at all your honor im in the middle of something here it relates to what mr hardy is doing your honor salter gave it about three seconds then motioned the attorneys forward to the bench once in front of the judge drysdale wasted no time either your honor the prosecution will stipulate that sal russo had terminal cancer and perhaps alzheimers disease he was going to die soon all these questions by mr hardy arent addressing any evidentiary issues freeman spoke under his breath neither did your case in chief salter glared him quiet mr hardy your honor its our intention to show how the deceaseds physical condition might have driven him to want to die somas highpitched voice rang out so what its still murder the attorneys all turned to him at the outburst salter remained calm address your remarks to the court all of you thats me mr soma mr freeman he stared to make sure his point had come across mr hardy are you getting to some kind of mental defense are you going to be asking for manslaughter based on some theory hardy didnt answer directly your honor im getting to the relationship between graham and his father the prosecution is contending that he robbed from sal although they couldnt prove it as you yourself noted this morning salter rebuked him thats not entirely accurate i did deny your motion however close i thought it was but hardy kept at him this was crucial to his case and he couldnt let it go nevertheless your honor dr cutlers testimony bears on the motive of the defendant graham russo would not have stolen from his father he loved him the judge chewed on his cheek slipped on his reading glasses took them back off motive yes your honor hardy had to have it but it was another huge risk salter thought another moment then delivered his judgment im going to allow it hardy let out a breath of relief the attorneys returned to their tables dr cutler he began again youve just told us that sal russos cancer was terminal did you have a prognosis on how long he would live yes six months to a year and what about the disease itself the tumor was it painful indirectly from the increased pressure in his head this produced horrible headaches and began to cause visual changes and motor weakness and over the next six months or a year would these symptoms grow progressively worse yes there would be great pain is that what youre saying yes unbearable pain unbearable hardy nodded and went back to his table to get a drink of water there he was stunned and somewhat pleased to see his client usually a devilmaycare wiseguy with his jaw hard set apparently blinking back tears hardy didnt want to draw attention to the moment it would appear staged but he noticed some of the jury had followed him over he could only hope that they would see and draw the proper conclusion from it back at the center of the courtroom hardy began again during this diagnostic stage doctor all the tests and second opinions and so on did sal come to see you often two or three times a week for a couple of months and did he come alone no never graham always came with him graham russo came every time yes sir and these visits and tests how did sal pay for them did he have insurance no that was one of his main problems and how did he solve that problem graham paid for everything out of his pocket the defense side of the gallery came alive now and salter had to gavel for quiet can you tell us more specifically what graham paid for cutler remained completely at ease talking to the jury who were rapt he paid for everything the visits the cat scans the mri the prescription thank you doctor well get to the prescription in a minute but how can you be sure that this was graham paying you personally and not just handing you his fathers money cutler crossed one knee over the other again he brought it right to the jury graham and i play softball on a semipro team after the games wed collect our pay and hed hand me his money id take it in and pay his bill all right now referring to the prescriptions you wrote for sal was one of these for the do not resuscitate form yes it was could you please tell us about that sure cutler had already been on the stand awhile and hardys questioning would go on a little longer but the doctor was still enthusiastic and hardy noted he was holding the jury its pretty selfexplanatory he had an almost apologetic tone but sal didnt want any extraordinary measures done to keep him alive if the paramedics found him apparently dead they were to leave him that way he was pretty adamant about it he had a lot of dignity and did he ask for the dnr himself yes graham was there but sal wanted it in case he decided to kill himself hardy heard the susurrus sweep the gallery but he kept it moving did sal specifically tell you he planned to kill himself cutler bless him chuckled not exactly we discussed his options that was one of them he turned to the jury explaining thats the way these things go what do you mean by that doctor well youve got a patient who is going to die soon in great pain on top of that in sals case you had his fear of the progress of alzheimers disease so there was a lot of subtext a lot of backwards questions backwards questions cutler contemplated how to rephrase it okay on the morphine for example sal asked if twelve milligrams could be a lethal dose i dont want to kill myself by mistake he said but what he meant was can i kill myself with this if i decide to your honor objection speculation dr cutler cant know what sal russo meant by his question salter started to sustain but cutler had had enough of lawyers telling him what he as a doctor could or couldnt do i know exactly what he meant he blurted out he asked me how to kill himself would it be more effective with alcohol and i told him that if i answered his question i could lose my license and even go to jail so we played this game where salter stopped him doctor please confine yourself to answering specific questions thats how we do it here a tense silence settled over the courtroom but cutler had made the point and the jury would understand terminal patients were often driven by the law to speak in code the communication was clear on both sides salter finally spoke again go ahead mr hardy hardy nodded this discussion about suicide doctor was graham there when you had it yes he was always there hardy took a small break another sip of water graham had recovered his composure and gave him a nod cutlers testimony had clearly registered with the jury several of the men were taking notes no one appeared distracted they were waiting for his next sally dr cutler you knew that graham worked as a paramedic did you not sure guys get hurt playing ball graham and i were the two medical people its how we got to know each other and to your personal knowledge did he give his father morphine injections yes the first time or two during visits it makes a big difference with drugs whether you give them into the muscle which is called im or the vein which is iv initially i recommended higher doses to be given im these could be lethal if injected iv later sal began to have breakthrough pain so i instructed graham on iv dosing guidelines i wanted him to be especially clear on it the jury had already heard this but hardy didnt think it would hurt them to be reminded graham had known what they knew so graham could have given these injections iv or im without sals knowledge that he was doing anything unusual or different hardy heard drysdales voice your honor objection relevance mr hardy in spite of himself salter seemed to have gotten interested and was giving him wide leeway with dr cutler but he thought drysdale might have a point here where was this going hardy was delighted with the objection since it gave him a chance to explain your honor mr drysdale and mr soma have gone to some lengths to try to leave the impression that graham hit his father behind the ear with the bottle of old crow so he could administer this shot without his father objecting though they havent proven it my question to dr cutler clarifies whether graham would have had to do that in any event salter considered and then overruled the objection the question was relevant cutler had it read back to him and then told the jury that an experienced person such as graham could have injected sal iv or im with complete impunity which made clear to the jury hardy hoped that sal would never have had to suspect a thing there would have been no struggle or need of one not if graham had been there which he hadnt been of course but that was no longer the point tactically hardy thought soma and drysdale made a mistake letting the younger man take cutlers crossexamination the two men were polar opposites and grahams friend the doctor was far more likable than the strident prosecutor of course both the men were fasttrack urban professionals and almost by definition had to possess typea personalities to have gotten where they were they probably were deep down inside more similar than not it was a matter of style more than anything but style counted here and played into grahams hands at least at first dr cutler youve said that you consider yourself a friend of the defendant have you known him for a long time cutler shrugged about two years and you play baseball with him is that correct softball but yes outside of softball do you see each other socially this struck cutler as funny outside of softball i dont have a social life humorless soma clucked that would be no doctor wouldnt it you didnt see defendant socially right cutler agreed this answer simple as it was frustrated soma your honor he said to salter the question calls for a negative and dr cutler has answered in the affirmative salter huffed so ask clearer questions mr soma lets move along obviously swallowing his bile soma turned back to the witness box doctor one more time outside of softball did you see defendant socially hardy wondered what soma hoped to accomplish by this display he was coming across as unusually petty and foolish and to get what that cutler and graham didnt party together who cared but the doctor just smiled unruffled and answered as bidden no stiffly soma intoned thank you dont mention it a ripple of laughter in the gallery even salter seemed to be suppressing some amusement soma finally seemed to get it he forced a little smile of his own did defendant share with you any of his motives for accompanying his father yes of course the obvious ones i thought they were pretty obvious anyway you did soma raised his eyebrows and brought in the jury hed started roughly but had picked up a scent he knew what trail he was going to follow now you thought it was obvious why graham brought his father down yes thats right did you think it was obvious that he was being the dutiful son yes and do you know for how long he had been this loving son hardy stood up objection your honor sustained weve heard testimony in this trial that the defendant hadnt seen his father for the previous fifteen years is that what youd call being a loving son doctor again hardy was on his feet objecting soma fought back your honor the jury doesnt have to buy the defendants late attack of altruism the judge sustained hardy but somas attack continued on any of these visits was sal russo difficult to attend to what do you mean difficult well doctor here is a man with alzheimers disease sometimes he doesnt know where he is he doesnt know who you are hes got a tremendously painful cancer in his brain surely he was a little cranky from time to time would you say that was the case yes sometimes and did the defendant ever mention to you that his father was being burdensome or difficult to take care of well he was yes or no doctor yes and maybe he was getting a little tired of it objection hearsay speculation badgering the witness but soma whirled flashed a malevolent glance at hardy spun back to salter im asking the witness what he heard with his own ears your honor its neither hearsay nor speculation and im not badgering im trying to get straight exactly what he heard salter allowed the question overruling hardy and was about to ask the recorder to read it out again when soma delivered it word for word and maybe he was getting a little tired of it did graham russo ever say that all right maybe he did maybe he did yes now lets move to these medical bills and doctors bills and so on that the defendant was paying they must have been expensive were they expensive yes very expensive in the hundreds thousands ten thousands say the high thousands all right lets say the high thousands did the defendant ever mention to you that this was becoming difficult this was a financial burden he could do without no no he was paying thousands of dollars to keep alive a man who was near death anyhow and he never mentioned any frustration about that no that never came up it never came up perhaps thats because he wasnt spending his own money hardy stood again your honor but soma stepped in again your honor dr cutler has told us he received money from graham for these bills after softball games and now we learn it was thousands of dollars proceed salter intoned are we to believe doctor that the defendant makes thousands of dollars playing softball and that every time he paid you for medical services you witnessed the source of the money not every time ah so the defendant would sometimes bring money from apparently another source cutler threw an apologetic look across the courtroom to graham and hardy what could he do yes sometimes he said and that source was his father isnt that so objection speculation but soma kept right on his voice rising in pitch and volume and maybe that source was drying up wasnt it doctor and there wasnt as much money anymore as defendant your honor i object hardy was forced to raise his own voice for nearly the first time in the entire trial salter banged his gavel mr soma please get yourself under control another outburst like that and ill find you in contempt you hear me yes your honor im sorry but he looked neither diminished by the rebuke nor sorry for what had caused it he was drawing some rich blood doctor he continued did the defendant ever indicate to you that he was entitled to something for all the trouble he was going through no he was did sal russo defendants father did sal ever complain about how much these visits were costing yes sometimes he would did it ever occur to you that he meant to ask how much it was costing him not graham no it wasnt do you know it wasnt his fathers money no but do you know his father didnt pay back even the softball money as soon as they got back to his apartment no but i your honor hardy had to try to break up this rhythm the witness is entitled to explain his answers theyre all yesandno questions your honor soma was really on a roll he didnt want to give the judge time to make any ruling on the objection the jury would remember what hed gotten not how ill watch it your honor which was easy to say he was finished hed gotten what hed come for no further questions i have one freeman the wild card came up and around the defense table for redirect he hadnt even cleared it with hardy so he must have been sure he was on to something dr cutler at any time in all of your treatments of sal russo did you sal and graham ever frankly and fully discuss the possibility of assisted suicide there was a collective gasp in the gallery this was the kind of question soma might have asked to hear it from the defense table was shocking but freeman had done it and it was now on the record cutler shell shocked anyway from somas assault now looked stunned yes many times he asked me if id help kill him if he got too far gone i said i couldnt and was sal russo lucid during at least some of these discussions yes many of them most it was brilliant if i do say so myself and i do freeman was in the holding cell defending himself hardy and graham were both having trouble appreciating his genius we got assisted suicide in the front of everybodys brains now we did before david it was more subtle was all subtle schmuttle unwrapping his reuben sandwich freeman scoffed at the idea he took a juicy bite leaned over so the bag would catch his drippings swabbed his thick lips with a napkin listen up graham didnt say that he was thinking of killing his dad for any reason remember were loving this assisted suicide defense but its still illegal my sons he pointed at graham even if its going to get you off graham was unconvinced yoda better that clearer make freeman motioned over to hardy thats for this silvertongued devil in closing how can i thank you enough hardy asked freeman grinned and took another bite no charge thursday afternoon all day friday monday and tuesday of the next week was a long slow waltz for the defense hardy had to get the jury to hear about the progress of alzheimers disease about sals relations with the rest of the estranged family about the places and times sal and graham had been together in public so he called helen and george and debra and the young dr finer whod first examined sal at the county clinic he called the owner of the us restaurant where they had frequently eaten keeping up on the motive issue he brought up many of grahams past coworkers and associates one at a time hardy called as witnesses several emts three male two female whod crewed with him over the past two years all of whom had nothing but good to say about his compassion bedside manner cooperative spirit medical knowledge punctuality and general competence hed made no enemies within his ambulance company besides russ cutler three other members of grahams softball team the hornets testified that hed brought his father to games introduced him around went out for food afterward he was a solicitous and dutiful son especially effective was roger stamps whod been with them in fremont after a game a year or more ago when sal had wandered away from the softball field he and graham had driven the darkened streets for over an hour before locating sal in the coffee shop of a bowling alley graham had paid his fathers tab got him belted into the car and drove him home hed never shown impatience or anger stamps hoped that when he got old he could have a son as devoted as graham craig ising was a guys guy and hence a good call for this jury but there was a risk to calling him as well in hardys mind there was a very real legal question as to whether grahams knowing participation in the highstakes softball games even leaving aside the question of claiming his income from it constituted a felony in the end they decided to call ising as a witness anyway he better than anyone else could put a positive spin on grahams apparently irresponsible defection from harold drapers courtroom as well as explain the intricacies of his motivation to be a replacement player that graham had correctly predicted the end of the baseball strike had wanted another look from the major league clubs wouldnt play as a scab and so on if graham wasnt going to testify somebody else had to make the jury aware of his state of mind and ising was the best choice graham hadnt acted like a selfish flake he was a man in pursuit of a dream soma and drysdale kept a low profile the occasional objection would come up over a witnesss characterization of one of grahams actions but generally the prosecution seemed happy to let hardy call his people and let them talk none of the witnesses were rebutting the evidence that had been presented what could there be to worry about on wednesday morning at seventhirty hardy sat behind the closed door of abe glitskys office with david freeman and sarah evans they were reviewing all the leads that as sarah had independently discovered over the past four months had gone nowhere hardy and freeman were contemplating calling one more witness and then they were going to wrap up the defense hardy getting to tie the pieces of his story grahams story together at last the early confidence he felt in their strategy had completely disappeared by now not that the trial hadnt gone as well as hed hoped but a jury was always a crapshoot and this one particularly hardy had been in the air with his dive now for most of four court days and it was all he could do to hold his tuck for the next hours he hadnt rebutted any prosecution evidence in his own case in chief oh yes hed done his best to discredit witnesses on the issue of whether there had been a struggle but that had been about the extent of his arguments he had presented an affirmative defense that was simply an alternative explanation of the same facts that the prosecution had used it was going to come down to a matter of what the jury believed or whom they believed in that sense it was good that no one had found any other dudes to point at and now they were all committed hardys defense was really the only possible one left but he couldnt shake his intense discomfort over the fact that it was basically a cynical lie a lie that served justice he believed but still a lie freeman was not being his most endearing self he appeared to have slept in his suit and certainly hadnt showered obvious in the cramped room he had consumed a healthy wellrounded breakfast of peanuts and had piled the shells in front of him on glitskys desk look lieutenant we can go down to judge salter right now and get ourselves a month continuance and i think we ought to do it and investigate the hell out of this gambling connection hardy tried to rein his partner in hed never do that to the jury david not at this stage and its not about any gambling anyway freeman paid no mind breezing along jawing at glitsky we know that craig ising is in cahoots with at least two dozen other gamblers downtown most of whom used sal russo to run their money around a long time ago hardy put in some of which might have been the wrapped bills in this case theres no evidence of that sarah said freeman snapped none that youve found sarahs eyes flashed at him thats right none that anybody could have found glitsky sat up hey hey nobody has to get accusatory getting mad isnt going to help anything im not mad freeman appeared genuinely surprised he was simply arguing his position for him a function of drawing breath how could it offend evans however had some color in her cheeks i interviewed craig ising twice mr freeman actually it had been four times but glitsky had only known and approved of the last two of them so she went with that i told him we werent interested in his gambling only in sal he said to his knowledge no one had used sal in at least two full years freeman scoffed at that he says graham corroborates it hardy said freeman looked from one of them to the other heres the deal he said sal had memory problems this ring a bell pavlovs he might have stumbled upon this opportunity to deliver a bag of cash and forgot he even did it to who from who glitsky asked abe means whom david to whom from whom hardy favored abe with a smile abe looked over whom this diz freeman ignored the exchange thats your job lieutenant find that out like freeman glitsky wasnt angry he admired freemans persistence but he realized that he was fishing and had nothing point me to any evidence any direction david and were on it im not saying it couldnt have happened im not even saying it didnt happen but ive got a suspect on trial for what wed be asking these people about if we could find out who they were what about the cooperative mr ising hardy had to speak up again hes our witness david hes been nothing but a help freeman waved a hand thats old news whats he done for us lately back at glitsky look you call ising in rip him a new asshole over all this gambling tell him youre giving him up to vice if he doesnt give us the name of every one of his cohorts and then you call all of them downtown and find where their stories dont coincide does he have a sheet meaning a police record truly amused now glitsky rolled his eyes at sarah turned to hardy anything else diz i think you went a bit over the line david suggesting we arrest the entire young generation of the citys power elite i dont know maybe that didnt seem reasonable glitsky could do it they sat at their table in the empty courtroom freeman had tried another ploy suggesting on round two that this time glitsky arrest dan tosca and somehow squeeze him for information on the multimilliondollar fishpoaching trade but again as glitsky and sarah had pointed out there wasnt even any smoke around tosca why should they go looking for a fire the point is not that he could do it david but that hed have to explain why and there wouldnt be any good reasons the old man shook his head picky picky picky besides hardy continued i thought wed decided to stay in our tuck that was you freeman said me id go to any lengths to keep a verdict away from a jury if a judge would give me a fiveyear continuance id take it on general principles spoken like a true defense attorney which i might remind you is what i am and youd let your client rot in jail absolutely hardy had to laugh were you born with this great compassion for your fellow man or is it something youve developed over the years both but all right glitsky washed now were back on plan a we calling brandt theyd beaten this decision to death but were pretty clear with what they should do on the one hand barbara brandt would be a stirring defender of assisted suicide and would put the issue right into the collective faces of the jury but freeman had already done just that on redirect with russ cutler only a moron and hardy hoped there were none on the jury could avoid some sense of the real issue in this case on the other hand brandt would swear that graham had killed sal she was probably a liar and certainly a loose cannon hardy didnt know what if anything drysdale and soma had discovered about brandts lie detector test but the polygraph experts name was les worrell and he was on their witness list hardy had questioned worrell and believed that brandt had in fact passed the test but hed also read newspaper and magazine reports opining that barbara brandt had been coached in how to pass the test what hardy didnt know was if worrell had been implicated in that collusion and he was loath to ask about more things he didnt know the whole polygraph issue was inadmissible but hardy and freeman thought they knew a land mine when they saw one im going to let my instincts decide he said finally go with what you feel huh freeman asked right dumbest idea i ever heard hardy shrugged you do it all the time but im the incredible david freeman it wasnt clear whether he was kidding or not im going to win them over david im going to make them see it without brandt probably now that i think of it she cant tell the jury anything they dont already know from other sources freeman seemed to buy this so you got a plan hardy cracked a craggy grin the outlines a little vague a little smile a little dance a little seltzer in my pants drysdale soma and the big boss himself dean powell were having their own meeting in the state attorneys offices on fremont street though a day or so of the defenses testimony had gone by before theyd seen it they were no longer unaware that hardy was conducting his portion of the trial on a different plane than they had they had a big decision to make and werent in precise accord about how to proceed dean powell had the floor which in this case was the head of the long functional stateissue table in the conference room his face was set and under the mane of white hair his color was high i dont care about any facesaving strategy art were not backing away from the specials all im saying dean drysdales tone was mild is that we dont want to let this boy go free if the jurys only choice is to convict on robbery murder or acquit they might just acquit and then whats all this been for all this has been to bring a murderer to justice powell wasnt entertaining other suggestions thats what all this has been for its what its always been for besides theyre not going to acquit fearless soma waded into it we just want to drive a stake into the heart of that possibility dean give them another option to consider ask for manslaughter as a possible lesser verdict hardys leading them in that direction dean drysdale added gil and i just want to cut him off god damn it powell clipped are you boys listening to me am i speaking some foreign language we have charged our man russo here with robbery murder dont you think i understand the implications of that i assure you i do and ill tell you something else if we back off if we even appear to back off well be broadcasting the news to the jury that we didnt prove the case and then they will acquit there was that familiar bubble of silence that succeeds the moment when a boss swears at underlings drysdale took a breath how about this dean we dont argue assisted suicide powell damn straight we dont but we give it to salter in our jury instructions the dilemma they faced was a real one in the same way that hardy and the defense had gone into their tuck vowing not to pull out of it until they had presented their entire argument so too the prosecution had avoided muddying the murder waters by never alluding to the possibility that sals death was less than murder assisted suicide was still both technically and in fact a crime in the state of california it might not be firstdegree murder but it was at least second and no way less than a long prison term drysdale was admitting the validity of powells position that they might open themselves to ridicule and acquittal if they switched over and added the assistedsuicide argument at this point but if they did do that they would vastly increase the odds that the jury would not set graham russo scot free drysdale believed that he could persuade judge salter to direct the jury that assisted suicide was still murder then the jury could return with a verdict of first or seconddegree murder and powell could still claim some sort of victory but the attorney general was adamant he wasnt doing that his team wouldnt play on that field we picked this fight six months ago art we get him on robbery murder or we let him go tempers were fraying and soma cracked under the pressure slapping his palm loudly on the table shit powell snapped back the strike of a snake dont you give me that attitude mr soma youll find yourself unemployed in a fucking heartbeat you hear me you afraid you didnt prove the case soma raised his eyes we proved the case sir powell stared him down lets hope you did because i dont want to hear one word in your closing about assisted suicide except to say its no defense to a murder charge our boy killed his father for his money thats what he did and thats why he did it if youve got any kind of problem with that at this stage either of you he paused glaring well thats just too damn bad youre going to have to live with it sarahs earlymorning meeting with hardy and freeman in glitskys office was ancient history as she and her partner decided not to wait for the elevators and took the stairs on their way down to the lobby on the secondfloor landing sarah glanced into the hallway and saw a pregnant woman feet spread and planted sitting on a bench alone outside of grahams courtroom now on a hunch she asked lanier to wait a minute and walked over are you debra mccoury the womans face was blotched and she appeared to be near tears she nodded who are you sarah sat next to her introducing herself im the one who arrested your brother i dont know if you remember but we spoke on the phone when i first i remember the face closed up ive called since a few times youve been a little hard to get in touch with well i work and evidently hated the fact but youre here now and the other day too i was a witness i got time off debra said without pay they said theyre doing the closing arguments today i wanted to be here from graham sarah had learned quite a lot about debra like her mother had with sal she had married below some perception of her station in life and it was playing the same kind of havoc with her graham felt nothing but sorry for her she didnt have be so miserable to keep herself looking so plain certainly she didnt have to remain in a relationship with a cheating husband but it was the same as the case with george sals abandonment had brought with it a nearly paralyzing loss of her selfesteem along with a bitterness that soured everything in her world debra believed in her heart that she wasnt worth loving that no one would ever truly love her sarah thought one look at her revealed her story and now she was going to have brendans baby and life was going to get more complicated sadder so why are you down here sarah asked you told me you didnt like graham that he couldnt be trusted debra swallowed with some effort he is my brother and what does that mean that means i dont want to see him sent to jail do you think he killed your father the blotches rose on her heavy neck i dont know but you do think he stole this money i dont know that either anymore i was here and heard that bank person nobody seems to know what happened about that what did you want to see me about in fact shed called debra for the most part because dismas hardy had asked her to do so before they had finally left the other dude phase of the investigation not that she or hardy had thought debra would lead to anything substantial still when shed made herself unavailable sarah had wondered i was following up on some other questions you told me about the baseball cards you also gave me the impression that you knew sal had more money stashed away somewhere which it turns out he did true but thats not my point my point is how did you know it i dont know maybe i wasnt sure of it i guess graham told me but i thought you hadnt talked to graham in a couple of years debra moved her hands over her belly her face a brown study there was a glint of moisture in her eyes you also said sal kept the baseball cards in his apartment had you been there to his apartment how did you know he kept them there she was shaking her head no i just assumed suddenly she whirled on sarah what are you asking me all of these questions for i didnt do anything i didnt say you did but youre im just asking you to explain how you knew some of the things you told me about lanier grew tired of waiting in the stairway he came across the hall and stood in front of the two women this is my partner inspector lanier sarah said lanier nodded everything all right here sarah kept up the press im sure you remember where you were on the afternoon that your father was killed you wouldnt forget that no i dont forget it it was a friday wasnt it i was at work all day you didnt take lunch yes no i think so i dont remember probably debras hands massaged her stomach look i dont like this this is making me feel sick perhaps because of laniers looming presence she made no effort to rise sal always had the baseball cards from when i was a kid she said i mean he had to still have them and the way my mother talked she always said he had other money thats why i thought that so why did you tell me graham was hiding something and couldnt be trusted sarah knew the real answer to this question but she wanted to hear the way debra got around it finally her eyes spilled over she dug in her purse for something to wipe the tears away hes not bad she said who isnt bad debra graham but she was shaking her head from side to side snuffling i just dont want them to send him to jail he didnt kill sal for any money i know that how do you know it i just know him he wouldnt have done that she looked pleadingly at sarah and marcel i dont care about the money either not anymore i dont even want my share i dont care about it brendan wanted she stopped your husband what about your husband hes the one who wanted the money who was on me to get the money she sobbed once i didnt mean to get graham in trouble i just want our family back again the way it was anything the way it was why cant it be that way anymore the tears were falling freely now and sarah finally touched her shoulder then stood up and motioned to marcel that they should go two days later hardy rested the defense case without calling barbara brandt or graham russo gil soma spent a moment conferring quietly with art drysdale at the prosecution table they were disappointed but not surprised that they wouldnt get a chance to hack at graham theyd spent a full day in chambers arguing jury instructions salter had been very uncomfortable about not giving manslaughter instructions not giving the jury any choice but murder or acquittal but neither side wanted manslaughter and that seemed to be a correct reading of the law so salter shrugged his shoulders and wished both sides good luck now hardy flashed a look behind him at the courtroom which was filled to overflowing it was reminiscent of day one with pratt and powell and their respective acolytes in attendance one team on each side there was jeff elliot the citytalk columnist from the chronicle and barbara brandt bravely camouflaging her disappointment at being snubbed surrounded by her entourage helen taylor was in the first row behind hardy grahams very pregnant sister debra whod evidently had an emotional morning was next to her mother but soma was up now commanding all of hardys attention that of all the courtroom first he would give his closing argument then it would be hardys turn finally soma would get the last word and salter would give the jury their instructions then at last the jury would go into deliberation hardy leaned over and whispered to graham asking him if he was all right telling him this might get rough he should stay calm try not to react the young man smiled gamely grabbed hardys arm and gave it a squeeze no fear easy for you to say after a lunch break when he hadnt been able to force a bite hardy was back with david freeman and graham russo at their table in the courtroom soma had borrowed the lowkey approach hed used to such good effect in his opening statement and in about an hour had told the bynow familiar story in a straightforward and plausible manner reflecting dean powells decision hed made no mention of assisted suicide as a reasonable second interpretation of the evidence for the jury and this had been a huge relief for the defense hardy and graham now thought they had a chance david freeman was of the opinion that it was locked up they would get their acquittal and because freeman had no sense of superstition and little of decorum hed kept repeating it during the recess making the other guys crazy graham had snapped at freeman you ever heard of not mentioning it when youre in the middle of a nohitter david you dont tell the pitcher why not freeman asked saying never mind dont try to graham hardy had left the holding cell now he stepped out in front of his table closer to the jury box than hed been when talking to witnesses he paused to slow himself down gave a confident nod to graham and freeman took a deep breath and began ladies and gentlemen of the jury i told you at the beginning of this trial that graham russo loved his father and im telling you that again now he moved a step closer to the jury box sal russo lived in a world that was closing up on him a world of murky memories and everincreasing pain for years and years hed been estranged from all three of his children but about two years ago he reached out to one of them to graham his oldest son at the time graham was having troubles of his own troubles that im sure many of you have experienced as youve tried to get settled in your jobs and your lifes work hardy had to get this jury and in particular these men to recognize the common ground they shared with his client he had quit the prestigious appointment he got after law school to pursue his dream of playing majorleague baseball but then that dream too had fallen apart hardy humanized it a little more he just couldnt hit the curveball im sure many of us know how that feels he got a chuckle or two when he came back to san francisco resigned now finally to being a lawyer he found that he couldnt find any work that the people hed thought were his friends in the yuppie world of the law had abandoned him these were calculated words designed to move these mostly workingclass men into grahams corner hardy continued this is when he reconnected with sal weve also heard the members of his family his mother and brother and sister testify that its also when graham discovered that his father was having problems with his memory he was in the first stages of alzheimers disease occasionally he would forget where he was what he needed to do graham was the only one who would help but he did more than simply help he became his fathers companion and friend they went out to dinners together to ball games they drove around the city talking laughing together reconnecting until finally as we learned from dr cutler sal began getting these terrible unbearable headaches hardy paused for a moment he was going to change his direction now and confront the prosecution youve heard mr soma and mr drysdale make assertions that graham resented his father the time he spent with him the money he spent for his treatment let me remind you that no one in this trial has ever not once presented any evidence in support of these assertions and you know why that is because they arent true graham never got tired of helping his father of nursing his father judge giotti told you that graham visited sal several times a week to make sure he was comfortable was taking his shots right up until the end blue sals downstairs neighbor a witness for the prosecution told us the same thing graham never wavered in his devotion he loved sal another pause hardy walked over to his table for a sip of water he glanced at the yellow pad on his desk on which were written only three words love evidence close hed barely touched on evidence yet the burden of proof the usual smorgasbord he had to give it its due now tearing a page from somas book he came right to the jury rail talking to them now not in a speech but human to human some of you may have noticed that ive spent very little time trying to rebut the evidence that the prosecution has presented thats because there is precious little evidence no one ever saw or even said they saw graham treat his father other than as a friend and companion the famous fifty thousand dollars the baseball cards did mr soma or mr drysdale prove anything to you about them other than that they once were in sals possession and later they were in grahams isnt it more reasonable to assume that sal knew he was losing his reason and wanted his son who was his caretaker and friend anyway to hold his valuables so that at the least they wouldnt get lost or misplaced or so that graham could use the money and proceeds from the cards to help defray some of the costs of sals treatment from what youve heard about graham russo doesnt that make a lot more sense than that suddenly one day graham struggled with his father and stole his money its ridiculous it didnt happen similarly there was no proof of any struggle let me tell you something and judge salter will repeat it to you when he gives you his jury instructions the prosecution has to prove grahams guilt to you beyond a reasonable doubt and i dont have to prove anything the burden of proof never shifts it is always on the prosecution and unless they can prove something as far as you must be concerned it just didnt happen salter cleared his throat and interrupted mr hardy ill be instructing them on the law when youre finished hardy took it calmly salter was right but it wouldnt hurt for the jury to see his passion he turned back to the panel with an apologetic smile as it turns out you have heard quite a lot of testimony about grahams character about his relationship with sal about the kind of person he is but even if you had none of that or didnt believe it even if graham sat there friendless and alone with no one to speak up for him the prosecution has presented nothing to support their theory thats all it is a misguided theory with no facts no evidence no proof to support it then how did it get to here all the way to trial i know youre all asking yourselves that question and i dont blame you so ill tell you it got here for one reason and one reason only really there were two and he hoped the jury had read the newspapers or talked to family members or somehow had discovered the personal connection between gil soma and graham russo freeman had bitched about somas involvement to the press on many occasions early on in the proceedings and then hardy had alluded to it in a couple of discussions with his reporter friend jeff elliot who printed it in his citytalk column it couldnt be admitted at trial of course but sometimes you got things to juries any way you could but hardy now had to get to the lies it was unpleasant and dicey but he had to address the issue graham panicked when the police came to talk to him he didnt panic because he thought hed done anything morally wrong and here his phraseology had to be precise but because hed been close to someone who had taken his own life hed shown him how to use the syringe hed even on occasion administered the drug himself hed comforted and counseled him when nobody else would and he knew he might be condemned for it he knew his kindness and compassion might be twisted by those more interested in politics than in justice more eager to exact a pound of flesh than to do the right thing graham russo knew the world was full of bureaucrats small men and women who live to control the lives of others men and women who like nothing more than to tell men like dr cutler what medical advice to give and tell us all what medicine we can and cannot take to ease our pain graham knew that these petty people werent content to control only our lives they seek even to control our deaths as well sal russo finally was beyond their control now but graham russo was not and he was afraid that is why he lied another pause to let it all sink in as a licensed attorney in the state of california graham was faced with the very real possibility that guilty or innocent he would lose his ability to practice law he might be disbarred he could then never work in the profession for which hed spent three grueling years in school and thousands of dollars in tuition he couldnt let that happen so he lied to police and then he lied to cover his earlier lies i wish this werent the case and believe me so does he but he did and its put him here and let me add that even sergeant evans who heard all of grahams falsehoods firsthand has told you she thinks graham is a trustworthy person not a liar hardy took a breath relieved hed expected to be interrupted by objections at every second but the closing argument was just that an argument he was making his case and evidently keeping within the bounds of specificity that was going to change in a minute but for the moment he was on safe ground graham knew that it looked like sal had committed suicide indeed dr strout the coroner is still not able to say it wasnt suicide perhaps graham knew better perhaps he knew about the dnr sticker that was out for the paramedics when they arrived perhaps he knew that his fathers pain had become unceasing that life had become truly unbearable that sal was ready to die that death itself when it came would be a peaceful and blessed relief hardy scanned the jury box resting on several jurors he wasnt offering any challenge just telling them what he believed what they had to believe he lowered his voice to a near whisper graham is a trained paramedic he got two calls from his father on the morning of his death he went to the apartment where his father was in blinding pain perhaps sal sitting on the floor by his coffee table had a last drink or two for courage an intravenous morphine shot is as dr strout has told you instantaneous and painless there was no struggle at any time and for sal russo there would be no more pain no more confusion as the past inexorably slipped away from him no loss of dignity there would finally be peace he met the eyes of every juror one by one it seemed to take forever i tell you that graham russo has committed no crime no murder was done here no injury to society that requires retribution this is an innocent man legally factually and above all morally innocent you must find him not guilty for all of our sakes citytalk by jeff elliot the hottest ticket in town on thursday was department at the hall of justice the courtroom of judge jordan salter there to an sro crowd comprised of most of the states legal powerhouses including california attorney general dean powell and san francisco district attorney sharron pratt euthanasia lobbyists citizens groups and media representatives the murder trial of lawyerathlete graham russo closed in a flurry of rhetoric from both sides this reporters view has always been that this trial was less about the murder of salmon sal russo than it was a kind of grudge matchup between gil soma and graham russo both of whom served a few years ago as clerks for federal judge harold draper soma hated russo for leaving him a big workload and here was the chance to pay him back petty you bet defense attorney dismas hardy took a bold stance and ignored the great majority of evidence presented by messrs soma and drysdale for the prosecution and instead painted his own picture of a devoted son who found himself in the agonizing dilemma of his fathers terminal illness the jury evidently believed him after deliberating only one and a half hours at about threethirty yesterday afternoon as all the country now knows they returned with a verdict of acquittal they didnt say that graham russo assisted in his fathers suicide the way the law is written thats just not an option instead they had to say that graham did nothing wrong i think they were right part five he was halfway across the lobby at freemans office the sun was bright in the solarium when phyllis called out from the reception desk oh mr hardy turning on a dime he marched to her desk oh phyllis he stared down at her as she looked up at him someday youre going to smile and im going to catch you and tell everybody this wasnt the time though the phones were ringing all over the switchboard and she pointed vaguely off behind her mr russos in his office he wants to see you yoda figured that proximity to his own august self during the four months of the trial preparation had been proper training to turn graham into his very own jedi knight and after a week off to reacclimatize to civilian life the exdefendant had come in to work at the freeman building as one of davids associates so much for grahams worries about being unhirable in the law hardy took a scintilla of pleasure from the fact that freeman had given graham michelles old office the usurper was gone and with her the memory well most of it of what shed done what he hadnt remaining for a moment at the reception desk hardy was deciding if he should go upstairs first check his answering machine he was out hustling jobs now had been all morning all the past couple of weeks since the trial had ended the endeavor had not been entirely unsuccessful since the conclusion of grahams trial hardy had reacquired a bit of star status in town hed gotten a lot of press and calls had come in he was looking forward to facing some of dean powells minions again the attorney general had decided to save face with his constituency by prosecuting some but not all of the doctors whod admitted to being involved with their patients deaths two of these doctors had come to hardy he wasnt sure he wanted assisted suicide to become his issue but on a casebycase basis a lawyer could do worse and at best find himself on the side of the angels he was still billing far less than he needed to live on although he had a few months reprieve hardy had a second time broken the first rule of defense law with leland taylor confident that he would win with graham and therefore that leland would be favorably disposed to pay hed allowed him after a generous retainer up front to make monthly payments for grahams defense his trust had been justified and the checks had been coming in every month there was no reason to suspect that the next one wouldnt arrive in a couple of weeks since hardy made three times his normal hourly rate when he was in court though hed told graham it was only double it looked to be a substantial payment able to hold him over for a while but lelands payment would come to an end after that and hed need more steady work lined up by the time it did freeman would probably try to throw something his way again but all in all hed prefer now to go it alone get his own practice into high gear it was about time and perhaps some of that work was waiting upstairs but his feet took him to grahams he knocked once and tried the door associates didnt lock doors in the freeman building graham wore a light blue suit and had cut his hair so it just brushed his ears he looked absurdly young fit and handsome obviously sleeping better than he had for the past six months the bags had disappeared from under his eyes but close up hardy could still discern a sallowness leftovers from the jail pallor and something else a sense of lingering fatigue or a new worry hardy closed the door behind him our dear phyllis said you wanted to see me oh yeah two separate words he blew out sharply sals stuff is ready to get picked up he gestured meaninglessly but hardy thought he knew what he meant sals stuff both from the evidence locker and the storage bin where the city had moved it was another emotional hurdle in the marathon that was the aftermath of a murder trial picking up the last of his fathers remains going back to the hall of justice where for so long hed been in chains hardy considered for about two seconds it would probably take him most of the afternoon but this personal stuff was more important than business at least he thought so he was sure it was among his greatest failings okay he said give me five minutes to check my messages his voice mail had seven calls the third one was from a jeanne walsh who said she was calling about the joan singleterry advertisement she left her number which hardy tried immediately although no one replied one of grahams first concerns after the verdict and it endeared him to hardy was the distribution of the money to joan singleterrys children if they could find her with one last advertising blitz george and debra had been as skeptical as hardy would have predicted about the existence of a joan singleterry and sals directive to give her his money but realizing that it was probably their best chance to get their hands on sals money without a legal battle the siblings had told graham they would let him give joan singleterry one last good try if he would split up the funds should it fail graham knew that any litigation to preserve the money after that would only eat up most of it so he finally agreed but their last run at singleterry was to be a good one instead of going nationwide with a tiny classified ad in the personals column of thirty or forty publications hardys earlier strategy they decided to take out a threeinch box in the sports sections of five of californias largest newspapers and for good measure a twoinch box in the wall street journal the advertisement paid for by most of the money graham had stashed with craig ising would run for one full week that week had passed on sunday two days before for hardy getting a call on the singleterry question did not automatically give rise to soaring hopes hed received half a dozen similar replies that had proven worthless before the trial nevertheless it did get his blood going the trial was over but the failure to achieve any sense of closure had kept him up several nights since the verdict had come in someone had killed sal russo and gotten away with it he couldnt shake the feeling that this connected somehow to joan singleterry and of course it didnt escape him that if singleterry were connected to a murderer she herself might already be dead murdered the advertisement itself might in fact subject her to mortal danger for this reason they had kept the ad as simple as possible the name joan singleterry hardys phone number reward no mention of graham hardy sal it would either work or it wouldnt since it was on the way to the hall of justice and its evidence lockup hardy and graham stopped off at the facility where the city had put up the rest of sals goods what there was of them now within the past few years with the moscone center and plans for the new giants stadium in china basin the south of market area had developed pockets of hope change life but a great deal of the real estate between market street and the hall of justice and this included the lions arms remained as it had been for decades seedy scabrous and sad graham punched his combination into the box by the cyclone fence and they pulled into the forlorn and soulless monthly storage rental facility peeling yellow stucco walls rustred corrugated iron doors they drove slowly down one long row around a corner back up another one nice place for a party hardy said couple of balloons maybe a tuba band a little imagination and you could really have a good time here hardy had picked up the key to the unit from the city custodian over a week ago he was to return it when theyd finished cleaning it out sals leftover goods from his apartment were in it and graham hesitated one last minute in the car perhaps steeling himself against the weather perhaps against a more powerful psychic storm before opening his door the wind was up in the midafternoon sending grimy clouds of dust soot flotsam swirling around the car gotta do it he said almost to himself hardy waited in the car while graham worked the heavy padlock and threw the door all the way up the unit was tiny six feet deep and maybe four feet wide and even so it wasnt nearly filled with a minimum of talk they started a chain gang lifting things and putting them into the open trunk of the bmw five or six boxes of books and bricabrac kitchen and bathroom utensils photo albums a small closets worth of salvation army clothes none of this had been tagged as evidence or figured as part of discovery and hardy realized with a stab that hed never before seen any of it not that hed needed it he consoled himself hed won but still it rankled graham reached down and passed him a rectangular piece of plywood whyd they throw this in hardy asked i think i saw a dumpster by the gate grahams expression went from hurt to anger then dissolved when he realized that hardy was looking at the back obviously thinking that one of the movers had thrown a random board onto sals pile of junk other side hardy turned it over the light was right and the painting leapt out at him through the grain of the plywood the boat by the wharf with the small boy fishing with a broken pole from the flying bridge what is this he asked graham shrugged he was holding another box waiting for hardy to put the painting into the trunk and resume loading one of sals your dad painted this graham put his box down and came over looking at the painting he was pretty good wasnt he hardy thought so but more he was interested in the background where was this his berth at the wharf when he still had the signing bonus thats his boat there you can still make out the name see whats this then hardy was pointing at the burnedout building in the background the old grotto right after it burned down is that when he lost his boat did it get caught in the fire or something no i think he sold it for parts a long time later it just wore out but it looks worn out here in this picture which would have been at the same time a gust of wind came up nearly pulling the board out of hardys hands graham was shaking his head placing something no he said i know he painted it after the fire we were in the manor he did it out in the garage he stared at it for another beat he always loved that painting and obviously it was hanging in his apartment a nod over the couch hardy was still mesmerized what graham asked its just a powerful image graham agreed sal was pretty good maybe ill hang it in my place you want to grab that last box the evidence lockup was in the bowels of the hall a huge room that smelled like an old library where people would occasionally change their oil with its graygreen paint and interior cyclone fence its barebulb lighting and cacophonous resonance it had all of the buildings usual institutional charm and then some sarah was waiting by the signout counter out of force of habit hardy had brought along his lawyers briefcase and leaned over to place it at his feet when he looked up he was initially shocked by the casual kiss of greeting that she and graham gave each other then he realized that the duty officer down here probably wouldnt recognize graham anyway and even if he did why would he care graham was a free citizen again he could kiss a cop if he wanted to it only took a couple of minutes there was some paperwork that sarah as arresting inspector of record had to sign so wheres marcel hardy asked sarah gave him the bad eye i took the afternoon off she said which answered his question the ostracism over her involvement with a murder suspect was he suspected just beginning in the week after the trial the story about her and graham had hit the press with a fury hardy didnt think anyone here today wanted to pursue it so he turned back to the counter there were three cardboard boxes two filled with the miscellaneous papers from sals apartment and the third the smallest one with the contents of the safe carefully labeled s russo safe evanslainer homicide in indelible black marker graham opened this last one first and peered inside then looked up and nodded a shaky smile in place still there sarah asked most of it at least sarah spoke to hardy i told him it wouldnt get stolen out of evidence he didnt believe me she has a trusting heart graham said lucky for you hardy pulled back the flaps and started laying the money out on the counter stacks of hundreddollar bills but it couldnt hurt to check before we leave under the bulging eyes of the duty officer who asked if they had arranged for a guard out of the building hardy took out the tightly wrapped bundles ten of them next he reached back in and pulled out a shoe box blew the dust off opened it the baseball cards didnt even fill it newspaper was stuffed in at the end and on the sides to keep them from shaking around hardy reached in again and picked up the second shoe box and graham put his hand in and rummaged around how about if we put the money back in sarah asked hardy nodded how about if we put everything back in its all here take it somewhere safe thats our plan graham said he lifted out the old belt and dropped one end to let it hang then put it around his waist you think i could find somebody to put a new buckle on this thing obviously graham was thinking of a memento of his father although perhaps this belt wasnt his most stylish option it was of unfinished black leather heavy and thick graham held it around his waist little big for me though he sucked in his washboard stomach he smiled turned to hardy it might fit you you want to try it hardy iced him a smile id respond appropriately except that theres a woman present in the back lot they loaded the boxes into the backseat of grahams bmw the trunk having been filled at the storage place with sarah as armed escort graham planned to get himself a new safety deposit box asap then theyd take the rest of the stuff to his place up on edgewood and decide what theyd do from there graham had asked if he wanted a lift back uptown but hardy wanted to call his joan singleterry connection again he had not told graham about the call no sense in getting his hopes up if it was a dead end the beemer was idling and graham and sarah were ready to go hardy couldnt stop himself from asking what have you found out about the cards im checking out the trade shows it looks like theyre going to bring in forty or fifty and youre splitting that with george and debra too graham gave him a shrug without singleterry im afraid its their money what can i do sarah leaned over from the passenger side hes even thinking of declaring his softball earnings hardy deadpanned whoa dont get all carried away on me now ive reformed graham was dead serious im reporting every cent of income i make for the rest of my life im going back and filing amended returns i am never ever under any circumstances spending one more night in jail hardy nodded heres a perfect example of the beauty of our criminal system you go to jail for a few months you come out a better person back at his office he punched in the number again and this time it picked up on the second ring hello jeanne walsh yes a young womans voice the crying of a baby in the background you called me in response to an advertisement in the newspaper thats right i did whats this about do i get the reward i could seriously use a reward its possible he temporized actually though we were trying to find joan singleterry herself do you know her of course thats why i called joan singleterry was my mother the past tense sprang up at hardy immediately amplified she died about four years ago would you mind answering some questions about her no i dont mind at all can i ask who im talking to though hardy apologized my name is dismas hardy im a lawyer in san francisco san francisco thats a long way away where are you eureka hardy had been doodling on his legal pad now he decided to take a couple of notes eureka was an old lumber port the county seat of humboldt county california three hundred miles up the coast and did your mother live there too in eureka yes did she always live there just a second she was gone from the phone and he heard her scolding no no no dont put that in there brittany mommy will be off in a minute okay hardy could relate jeanne came back to the phone im sorry where were we did your mother always live in eureka mostly she was born here then lived in san francisco for a while and then moved back but her name wasnt singleterry when she was down there it was palmieri joan palmieri then back up here she married ron singleterry hardys heart sank but when she lived in san francisco your mothers name was joan what palmieri jeanne spelled it hardy wrote it on his pad do you know a man named sal russo no i dont think so do you remember if your mother ever mentioned him sal russo she was silent a minute no it doesnt even ring a tiny bell was she supposed to know him does this mean i dont get the reward brittany dont reward or not the child was commanding more than half of jeanne walshs attention hardy should let her go and get on his own horse this finally was a definite link to joan singleterry and a new name with which to conjure palmieri he thanked her and told her hed get back to her this time unable to entirely suppress the rush of excitement his hunch was becoming a certainty he didnt know the exact mechanism but joan singleterry was going to lead him to sal russos killer the whole family pitched in making chili quesadillas and tacos pico and angela morales came by with their three children young and old ate together at the same table the law went undiscussed the kids went down to sleep before eightthirty five of them on the floor in rebeccas room when pico and angela woke up their clan to go home three hours later hardy and frannie still had some energy and didnt let it go to waste this morning he made his fourmile jog and walk with something approaching ease the city had turned cold by california standards the high today would be degrees so he brought wood up from the cord of oak underneath the house while frannie baked bread he cleaned his fish tank with all the domesticity he didnt arrive at the office until nearly noon among his messages was a call from another of the doctors whod signed the published admission that hed helped one or more of his patients die hardy could see a groundswell developing here yesterday hed forgotten to return the padlock key for the storage unit to the city custodian and he decided to use that as an excuse to go to the hall the door to glitskys office was open he sat at his desk and appeared to be buried in paperwork hardy walked in with his briefcase in one hand and some hot tea in the other and the lieutenant sat back and graciously accepted the offering the two men hadnt talked since the day of the verdict and sarah and graham had not hit the gossip mills yet by then now of course they had abe carefully sipped at the scalding liquid why dont you get the door he asked conversationally god i love the sound of that when they were good and alone he took another sip i guess you didnt know about evans and your client hardy kept a straight face what about them glitsky moved some paper around i suppose you thought that if id known they were an item i might have been a little skeptical about her professional opinion regarding his guilt or not might not have sent her out to investigate other innocent civilians with my blessing george wasnt all that innocent besides graham wasnt guilty the jury said so the lieutenant went to his tea decided to say a few more words she was a good cop she had to be to get here but you dont sleep with your suspects i never have but id agree its good advice glitsky nodded again this was pointless what happened between evans and graham russo hadnt been hardys doing it was galling that hardy had possibly hell probably hell definitely known all about it for months and hadnt mentioned a thing to glitsky but then glitsky realized that a part of it perhaps the biggest part was his own fault it wasnt hardy whod cut off the communication theyd always had it was himself he sipped more tea settled back into his chair and this visit today is about i honestly thought youd never ask surprise glitsky said its a cop tool hey that reminds me knock knock glitsky shook his head no no really come on humor me one time knock knock glitsky hesitated another second there was no getting around hardy hed just sit there with his shiteating grin and keep repeating knock knock until he got an answer he growled it out all right jesus whos there interrupting cow interrupting co mooo in a major victory for the defense hardy got glitsky to crack a tenth of a smile all right the lieutenant said that wasnt bad i see youre playing with your kids again how are they i ought to bring orel by actually with the trial over now and the first hectic weeks of school out of the way his kids were giving him a period of joy last night good as it had been was becoming almost typical vincent actually preferred that hardy tuck him in nowadays rather than frannie and miraculously hed been home a lot of nights to do just that it seemed to make a difference to the boy dad being around with some regularity rebecca continued to be his darling anytime hardy said they love orel but now to the singular purpose of this particular business call he grabbed his briefcase and pulled it up to his lap unsnapping the clips it was the first time hed opened it since hed left graham and sarah in the parking lot yesterday afternoon he couldnt help laughing somehow probably while hardy was busy helping with loading the boxes yesterday in the parking lot graham had slipped sals belt into his briefcase what glitsky sat forward in his chair wanting to know hardy was just a bundle of laughs today it wasnt natural he pulled it out among the contents of sal russos safe what is it its a belt abe whats it look like in sal russos safe hardy nodded we just got it out of the evidence lockup yesterday whats it doing in your briefcase hardy avoided that you wouldnt believe the stuff i accumulate in here glitsky held out his hand hardy stood and passed the belt over the desk you want it he asked keeping the joke running maybe itll fit you the lieutenant wasnt smiling what was this evidence of nothing we never used it though of course you checked it out hardy cocked his head suddenly glitsky was interested and that made him interested of course before they tool belts they call them blanks this is one of them anyway theres no tannery mark except that e punch in the back nobody i talked to knew what that stood for not even freeman and freeman knows everything best we could come up with was a friend of sals was going to make him a belt and the old man picked out the blank then the other guy never got around to it glitsky stared across at him the scar had gone pale across his lips a sign of tension it might not be anything he said but north beach station all their stuff they punch esomething on it just like this north beach station is e the north beach police station no glitsky shook his head fire a line drawn from the hall of justice to hardys office on sutter street would almost intersect the administrative offices of the main fire station on golden gate avenue hurriedly grabbing a cab uptown hardy couldnt help but notice and thought it provocative that that same line would probably cut through both mario giottis chambers and the living room in sal russos apartment escaping his attention until this moment it was after all an imaginary line now he couldnt shake the conviction that this might be the axis around which the russo case revolved it had gotten late he wasnt sure how he did finally return the storageroom key then ran into some attorneys outside the municipal courtrooms who wanted to talk about the case buy him some drinks which he refused then jeff elliot appeared outside the reporters room on the third floor of the hall and another forty minutes or so went away he tried to keep a lid on what he was thinking knowing that unless you wanted to leak something specific or start a rumor and that wasnt his intention now it wasnt a good policy to speculate to newspaper reporters now somehow it was nearly five oclock he was relieved that he had made it to the building before the main fire department offices would close a bright sun flirted with the tops of twin peaks but the day itself continued truly cold the biting wind of the previous afternoon had picked up steam and an attitude coming across the sierra nevada mountain range erasing the last memories of indian summer hardy hurriedly thrust some bills at the cabbie briefcase in hand he half ran two at a time up the wide steps leading into the building in the lobby the lateafternoon glare against the polished righthand wall was blinding shading his eyes he found the office he wanted on the opposite wall and walked in for a city office the place appeared to run very well hardy was approaching the counter when a uniformed young black woman saw him stood up at one of the desks came around it and asked if she could help him this might be unusual he said but id like to know if you can identify something for me he took out the belt and placed it on the counter picking it up she turned it over once or twice noted the e stamp on one side put it back down this is a hoseandladder strap she said as if she saw one every day and maybe she did we use em to wrap up gear on the trucks this ones stamped by north beach station whered you get it hardy kept it vague a friend of mine had it he said he gave it to me i thought i might make it into a belt the woman laughed this old thing youd have to cut off half of it first repolish it get it tooled this had been glitskys second point which hardy felt he should have seen much earlier the belt was far too big for graham or for hardy and sal had been a wiry old man what had made hardy think it would fit him that it was a belt in the first place the woman was turning it in her hand again then snapped it a time or two besides its pretty brittle she said your friend must have had it a long time did he say where he got it i think he found it left behind at a fire scene hardy said forgot to return it she gave him another smile obviously assuming that hardys friend was himself that guilt over the stolen strap had finally caught up with him i dont think north beach would use it anymore you might as well hang on to it or i could just throw it away here it wont make much of a belt ill bring it back to him hardy said maybe its got sentimental value she gave him a dubious look handed the strap back to him maybe is that all you need i think so would north beach know where they lost this or when i dont know that you could go and ask them maybe they keep some kind of inventory of losses something like that stations do things differently but that thing is old id be surprised hardy was wrapping it around his hand he slipped it off and put it back into his briefcase snapping the clips me too there was nothing else to say well thank you youve been a big help he walked back out into the lobby took a few steps and came to a stop for a moment he considered turning around and going right back down to glitskys office since grahams release sal russos death was again an unsolved homicide and in theory abe ought to be interested in any evidence related to it except that now thanks to hardys efforts the entire city believed the story that graham had killed his father out of mercy nobody except possibly graham himself sarah and hardy nobody was looking for a killer anymore the case although technically still open and unsolved was concluded to everyones satisfaction even to glitskys subliminally aware that people were beginning to stream out of the elevators and offices around him at the end of the workday hardy felt strangely rooted to where he was he didnt want to lose his train of thought if he was going to bring up anything about this case with an eye to another suspect he would need a lot more than this hoseandladder strap but he did have an idea where he might get just that first hed go back down to the chronicle and reexamine the archives related to the fire at giottis grotto it might have been months before the date on the wrapped money but months after all this elapsed time was close enough without the strap any connection between that fire and sal was a tenuous stretch with it hardy thought he had a causal link that was compelling it was damn near conclusive of something he just couldnt put his finger on exactly what it was he would turn sarah loose on it too she wouldnt share any of glitskys reluctance whoever had killed sal russo was her enemy her mans torturer and sarah was going to bring that person down if she could could it have been giotti hardy visualized the affable and brilliant jurist he could though it was a big maybe imagine the judge helping sal kill himself as hardy had argued that graham had try as he might though and much as the symmetry appealed to him he couldnt see giotti murdering sal not struggling with his oldest friend who was now a feeble old man then knocking him out fatally injecting him with morphine and that hardy reminded himself is precisely what had happened regardless of the story hed made so convincing to the jury to the city at large far to the west the sun finally kissed twin peaks then abruptly dropped below them downtown fell into shade as though somebody had drawn the blinds the glare that had been bathing the lobby off the polished wall vanished the startling sudden dimness the transformation in the feel of the cavernous room pulled hardy blinking from his thoughts automatically it seemed his eyes went to the wall etched marble with gilt inlay here were the names of those whod died fighting fires in the city since before the great earthquake and fire of the lobby had mostly cleared echoing footsteps from behind him muffled voices carrying from a great distance hardy stood transfixed a premonition tickling at the edges of his consciousness he moved a step closer to the wall focusing down from his wide angle another step feeling it somehow before he recognized anything it was here and then suddenly jumping out appearing as out of a magic eye poster there it was he blinked again now forcing himself to slow down to make sure of what he was seeing randall one letter at time he told himself dont miss one and get it wrong not now g okay stop and make sure he raked the name slowly left to right palmieri it was just a name on a wall but he knew that it was more much more it was the key to everything randall palmieri could have died in or for all hardy could be sure but he was certain that wasnt the case his bones and heart knew that palmieri had died in november of fighting the fire that had burned down the grotto he retraced his steps back to the fire departments door but it was closed now locked up timing he thought lifes little reminder that you couldnt control a damn thing he looked at his watch fiveten he was furious at the efficient office hed admired fifteen minutes before he bet the fire department opened punctually at nine too all but running now he descended the front steps and hailed another cab insane frustration the chronicle archives were also closed for the day by the time he arrived there from a pay phone across the street he placed a call to jeff elliot who he hoped would be working late in the basement jeff always worked late he worked early he worked all the time hardys plan was that he would give jeff the scoop first the columnist would be satisfied with that it was the way things were done but of course jeff wasnt in hardy didnt even leave him a voice mail message he wanted answers now hed waited long enough without giving it much thought he got the number of the federal courthouse another government office sure to be closed and found that it was he got a recording which didnt mean that no one was working in the building all right perhaps the receptionists and some secretaries had gone home but hardy knew the law business and it was an absolute certainty that the judges offices at the federal courthouse were little beehives of activity even as he stood here shivering graham had told him that while hed been clerking for harold draper there had been times when he hadnt gone outside the building for three days in a row so someone was there his instincts were telling him to slow down now fate was lobbying to make him stop nobody was around the message was loud and clear this wasnt the propitious moment it wasnt meant to be he should stop and think about the implications of all his discoveries and hunches and methodically follow things up tomorrow and the next day and the one after that but he was so close so close he felt it suddenly he couldnt wait it was right here and it would escape if he gave it the chance he couldnt do that rather than fight for another parking space he legged it down mission a couple of blocks freezing now in the stiff gale jaws clenched he told himself that all his working out over the past months was finally paying off he made it to the courthouse in under five minutes this time he was unmoved by the immensity of the building the solid bronze doors that extended to over twice his height the iron lanterns that had come from some florentine palace these doors as hed expected were closed but there was the other entrance by the gate to the parking area in front of the lions arms in the alley the security guard had seen it a hundred times here was some frantic lawyer whod missed a deadline waving him over wanting to get into the building perhaps have his brief accepted although it was half an hour late the odds of that he knew were slim and none is judge giotti still in id like to see him business hours are over im afraid this isnt strictly business its not court business is the judge a friend of yours the lawyer seemed to think about it maybe he was a friend of the judges and didnt want to presume on it no he said he asked me to keep him up on the progress of a case of mine ive got a few things to tell him about the guard looked hardy up and down the rule was when in doubt dont the judges got a lot of their work done after the formal workday and all of them hated being interrupted but if this guy was a friend of giottis of course if he were a friend hed have a private number on the other hand he wasnt pushing really though he was cold right at the moment and probably wouldnt mind being inside you want to wait a sec ill go check with his office see if anybodys there they wouldnt even take a message graham didnt have a high regard for the denizens of the federal courthouse in any case but even he was surprised that no one had come down to talk to hardy apparently they were busy hardy had cooled off figuratively since striking out with giottis office too he was back on sutler street at his desk graham had come up on his summons it wasnt much after six in the middle of the week and the gristmill was humming along nicely hardys original inclination was to get graham to help him do some research on this ancient fire situation he could use sarahs help too but in the middle of venting his frustrations hardy had changed his mind he wouldnt be giving anything else away in this case until hed narrowed it down somewhat if the fire had been important in grahams life hardy would give him the opportunity to talk about it but if it hadnt he didnt want graham and sarah asking around indiscriminately raising warning flags for whomever he was hunting this investigation now finally was something hardy felt he had to keep under his own close control the outline of what he sought was still fairly nebulous he reminded himself that jeanne walsh had never heard of sal russo her mother joan singleterry had never mentioned him perhaps even grahams joan singleterry had never been joan palmieri he had to get all that straight first graham had picked up his darts and threw the first one bullseye he almost didnt seem to notice whyd you want to see giotti hardy kept it vague that painting of sals it got me thinking i wanted to ask him again about the grotto fire do you remember much about it graham shook his head i was fifteen if you couldnt bat it or throw it it didnt exist for me the fire obviously made an impression on sal thats just the way he was diz things affected him he threw another dart got another bullseye that painting to me its the loss of innocence in general the fires just another symbol the ruined boat in the foreground the boy with the broken pole you notice all the garbage in the water hes painting the thing out in the garage while he and mom are breaking up think about it its impressionistic its his whole world breaking up youre probably right hardy said after graham left he tried calling jeanne walsh again she hadnt bought an answering machine since yesterday or if she had shed neglected to plug it in it wasnt his night he was going home when he opened the door to his house it was almost eerily silent and he listened for a minute then called out frannie furtive noises from the back of the house frannie kids dads home in seconds he was in the kitchen anybody here muffled giggling at least recognizable as benign from farther back he walked through the master bedroom and into vincents which had been transformed into an impenetrable maze of blankets pillows ropes strung from bed to chairs to bookshelves he lifted up one of the blankets and looked under hey guys rebecca held a finger to her lips shh wheres mom he whispered i dont know shh this was not hardys favorite answer but since a game was obviously in progress he didnt want to be a spoilsport so he stood up and turned around mr hardy hi it took him a moment this was mary their babysitter having come out of hiding from wherever what was she doing here is frannie all right he asked foolishly the girls face was all confusion i guess so werent you meeting her someplace thats what she said it was all coming back to him it was wednesday night date night he was picking frannie up at the shamrock at seven his mind in its dance of frustration and speculation had spun that little fact out of its galaxy hed not so much forgotten as absolutely misplaced the information he looked at his watch seventwenty and gave mary an apologetic grin sorry to break in on you like this my brains turned to mush ive got to use the phone they were at stagnolas hardy and frannie never ate on the wharf although the food was often wonderful it was just such a tourist place with traffic hassles and exorbitant parking rates there were dozens of other spots offering great food in the city tonight though hardy felt as though he needed to be here he also felt like hed traveled a hundred miles in the past threeplus hours from the hall of justice to the fire department main office back to the chronicle then the jog to the federal building and back his office driving his own car all the way across town to his home in the avenues almost to the beach now halfway back downtown to the shamrock to meet the longsuffering frannie until at last he was settled at his table chianti poured tucking into an antipasto plate pepperoncini salami mortadella provolone artichoke hearts olives caponata hot sourdough rolls by the basket heaven shed given him several rations of grief since hed finally arrived to pick her up no i understand lots of times ill get caught up in things around the house and forget that you exist too then ill snap my fingers and go oh thats right dismas et cetera since hardy felt he basically deserved it hed let her go on except now it had all wound down she was holding his hand over the table glad they were together he had to tell her bounce it off her see where he didnt have it right she listened carefully then went another way i think you should turn it over to the police what exactly whatever youve got let them go with it give it to abe this is what he does dismas but hardy was shaking his head no its not hes got to have a murder a case how about sal russo doesnt he count sure he counts but i dont have any proof of anything that would get him involved all ive got is this hoseandladder belt a fire in this place eighteen years ago a dead fireman who might or might not have been at this fire and fifty thousand dollars so what nobody stole that from sal as a matter of fact he had it when he died or graham did which is the same thing frannie sipped wine but you think theyre related a nod theyve got to be ive just got to find out where a few things connect just he shrugged all im saying is you might want to run it by abe have him look up this palmieri call the woman in eureka hassle a sitting federal judge he knew abe knew he didnt have enough abe wont do it not yet maybe not ever frannies point was well taken though and in a day or two after hed secured his inferences thats exactly what hed do he had no desire to get close to cornering a murderer that was police work it could be very unhealthy but he didnt yet think it was giotti or rather he didnt want to think it was giotti although he was convinced that the judge had some information that would move things along information that whether he knew it or not hed somehow kept out of hardys scrutiny thats all he needed to talk to him the waiter had earlier introduced himself as mauritio he was one of those personable talkyourearoff swarthy and handsome older men in a tuxedo that youre either in the mood for or not now he came up to ask them about their dinner hardy broke his most disarming smile squeezed frannies hand gently cueing her to be cool she gave him a warning look as if she wouldnt be does judge giotti still eat here all the time oh yeah theyre in here a couple of times a week for lunch he and his wife you a friend of the judges he pointed at the chianti that bottles on the house i dont know if hed call me a friend im a lawyer but hes a good judge he raves about the food here hardy motioned down at his empty plate this antipasto hes right hes a great guy the best mauritio replied did i hear this place used to be in his family yeah long time ago used to be giottis grotto mauritios tired face took on a little more life believe it or not i used to bus tables back then hardy shamelessly flattered the man before they had child labor laws frannie squeezed his hand dont pile it on too thick so you must have known sal russo too mauritios brow darkened briefly but cleared when hardy explained that he was the lawyer whod gotten sals son off well damn mauritio said that bottle is on us that was good work poor sal pray to god my son could do what his son did i ever need it whats your name again they went through the introductions then hardy asked if sal had been around during the grotto years oh yeah he and the judge they were like this two fingers together salmon sal a shake of the head a wistful tone what happened to him huh but at least it was over fast any more time on the street something worse might have happened hardy shot a look at his wife went back to mauritio what do you mean oh you know at the end the last few months the guy was a real pain last time i snuck him a lunch here back in the kitchen he wound up wanting to fight me over some bet we must have made twenty years ago i didnt even remember it something about roberto clemente for christs sake so i break him the news that robertos been gone awhile and suddenly hes all over me i owe him a large one hes gonna kick my ass mauritio smiled over at frannie scuse me the language its all right her brilliant smile if i hadnt heard it before i wouldnt know what it meant would i hardy figured mauritio was halfway to abiding love for his wife he was going on anyway the poor guy he makes a scene i kick him out so hes yelling at me by the back door says he gonna tell all the guys im a welsher and i just made the guy a free lunch he shook his head in commiseration you knew he couldnt help it you couldnt hold it against him but you didnt want him around it was probably better he went out when he did his boy did him a big favor after dinner a couple more questions so the grotto it burned down or something to the ground saddest night of my life nobody could believe it why not he shrugged i mean the old man the judges father fire was what scared him most we had more hydrants and safety systems than anybody then the one time we need em they dont work worth a damn its a universal law hardy said whered it start a sigh kitchen they think then just took off one of the fireman died even horrible well he clapped his hands lightly hey enough of this you folks eat good i see the judge ill tell him you came by as soon as frannie had taken the kids out the door to school he was at the kitchen table with his wideranging if temporary amnesia yesterday he was almost surprised that hed remembered to throw jeanne walshs telephone number into his briefcase but he had she picked up on the second ring there was no baby noise in the background and she sounded more relaxed mrs walsh this is dismas hardy again the lawyer from san francisco sure the reward i remember might as well feed her the sugar first thats what im calling about the reward may not be out of the picture id like to ask you a couple more questions if i may do you have a minute i hope so brittanys down for a nap shes really pretty good most of the time i dont know why she was so cranky yesterday maybe shes teething hardy was right back with her to the days of infancy when there was nothing else in life but your child and its health and habits even the prospect of a reward while possibly interesting couldnt hold a candle im sure shes wonderful hardy said but i did want to ask you about your mother you said when she was in san francisco she was joan palmieri was that her maiden name or was she married before a nervous laugh didnt i say that no i guess not yeah she was married to my dad my natural father not ron hardy was getting confused with all the names ron ron singleterry but palmieri palmieri was my own maiden name okay he thought getting there and was your dads first name randall randy yes how did you know and he was killed in a fire at giottis grotto in yeah that was my father i was just a baby then well four or five i must have been but i dont really remember him thats why we moved back up here mom wanted to start over i think it was probably a good idea it worked out pretty well for her ron was a good guy hardy had been taking notes writing it all down but you still dont remember anyone named sal russo no i thought about it all last night i tell you i even called my sister but she didnt remember it either hardy was closing in on it sal had referred to joan singleterrys children plural not to her child and now that was confirmed do you have other family jeanne no well i mean my own family johnny and brittany but otherwise theres just my sister margie margie sanford now okay one or two more if you dont mind how about mario giotti that name do you know him she laughed i will if we need to you dont need to youre doing fine the reward doesnt depend on you knowing mario giotti thats a relief because i dont never heard of him nope sorry me too hardy thought but hed gotten a lot more than hed have dared hope for even a couple of days before he ran more names at her brendan or debra mccoury graham russo george russo leland and helen taylor everybody he could think of he almost said david freeman you just never knew she didnt know any of them he told her to hang tight she appeared to be the child of the joan singleterry they were seeking hed get back to her but what was the connection how had sal known joan he poured himself a cup of espresso working the possibilities randy palmieri had been killed in the fire at the grotto the grotto had been owned by the giotti family until a few months after it burned down a mysterious fire that had eluded a stateoftheart detection and sprinkling system started in the kitchen and wiped out the whole place sal russo had kept a memento of that fire with him until he died as well as fifty thousand dollars in cash wrapped and dated a few months later on the personal side sals marriage had ended at about the same time he no longer felt noble or special or whatever it was hed always felt no longer had the heart to stand up to the forces represented by leland taylor he didnt deserve helen and their wonderful children anymore she was right to cast him off he wouldnt even try to see his children anymore he had more than failed he had fallen and in the present sal was more and more living in his past where now perhaps he could undo his past sins repay his past debts reclaim his old love it was happening now all of this his life and it made sal as mauritio had said a pain in the ass perhaps more than that as his mind slipped away as he forgot what he was supposed to keep hidden and secret as he remembered what hed promised to forget perhaps sal had become a danger at the fire department office the same efficient woman helped him the hoseandladder strap was something else wasnt it mild chagrin hed been caught in his fib i really hate to admit this he said but the truth is that im a lawyer i was trying to be slick its an occupational hazard it rolled right off her so it wasnt your friends belt no he got serious i found this out since last night i believe the strap came from a fire that killed a man randall palmieri hes on your wall out there i wondered if i could talk to your widows and orphans person find out a little how that works you can just keep talking to me she said im the information officer i want to verify the identity of the mans offspring theres a substantial reward involved i think maybe they could use it if a fireman dies on the job i suppose theres some kind of pension or settlement the woman nodded palmieri hardy nodded and spelled it for her randall g ill be right back he waited at the counter for about five minutes at which time she returned with a black binder sorry that took so long she said i wanted to ask my boss how confidential this stuff was she shrugged i cant give you addresses or anything without a court order but if you give me a name i can tell you if its here thats all you said you needed hardy would have to take what he could get essentially yes randall palmieri he repeated she opened to the page and waited hardy didnt need his written notes his wifes name was joan and she moved to eureka and married a ron singleterry she had two children jeanne and margie since married with different names the woman nodded thats what i have do they still get the pension the daughters no the benefit ends with the death of the spouse so theyre not getting any money anymore any help not from us the woman was still looking down at the page then came up at him i dont see how this could hurt if you want more information theres a trust listed here crossreferenced the singleterrys may have been getting money from it too on top of the pension maybe theyd be free to tell you more about it okay thanks wheres this trust located she read it out its called the bgg memorial trust of its administered lets see oh its only a couple of blocks away at baywest you could probably walk right over he didnt want to see anyone least of all either david freeman or graham russo but both of them were hanging around the lobby when he got to his building at a little after eleven there was no avoiding them but he could try to keep it short and sweet he put on his best harried air ostentatiously looked at his watch im running through hereguys on the way to someplace else ive got an appointment at lunch big dollars david youll be proud of me at last phyllis looked disapprovingly over her bank of phones too much noise hardy ignored her but graham you might want to call your brother and sister advise them not to go spending their inheritance money weve got a real lead on joan singleterry ill tell you all about it later he kept moving toward the stairs climbing graham tailed behind him but thats what i wanted to tell you hardy stopped turned graham was brushing by him two steps at a time i left it in your office feigned outrage you broke into my office at the top of the stairs graham grinned back down at him itd be harder if you locked it the young man was excited clearly hed found something we would have called you last night but it was after ninethirty we figured you old guys were already asleep get out of my way graciously still beaming graham let hardy open his own door he crossed to the desk and in the middle of the blotter found a large article stapled together from an old copy of the chronicle nineteen eightyeight while he read graham was filling him in so we had all these boxes mostly just junk and paper taking up room sarah thought we ought to go through everything in them page by page throw away everything we didnt want clean the place up hardy glanced up at him and i think i live a wild life going to bed at ninethirty and all i didnt say it was all we did anyway sarah found that it was one of those followup stories the papers sometimes run what happened to or life after this one concerned the patchedtogether lives of six women whose husbands had been killed doing their jobs in the prime of their lives a construction worker two cops a racecar driver a charter pilot and randy palmieri fireman this guys wife joan palmieri graham was saying she moved to eureka and married a man named ron singleterry and her husband i notice was killed in the grotto fire shes got to be our joan singleterry graham said she is graham went mute for a beat you know about her a little thats what i wanted to tell you about the only thing is graham said i called information in eureka she isnt listed theres no singleterry there no palmieri either no hardy thought but theres a walsh and a sanford and you dont need to know that right now well he said its someplace to start look ive really got to run well get to it later but graham this close to something didnt want to let him go wait a minute what did you find same thing different story chronicle archives im going to see if i can talk to mario giotti today see how sal was connected to the fire at the grotto if he was you dont think sal started it by mistake do you got drunk or something no hardy said honestly no i dont think that but at last he now knew the mechanism by which sal had come to know joan palmieris married name he knew as he would say how it was all connected mr hardy judge mario giotti had not shrugged himself out of his robes although he was alone reading in his chambers hardy didnt think this was an unintentional oversight the trappings of power and authority you said it was an emergency i am sorry to bother you judge and thanks for seeing me i know youre busy if i didnt see people when i was busy id never see anybody the strong smile you want to sit down hardy went to the seating arrangement by the ornate fireplace with its electrical heater purring within it against the bitter day the wind had brought in a low blanket of cloud cover and as hardy in a trench coat had been walking from his office to giottis it had started to mist he got right to it judge ive got a big problem id assumed that what is it hardy considered his response he wanted to blurt out its you but he had to restrain his tendencies he had to box him in until there was no escape im afraid its about the fire at your restaurant again ive come upon some information that leads me to think sal had something to do with it giotti leaned back in his wing chair fingertips templed at his lips go on you remember that morning i stopped you on your run out back here in the alley and asked you if you knew anybody named singleterry of course at that time i was hiding some information from the public keeping it out of the trial because it seemed so inherently not credible and what was that hardy outlined sals request to graham that he give the money to this singleterry woman since we didnt have her i didnt believe anyone in the courtroom would believe the story so we decided not to bring it up it does seem like a reach giotti agreed now i gather youve found her almost hardy said her daughters the judge took that in that would be good then wouldnt it you could find out what you need about sal thats true ive done that joan singleterrys first husband was randy palmieri giottis face seemed by degrees to be growing darker now the black circles under his eyes becoming more pronounced the jowls heavier as his chin went down resting on his chest he let out a long breath and came back to hardy the man who died in the fire a nod thats right you knew him who he was of course the names forever burned into my memory it was a tragedy how could i not know it i dont know i dont suppose you could but then by the same token im afraid i dont understand how you could forget the name singleterry but singleterry wasnt her name how would i hardy couldnt make himself listen to it anymore he had to cut him off because judge your trust the bgg thats your trust isnt it bruno giottis grotto memorial trust it sent her money for seventeen years im just having a hard time seeing how that could have slipped your mind giotti was nodding repeatedly his eyes on the middle distance between them after a long minute he got up and crossed the room back to his desk stared above it out the window into the gray mist i remember thinking i liked the way your mind worked mr hardy maybe that was misguided now youre implying i had something to do with that fire arent you with arson and murder finally he turned around im afraid im too busy for this its arrant nonsense id be glad to hear your explanation giottis nostrils flared i dont need to give you any explanation mr hardy like everyone else in america i am innocent until proven guilty if youve got some proof of these outrageous accusations why dont you bring it to the attention of the police right now this interview is over he pointed at the door you know your way hardy stood up but instead of moving toward the door he assumed an atease position in front of his chair i dont think so clearly unaccustomed to anything less than immediate obedience at any display of his authority giotti stiffened i said get the hell out of here he reached for the telephone ill have you removed you dont want to do that hardy said calmly im not talking about a twentyyearold fire im talking about sal russo giotti gently replaced the receiver what about him the fifty thousand dollars the judge waited somehow it came from the fire i dont know exactly how it got into sals hands but the police are going to want to find out theyre going to see a connection between you and sals death maybe a motive for you to have killed sal i dont have to tell you this you think i killed sal i dont think sal was ready to die when you injected him that makes it murder youre out of your mind hardy didnt care about the judges transparent denial i want to know what happened i dont have to go to the police this is for me im not going away until i find out no i dont suppose you would giotti went around behind his desk pulled out his chair and sat down on it this palmieri person died in a fire at my fathers restaurant weve helped take care of the family you denied knowing the name thats consciousness of guilt the judge shrugged we like to keep our charity anonymous perhaps you see a crime there i dont think many other people would certainly not the police he picked up the telephone again now do i call security or do you leave on your own this was highstakes poker and the judge was calling his bluff but giotti had already tipped his hand hardy wouldnt still be here if he didnt have winning cards he did and he knew it now he was going to raise youd better call in the troops he said im not going anywhere not on my own power after everything youve already put me through you think im going to let this go giottis eyes were a black glare you son of a bitch his hand was still on the telephone hardy kept his voice low calm security comes here theyll have to file a report it all gets official were not there yet though are we the glare never wavered whats stopping it me thats all and youre offering me some kind of what im not offering you anything judge i want to know what happened im an officer of the court if i have to go to the police i will if i dont have to he left it unsaid giotti glowered another moment then picked up his telephone and hardy feared he had lost giotti would call in some political chits among the honchos the police would at best cursorily look into hardys information and decide that a respected federal judge had done no wrong hardy was yet another unscrupulous meddling defense attorney looking for more headlines ready to slander a beacon of the legal community if it would get him a few more clients and then of course theres the newspaper he said giotti took in the last warning made his decision and pushed a button on the telephone he waited then asked his secretary to hold his calls replacing the receiver he looked across at hardy do you want to know what happened or do you want to go to homicide youre not going to get both not from me and whatever happens it looks as though im going to need some legal counsel giotti reached under his robes took out his wallet and pulled a bill from it do you want to be my lawyer mr hardy giotti was offering him a fivedollar retainer if hardy accepted it every word between them would then be subject to the attorneyclient privilege he could never take it to the police this was hardy thought truly faustian he reminded himself though that in the eyes of the law justice had already been done no one else was looking for the murderer of sal russo he had to know still he hesitated giottis voice though he never raised it cut at him do you honestly think youre going to find physical proof of a fire that occurred almost eighteen years ago proof that would stand up at trial the insurance company looked pretty hard before they paid out you can believe me again the tone shifted impatience command now you can come over and take this bill or you can walk out of here one way youll know and the other you wont its your call hardy crossed the room giotti still seated watched him all the way the bill was lying on the desk between them and hardy picked it up and put it into his pocket all right counselor said the judge now sit down and let me tell you a story lets say the grotto was having a tough time tourism was down the restaurant business is always skin of your teeth anyway then lets say one day we get a notice from the state about inadequate handicap access weve got to build a ramp renovate the lobby to make a long story short weve got to lay out say fortyfive thousand dollars to bring the place to code or theyre going to shut us down now lets also say the owners son is a young attorney with political aspirations but he still works in the kitchen sometimes he loves it back there hes all conflicted about his career where its going what hes doing so he keeps his hand in at the restaurant and then suddenly it looks like the business is going belly up because theres no place the owners are going to find thirty or forty thousand dollars for handicap upgrading so this smart kid he comes up with this smart idea if theres a small fire controlled starts say in the kitchen does a little damage but basically its so the insurance can cover the renovation lets say the young attorney has a good friend his oldest and best friend call him sal who owns a boat moored right out behind the place and these guys are out fishing together night fishing they do it all the time when the fire starts they dont get back in till the skylines ablaze the attorneys thinking its impossible the fire could spread the place is rigged so it could never burn up theres backup systems on the backup systems but maybe he didnt figure on the grease in the kitchen maybe it got too hot too fast anyway whatever the place goes up but a guy dies a fireman by mistake sweetfaced young guy two little kids pretty wife theres no evidence of arson it looks like one of the pilot lights caught some grease that had dripped down one of the service staff must have left an apron near the stove and not that anybodys really asking but the two friends alibi each other they werent anywhere near there all night they were out under the bridge knocking down the halibut they got a boatload of fish to prove it giotti was leaning back in his oversized chair his hands crossed over his middle he sighed wearily lets say something like that happened counselor you going to try and take that to trial hardy was too wired for any games although he knew giotti was absolutely correct there was no evidence here anymore murder might have no statute of limitations but to convict you still needed more than hed ever be able to produce any physical evidence of the fire was long gone sals rocksolid alibi and giottis went that way to the grave with him joan singleterry was dead even the insurance companys investigators had found no wrongdoing there was no chance no police department would waste a minute on it but there was more hardy felt he needed to know how do you think somebody like sal could have gotten ahold of fifty thousand dollars in cash in this scenario it could have been part of the insurance money a payoff you mean to keep quiet a show of gratitude maybe maybe a little of both giotti shrugged lifes complicated and sal couldnt handle the guilt could he he killed somebody an innocent man a guy just like himself wife and kids and it ruined him another shrug hardy dug into his pocket and removed the bill placed it on the desk were out of hypothetical now judge and youre not my client anymore you killed sal didnt you no i didnt do that because hed started talking about it didnt he he was back in the past telling people about the fire wasnt he i didnt kill him giotti repeated i dont believe you the judge pulled the bill back toward him centered it in front of him i dont care what you believe mr hardy sal was my best friend he saved my whole life my career everything and he suffered terribly for it really lost everything you think after that after all he went through for me im going to reward him by killing him i dont think you had any choice well youre wrong the fire was a tragedy an accident a mistake ive tried to make it up to that poor family as well as anybody could to sal too we stuck together even if he sometimes made it a little hard on me i never would have killed him dont you understand that never under any conditions id have gone down myself first he didnt get out of giottis until after three and then unable to refocus hed walked to the chronicle building gone to the archives and read every story he could find on the fire on palmieri on giotti by now the rain was falling steadily and he had walked back uptown to his office in the thick of it there he discovered that in the past two days hed collected twentyone call slips and his voice mail ran to over ten minutes there was no question graham russos trial had given his career a shot in the arm even if at the moment he couldnt imagine that anyone would want to pay for the services of a bumbling moron such as himself where had he gotten everything wrong what had he missed he had to put that all of it out of his mind the day hadnt been a total failure he had found joan singleterry and her connection to sal russo her kids were going to get the money whoopee his biggest problem he had trouble even phrasing it to himself he didnt quite disbelieve mario giotti the judges vehemence and passion at the end of their discussion about sals role in his life had struck a resonant chord and suddenly hardy had lost the conviction that giotti was lying killing sal was beyond giottis pale he had never intentionally killed anyone he had been trying to make moral restitution to the victims of the one accidental death technically a murder but certainly unintentional hed been involved with he was not a coldblooded man a man who would kill with premeditation even if his victim was already on the verge of death that distinction would be critical to him his lifes work in the law could never let him forget it so who had killed sal his office had grown dark and he flicked on his greenshaded bankers lamp guilt over his unanswered messages didnt just gnaw at him it was taking huge bites he was going to have to miss dinner get caught up frannie would deal with it possibly would relish some time away from his intensity besides theyd had a date just the night before a wonderful family dinner with friends at home the night before that he had to do some billable work business development something worthwhile frannie had been able to tell from the tone of his voice that he needed to feel as though hed accomplished something before he came home it almost didnt matter what it was she told him shed be fine shed wait up she had a book she was loving shed kiss the kids for him and oh she almost forgot some potential client had called a little earlier and frannie had said hardy would be working late in his office shed given his office number so he might expect a call but now nearly three hours later there hadnt been one he wouldnt wait around for it it would come later or it wouldnt over the past few hours hed been subliminally aware that the associates downstairs were going home their muffled voices carried up the stairs as they passed through phylliss lobby in twos and threes on their way out by a little after ninethirty hed made all of his return phone calls mostly to various answering machines although he had held the hand of one of his prospective new doctor clients and flatly turned down handling two divorces he was now doing some substantive preparation taking notes on a stack of recent briefs that had been filed in various federal courts on the righttodie issue because he preferred his bankers lamp to the overheads he was working almost completely in the dark the green glass shade cast a soothing pool of light over his desk somehow it helped his concentration he sat back in his chair closed his eyes briefly the building was quiet outside the wind gusted and threw some raindrops against his window reminding him that it was still coming down he got up stretched crossed back to his window and looked down on sutter nearly deserted at this hour one dark car was parked directly across from him but otherwise the curbs were empty the rest of the street shone darkly streetlights reflecting off the wet surfaces he returned to his desk pulled his yellow legal pad toward him grabbed a copy of another published brief and stopped he really ought to go home he could do this notetaking anytime it was late on a miserable night he felt hed finally paid himself back for the wasted daytime hours although he couldnt say hed accomplished much the buildings night bell sounded this in itself was mildly surprising since the only people who would normally be coming to the office at this hour would be nightowl associates who had their own keys it was unlikely that it was a client especially since hardy was all but certain that he was the last person in the building probably he thought it was one of the citys homeless whod wandered up the small stoop to get out of the rain pressed the lit button by mistake but it sounded again and he decided hed better go check the lighting in the hallway outside of his office was on dim on the stairway the same thing the cavernous lobby ceiling had a few feeble pinheads of light it was dark as a movie theater hardy descended the curving main staircase and got to the circular marbled alcove at the bottom turning the dead bolt in the heavy wooden doors he pulled the door open no one was there he stepped out onto the sidewalk to look no one squinting through the rain at the car parked across the way he couldnt see anybody in the front seats the back windows appeared to be darkly tinted he couldnt make out anything through them enough of this he was going home first back upstairs to his office where hed pack his briefcase and then out of here out the front door again down to the parking garage under the building home the back door to the giottis car swung open it had been essential to ring the bell to find out if anyone else was in the building also to be sure that the thirdfloor light was hardy it didnt look as though there was anyone else still working but at a time like this one couldnt be too sure there were no lights left on in the lowerfloor offices when the bell rang the second time the person working upstairs got up came all the way down opened the front door and stepped out onto the sidewalk it was hardy all right though not exactly the welldressed version that he presented to the court whose picture had been all over the newspapers his sound bites on the news this was the working attorney tie undone coat off collar open but even from across the street there was no mistaking him there were shadows now moving in his office hed gone back up there now the thing to do was ring the bell again wait for him this time until he opened the door again then do the thing hardy was just going to finish these last three pages otherwise hed have to go back and reread the first twelve again to catch up to his place in the brief to where he was now if he wanted to reboard the papers train of thought now the opening pages were still clear enough in his memory the syllogistic rhythm of the argument unbroken he went right back to the spot where hed left off picked up his pen read a few words there was a sound his head came up and he listened carefully there couldnt be a sound there was no one in the building and hed locked the door behind him or had he suddenly he couldnt remember if hed turned the dead bolt back it didnt matter really since he was going back down almost immediately but maybe no hed locked it he was pretty sure hed be done here in two minutes anyway and he was hed heard no other noise although lost in his reading hurrying now to finish scribbling the odd note he was not likely to have heard one anyway finally he finished the brief closed it back to its cover put down his pen and leaned back in his chair he looked up a silhouette was outlined in the doorway to his office mr hardy hardys hand was over his heart jesus christ did i startle you im sorry no thats all right as soon as i land ill be fine your wife said youd be working late i thought its all right his breath was coming back howd you get in here was that you who rang the bell yes he took another lungful of air whered you go nobody answered so i went back to my car then i must have looked away for a minute i saw the front door closing behind you then you moving around up here through the window and i got out to try again but this time the door was open okay hardy said okay but im afraid its a little late i was just finishing up here going home im sorry i can walk you back down and well make an appointment for tomorrow hows that she stepped into the room hardy noticed that the strap to her purse was around her neck and that she was holding her purse in front of her with both hands or rather that one hand was in the purse the other holding it im afraid that wont do hardy started gathering his papers pushed away from the desk started to stand up well im afraid its going to have to sit back down please something in her voice he looked back up shed moved another step closer and pulled the purse away down to her side her other hand held a small gun and she trained it levelly on him you dont know who i am do you no maam but youve sure got my attention my name is pat im judge giottis wife im really sorry to be meeting you like this youre sorry hardy thought but he said nothing pat giotti made some clucking sound you and mario had a long talk today he told me all about it yes maam we did but he hired me as his lawyer he may have told you and i cant repeat anything he said to me its attorneyclient privilege a dry mirthless chuckle i know all about that mr hardy i also know it has no real teeth i know all the ways its been abused i wasnt planning to abuse it no im sure you werent not now but something could happen someday the point is i cant be positive about it and unfortunately thats what i have to be hardys brain was on fire trying to find a way out in a last desperate spurt of mental energy before it was silenced forever but no ideas came other than to keep her talking if he could were you this polite to sal before you hit him her voice was tight with tension i dont think rudeness serves any purpose i didnt want to hurt sal i dont think i did hurt sal no hardy thought only killed him but she was going on but he would have hurt us he would have ruined everything nobody seems to understand that even mario didnt always saying sal was harmless sal was his old friend a good guy well let me tell you mr hardy sal was out of control he wasnt going to stop on his own somebody had to stop him and it didnt matter that was the amazing thing he only had a few months anyway he was dead in a couple of months at the most i know hardy said so what happened that you had to do anything keep her talking think think you really dont know mario didnt tell you this a bitter laugh its so typical hes always doing things like this leaving it for me to clean up after him tell me hardy said in her calm hysteria she kept the gun trained on hardys chest her body shifted its language terrifying he thought she would pull the trigger now that it was over he sucked in a breath there was that bomb scare that day friday a little before lunchtime you knew about that of course he nodded when they cleared the building the courthouse mario was out in the alley with his staff suddenly sal is there pulling him aside all in a panic telling mario hes got to get the money together the money isnt in his safe hes thinking mario took it back somehow he tells him if he doesnt get it back hes going to spread the word about the fire he wont keep quiet any longer she lowered her voice but not the gun dont you see mr hardy he would have destroyed marios name which is all we have all weve worked for all these years marios reputation with his peers and to let that senile bum threaten it no he had to be stopped i couldnt let him bring mario down sal wasnt anybody he was dead anyway so your husband called you after he went back inside she nodded he thought sal had simply misplaced the money taken it out of the safe put it somewhere else and forgotten where so he went back up to sals room with him to look for it can you believe the risk he took doing that anyone might have seen him and remembered then when mario couldnt find any money sal went off at him mario yelled back another tumbler fell into place blues testimony before her nap the male voice in sals apartment it had been giotti after all but his wife was going on the gun still trained on hardys chest after he got back to his chambers he called and told me what had just happened and still he tried to tell me it was all right sal was just having a bad day how could he believe that how could he not see so what did you decide to do i didnt know exactly not when i left to go there something though i was going to stop him i brought this gun with me just in case but then there was the morphine out on the table so much quieter and cleaner i knew how to administer injections one of my children is diabetic i knew to put it in the vein there was this heavy whiskey bottle sal never felt anything i just knocked at his door and he let me in and we talked a minute just like you and me now and everything was there laid out for me as though god wanted me to do it wanted to help me with a jolt of terror hardy realized that hed led her to her moment god had provided in this case as well the building empty except for him the open door the cover of darkness for her escape it would be her second perfect crime he thought of a final question does your husband know it wasnt really a laugh it was too derisive mario how could i tell him hes a good man a judge he believes in justice he doesnt understand that sometimes you have to act not pass some abstract judgment so what does he think happened that it was just his good luck he believes it was graham i think you convinced him for which i thank you this was her closing statement hardy could feel it the notion came to him an instinct far less than a thought or an idea there was no time to analyze how good it was in despair his last effort trying not to give it away with his upper body he moved his foot under the desk and kicked a leg of it producing a wooden thud this was going to have to be fast if he was to have a prayer what was that she had to take her eyes off him for an instant if he could make her do that maybe you forgot to lock the downstairs door behind you too her head began to turn and only slightly it was going to have to be enough hardy lunged for his bankers lamp as she fired he went rolling with it over then off the desk the lamp crashed to the floor plunging the room into darkness as the sound of more gunfire exploded in his ears and he knew in the blinding flash of pain god hed been hit a third shot another it was his leg below the knee here came another shot she wasnt wasting any time he felt her steps on the floor the vibrations through it she was coming toward him as he lay the only light now with the lamp broken and it wasnt much came from the dimmers in the hallway outside his door fighting the shock and pain he pulled his back up against the wood and the cover the desk barely provided when he looked up her form was there above him even in the darkness he could see the arm coming down he was on his side his back pressed against the side of the desk with no hesitation she fired again the lick of flame across his belly he didnt want to die like this aiming for a last shot to finish him she finally made a mistake coming too close she was now within his reach and he grabbed for her near foot catching her at the ankle bringing his other hand up around her leg he pulled as hard as he could twisting her foot as he did she screamed and fell in a heap next to him the gun hit the floor and went off again he couldnt risk letting go of her leg even for a second but began pulling himself up her struggling body arm over arm he could feel a weakness spreading in him but he couldnt give in to that he had to manage to hold on to her she was pounding her fists on his head and shoulders screaming at him no no no rolling over onto something hard he felt the gun and grabbed for it getting it into his hand then rolling away ive got the gun he said dont move its over no she kicked out in his direction it wasnt over for her she wasnt going to let him take her not alive the shadow of her came at him with all her strength hit him full in the chest knocking him backward again grabbing for the gun his leg as he tried to kick her off him wouldnt do what he asked it to when he twisted to get at her his stomach stabbed at him he screamed involuntarily at the pain but she was a wild animal over him scratching at his face lunging for the weapon in his left hand he had no other option his strength and mobility were ebbing away he snapped the gun up feeling it connect with flesh and bone the side of her head it stunned her briefly and without any reflection he brought the gun up again connected with flesh and she collapsed to the floor he had to get to a light a phone get some distance on her with all he had left he pushed her off him then wasnt sure he could get up at all his leg wasnt responding his stomach prevented any turning of his torso but he had to pulling himself up by the corner of the desk he finally got his dead leg pulled over to his doorway and hit the light switch pat giotti was already moving again coming to dont dont move he gasped at her she was wearing black spandex leggings and a black nylon windbreaker and there was blood his blood he realized all over her he couldnt get a breath hyperventilating he kept the gun trained on her as he hobbled his way across to the desk again knocking the receiver off he pushed picked the receiver up again stay back it was all he could get out but shed gotten to her knees now again less than five feet from where shakily he stood he had the telephone receiver in one hand the gun in the other when the operator answered hardy started to say his name consciousness was fading he gasped to try to fill his lungs at that moment she leapt at him again for the gun over the desk hed been wounded twice and had lost a deal of blood already and she had only been stunned and now seemed to have regained all of her strength with the adrenaline driving her it was considerable when she hit him full body across the chest he collapsed again under her both of her hands were on the gun now as she struggled to wrest it from him twisted it back and got hold of it she swung it around hardy saw the black hole of the barrel center on his face a last desperate grip going to her wrist bringing his other hand up trying to slap it away all the way around the gun fired and she screamed her body arching back youve shot me oh god im shot the hand holding the gun went to her shoulder but she managed to keep hold of it falling forward onto hardy to keep him from moving she jammed the weapon forward into the flesh under his jaw she pulled the trigger click again click an anguished groan and pat giottis body already collapsed on top of him went limp hardy pushed to roll her off him shed been hit in the shoulder she wasnt going to die from it he struggled got himself up to the telephone he mumbled something tried to get out his name and address it sounded funny though indistinct he tried again shooting fading fast darkness closing in hurry he blacked out sarah stood before glitskys desk the door closed behind them she was waiting for the boom to be lowered since the verdict on graham and then with the attack on hardy and the resulting rumors and revelations about the giottis the russo case continued to enthrall the public the feeding frenzy for the tiniest bits of news surrounding the principals had continued unabated over the weekend a television reporter trying to make the connection between craig ising and grahams income had interviewed ising and stumbled upon the information that sarah had been with graham at his softball tournament on the weekend after hed been indicted this had made the news last night and her lieutenant had summoned her into his office first thing this morning the last straw i dont have any excuse sir i did it i was there glitsky sat behind his desk looking up at her he didnt want to hear this not only was it grounds for dismissal from the force but harboring a fugitive was a felony all i can say is that i was sure graham hadnt committed any crime and i didnt harbor anyone i had him turn himself in didnt i turn himself in you had a man wanted for murder and you decided not to arrest him thats not your decision to make sergeant yes sir i realize that i was wrong the grand jury had indicted him yes sir she didnt have to go on about the political circus surrounding that indictment glitsky knew it as well as she did now he opened his desk drawer thought a minute slammed it closed the poa police officers association doesnt want you fired of course theyre telling me theyll sue the department first woman in homicide all that crap i hope you realize that if you were a man youd be out of here evans stuck out her chin with all respect sir if i were a man this wouldnt be news it would never have come up it would have gotten buried glitsky snorted you really think that yes sir no offense ive seen it happen several times the lieutenant took that in if you wanted to step down on your own you could save everybody a lot of trouble it would make a lot of trouble for me sir ive worked hard to get here and i deserve to be here glitsky looked long and hard at the sergeants face she had made a tremendous error in judgment but she still had the spine independence and intelligence that made a great cop he considered his words with care you know sergeant this detail homicide its not heaven you dont get here and then stop i didnt say he held up a hand you said you deserved to be here you earned it well thats true you did but you dont just earn it and thats the end of it you continue to deserve to be here every day every single day or you leave thats the gig sarah took the rebuke stoically he was found innocent lieutenant he didnt kill anybody nothing like this is ever going to happen to me again graham didnt even get disbarred she paused considering then added were going to be married glitsky opened the drawer again looked down at the scratch hed prepared and signed off on the formal charges hed planned to send to the chief all at once he realized he wasnt going to do that he pushed the drawer closed and brought his eyes up to hers im happy for you he said there were days in the next few weeks before he finally found out for sure when hardy wondered if it had all been worth it he had had to know what had happened with sal russo and the knowledge had nearly killed him the gash that the second bullet had traced across his middle was a constant reminder of how close it had been another inch and a half and the slug would have ripped through both lungs and his heart he knew he still wasnt finished with the nightmares the last click under his jaw was burned into his psyche he would jolt awake as often as not drenched in sweat and lie there in bed next to frannie until he finally gathered the strength to rise to limp through his darkened house look in on both children rearrange the elephants sit in the chair in his living room in the dark and still with everything hed suffered hed been lucky the leg wound had passed cleanly through his calf muscle his doctor assured him that hed be able to jog his fourmile loop again within six months although his longjump career was probably effectively over concentration although improving was still a problem he would be sitting with frannie or the kids and suddenly go blank seeing the gun leveled at him the perfect black little o he saw it now at nearly noon on a tuesday in the middle of october and he jerked his head up he was in the solarium trying to follow an article in one of the law journals about some new natural death hospice care facilities that were apparently operating within the law in oregon and montana and maybe several other states he was making notes on arguments that might help his doctor clients here in san francisco although it was beginning to look as though dean powell was going to accept very reasonable nolo pleas fines and light community service which hardys clients were doing anyway for most of them hardy had checked with the licensing board and already had a promise that the doctors would be allowed to continue to practice freeman had told him that under the circumstances hardy might even do better hell hed said you could probably get a letter of apology but neither hardy nor his doctors some of whom had recently discovered that political grandstanding had consequences in the real world were willing to push their luck hardy liked to think that the trial of graham russo had made the attorney general rethink his hardline position on assisted suicide if nothing else powell had come to realize that his earlier push for prosecution of these doctors was politically unpopular and if it wasnt going to win votes the ag wasnt interested in it hardy was sitting up straight with his back against his chair he told himself that the bandages around his chest were good for his posture any slouching was intolerable there was a comforting and familiar buzz in the lobby behind him associates coming and going phones ringing he looked out through the glass into the enclosed garden area where some pigeons were enjoying the sunshine hardy was going to be all right except that now his chest was an agony of itching from where theyd shaved him where the last scabs were falling away he tensed his calf and felt the familiar stab of pain it too was healing he supposed but it wasnt done yet he went back to his article david freeman brown bag in hand knocked at the solarium lintel walked right in and began unpacking he pulled out a couple of wrapped sandwiches a large bottle of pellegrino water little plastic glasses and a jar of marinated artichoke hearts i took the liberty he said unwrapping the white butcher paper mortadella sourdough provolone brain food hardy pushed his journal to the side i thought that was fish fish too freeman said he had finished unwrapping the sandwich spreading the paper out under it making it neat pushing it over in front of hardy he poured some pellegrino into one of the glasses and placed it in front of him too this kind of solicitude from freeman was unusual and hardy glanced over at him what he said what what dont give me that david freeman left his own sandwich unmolested still wrapped in front of him he sat back they cut a deal with the judges wife pratt accepted a plea hardy threw a disbelieving glance at the old man what do you mean she accepted a plea what plea manslaughter on sal russo three years assault with a deadly weapon on you three years concurrent no additional time for the gun for a second the room tried to come up at hardy diz assault with a deadly weapon it was attempted murder david she tried to kill me she did kill sal russo and what do you mean no additional time for the gun freeman let out a long breath cracked a knuckle it seems mrs giottis been under a lot of stress lately imagining that russo was a threat to her husbands career and that you somehow were part of this giant conspiracy imagining she told me her husband and russo had started a fire that killed a fireman she told me shed killed russo to shut him up she told me she was going to kill me so i couldnt talk about it nodding freeman went along with him yes indeed my son quite mad wasnt she imagining all these terrible things about her husband and some fire but giotti hardy stopped himself he couldnt say and that realization choked him what the judge denies everything and her doctors confirm that shes imagining it so we all know it never happened except of course for some nastyminded columnists freeman eyed hardy shrewdly unless someone knew something admissible that could actually pin the arson on giotti you wouldnt know anybody like that would you diz no i thought not if you did im sure at the very least youd want to tell your old pal david but hardy knew he could never tell freeman or anybody else what giotti had told him under the seal of the attorneyclient privilege it had been the worst five dollars hed ever earned i dont know anything david the old man nodded i believe you but you know with pratt not exactly being in love with you to begin with the fact that you couldnt provide any more information on giotti didnt make her want to throw the book at his wife after all the judge still has some influence you cross him at your peril pratt knows that youre lucky she didnt charge you for trying to kill her maybe the fact that it was her gun that she brought hardy made a face never mind that what about powell wont he do anything freeman shrugged why would he and anyway he cant double jeopardys still a nono both crimes you and sal they both happened in pratts jurisdiction and shes charged and prosecuted them end of story fingertips to his temples hardy was trying to make his headache go away so whats she going to serve giottis wife freeman shook his head in commiseration you havent heard the best part the judge has just stayed her delivery to the prison system postponed it i know what stayed means but how for how long indefinitely shes going to do her time in the county jail close to home hardy finally exploded jesus christ david this wasnt some shoplifting spree no judge could do that well this one must know giotti and he just did and since pratt thinks its a swell idea no ones going to object well i damn well object but you my son are the proverbial person that nobody asked i hate to mention it diz but youve made a few enemies youre not even the player to be named later hardy took it stoically it wasnt too great a shock but he was curious about pat giottis sentence so how much time you really think shell do a couple of years plus or minus freeman trailed off shes going to be a model prisoner get an early release so what about all this hardy vaguely indicated himself what did i do this for freeman took a huge bite of his sandwich and chewed awhile thoughtfully he drank some pellegrino water you won your case your clients free you got yourself a passel of new work this wasnt much satisfaction hardy had to ask so im shot twice and almost killed and the person who did this gets a few months in the country club thats it what happened to justice here freeman nodded took another sip of water shrugged justice i think it went on vacation stagnolas was packed with the thursday lunch crowd october was high season for tourists in san francisco and fishermans wharf swarmed with them getting off the ferries walking up from pier down from ghirardelli square mario giotti had been overwhelmed with his wifes legal troubles over the past weeks it had shocked and dismayed him to learn that she had killed sal but certainly once it became clear that she had the next order of business was damage control which given his influence and connections hadnt proved too difficult the community his brethren had closed ranks around him as he knew they would pat and thank god she was still alive had even come to agree with his decision about their story shed been under too much stress with the accusations sal had been making against her husband and had cracked under the pressure there had been a fire at the grotto certainly but nothing like a coverup nothing that could come back to haunt the judge and mar his reputation in fact if anything the judges anonymous contributions over the years to the family of randall palmieri were signs of his generosity and beneficence throughout his attorneys negotiations with sharron pratt giotti had feared that dismas hardy would step up and ruin everything but evidently hed put the fear of god into the man should he take it upon himself to abuse the attorneyclient privilege the state bar would rise in righteous indignation and lift his license to practice law giotti never considered that hardy was simply a man of honor that he had entered into a contract and would keep his word giotti did wonder if hardy had leaked something of their privileged discussion to the columnist jeff elliot but he had no way to prove it and no way to accuse hardy of anything without implicating himself elliot had come pretty close to what had happened but hadnt gotten it exactly right and that in turn made giotti think that hardy had kept it close to the vest after all the reporter had dug and gotten lucky but didnt have all the pieces so the rumors had flown for a few days but they died down he hadnt even deigned to issue any kind of formal denial everything was going to work out fine this was his city he belonged here people loved him and always would and now here was his old friend mauritio at the front door greeting patrons as they filed in because of all the troubles then having to decide some cases on the circuit in idaho and then hawaii giotti hadnt been to his old psychic home back to his roots in nearly a month now he arrived at the door hey mauritio his hale and voluble welcome his old friend his old employee drew himself up the smile fled from his face good afternoon your honor he said formally giotti cocked his head to one side a question he still wore his smile mauritio whats the matter you look like you seen a ghost maybe i do your honor giotti knew it felt wrong but tried to make a joke of it well invite him in he can sit at my table with me im sorry your table hey my table he started to push his way by but mauritio stepped in front of him you got a reservation your honor we got a packed house in here today giotti raised his voice what do you mean you got a packed house im talking my table what do you he noticed that people had started to gather behind them to notice he couldnt have that he calmed himself no i dont have a reservation mauritio clucked hey im sorry your honor maybe some other day maybe you call first couple of hours ought to hold one meanwhile you might try next door but theyre pretty crowded too in fact judge maybe you gonna have trouble finding fish anywhere on the wharf since sal russo died maybe you gonna have trouble finding good fish anywhere around here stiffly giotti stood a moment then he nodded and turned away behind him he heard mauritio barking to a knot of tourists hey how you folks doin come on in come on in were saving a table just for you the wind was high off the ocean rushing up the cliffs and inland across the peninsula bending the cypresses nearly to the ground a chill autumn sun was sinking into the water out at the horizon and a young couple stood before a grave site at the ridge of the colma cemetery the man wore a baseball uniform graham had played in the seasons last tournament down in santa clara during the day the hornets had gotten beaten on their third game so graham was finished early he and sarah had decided to drive over to the coastal town of santa cruz and have a late lunch then up the coast on highway one and then suddenly in colma theyd made the turn into here graham had distributed the proceeds from the sale of the baseball cards and the fifty thousand dollars to jeanne walsh and her sister in eureka and in spite of the reactions of his brother and sister felt hed discharged a debt of honor hed gotten a letter from lelands lawyer on behalf of the other heirs telling him he couldnt give away their inheritance and that the singleterry offspring had no legal claim graham had told them to go ahead and sue him and distributed the money in cash anyway it was perhaps something neither debra nor george would understand but that was going to be their problem and their burden afterward to her credit debra had called to tell him it was okay she wasnt going to be part of any lawsuit george might bring graham saw hope here he had no similar illusions about his brother or his mother george and helen would live and die in lelands camp at a level of physical comfort and social constriction that was their choice it wasnt his he went to one knee and smoothed at the grass over where his fathers remains were buried hed taken his spikes up with him wearing them over his shoulders with the laces tying them together now as though they were a holy necklace he removed them over his head and placed them by the headstone on the grass dont say maňana if you dont mean it sarah said softly she was quoting from an old jimmy buffett song one of the cuts on a cd theyd been playing ever since the verdict cheeseburger in paradise cowboy in the jungle themes of freedom and rebellion rum and sunshine after his time in jail the tunes seemed to help graham with normalcy hed get there but hanging up the spikes was a different symbol a different type of commitment he stood looking down for a last moment i mean it he said hand in hand sarah and graham turned to walk down the hill sarah sighed theres one thing i still dont understand even after all of this what all the paper the notes the names what about them well i must have made a hundred calls maybe more following up checking addresses trying to break the code i reached maybe half a dozen people who remembered your father at all and none of them were involved in fishing or baseball or gambling or anything else that related to anything i just dont get it all those names sal wrote down all those numbers theyd gotten back down to the parking lot and grahams steps slowed then came to a stop sarah waited it was everybody he ever knew he didnt want to forget the wind gusted stinging his eyes he thought if he wrote it all down he stood motionless overcome with emotion sarah took a tentative step and put her arms up around him sal sat at the kitchen table writing furiously in the margins of the newspaper in front of him one of the obituaries was earl willis and the name had started a trail of connection sal had already been to see finer and he knew what was coming he wasnt telling anybody what he knew he wasnt going to have anybody pity him no sir the kid whod sat next to him in third grade was named earl willis was he the guy that had just died a noncatholic earl willis that was his name sal remembered now who sat behind earl he had to remember what was her name dorothy something that was it blake dorothy blake closing his eyes he tried to envision his old classroom the map of the world tacked above the blackboard miss gray that was it his teacher miss gray now how about his other teachers he wasnt going to forget those names he was going to have them right here written down in case anybody asked in case he forgot and his assistant coach on grahams little league team the jaguars yep jaguars sal remembered the guy smoked like a chimney always had a cigarette tucked in his ear a pack in the arm of his tshirt what was that name he knew it he knew he knew it it just wasnt coming but he had that pad of paper by his bed in case it came to him tonight hed write it down then no one would know that he was forgetting hed have it all right here but wait what about the other kids on grahams team he remembered the shortstop kenny frazier good glove no hit he was out of newspaper margin miss gray the other teachers the jaguars but aha here was a brown bag from the grocery store he pulled it over writing fast his and helens first phone number the house on taraval he had to get that down but then the rest the rest of everything the afternoon sun poured in over him and he scribbled until the light was gone thinking that if he wrote it all down everybody and everything from the beginning maybe he would be able to retrieve it all when he needed it maybe his life wouldnt all go away maybe he would live forever john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of such novels as the mercy rule the th juror nothing but the truth and the hearing lives with his family in
