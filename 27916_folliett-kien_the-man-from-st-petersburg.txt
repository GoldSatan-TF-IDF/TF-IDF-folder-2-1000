zuckerman one cant love humanity one can only love people graham greene one it was a slow sunday afternoon the kind walden loved he stood at an open window and looked across the park the broad level lawn was dotted with mature trees a scotch pine a pair of mighty oaks several chestnuts and a willow like a head of girlish curls the sun was high and the trees cast dark cool shadows the birds were silent but a hum of contented bees came from the flowering creeper beside the window the house was still too most of the servants had the afternoon off the only weekend guests were waldens brother george georges wife clarissa and their children george had gone for a walk clarissa was lying down and the children were out of sight walden was comfortable he had worn a frock coat to church of course and in an hour or two he would put on his white tie and tails for dinner but in the meantime he was at ease in a tweed suit and a softcollared shirt now he thought if only lydia will play the piano tonight it will have been a perfect day he turned to his wife will you play after dinner lydia smiled if you like walden heard a noise and turned back to the window at the far end of the drive a quarter of a mile away a motor car appeared walden felt a twinge of irritation like the sly stab of pain in his right leg before a rainstorm why should a car annoy me he thought he was not against motor carshe owned a lanchester and used it regularly to travel to and from londonalthough in the summer they were a terrible nuisance to the village sending up clouds of dust from the unpaved road as they roared through he was thinking of putting down a couple of hundred yards of tarmacadam along the street ordinarily he would not have hesitated but the roads had not been his responsibility since when lloyd george had set up the roads boardsand that he realized was the source of his irritation it had been a characteristic piece of liberal legislation they took money from walden in order to do themselves what he would have done anyway then they failed to do it i suppose ill pave the road myself in the end he thought its just annoying to pay for it twice the motor car turned into the gravel forecourt and came to a noisy shuddering halt opposite the south door exhaust fumes drifted in at the window and walden held his breath the driver got out wearing a helmet goggles and a heavy motoring coat and opened the door for the passenger a short man in a black coat and a black felt hat stepped down from the car walden recognized the man and his heart sank the peaceful summer afternoon was over its winston churchill he said lydia said how embarrassing the man just refused to be snubbed on thursday he had sent a note which walden had ignored on friday he had called on walden at his london house and had been told that the earl was not at home now he had driven all the way to norfolk on a sunday he would be turned away again does he think his stubbornness is impressive walden wondered he hated to be rude to people but churchill deserved it the liberal government in which churchill was a minister was engaged in a vicious attack on the very foundations of english societytaxing landed property undermining the house of lords trying to give ireland away to the catholics emasculating the royal navy and yielding to the blackmail of trade unions and damned socialists walden and his friends would not shake hands with such people the door opened and pritchard came into the room he was a tall cockney with brilliantined black hair and an air of gravity which was transparently fake he had run away to sea as a boy and had jumped ship in east africa walden there on safari had hired him to supervise the native porters and they had been together ever since now pritchard was waldens majordomo traveling with him from one house to another and as much of a friend as a servant could be the first lord of the admiralty is here my lord pritchard said im not at home walden said pritchard looked uncomfortable he was not used to throwing out cabinet ministers my fathers butler would have done it without turning a hair walden thought but old thomson is graciously retired growing roses in the garden of that little cottage in the village and somehow pritchard has never acquired that unassailable dignity pritchard began to drop his aitches a sign that he was either very relaxed or very tense mr churchill said youd say not at ome my lord and e said to give you this letter he proffered an envelope on a tray walden did not like to be pushed he said crossly give it back to him then he stopped and looked again at the handwriting on the envelope there was something familiar about the large clear sloping letters oh dear said walden he took the envelope opened it and drew out a single sheet of heavy white paper folded once at the top was the royal crest printed in red walden read buckingham palace may st my dear walden you will see young winston george ri its from the king walden said to lydia he was so embarrassed that he flushed it was frightfully bad form to drag the king into something like this walden felt like a schoolboy who is told to stop quarreling and get on with his prep for a moment he was tempted to defy the king but the consequences lydia would no longer be received by the queen people would be unable to invite the waldens to parties at which a member of the royal family would be present andworst of allwaldens daughter charlotte could not be presented at court as a debutante the familys social life would be wrecked they might as well go and live in another country no there was no question of disobeying the king walden sighed churchill had defeated him in a way it was a relief for now he could break ranks and no one could blame him letter from the king old boy he would say in explanation nothing to be done you know ask mr churchill to come in he said to pritchard he handed the letter to lydia the liberals really did not understand how the monarchy was supposed to work he reflected he murmured the king is just not firm enough with these people lydia said this is becoming awfully boring she was not bored at all walden thought in fact she probably found it all quite exciting but she said that because it was the kind of thing an english countess would say and since she was not english but russian she liked to say typically english things the way a man speaking french would say alors and hein a lot walden went to the window churchills motor car was still rattling and smoking in the forecourt the driver stood beside it with one hand on the door as if he had to hold it like a horse to stop it from wandering away a few servants were gazing at it from a safe distance pritchard came in and said mr winston churchill churchill was forty exactly ten years younger than walden he was a short slender man who dressed in a way walden thought was a shade too elegant to be quite gentlemanly his hair was receding rapidly leaving a peak at the forehead and two curls at the temples which together with his short nose and the permanent sardonic twinkle in his eye gave him a mischievous look it was easy to see why the cartoonists regularly portrayed him as a malign cherub churchill shook hands and said cheerfully good afternoon lord walden he bowed to lydia lady walden how do you do walden thought what is it about him that grates so on my nerves lydia offered him tea and walden told him to sit down walden would not make small talk he was impatient to know what all the fuss was about churchill began first of all my apologies together with the kings for imposing myself on you walden nodded he was not going to say it was perfectly all right churchill said i might add that i should not have done so other than for the most compelling reasons youd better tell me what they are do you know what has been happening in the money market yes the discount rate has gone up from one and three quarters to just under three percent its an enormous rise and it has come about in a few weeks i presume you know why churchill nodded german companies have been factoring debts on a vast scale collecting cash and buying gold a few more weeks of this and germany will have got in everything owing to her from other countries while leaving her debts to them outstandingand her gold reserves will be higher than they have ever been before they are preparing for war in this and other ways they have raised a levy of one billion marks over and above normal taxation to improve an army that is already the strongest in europe you will remember that in when lloyd george increased british taxation by fifteen million pounds sterling there was almost a revolution well a billion marks is equivalent to fifty million pounds its the biggest levy in european history yes indeed walden interrupted churchill was threatening to become histrionic walden did not want him making speeches we conservatives have been worried about german militarism for some time now at the eleventh hour youre telling me that we were right churchill was unperturbed germany will attack france almost certainly the question is will we come to the aid of france no walden said in surprise the foreign secretary has assured us that we have no obligations to france sir edward is sincere of course churchill said but he is mistaken our understanding with france is such that we could not possibly stand aside and watch her be defeated by germany walden was shocked the liberals had convinced everyone him included that they would not lead england into war and now one of their leading ministers was saying the opposite the duplicity of the politicians was infuriating but walden forgot that as he began to contemplate the consequences of war he thought of the young men he knew who would have to fight the patient gardeners in his park the cheeky footmen the brownfaced farm boys the hellraising undergraduates the languid idlers in the clubs of st jamess then that thought was overtaken by another much more chilling and he said but can we win churchill looked grave i think not walden stared at him dear god what have you people done churchill became defensive our policy has been to avoid war and you cant do that and arm yourself to the teeth at the same time but you have failed to avoid war were still trying but you think you will fail churchill looked belligerent for a moment then swallowed his pride yes so what will happen if england and france together cannot defeat germany then we must have another ally a third country on our side russia if germany is divided fighting on two fronts we can win the russian army is incompetent and corrupt of courselike everything else in that countrybut it doesnt matter so long as they draw off part of germany s strength churchill knew perfectly well that lydia was russian and it was characteristically tactless of him to disparage her country in her presence but walden let it pass for he was highly intrigued by what churchill was saying russia already has an alliance with france he said its not enough churchill said russia is obliged to fight if france is the victim of aggression it is left to russia to decide whether france is the victim or the aggressor in a particular case when war breaks out both sides always claim to be the victim therefore the alliance obliges russia to do no more than fight if she wants to we need russia to be freshly and firmly committed to our side i cant imagine you chaps joining hands with the czar then you misjudge us to save england well deal with the devil your supporters wont like it they wont know walden could see where all this was leading and the prospect was exciting what have you in mind a secret treaty or an unwritten understanding both walden looked at churchill through narrowed eyes this young demagogue might have a brain he thought and that brain might not be working in my interest so the liberals want to do a secret deal with the czar despite the hatred which the english people have for the brutal russian regimebut why tell me they want to rope me in somehow that much is clear for what purpose so that if it all goes wrong they will have a conservative on whom to put the blame it will take a plotter more subtle than churchill to lead me into such a trap walden said go on i have initiated naval talks with the russians along the lines of our military talks with the french theyve been going on for a while at a rather low level and now they are about to get serious a young russian admiral is coming to london his name is prince aleksey andreyevich orlov lydia said aleks churchill looked at her i believe he is related to you lady walden yes lydia said and for some reason walden could not even guess at she looked uneasy he is the son of my elder sister which makes him my cousin nephew walden said i didnt know he had become an admiral lydia added it must be a recent promotion she was her usual perfectly composed self and walden decided he had imagined that moment of unease he was pleased that aleks would be coming to london he was very fond of the lad lydia said he is young to have so much authority hes thirty churchill said to lydia and walden recalled that churchill at forty was very young to be in charge of the entire royal navy churchills expression seemed to say the world belongs to brilliant young men like me and orlov but you need me for something walden thought in addition churchill went on orlov is nephew to the czar through his father the late prince andmore importantlyhe is one of the few people other than rasputin whom the czar likes and trusts if anyone in the russian naval establishment can swing the czar on to our side orlov can walden asked the question that was on his mind and my part in all this i want you to represent england in these talksand i want you to bring me russia on a plate the fellow could never resist the temptation to be melodramatic walden thought you want aleks and me to negotiate an anglorussian military alliance yes walden saw immediately how difficult challenging and rewarding the task would be he concealed his excitement and resisted the temptation to get up and pace about churchill was saying you know the czar personally you know russia and speak russian fluently youre orlovs uncle by marriage once before you have persuaded the czar to side with england rather than with germany in when you intervened to prevent the ratification of the treaty of bjorko churchill paused nevertheless you were not our first choice to represent britain at these negotiations the way things are at westminster yes yes walden did not want to start discussing that however something changed your mind in a nutshell you were the czars choice it seems you are the only englishman in whom he has any faith anyway he sent a telegram to his cousin his majesty king george the fifth insisting that orlov deal with you walden could imagine the consternation among the radicals when they learned they would have to involve a reactionary old tory peer in such a clandestine scheme i should think you were horrified he said not at all in foreign affairs our policies are not so much at odds with yours and i have always felt that domestic political disagreements were no reason why your talents should be lost to his majestys government flattery now walden thought they want me badly aloud he said how would all this be kept secret it will seem like a social visit if you agree orlov will stay with you for the london season you will introduce him to society am i right in thinking that your daughter is due to come out this year he looked at lydia thats right she said so youll be going about a good deal anyway orlov is a bachelor as you know and obviously very eligible so we can noise it abroad that hes looking for an english wife he may even find one good idea suddenly walden realized that he was enjoying himself he had used to be a kind of semiofficial diplomat under the conservative governments of salisbury and balfour but for the last eight years he had taken no part in international politics now he had a chance to go back onstage and he began to remember how absorbing and fascinating the whole business was the secrecy the gamblers art of negotiation the conflicts of personalities the cautious use of persuasion bullying or the threat of war the russians were not easy to deal with he recalled they tended to be capricious obstinate and arrogant but aleks would be manageable when walden married lydia aleks had been at the wedding a tenyearold in a sailor suit later aleks had spent a couple of years at oxford university and had visited walden hall during the vacations the boys father was dead so walden gave him rather more time than he might normally have spent with an adolescent and was delightfully rewarded by a friendship with a lively young mind it was a splendid foundation for negotiation i believe i might be able to bring it off he thought what a triumph that would be churchill said may i take it then that youll do it of course said walden lydia stood up no dont get up she said as the men stood with her ill leave you to talk politics will you stay for dinner mr churchill ive an engagement in town unfortunately then i shall say goodbye she shook his hand she went out of the octagon which was where they always had tea and walked across the great hall through the small hall and into the flower room at the same time one of the undergardenersshe did not know his namecame in through the garden door with an armful of tulips pink and yellow for the dinner table one of the things lydia loved about england in general and walden hall in particular was the wealth of flowers and she always had fresh ones cut morning and evening even in winter when they had to be grown in the hothouses the gardener touched his caphe did not have to take it off unless he was spoken to for the flower room was notionally part of the gardenand laid the flowers on a marble table then went out lydia sat down and breathed the cool scented air this was a good room in which to recover from shocks and the talk of st petersburg had unnerved her she remembered aleksey andreyevich as a shy pretty little boy at her wedding and she remembered that as the most unhappy day of her life it was perverse of her she thought to make the flower room her sanctuary this house had rooms for almost every purpose different rooms for breakfast lunch tea and dinner a room for billiards and another in which to keep guns special rooms for washing clothes ironing making jam cleaning silver hanging game keeping wine brushing suits her own suite had a bedroom a dressing room and a sitting room and yet when she wanted to be at peace she would come here and sit on a hard chair and look at the crude stone sink and the castiron legs of the marble table her husband also had an unofficial sanctuary she had noticed when stephen was disturbed about something he would go to the gun room and read the game book so aleks would be her guest in london for the season they would talk of home and the snow and the ballet and the bombs and seeing aleks would make her think of another young russian the man she had not married it was nineteen years since she had seen that man but still the mere mention of st petersburg could bring him to mind and make her skin crawl beneath the watered silk of her tea gown he had been nineteen the same age as she a hungry student with long black hair the face of a wolf and the eyes of a spaniel he was as thin as a rail his skin was white the hair of his body soft dark and adolescent and he had clever clever hands she blushed now not at the thought of his body but at the thought of her own betraying her maddening her with pleasure making her cry out shamefully i was wicked she thought and i am wicked still for i should like to do it again she thought guiltily of her husband she hardly ever thought of him without feeling guilty she had not loved him when they married but she loved him now he was strongwilled and warmhearted and he adored her his affection was constant and gentle and entirely lacking in the desperate passion which she had once known he was happy she thought only because he had never known that love could be wild and hungry i no longer crave that kind of love she told herself i have learned to live without it and over the years it has become easier so it shouldim almost forty some of her friends were still tempted and they yielded too they did not speak to her of their affairs for they sensed she did not approve but they gossiped about others and lydia knew that at some countryhouse parties there was a lot of well adultery once lady girard had said to lydia with the condescending air of an older woman who gives sound advice to a young hostess my dear if you have the viscountess and charlie stott at the same time you simply must put them in adjoining bedrooms lydia had put them at opposite ends of the house and the viscountess had never come to walden hall again people said all this immorality was the fault of the late king but lydia did not believe them it was true that he had befriended jews and singers but that did not make him a rake anyway he had stayed at walden hall twiceonce as prince of wales and once as king edward viiand he had behaved impeccably both times she wondered whether the new king would ever come it was a great strain to have a monarch to stay but such a thrill to make the house look its very best and have the most lavish meals imaginable and buy twelve new dresses just for one weekend and if this king were to come he might grant the waldens the coveted entréethe right to go into buckingham palace by the garden entrance on big occasions instead of queuing up in the mall along with two hundred other carriages she thought about her guests this weekend george was stephens younger brother he had stephens charm but none of stephens seriousness georges daughter belinda was eighteen the same age as charlotte both girls would be coming out this season belindas mother had died some years ago and george had married again rather quickly his second wife clarissa was much younger than he and quite vivacious she had given him twin sons one of the twins would inherit walden hall when stephen died unless lydia gave birth to a boy late in life i could she thought i feel as if i could but it just doesnt happen it was almost time to be getting ready for dinner she sighed she felt comfortable and natural in her tea gown with her fair hair dressed loosely but now she would have to be laced into a corset and have her hair piled high on her head by a maid it was said that some of the young women were giving up corsets altogether that was all right lydia supposed if you were naturally shaped like the figure eight but she was small in all the wrong places she got up and went outside that undergardener was standing by a rose tree talking to one of the maids lydia recognized the maid she was annie a pretty voluptuous emptyheaded girl with a wide generous smile she stood with her hands in the pockets of her apron turning her round face up to the sun and laughing at something the gardener had said now there is a girl who doesnt need a corset lydia thought annie was supposed to be supervising charlotte and belinda for the governess had the afternoon off lydia said sharply annie where are the young ladies annies smile disappeared and she dropped a curtsy i cant find them mlady the gardener moved off sheepishly you dont appear to be looking for them lydia said off you go very good mlady annie ran toward the back of the house lydia sighed the girls would not be there but she could not be bothered to call annie back and reprimand her again she strolled across the lawn thinking of familiar and pleasant things pushing st petersburg to the back of her mind stephens father the seventh earl of walden had planted the west side of the park with rhododendrons and azaleas lydia had never met the old man for he had died before she knew stephen but by all accounts he had been one of the great largerthanlife victorians his bushes were now in full glorious bloom and made a rather unvictorian blaze of assorted colors we must have somebody paint a picture of the house she thought the last one was done before the park was mature she looked back at walden hall the gray stone of the south front looked beautiful and dignified in the afternoon sunshine in the center was the south door the farther east wing contained the drawing room and various dining rooms and behind them a straggle of kitchens pantries and laundries running higgledypiggledy to the distant stables nearer to her on the west side were the morning room the octagon and at the corner the library then around the comer along the west front the billiard room the gun room her flower room a smoking room and the estate office on the second floor the family bedrooms were mostly on the south side the main guest rooms on the west side and the servants rooms over the kitchens to the northeast out of sight above the second floor was an irrational collection of towers turrets and attics the whole facade was a riot of ornamental stonework in the best victorian rococo manner with flowers and chevrons and sculpted coils of rope dragons and lions and cherubim balconies and battlements flagpoles and sundials and gargoyles lydia loved the place and she was grateful that stephenunlike many of the old aristocracycould afford to keep it up she saw charlotte and belinda emerge from the shrubbery across the lawn annie had not found them of course they both wore widebrimmed hats and summer frocks with schoolgirls black stockings and low black shoes because charlotte was coming out this season she was occasionally permitted to put up her hair and dress for dinner but most of the time lydia treated her like the child she was for it was bad for children to grow up too fast the two cousins were deep in conversation and lydia wondered idly what they were talking about what was on my mind when i was eighteen she asked herself and then she remembered a young man with soft hair and clever hands and she thought please god let me keep my secrets do you think well feel different after weve come out belinda said charlotte had thought about this before i shant but well be grownup i dont see how a lot of parties and balls and picnics can make a person grownup well have to have corsets charlotte giggled have you ever worn one no have you i tried mine on last week whats it like awful you cant walk upright how did you look charlotte gestured with her hands to indicate an enormous bust they both collapsed laughing charlotte caught sight of her mother and put on a contrite face in anticipation of a reprimand but mama seemed preoccupied and merely smiled vaguely as she turned away it will be fun though said belinda the season yes charlotte said doubtfully but whats the point of it all to meet the right sort of young man of course to look for husbands you mean they reached the great oak in the middle of the lawn and belinda threw herself down on the seat beneath the tree looking faintly sulky you think coming out is all very silly dont you she said charlotte sat beside her and looked across the carpet of turf to the long south front of walden hall the tall gothic windows glinted in the afternoon sun from here the house looked as if it might be rationally and regularly planned but behind that facade it was really an enchanting muddle she said whats silly is being made to wait so long im not in a hurry to go to balls and leave cards on people in the afternoon and meet young meni shouldnt mind if i never did those thingsbut it makes me so angry to be treated like a child still i hate having supper with marya shes quite ignorant or pretends to be at least in the dining room you get some conversation papa talks about interesting things when i get bored marya suggests we play cards i dont want to play anything ive been playing all my life she sighed talking about it had made her angrier she looked at belindas calm freckled face with its halo of red curls charlotte s own face was oval with a rather distinctive straight nose and a strong chin and her hair was thick and dark happygolucky belinda she thought these things really dont bother her she never gets intense about anything charlotte touched belindas arm sorry i didnt mean to carry on so its all right belinda smiled indulgently you always get cross about things you cant possibly change do you remember that time you decided you wanted to go to eton never you most certainly did you made a terrible fuss papa had gone to school at eton you said so why shouldnt you charlotte had no memory of that but she could not deny that it sounded just like her at ten years old she said but do you really think these things cant possibly be different coming out and going to london for the season and getting engaged and then marriage you could have a scandal and be forced to emigrate to rhodesia im not quite sure how one goes about having a scandal nor am i they were silent for a while sometimes charlotte wished she were passive like belinda life would be simplerbut then again it would be awfully dull she said i asked marya what im supposed to do after i get married do you know what she said she imitated her governesss throaty russian accent do why my child you will do nothing oh thats silly belinda said is it what do my mother and yours do theyre good society they have parties and stay about at country houses and go to the opera and thats what i mean nothing they have babies now thats another thing they make such a secret about having babies thats because its vulgar why whats vulgar about it charlotte saw herself becoming enthusiastic again marya was always telling her not to be enthusiastic she took a deep breath and lowered her voice you and i have got to have these babies dont you think they might tell us something about how it happens theyre very keen for us to know all about mozart and shakespeare and leonardo da vinci belinda looked uncomfortable but very interested she feels the same way about it as i do charlotte thought i wonder how much she knows charlotte said do you realize they grow inside you belinda nodded then blurted out but how does it start oh it just happens i think when you get to about twentyone thats really why you have to be a debutante and come outto make sure you get a husband before you start having babies charlotte hesitated i think she added belinda said then how do they get out i dont know how big are they belinda held her hands about two feet apart the twins were this big when they were a day old she thought again and narrowed the distance well perhaps this big charlotte said when a hen lays an egg it comes out behind she avoided belindas eyes she had never had such an intimate conversation with anyone ever the egg seems too big but it does come out belinda leaned closer and spoke quietly i saw daisy drop a calf once shes the jersey cow on the home farm the men didnt know i was watching thats what they call it dropping a calf charlotte was fascinated what happened it was horrible it looked as if her tummy opened up and there was a lot of blood and things she shuddered it makes me scared charlotte said im afraid it will happen to me before i find out all about it why wont they tell us we shouldnt be talking about such things weve damn well got a right to talk about them belinda gasped swearing makes it worse i dont care it maddened charlotte that there was no way to find out these things no one to ask no book to consult she was struck by an idea theres a locked cupboard in the libraryi bet there are books about all this sort of thing in there lets look but if its locked oh i know where the key is ive known for years well be in terrible trouble if were caught theyre all changing for dinner now this is our chance charlotte stood up belinda hesitated therell be a row i dont care if there is anyway im going to look in the cupboard and you can come if you want charlotte turned and walked toward the house after a moment belinda ran up beside her as charlotte had known she would they went through the pillared portico and into the cool lofty great hall turning left they passed the morning room and the octagon then entered the library charlotte told herself she was a woman and entitled to know but all the same she felt like a naughty little girl the library was her favorite room being on a corner of the house it was very bright lit by three big windows the leatherupholstered chairs were old and surprisingly comfortable in winter there was a fire all day and there were games and jigsaw puzzles as well as two or three thousand books some of the books were ancient having been here since the house was built but many were new for mama read novels and papa was interested in lots of different thingschemistry agriculture travel astronomy and history charlotte liked particularly to come here on maryas day off when the governess was not able to snatch away far from the madding crowd and replace it with the water babies sometimes papa would be here with her sitting at the victorian pedestal desk and reading a catalogue of agricultural machinery or the balance sheet of an american railroad but he never interfered with her choice of books the room was empty now charlotte went straight to the desk opened a small square drawer in one of the pedestals and took out a key there were three cupboards against the wall beside the desk one contained games in boxes and another had cartons of writing paper and envelopes embossed with the walden crest the third was locked charlotte opened it with the key inside were twenty or thirty books and a pile of old magazines charlotte glanced at one of the magazines it was called the pearl it did not seem promising hastily she picked out two books at random without looking at the titles she closed and locked the cupboard and replaced the key in the desk drawer there she said triumphantly where can we go to look at them belinda hissed remember the hideaway oh yes why are we whispering they both giggled charlotte went to the door suddenly she heard a voice in the hall calling lady charlotte lady charlotte its annie shes looking for us charlotte said shes nice but so dimwitted well go out the other way quickly she crossed the library and went through the far door into the billiard room which led in turn to the gun room but there was someone in the gun room she listened for a moment its my papa belinda whispered looking scared hes been out with the dogs fortunately there was a pair of french doors from the billiard room on the west terrace charlotte and belinda crept out and closed the doors quietly behind them the sun was low and red casting long shadows across the lawns now how do we get back in belinda said over the roofs follow me charlotte ran around the back of the house and through the kitchen garden to the stables she stuffed the two books into the bodice of her dress and tightened her belt so they should not fall out from a corner of the stable yard she could climb by a series of easy steps to the roof over the servants quarters first she stood on the lid of a low iron bunker which was used to store logs from there she hauled herself onto the corrugated tin roof of a leanto shed where tools were kept the shed leaned against the washhouse she stood upright on the corrugated tin and lifted herself onto the slate roof of the washhouse she turned to look behind belinda was following lying facedown on the sloping slates charlotte edged along crabwise holding on with the palms of her hands and the sides of her shoes until the roof ended up against a wall then she crawled up the roof and straddled the ridge belinda caught up with her and said isnt this dangerous ive been doing it since i was nine years old above them was the window of an attic bedroom shared by two parlormaids the window was high in the gable its top corners almost reaching the roof which sloped down on either side charlotte stood upright and peeped into the room no one was there she pulled herself onto the window ledge and stood up she leaned to the left got an arm and a leg over the edge of the roof and hauled herself onto the slates she turned back and helped belinda up they lay there for a moment catching their breath charlotte remembered being told that walden hall had four acres of roof it was hard to believe until you came up here and realized you could get lost among the ridges and valleys from this point it was possible to reach any part of the roofs by using the footways ladders and tunnels provided for the maintenance men who came every spring to clean gutters paint drainpipes and replace broken tiles charlotte got up come on the rest is easy she said there was a ladder to the next roof then a board footway then a short flight of wooden steps leading to a small square door set in a wall charlotte unlatched the door and crawled through and she was in the hideaway it was a low windowless room with a sloping ceiling and a plank floor which would give you splinters if you were not careful she imagined it had once been used as a storeroom anyway it was now quite forgotten a door at one end led into a closet off the nursery which had not been used for many years charlotte had discovered the hideaway when she was eight or nine and had used it occasionally in the gamewhich she seemed to have been playing all her lifeof escaping from supervision there were cushions on the floor candles in jars and a box of matches on one of the cushions lay a battered and floppy toy dog which had been hidden there eight years ago after marya the governess had threatened to throw him away a tiny occasional table bore a cracked vase full of colored pencils and a red leather writing case walden hall was inventoried every few years and charlotte could recall mrs braithwaite the housekeeper saying that the oddest things went missing belinda crawled in and charlotte lit the candles she took the two books from her bodice and looked at the titles one was called household medicine and the other the romance of lust the medical book seemed more promising she sat on a cushion and opened it belinda sat beside her looking guilty charlotte felt as if she were about to discover the secret of life she leafed through the pages the book seemed explicit and detailed on rheumatism broken bones and measles but when it arrived at childbirth it suddenly became impenetrably vague there was some mysterious stuff about cramps waters breaking and a cord which had to be tied in two places then cut with scissors which had been dipped in boiling water this chapter was evidently written for people who already knew a lot about the subject there was a drawing of a naked woman charlotte noticed but was too embarrassed to tell belinda that the woman in the drawing had no hair in a certain place where charlotte had a great deal then there was a diagram of a baby inside a womans tummy but no indication of a passage by which the baby might emerge belinda said it must be that the doctor cuts you open then what did they do in history before there were doctors charlotte said anyway this books no good she opened the other at random and read aloud the first sentence that came to her eye she lowered herself with lascivious slowness until she was completely impaled upon my rigid shaft whereupon she commenced her delicious rocking movements to and fro charlotte frowned and looked at belinda i wonder what it means said belinda feliks kschessinsky sat in a railway carriage waiting for the train to pull out of dover station the carriage was cold he was quite still it was dark outside and he could see his own reflection in the window a tall man with a neat mustache wearing a black coat and a bowler hat there was a small suitcase on the rack above his head he might have been the traveling representative of a swiss watch manufacturer except that anyone who looked closely would have seen that the coat was cheap the suitcase was cardboard and the face was not the face of a man who sold watches he was thinking about england he could remember when in his youth he had upheld england s constitutional monarchy as the ideal form of government the thought amused him and the flat white face reflected in the window gave him the ghost of a smile he had since changed his mind about the ideal form of government the train moved off and a few minutes later feliks was watching the sun rise over the orchards and hop fields of kent he never ceased to be astonished at how pretty europe was when he first saw it he had suffered a profound shock for like any russian peasant he had been incapable of imagining that the world could look this way he had been on a train then he recalled he had crossed hundreds of miles of russias thinly populated northwestern provinces with their stunted trees their miserable villages buried in snow and their winding mud roads then one morning he had woken up to find himself in germany looking at the neat green fields the paved roads the dainty houses in the clean villages and the flower beds on the sunny station platform he had thought he was in paradise later in switzerland he had sat on the veranda of a small hotel warmed by the sun yet within sight of snowcovered mountains drinking coffee and eating a fresh crusty roll and he had thought people here must be so happy now watching the english farms come to life in the early morning he recalled dawn in his home villagea gray boiling sky and a bitter wind a frozen swampy field with puddles of ice and tufts of coarse grass rimed with frost himself in a worn canvas smock his feet already numb in felt shoes and clogs his father striding along beside him wearing the threadbare robes of an impoverished country priest arguing that god was good his father had loved the russian people because god loved them it had always been perfectly obvious to feliks that god hated the people for he treated them so cruelly that discussion had been the start of a long journey a journey which had taken feliks from christianity through socialism to anarchist terror from tambov province through st petersburg and siberia to geneva and in geneva he had made the decision which brought him to england he recalled the meeting he had almost missed it he almost missed the meeting he had been to kraków to negotiate with the polish jews who smuggled the magazine mutiny across the border into russia he arrived in geneva after dark and went straight to ulrichs tiny backstreet printing shop the editorial committee was in sessionfour men and two girls gathered around a candle in the rear of the shop behind the gleaming press breathing the smells of newsprint and oiled machinery planning the russian revolution ulrich brought feliks up to date on the discussion he had seen josef a spy for the okhrana the russian secret police josef secretly sympathized with the revolutionaries and gave the okhrana false information for their money sometimes the anarchists would give him true but harmless tidbits and in return josef warned them of okhrana activities this time josefs news had been sensational the czar wants a military alliance with england ulrich told feliks he is sending prince orlov to london to negotiate the okhrana know about it because they have to guard the prince on the journey through europe feliks took off his hat and sat down wondering whether this was true one of the girls a sad shabby russian brought him tea in a glass feliks took a halfeaten lump of sugar from his pocket placed it between his teeth and sipped the tea through the sugar in the peasant manner the point being ulrich went on that england could then have a war with germany and make the russians fight it feliks nodded the shabby girl said and it wont be the princes and counts who get killedit will be the ordinary russian people she was right feliks thought the war would be fought by the peasants he had spent most of his life among these people they were hard surly and narrowminded but their foolish generosity and their occasional spontaneous outbursts of sheer fun gave a hint of how they might be in a decent society their concerns were the weather animals disease childbirth and outwitting the landlord for a few years in their late teens they were sturdy and straight and could smile and run fast and flirt but soon they became bowed and gray and slow and sullen now prince orlov would take those young men in the springtime of their lives and march them in front of a cannon to be shot to pieces or maimed forever no doubt for the very best reasons of international diplomacy it was things like this that made feliks an anarchist what is to be done said ulrich we must blaze the news across the front pages of mutiny said the shabby girl they began to discuss how the story should be handled feliks listened editorial matters interested him little he distributed the magazine and wrote articles about how to make bombs and he was deeply discontented he had become terribly civilized in geneva he drank beer instead of vodka wore a collar and a tie and went to concerts of orchestral music he had a job in a bookshop meanwhile russia was in turmoil the oil workers were at war with the cossacks the parliament was impotent and a million workers were on strike czar nicholas ii was the most incompetent and asinine ruler a degenerate aristocracy could produce the country was a powder barrel waiting for a spark and feliks wanted to be that spark but it was fatal to go back joe stalin had gone back and no sooner had he set foot on russian soil than he had been sent to siberia the secret police knew the exiled revolutionaries better than they knew those still at home feliks was chafed by his stiff collar his leather shoes and his circumstances he looked around at the little group of anarchists ulrich the printer with white hair and an inky apron an intellectual who loaned feliks books by proudhon and kropotkin but also a man of action who had once helped feliks rob a bank olga the shabby girl who had seemed to be falling in love with feliks until one day she saw him break a policemans arm and became frightened of him vera the promiscuous poetess yevno the philosophy student who talked a lot about a cleansing wave of blood and fire hans the watchmaker who saw into peoples souls as if he had them under his magnifying glass and pyotr the dispossessed count writer of brilliant economic tracts and inspirational revolutionary editorials they were sincere and hardworking people and all very clever feliks knew their importance for he had been inside russia among the desperate people who waited impatiently for smuggled newspapers and pamphlets and passed them from hand to hand until they fell to pieces yet it was not enough for economic tracts were no protection against police bullets and fiery articles would not burn palaces ulrich was saying this news deserves wider circulation than it will get in mutiny i want every peasant in russia to know that orlov would lead him into a useless and bloody war over something that concerns him not at all olga said the first problem is whether we will be believed feliks said the first problem is whether the story is true we can check ulrich said the london comrades could find out whether orlov arrives when he is supposed to arrive and whether he meets the people he needs to meet its not enough to spread the news yevno said excitedly we must put a stop to this how said ulrich looking at young yevno over the top of his wirerimmed spectacles we should call for the assassination of orlovhe is a traitor betraying the people and he should be executed would that stop the talks it probably would said count pyotr especially if the assassin were an anarchist remember england gives political asylum to anarchists and this infuriates the czar now if one of his princes were killed in england by one of our comrades the czar might well be angry enough to call off the whole negotiation yevno said what a story we would have then we could say that orlov had been assassinated by one of us for treason against the russian people every newspaper in the world would carry that report ulrich mused think of the effect it would have at home you know how russian peasants feel about conscriptionits a death sentence they hold a funeral when a boy goes into the army if they learned that the czar was planning to make them fight a major european war the rivers would run red with blood he was right feliks thought yevno always talked like that but this time he was right ulrich said i think youre in dreamland yevno orlov is on a secret missionhe wont ride through london in an open carriage waving to the crowds besides i know the london comradestheyve never assassinated anyone i dont see how it can be done i do feliks said they all looked at him the shadows on their faces shifted in the flickering candlelight i know how it can be done his voice sounded strange to him as if his throat were constricted ill go to london ill kill orlov the room was suddenly quiet as all the talk of death and destruction suddenly became real and concrete in their midst they stared at him in surprise all except ulrich who smiled knowingly almost as if he had planned all along that it would turn out this way two london was unbelievably rich feliks had seen extravagant wealth in russia and much prosperity in europe but not on this scale here nobody was in rags in fact although the weather was warm everyone was wearing several layers of heavy clothing feliks saw carters street vendors sweepers laborers and delivery boysall sporting fine factorymade coats without holes or patches all the children wore boots every woman had a hat and such hats they were mostly enormous things as broad across as the wheel of a dog cart and decorated with ribbons feathers flowers and fruit the streets were teeming he saw more motor cars in the first five minutes than he had in all his life there seemed to be as many cars as there were horsedrawn vehicles on wheels or on foot everyone was rushing in piccadilly circus all the vehicles were at a standstill and the cause was one familiar in any city a horse had fallen and its cart had overturned a crowd of men struggled to get beast and wagon upright while from the pavement flower girls and ladies with painted faces shouted encouragement and made jokes as he went farther east his initial impression of great wealth was somewhat modified he passed a domed cathedral which was called st paul s according to the map he had bought at victoria station and thereafter he was in poorer districts abruptly the magnificent facades of banks and office buildings gave place to small row houses in varying states of disrepair there were fewer cars and more horses and the horses were thinner most of the shops were street stalls there were no more delivery boys now he saw plenty of barefoot childrennot that it mattered for in this climate it seemed to him they had no need of boots anyway things got worse as he penetrated deeper into the east end here were crumbling tenements squalid courtyards and stinking alleys where human wrecks dressed in rags picked over piles of garbage looking for food then feliks entered whitechapel high street and saw the familiar beards long hair and traditional robes of assorted orthodox jews and tiny shops selling smoked fish and kosher meat it was like being in the russian pale except that the jews did not look frightened he made his way to jubilee street the address ulrich had given him it was a twostory building that looked like a lutheran chapel a notice outside said the workers friend club and institute was open to all working men regardless of politics but another notice betrayed the nature of the place by announcing that it had been opened in by peter kropotkin feliks wondered whether he would meet the legendary kropotkin here in london he went in he saw in the lobby a pile of newspapers also called the workers friend but in yiddish der arbeiter fraint notices on the walls advertised lessons in english a sunday school a trip to epping forest and a lecture on hamlet feliks stepped into the hall the architecture confirmed his earlier instinct this had definitely been the nave of a nonconformist church once upon a time however it had been transformed by the addition of a stage at one end and a bar at the other on the stage a group of men and women appeared to be rehearsing a play perhaps this was what anarchists did in england feliks thought that would explain why they were allowed to have clubs he went over to the bar there was no sign of alcoholic drink but on the counter he saw gefilte fish pickled herring andjoya samovar the girl behind the counter looked at him and said nu feliks smiled a week later on the day that prince orlov was due to arrive in london feliks had lunch at a french restaurant in soho he arrived early and picked a table near the door he ate onion soup fillet steak and goats cheese and drank half a bottle of red wine he ordered in french the waiters were deferential when he finished it was the height of the lunchhour rush at a moment when three of the waiters were in the kitchen and the other two had their backs to him he calmly got up went to the door took his coat and hat and left without paying he smiled as he walked down the street he enjoyed stealing he had quickly learned how to live in this town on almost no money for breakfast he would buy sweet tea and a slab of bread from a street stall for twopence but that was the only food he would pay for at lunchtime he stole fruit or vegetables from street stalls in the evening he would go to a charity soup kitchen and get a bowl of broth and unlimited bread in return for listening to an incomprehensible sermon and singing a hymn he had five pounds in cash but it was for emergencies he was living at dunstan houses in stepney green in a fivestory tenement building where lived half the leading anarchists in london he had a mattress on the floor in the apartment of rudolf rocker the charismatic blond german who edited der arbeiter fraint rockers charisma did not work on feliks who was immune to charm but feliks respected the mans total dedication rocker and his wife milly kept open house for anarchists and all dayand half the nightthere were visitors messengers debates committee meetings and endless tea and cigarettes feliks paid no rent but each day he brought home somethinga pound of sausages a packet of tea a pocketful of orangesfor the communal larder they thought he bought these things but of course he stole them he told the other anarchists he was here to study at the british museum and finish his book about natural anarchism in primitive communities they believed him they were friendly dedicated and harmless they sincerely believed the revolution could be brought about by education and trade unionism by pamphlets and lectures and trips to epping forest feliks knew that most anarchists outside russia were like this he did not hate them but secretly he despised them for in the end they were just frightened nevertheless among such groups there were generally a few violent men when he needed them he would seek them out meanwhile he worried about whether orlov would come and about how he would kill him such worries were useless and he tried to distract his mind by working on his english he had learned a little of the language in cosmopolitan switzerland during the long train journey across europe he had studied a school textbook for russian children and an english translation of his favorite novel the captains daughter by pushkin which he knew almost by heart in russian now he read the times every morning in the reading room of the jubilee street club and in the afternoons he walked the streets striking up conversations with drunks vagrants and prostitutesthe people he liked best the people who broke the rules the printed words in books soon meshed with the sounds all around him and already he could say anything he needed to before long he would be able to talk politics in english after leaving the restaurant he walked north across oxford street and entered the german quarter west of tottenham court road there were a lot of revolutionists among the germans but they tended to be communists rather than anarchists feliks admired the discipline of the communists but he was suspicious of their authoritarianism and besides he was temperamentally unsuited to party work he walked all the way across regents park and entered the middleclass suburb to its north he wandered around the treelined streets looking into the small gardens of the neat brick villas searching for a bicycle to steal he had learned to ride a bicycle in switzerland and had discovered that it was the perfect vehicle for shadowing someone for it was maneuverable and inconspicuous and in city traffic it was fast enough to keep up with a motor car or a carriage sadly the bourgeois citizens of this part of london seemed to keep their bicycles locked away he saw one cycle being ridden along the street and was tempted to knock the rider off the machine but at that moment there were three pedestrians and a bakers van on the road and feliks did not want to create a scene a little later he saw a boy delivering groceries but the boys cycle was too conspicuous with a large basket on the front and a metal plate hanging from the crossbar bearing the name of the grocer feliks was beginning to toy with alternative strategies when at last he saw what he needed a man of about thirty came out of one of the gardens wheeling a bicycle the man wore a straw boater and a striped blazer which bulged over his paunch he leaned his cycle against the garden wall and bent down to put on his trouser clips feliks approached him rapidly the man saw his shadow looked up and muttered good afternoon feliks knocked him down the man rolled onto his back and looked up at feliks with a stupid expression of surprise feliks fell on him dropping one knee into the middle button of the striped blazer the mans breath left his body in a whoosh and he was winded helpless gasping for air feliks stood up and glanced toward the house a young woman stood at a window watching her hand raised to her open mouth her eyes wide with fright he looked again at the man on the ground it would be a minute or so before he even thought about getting up feliks climbed on the bicycle and rode away rapidly a man who has no fear can do anything he wants feliks thought he had learned that lesson eleven years ago in a railway siding outside omsk it had been snowing it was snowing feliks sat in an open railway truck on a pile of coal freezing to death he had been cold for a year ever since he escaped from the chain gang in the gold mine in that year he had crossed siberia from the frozen north almost to the urals now he was a mere thousand miles from civilization and warm weather most of the way he had walked although sometimes he rode in railcars or on wagons full of pelts he preferred to ride with cattle for they kept him warm and he could share their feed he was vaguely aware that he was little more than an animal himself he never washed his coat was a blanket stolen from a horse his ragged clothes were full of lice and there were fleas in his hair his favorite food was raw birds eggs once he had stolen a pony ridden it to death then eaten its liver he had lost his sense of time he knew it was autumn by the weather but he did not know what month he was in often he found himself unable to remember what he had done the day before in his saner moments he realized he was half mad he never spoke to people when he came to a town or village he skirted it pausing only to rob the garbage dump he knew only that he had to keep going west for it would be warmer there but the coal train had been shunted onto a siding and feliks thought he might be dying there was a guard a burly policeman in a fur coat who was there to stop peasants from taking coal for their fires as that thought occurred to him feliks realized he was having a lucid moment and that it might be his last he wondered what had brought it on then he smelled the policemans dinner but the policeman was big and healthy and had a gun i dont care feliks thought im dying anyway so he stood up and picked up the biggest lump of coal he could carry and staggered over to the policemans hut and went in and hit the startled policeman over the head with the lump of coal there was a pot on the fire and stew in the pot too hot to eat feliks carried the pot outside and emptied it out into the snow then he fell on his knees and ate the food mixed with cooling snow there were lumps of potato and turnip and fat carrots and chunks of meat he swallowed them whole the policeman came out of the hut and hit feliks with his club a heavy blow across the back feliks was wild with rage that the man should try to stop him from eating he got up from the ground and flew at the man kicking and scratching the policeman fought back with his club but feliks could not feel the blows he got his fingers on the mans throat and squeezed he would not let go after a while the mans eyes closed then his face went blue then his tongue came out then feliks finished the stew he ate all the food in the hut and warmed himself by the fire and slept in the policemans bed when he woke up he was sane he took the boots and the coat off the corpse and walked to omsk on the way he made a remarkable discovery about himself he had lost the ability to feel fear something had happened in his mind as if a switch had closed he could think of nothing that could possibly frighten him if hungry he would steal if chased he would hide if threatened he would kill there was nothing he wanted nothing could hurt him anymore love pride desire and compassion were forgotten emotions they all came back eventually except the fear when he reached omsk he sold the policemans fur coat and bought trousers and a shirt a waistcoat and a topcoat he burned his rags and paid one ruble for a hot bath and a shave in a cheap hotel he ate in a restaurant using a knife instead of his fingers he saw the front page of a newspaper and remembered how to read and then he knew he had come back from the grave he sat on a bench in liverpool street station his bicycle leaning against the wall beside him he wondered what orlov was like he knew nothing about the man other than his rank and mission the prince might be a dull plodding loyal servant of the czar or a sadist and a lecher or a kindly whitehaired old man who liked nothing better than to bounce his grandchildren on his knee it did not matter feliks would kill him anyway he was confident he would recognize orlov for russians of that type had not the faintest conception of traveling unobtrusively secret mission or no would orlov come if he did come and arrived on the very train josef had specified and if he subsequently met with the earl of walden as josef had said he would then there could hardly be any further doubt that josefs information had been accurate a few minutes before the train was due a closed coach drawn by four magnificent horses clattered by and drove straight onto the platform there was a coachman in front and a liveried footman hanging on behind a railwayman in a militarystyle coat with shiny buttons strode after the coach the railwayman spoke to the coachman and directed him to the far end of the platform then a stationmaster in a frock coat and top hat arrived looking important consulting his job watch and comparing it critically with the station clocks he opened the carriage door for the passenger to step down the railwayman walked past felikss bench and feliks grabbed his sleeve please sir he said putting on the wideeyed expression of a naïve foreign tourist is that the king of england the railwayman grinned no mate its only the earl of walden he walked on so josef had been right feliks studied walden with an assassins eye he was tall about felikss height and beefyeasier to shoot than a small man he was about fifty except for a slight limp he seemed fit he could run away but not very fast he wore a highly visible light gray morning coat and a top hat of the same color his hair under the hat was short and straight and he had a spadeshaped beard patterned after that of the late king edward vii he stood on the platform leaning on a canepotential weaponand favoring his left leg the coachman the footman and the stationmaster bustled about him like bees around the queen his stance was relaxed he did not look at his watch he paid no attention to the flunkies around him he is used to this feliks thought all his life he has been the important man in the crowd the train appeared smoke billowing from the funnel of the engine i could kill orlov now feliks thought and he felt momentarily the thrill of the hunter as he closes with his prey but he had already decided not to do the deed today he was here to observe not to act most anarchist assassinations were bungled because of haste or spontaneity in his view he believed in planning and organization which were anathema to many anarchists but they did not realize that a man could plan his own actionsit was when he began to organize the lives of others that he became a tyrant the train halted with a great sigh of steam feliks stood up and moved a little closer to the platform toward the far end of the train was what appeared to be a private car differentiated from the rest by the colors of its bright new paintwork it came to a stop precisely opposite waldens coach the stationmaster stepped forward eagerly and opened a door feliks tensed peering along the platform watching the shadowed space in which his quarry would appear for a moment everyone waited then orlov was there he paused in the doorway for a second and in that time felikss eye photographed him he was a small man wearing an expensivelooking heavy russian coat with a fur collar and a black top hat his face was pink and youthful almost boyish with a small mustache and no beard he smiled hesitantly he looked vulnerable feliks thought so much evil is done by people with innocent faces orlov stepped off the train he and walden embraced russian fashion but quickly then they got into the coach that was rather hasty feliks thought the footman and two porters began to load luggage onto the carriage it rapidly became clear that they could not get everything on and feliks smiled to think of his own cardboard suitcase half empty the coach was turned around it seemed the footman was being left behind to take care of the rest of the luggage the porters came to the carriage window and a graysleeved arm emerged and dropped coins into their hands the coach pulled away feliks mounted his bicycle and followed in the tumult of the london traffic it was not difficult for him to keep pace he trailed them through the city along the strand and across st jamess park on the far side of the park the coach followed the boundary road for a few yards then turned abruptly into a walled forecourt feliks jumped off his bicycle and wheeled it along the grass at the edge of the park until he stood across the road from the gateway he could see the coach drawn up to the imposing entrance to a large house over the roof of the coach he saw two top hats one black and one gray disappear into the building then the door closed and he could see no more lydia studied her daughter critically charlotte stood in front of a large pier glass trying on the debutantes gown she would wear to be presented at court madame bourdon the thin elegant dressmaker fussed about her with pins tucking a flounce here and fastening a ruffle there charlotte looked both beautiful and innocentjust the effect that was called for in a debutante the dress of white tulle embroidered with crystals went down almost to the floor and partly covered the tiny pointed shoes its neckline plunging to waist level was filled in with a crystal corsage the train was four yards of clothofsilver lined with pale pink chiffon and caught at the end by a huge whiteandsilver bow charlotte s dark hair was piled high and fastened with a tiara which had belonged to the previous lady walden stephens mother in her hair she wore the regulation two white plumes my baby has almost grown up lydia thought she said its very lovely madame bourdon thank you my lady charlotte said its terribly uncomfortable lydia sighed it was just the kind of thing charlotte would say lydia said i wish you wouldnt be so frivolous charlotte knelt down to pick up her train lydia said you dont have to kneel look copy me and ill show you how its done turn to the left charlotte did so and the train draped down her left side gather it with your left arm then make another quarter turn to the left now the train stretched out along the floor in front of charlotte walk forward using your right hand to loop the train over your left arm as you go it works charlotte smiled when she smiled you could feel the glow she used to be like this all the time lydia thought when she was little i always knew what was going on in her mind growing up is learning to deceive charlotte said who taught you all these things mama your uncle georges first wife belindas mother coached me before i was presented she wanted to say these things are easy to teach but the hard lessons you must learn on your own charlotte s governess marya came into the room she was an efficient unsentimental woman in an irongray dress the only servant lydia had brought from st petersburg her appearance had not changed in nineteen years lydia had no idea how old she was fifty sixty marya said prince orlov has arrived my lady why charlotte you look magnificent it was almost time for marya to begin calling her lady charlotte lydia thought she said come down as soon as youve changed charlotte charlotte immediately began to unfasten the shoulder straps which held her train lydia went out she found stephen in the drawing room sipping sherry he touched her bare arm and said i love to see you in summer dresses she smiled thank you he looked rather fine himself she thought in his gray coat and silver tie there was more gray and silver in his beard we might have been so happy you and i suddenly she wanted to kiss his cheek she glanced around the room there was a footman at the sideboard pouring sherry she had to restrain the impulse she sat down and accepted a glass from the footman how is aleks much the same as always stephen replied youll seehell be down in a minute what about charlotte s dress the gown is lovely its her attitude that disturbs me shes unwilling to take anything at face value these days i should hate her to become cynical stephen refused to worry about that you wait until some handsome guards officer starts paying attention to hershell soon change her mind the remark irritated lydia implying as it did that all girls were the slaves of their romantic natures it was the kind of thing stephen said when he did not want to think about a subject it made him sound like a hearty emptyheaded country squire which he was not but he was convinced that charlotte was no different from any other eighteenyearold girl and he would not hear otherwise lydia knew that charlotte had in her makeup a streak of something wild and unenglish which had to be suppressed irrationally lydia felt hostile toward aleks on account of charlotte it was not his fault but he represented the st petersburg factor the danger of the past she shifted restlessly in her chair and caught stephen observing her with a shrewd eye he said you cant possibly be nervous about meeting little aleks she shrugged russians are so unpredictable hes not very russian she smiled at her husband but their moment of intimacy had passed and now there was just the usual qualified affection in her heart the door opened be calm lydia told herself aleks came in aunt lydia he said and bowed over her hand how do you do aleksey andreyevich she said formally then she softened her tone and added why you still look eighteen i wish i were he said and his eyes twinkled she asked him about his trip as he replied she found herself wondering why he was still unmarried he had a title which on its own was enough to knock many girlsnot to mention their mothersoff their feet and on top of that he was strikingly goodlooking and enormously rich im sure hes broken a few hearts she thought your brother and your sister send their love aleks was saying and ask for your prayers he frowned st petersburg is very unsettled nowits not the town you knew stephen said weve heard about this monk rasputin the czarina believes that god speaks through him and she has great influence over the czar but rasputin is only a symptom all the time there are strikes and sometimes riots the people no longer believe that the czar is holy what is to be done stephen asked aleks sighed everything we need efficient farms more factories a proper parliament like england s land reform trade unions freedom of speech i shouldnt be in too much of a hurry to have trade unions if i were you stephen said perhaps still somehow russia must join the twentieth century either we the nobility must do it or the people will destroy us and do it themselves lydia thought he sounded more radical than the radicals how things must have changed at home that a prince could talk like this her sister tatyana alekss mother referred in her letters to the troubles but gave no hint that the nobility was in real danger but then aleks was more like his father the old prince orlov a political animal if he were alive today he would talk like this stephen said there is a third possibility you knowa way in which the aristocracy and the people might yet be united aleks smiled as if he knew what was coming and that is a war aleks nodded gravely they think alike lydia reflected aleks always looked up to stephen stephen was the nearest thing to a father that the boy had after the old prince died charlotte came in and lydia stared at her in surprise she was wearing a frock lydia had never seen of cream lace lined with chocolatebrown silk lydia would never have chosen itit was rather strikingbut there was no denying that charlotte looked ravishing where did she buy it lydia wondered when did she start buying clothes without taking me along who told her that those colors flatter her dark hair and brown eyes does she have a trace of makeup on and why isnt she wearing a corset stephen was also staring lydia noticed that he had stood up and she almost laughed it was a dramatic acknowledgment of his daughters grownup status and what was funny was that it was clearly involuntary in a moment he would feel foolish and he would realize that standing up every time his daughter walked into a room was a courtesy he could hardly sustain in his own house the effect on aleks was even greater he sprang to his feet spilled his sherry and blushed crimson lydia thought why hes shy he transferred his dripping glass from his right hand to his left so that he was unable to shake with either and he stood there looking helpless it was an awkward moment for he needed to compose himself before he could greet charlotte but he was clearly waiting to greet her before he would compose himself lydia was about to make some inane remark just to fill the silence when charlotte took over she pulled the silk handkerchief from alekss breast pocket and wiped his right hand with it saying how do you do aleksey andreyevich in russian she shook his nowdry right hand took the glass from his left hand wiped the glass wiped the left hand gave him back the glass stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket and made him sit down she sat beside him and said now that youve finished throwing the sherry around tell me about diaghilev hes supposed to be a strange man have you met him aleks smiled yes ive met him as aleks talked lydia marveled charlotte had dealt with the awkward moment without hesitation and had gone on to ask a questionone which she had presumably prepared in advancewhich succeeded in taking orlovs mind off himself and making him feel at ease and she had done all that as smoothly as if she had had twenty years practice where had she learned such poise lydia caught her husbands eye he too had noted charlotte s graciousness and he was smiling from ear to ear in a glow of fatherly pride feliks paced up and down in st jamess park pondering what he had seen from time to time he glanced across the road at the graceful white facade of waldens house rising over the high forecourt wall like a noble head above a starched collar he thought they believe they are safe in there he sat on a bench in a position from which he could still see the house middleclass london swarmed about him the girls in their outrageous headgear the clerks and shopkeepers walking homeward in their dark suits and bowler hats there were gossiping nannies with babies in perambulators or overdressed toddlers there were tophatted gentlemen on their way to and from the clubs of st jamess there were liveried footmen walking tiny ugly dogs a fat woman with a big bag of shopping plumped herself down on the bench beside him and said hot enough for you he was not sure what would be the appropriate reply so he smiled and looked away it seemed that orlov had realized his life might be in danger in england he had shown himself for only a few seconds at the station and not at all at the house feliks guessed that he had requested in advance that he be met by a closed coach for the weather was fine and most people were driving open landaus until today this killing had been planned in the abstract feliks reflected it had been a matter of international politics diplomatic quarrels alliances and ententes military possibilities the hypothetical reactions of faraway kaisers and czars now suddenly it was flesh and blood it was a real man of a certain size and shape it was a youthful face with a small mustache a face which must be smashed by a bullet it was a short body in a heavy coat which must be turned into blood and rags by a bomb it was a cleanshaven throat above a spotted tie a throat which must be sliced open to gush blood feliks felt completely capable of doing it more than that he was eager there were questionsthey would be answered there were problemsthey would be solved it would take nervehe had plenty he visualized orlov and walden inside that beautiful house in their fine soft clothes surrounded by quiet servants soon they would have dinner at a long table whose polished surface reflected like a mirror the crisp linen and silver cutlery they would eat with perfectly clean hands even the fingernails white and the women wearing gloves they would consume a tenth of the food provided and send the rest back to the kitchen they might talk of racehorses or the new ladies fashions or a king they all knew meanwhile the people who were to fight the war shivered in hovels in the cruel russian climateyet could still find an extra bowl of potato soup for an itinerant anarchist what a joy it will be to kill orlov he thought what sweet revenge when i have done that i can die satisfied he shivered youre catching a cold said the fat woman feliks shrugged ive got him a nice lamb chop for his dinner and ive made an apple pie she said ah said feliks what on earth was she talking about he got up from the bench and walked across the grass toward the house he sat on the ground with his back to a tree he would have to observe this house for a day or two and find out what kind of life orlov would lead in london when he would go out and to where how he would travelcoach landau motor car or cab how much time he would spend with walden ideally he wanted to be able to predict orlovs movements and so lie in wait for him he might achieve that simply by learning his habits otherwise he would have to find a way of discovering the princes plans in advanceperhaps by bribing a servant in the house then there was the question of what weapon to use and how to get it the choice of weapon would depend upon the detailed circumstances of the killing getting it would depend on the jubilee street anarchists for this purpose the amateur dramatics group could be ignored as could the dunstan houses intellectuals and indeed all those with visible means of support but there were four or five angry young men who always had money for drinks and on the rare occasions when they talked politics spoke of anarchism in terms of expropriating the expropriators which was jargon for financing the revolution by theft they would have weapons or know where to get them two young girls who looked like shop assistants strolled by his tree and he heard one of them say told him if you think just because you take a girl to the bioscope and buy her a glass of brown ale you can then they were past a peculiar feeling came over feliks he wondered whether the girls had caused itbut no they meant nothing to him am i apprehensive he thought no fulfilled no that comes later excited hardly he finally figured out that he was happy it was very odd indeed that night walden went to lydia s room after they had made love she slept and he lay in the dark with her head on his shoulder remembering st petersburg in he was always traveling in those days america africa arabiamainly because england was not big enough for him and his father both he found st petersburg society gay but prim he liked the russian landscape and the vodka languages came easily to him but russian was the most difficult he had ever encountered and he enjoyed the challenge as the heir to an earldom stephen was obliged to pay a courtesy call on the british ambassador and the ambassador in his turn was expected to invite stephen to parties and introduce him around stephen went to the parties because he liked talking politics with diplomats almost as much as he liked gambling with officers and getting drunk with actresses it was at a reception in the british embassy that he first met lydia he had heard of her previously she was spoken of as a paragon of virtue and a great beauty she was beautiful in a frail colorless sort of way with pale skin pale blond hair and a white gown she was also modest respectable and scrupulously polite there seemed to be nothing to her and stephen detached himself from her company quite quickly but later he found himself seated next to her at dinner and he was obliged to converse with her the russians all spoke french and if they learned a third language it was german so lydia had very little english fortunately stephens french was good finding something to talk about was a bigger problem he said something about the government of russia and she replied with the reactionary platitudes that were twoapenny at the time he spoke about his enthusiasm biggame hunting in africa and she was interested for a while until he mentioned the naked black pygmies at which point she blushed and turned away to talk with the man on her other side stephen told himself he was not very interested in her for she was the kind of girl one married and he was not planning to marry still she left him with the nagging feeling that there was more to her than met the eye lying in bed with her nineteen years later walden thought she still gives me that nagging feeling and he smiled ruefully in the dark he had seen her once more that evening in st petersburg after dinner he had lost his way in the labyrinthine embassy building and had wandered into the music room she was there alone sitting at the piano filling the room with wild passionate music the tune was unfamiliar and almost discordant but it was lydia who fascinated stephen the pale untouchable beauty was gone her eyes flashed her head tossed her body trembled with emotion and she seemed altogether a different woman he never forgot that music later he discovered that it had been tchaikovskys piano concerto in b flat minor and since then he went to hear it played at every opportunity although he never told lydia why when he left the embassy he went back to his hotel to change his clothes for he had an appointment to play cards at midnight he was a keen gambler but not a selfdestructive one he knew how much he could afford to lose and when he had lost it he stopped playing had he run up enormous debts he would have been obliged to ask his father to pay them and that he could not bear to do sometimes he won quite large sums however that was not the appeal of gambling for him he liked the masculine companionship the drinking and the late hours he did not keep that midnight rendezvous pritchard his valet was tying stephens tie when the british ambassador knocked on the door of the hotel suite his excellency looked as if he had got out of bed and dressed hastily stephens first thought was that some kind of revolution was going on and all the british would have to take refuge in the embassy bad news im afraid said the ambassador youd better sit down cable from england its your father the old tyrant was dead of a heart attack at sixtyfive well im damned stephen said so soon my deepest sympathy the ambassador said it was very good of you to come personally not at all anything i can do youre very kind the ambassador shook his hand and left stephen stared into space thinking about the old man he had been immensely tall with a will of iron and a sour disposition his sarcasm could bring tears to your eyes there were three ways to deal with him you could become like him you could go under or you could go away stephens mother a sweet helpless victorian girl had gone under and died young stephen had gone away he pictured his father lying in a coffin and thought youre helpless at last now you cant make housemaids cry or footmen tremble or children run and hide youre powerless to arrange marriages evict tenants to defeat parliamentary bills youll send no more thieves to jail transport no more agitators to australia ashes to ashes dust to dust in later years he revised his opinion of his father now in at the age of fifty walden could admit to himself that he had inherited some of his fathers values love of knowledge a belief in rationalism a commitment to good work as the justification of a mans existence but back in there had been only bitterness pritchard brought a bottle of whiskey on a tray and said this is a sad day my lord that my lord startled stephen he and his brother had courtesy titlesstephens was lord highcombebut they were always called sir by the servants and my lord was reserved for their father now of course stephen was the earl of walden along with the title he now possessed several thousands of acres in the south of england a big chunk of scotland six racehorses walden hall a villa in monte carlo a shooting box in scotland and a seat in the house of lords he would have to live at walden hall it was the family seat and the earl always lived there he would put in electric light he decided he would sell some of the farms and invest in london property and north american railroads he would make his maiden speech in the house of lordswhat would he speak on foreign policy probably there were tenants to be looked after several households to be managed he would have to appear in court in the season and give shooting parties and hunt balls he needed a wife the role of earl of walden could not be played by a bachelor someone must be hostess at all those parties someone must reply to invitations discuss menus with cooks allocate bedrooms to guests and sit at the foot of the long table in the dining room of walden hall there must be a countess of walden there must be an heir i need a wife pritchard yes my lord our bachelor days are over the next day walden saw lydia s father and formally asked permission to call on her almost twenty years later he found it difficult to imagine how he could have been so wickedly irresponsible even in his youth he had never asked himself whether she was the right wife for him only whether she was good countess material he had never wondered whether he could make her happy he had assumed that the hidden passion released when she played the piano would be released for him and he had been wrong he called on her every day for two weeksthere was no possibility of getting home in time for his fathers funeraland then he proposed not to her but to her father her father saw the match in the same practical terms as walden walden explained that he wanted to marry immediately although he was in mourning because he had to get home and manage the estate lydia s father understood perfectly they were married six weeks later what an arrogant young fool i was he thought i imagined that england would always rule the world and i would always rule my own heart the moon came out from behind a cloud and illuminated the bedroom he looked down at lydia s sleeping face i didnt foresee this he thought i didnt know that i would fall helplessly hopelessly in love with you i asked only that we should like each other and in the end that was enough for you but not for me i never thought that i would need your smile yearn for your kisses long for you to come to my room at night i never thought that i would be frightened terrified of losing you she murmured in her sleep and turned over he pulled his arm from under her neck then sat up on the edge of the bed if he stayed any longer he would nod off and it would not do to have lydias maid catch them in bed together when she came in with the morning cup of tea he put on his dressing gown and his carpet slippers and walked softly out of the room through the twin dressing rooms and into his own bedroom im such a lucky man he thought as he lay down to sleep walden surveyed the breakfast table there were pots of coffee china tea and indian tea jugs of cream milk and cordial a big bowl of hot porridge plates of scones and toast and little pots of marmalade honey and jam on the sideboard was a row of silver dishes each warmed by its own spirit lamp containing scrambled eggs sausages bacon kidneys and haddock on the cold table were pressed beef ham and tongue the fruit bowl on a table of its own was piled with nectarines oranges melons and strawberries this ought to put aleks in a good mood he thought he helped himself to eggs and kidneys and sat down the russians would have their price he thought they would want something in return for their promise of military help he was worried about what the price might be if they were to ask for something england could not possibly grant the whole deal would collapse immediately and then it was his job to make sure it did not collapse he would have to manipulate aleks the thought made him uncomfortable having known the boy for so long should have been a help but in fact it might have been easier to negotiate in a tough way with someone about whom one did not care personally i must put my feelings aside he thought we must have russia he poured coffee and took some scones and honey a minute later aleks came in looking brighteyed and wellscrubbed sleep well walden asked him wonderfully well aleks took a nectarine and began to eat it with a knife and fork is that all youre having walden said you used to love english breakfasti remember you eating porridge cream eggs beef and strawberries and then asking cook for more toast im not a growing boy anymore uncle stephen i might do well to remember that walden thought after breakfast they went into the morning room our new fiveyear plan for the army and navy is about to be announced aleks said thats what he does walden thought he tells you something before he asks you for something he remembered aleks saying im planning to read clausewitz this summer uncle by the way may i bring a guest to scotland for the shooting the budget for the next five years is seven and a half billion rubles aleks went on at ten rubles to the pound sterling walden calculated that made million its a massive program he said but i wish you had begun it five years ago so do i said aleks the chances are that the program will hardly have started before were at war aleks shrugged walden thought he wont commit himself to a forecast of how soon russia might be at war of course the first thing you should do is increase the size of the guns on your dreadnoughts aleks shook his head our third dreadnought is about to be launched the fourth is being built now both will have twelveinch guns its not enough aleks churchill has gone over to fifteeninch guns for ours and hes right our commanders know that but our politicians dont you know russia uncle new ideas are viewed with the utmost distrust innovation takes forever were fencing walden thought what is your priority a hundred million rubles will be spent immediately on the black sea fleet i should have thought the north sea was more important for england anyway we have a more asian viewpoint than youour bullying neighbor is turkey not germany they might be allies they might indeed aleks hesitated the great weakness of the russian navy he went on is that we have no warmwater port it sounded like the beginning of a prepared speech this is it walden thought were getting to the heart of the matter now but he continued to fence what about odessa on the black sea coast while the turks hold constantinople and gallipoli they control the passage between the black sea and the mediterranean so for strategic purposes the black sea might as well be an inland lake which is why the russian empire has been trying to push southward for hundreds of years why not were slavs and many of the balkan peoples are slavs if they want national freedom of course we sympathize indeed still if they get it they will probably let your navy pass freely into the mediterranean slav control of the balkans would help us russian control would help even more no doubtalthough its not in the cards as far as i can see would you like to give the matter some thought walden opened his mouth to speak then closed it abruptly this is it he thought this is what they want this is the price we cant give russia the balkans for gods sake if the deal depends on that there will be no deal aleks was saying if we are to fight alongside you we must be strong the area we are talking about is the area in which we need strengthening so naturally we look to you for help there that was putting it as plainly as could be give us the balkans and well fight with you pulling himself together walden frowned as if puzzled and said if britain had control of the balkans we couldat least in theorygive the area to you but we cant give you what we havent got so im not sure how we can strengthen youas you put itin that area alekss reply was so quick that it must have been rehearsed but you might acknowledge the balkans as a russian sphere of influence aah thats not so bad walden thought that we might be able to manage he was enormously relieved he decided to test alekss determination before winding up the discussion he said we could certainly agree to favor you over austria or turkey in that part of the world aleks shook his head we want more than that he said firmly it had been worth a try aleks was young and shy but he could not be pushed around worse luck walden needed time to reflect now for britain to do as russia wanted would mean a significant shift in international alignments and such shifts like movements of the earths crust caused earthquakes in unexpected places you may like to talk with churchill before we go any farther aleks said with a little smile you know damn well i will walden thought he realized suddenly how well aleks had handled the whole thing first he had scared walden with a completely outrageous demand then when he put forward his real demand walden had been so relieved that he welcomed it i thought i was going to manipulate aleks but in the event he manipulated me walden smiled im proud of you my boy he said that morning feliks figured out when where and how he was going to kill prince orlov the plan began to take shape in his mind while he read the times in the library of the jubilee street club his imagination was sparked by a paragraph in the court circular column prince aleksey andreyevich orlov arrived from st petersburg yesterday he is to be the guest of the earl and countess of walden for the london season prince orlov will be presented to their majesties the king and queen at the court on thursday june th now he knew for certain that orlov would be at a certain place on a certain date at a certain time information of this kind was essential to a carefully planned assassination feliks had anticipated that he would get the information either by speaking to one of waldens servants or by observing orlov and identifying some habitual rendezvous now he had no need to take the risks involved in interviewing servants or trailing people he wondered whether orlov knew that his movements were being advertised by the newspapers as if for the benefit of assassins it was typically english he thought the next problem was how to get sufficiently close to orlov to kill him even feliks would have difficulty getting into a royal palace but this question also was answered by the times on the same page as the court circular sandwiched between a report of a dance given by lady bailey and the details of the latest wills he read the kings court arrangements for carriages in order to facilitate the arrangements for calling the carriages of the company at their majesties courts at buckingham palace we are requested to state that in the case of the company having the privilege of the entree at the pimlico entrance the coachman of each carriage returning to take up is required to leave with the constable stationed on the left of the gateway a card distinctly written with the name of the lady or gentleman to whom the carriage belongs and in the case of the carriages of the general company returning to take up at the grand entrance a similar card should be handed to the constable stationed on the left of the archway leading to the quadrangle of the palace to enable the company to receive the advantage of the above arrangements it is necessary that a footman should accompany each carriage as no provision can be made for calling the carriages beyond giving the names to the footmen waiting at the door with whom it rests to bring the carriage the doors will be open for the reception of the company at oclock feliks read it several times there was something about the prose style of the times that made it extremely difficult to comprehend it seemed at least to mean that as people left the palace their footmen were sent running to fetch their carriages which would be parked somewhere else there must be a way he thought that i can contrive to be in or on the walden carriage when it returns to the palace to pick them up one major difficulty remained he had no gun he could have got one easily enough in geneva but then to have carried it across international frontiers would have been risky he might have been refused entry into england if his baggage had been searched it was surely just as easy to get a gun in london but he did not know how and he was most reluctant to make open inquiries he had observed gun shops in the west end of london and noted that all the customers who went in and out looked thoroughly upperclass feliks would not get served in there even if he had the money to buy their beautifully made precision firearms he had spent time in lowclass pubs where guns were surely bought and sold among criminals but he had not seen it happen which was hardly surprising his only hope was the anarchists he had got into conversation with those of them whom he thought serious but they never talked of weapons doubtless because of felikss presence the trouble was that he had not been around long enough to be trusted there were always police spies in anarchist groups and while this did not prevent the anarchists from welcoming newcomers it made them wary now the time for surreptitious investigation had run out he would have to ask directly how guns were to be obtained it would require careful handling and immediately afterward he would have to sever his ties with jubilee street and move to another part of london to avoid the risk of being traced he considered the young jewish tearaways of jubilee street they were angry and violent boys unlike their parents they refused to work like slaves in the sweatshops of the east end sewing the suits that the aristocracy ordered from savile row tailors unlike their parents they paid no attention to the conservative sermonizing of the rabbis but as yet they had not decided whether the solutions to their problems lay in politics or in crime his best prospect he decided was nathan sabelinsky a man of about twenty he had rather slavic good looks and wore very high stiff collars and a yellow waistcoat feliks had seen him around the spielers off the commercial road he must have had money to spend on gambling as well as on clothes he looked around the library the other occupants were an old man asleep a woman in a heavy coat reading das kapital in german and making notes and a lithuanian jew bent over a russian newspaper reading with the aid of a magnifying glass feliks left the room and went downstairs there was no sign of nathan or any of his friends it was a little early for him if he worked at all feliks thought he worked at night feliks went back to dunstan houses he packed his razor his clean underwear and his spare shirt in his cardboard suitcase he told milly rudolf rockers wife ive found a room ill come back this evening to say thank you to rudolf he strapped the suitcase to the backseat of the bicycle and rode west to central london then north to camden town here he found a street of high oncegrand houses which had been built for pretentious middleclass families who had now moved to the suburbs at the ends of the new railway lines in one of them feliks rented a dingy room from an irishwoman called bridget he paid her ten shillings in advance of two weeks rent by midday he was back in stepney outside nathans home in sidney street it was a small row house of the tworoomsupandtwodown type the front door was wide open feliks walked in the noise and the smell hit him like a blow there in a room about twelve feet square some fifteen or twenty people were working at tailoring men were using machines women were sewing by hand and children were pressing finished garments steam rose from the ironing boards to mingle with the smell of sweat the machines clattered the irons hissed and the workers jabbered incessantly in yiddish pieces of cloth cut already for stitching were piled on every available patch of floor space nobody looked up at feliks they were all working furiously fast he spoke to the nearest person a girl with a baby at her breast she was handsewing buttons onto the sleeve of a jacket is nathan here he said upstairs she said without pausing at her work feliks went out of the room and up the narrow staircase each of the two small bedrooms had four beds most of them were occupied presumably by people who worked at night he found nathan in the back room sitting on the edge of a bed buttoning his shirt nathan saw him and said feliks wie gehts i need to talk to you feliks said in yiddish so talk come outside nathan put on his coat and they went out into sidney street they stood in the sunshine close to the open window of the sweatshop their conversation masked by the noise from inside my fathers trade said nathan hell pay a girl fivepence for machining a pair of trousersan hours work for her hell pay another threepence to the girls who cut press and sew on buttons then he will take the trousers to a west end tailor and get paid ninepence profit one pennyenough to buy one slice of bread if he asks the west end tailor for tenpence hell be thrown out of the shop and the work will be given to one of the dozens of jewish tailors out in the street with their machines under their arms i wont live like that is this why youre an anarchist those people make the most beautiful clothes in the worldbut did you see how they are dressed and how will things be changedby violence i think so i was sure you would feel this way nathan i need a gun nathan laughed nervously what for why do anarchists usually want guns you tell me feliks to steal from thieves to oppress tyrants and to kill murderers which are you going to do ill tell youif you really want to know nathan thought for a moment then said go to the frying pan pub on the corner of brick lane and thrawl street see garfield the dwarf thank you said feliks unable to keep the note of triumph out of his voice how much will i have to pay five shillings for a pinfire id rather have something more reliable good guns are expensive ill just have to haggle feliks shook nathans hand thank you nathan watched him climb on his bicycle maybe youll tell me about it afterward feliks smiled youll read about it in the papers he waved a hand and rode off he cycled along whitechapel road and whitechapel high street then turned right into osborn street immediately the character of the streets changed this was the most rundown part of london he had yet seen the streets were narrow and very dirty the air smoky and noisome the people mostly wretched the gutters were choked with filth but despite all that the place was as busy as a beehive men ran up and down with handcarts crowds gathered around street stalls prostitutes worked every corner and the workshops of carpenters and bootmakers spilled out onto the pavements feliks left his bicycle outside the door of the frying pan if it was taken he would just have to steal another one to enter the pub he had to step over what looked like a dead cat inside was a single room low and bare with a bar at the far end older men and women sat on benches around the walls while younger people stood in the middle of the room feliks went to the bar and asked for a glass of ale and a cold sausage he looked around and spotted garfield the dwarf he had not seen him before because the man was standing on a chair he was about four feet tall with a large head and a middleaged face a very big black dog sat on the floor beside his chair he was talking to two large toughlooking men dressed in leather waistcoats and collarless shirts perhaps they were bodyguards feliks noted their large bellies and grinned to himself thinking ill eat them up alive the two men held quart pots of ale but the drawf was drinking what looked like gin the barman handed feliks his drink and his sausage and a glass of the best gin feliks said a young woman at the bar looked at him and said is that for me she smiled coquettishly showing rotten teeth feliks looked away when the gin came he paid and walked over to the group who were standing near a small window which looked on to the street feliks stood between them and the door he addressed the dwarf mr garfield who wants him said garfield in a squeaky voice feliks offered the glass of gin may i speak to you about business garfield took the glass drained it and said no feliks sipped his ale it was sweeter and less fizzy than swiss beer he said i wish to buy a gun i dont know what youve come here for then i heard about you at the jubilee street club anarchist are you feliks said nothing garfield looked him up and down what kind of gun would you want if i had any a revolver a good one something like a browning sevenshot that would be perfect i havent got one if i had i wouldnt sell it and if i sold it id have to ask five pounds i was told a pound at the most you was told wrong feliks reflected the dwarf had decided that as a foreigner and an anarchist feliks could be rooked all right feliks thought well play it your way i cant afford more than two pounds i couldnt come down below four would that include a box of ammunition all right four pounds including a box of ammunition agreed feliks said he noticed one of the bodyguards smothering a grin after paying for the drinks and the sausage feliks had three pounds fifteen shillings and a penny garfield nodded at one of his companions the man went behind the bar and out through the back door feliks ate his sausage a minute or two later the man came back carrying what looked like a bundle of rags he glanced at garfield who nodded the man handed the bundle to feliks feliks unfolded the rags and found a revolver and a small box he took the gun from its wrappings and examined it garfield said keep it down no need to show it to the whole bleeding world the gun was clean and oiled and the action worked smoothly feliks said if i do not look at it how do i know it is good where do you think you are harrods feliks opened the box of cartridges and loaded the chambers with swift practiced movements put the fucking thing away the dwarf hissed give me the money quick and fuck off out of it youre fucking mad a bubble of tension rose in felikss throat and he swallowed dryly he took a step back and pointed the gun at the dwarf garfield said jesus mary and joseph shall i test the gun feliks said the two bodyguards stepped sideways in opposite directions so that feliks could not cover them both with the one gun felikss heart sank he had not expected them to be that smart their next move would be to jump him the pub was suddenly silent feliks realized he could not get to the door before one of the bodyguards reached him the big dog growled sensing the tension in the air feliks smiled and shot the dog the bang of the gun was deafening in the little room nobody moved the dog slumped to the floor bleeding the dwarfs bodyguards were frozen where they stood feliks took another step back reached behind him and found the door he opened it still pointing the gun at garfield and stepped out he slammed the door stuffed the gun in his coat pocket and jumped on his bicycle he heard the pub door open he pushed himself off and began to pedal somebody grabbed his coat sleeve he pedaled harder and broke free he heard a shot and ducked reflexively someone screamed he dodged around an icecream vendor and turned a corner in the distance he heard a police whistle he looked behind nobody was following him half a minute later he was lost in the warrens of whitechapel he thought six bullets left three charlotte was ready the gown agonized over for so long was perfect to complete it she wore a single blush rose in her corsage and carried a spray of the same flowers covered in chiffon her diamond tiara was fixed firmly to her upswept hair and the two white plumes were securely fastened everything was fine she was terrified as i enter the throne room she said to marya my train will drop off my tiara will fall over my eyes my hair will come loose my feathers will lean sideways and i shall trip over the hem of my gown and go flat on the floor the assembled company will burst out laughing and no one will laugh louder than her majesty the queen i shall run out of the palace and into the park and throw myself into the lake you ought not to talk like that said marya then more gently she added youll be the loveliest of them all charlotte s mother came into the bedroom she held charlotte at arms length and looked at her my dear youre beautiful she said and kissed her charlotte put her arms around mamas neck and pressed her cheek against her mothers the way she had used to as a child when she had been fascinated by the velvet smoothness of mamas complexion when she drew away she was surprised to see a hint of tears in her mothers eyes youre beautiful too mama she said lydia s gown was of ivory charmeuse with a train of old ivory brocade lined in purple chiffon being a married lady she wore three feathers in her hair as opposed to charlotte s two her bouquet was sweet peas and petunia roses are you ready she said ive been ready for ages charlotte said pick up your train charlotte picked up her train the way she had been taught mama nodded approvingly shall we go marya opened the door charlotte stood aside to let her mother go first but mama said no dearits your night they walked in procession marya bringing up the rear along the corridor and down to the landing when charlotte reached the top of the grand staircase she heard a burst of applause the whole household was gathered at the foot of the stairs housekeeper cook footmen maids skivvies grooms and boys a sea of faces looked up at her with pride and delight charlotte was touched by their affection it was a big night for them too she realized in the center of the throng was papa looking magnificent in a black velvet tailcoat knee breeches and silk stockings with a sword at his hip and a cocked hat in his hand charlotte walked slowly down the stairs papa kissed her and said my little girl the cook who had known her long enough to take liberties plucked at her sleeve and whispered you look wonderful mlady charlotte squeezed her hand and said thank you mrs harding aleks bowed to her he was resplendent in the uniform of an admiral in the russian navy what a handsome man he is charlotte thought i wonder whether someone will fall in love with him tonight two footmen opened the front door papa took charlotte s elbow and gently steered her out mama followed on alekss arm charlotte thought if i can just keep my mind blank all evening and go automatically wherever people lead me i shall be all right the coach was waiting outside william the coachman and charles the footman stood at attention on either side of the door wearing the walden livery william stout and graying was calm but charles looked excited papa handed charlotte into the coach and she sat down gracefully i havent fallen over yet she thought the other three got in pritchard brought a hamper and put it on the floor of the coach before closing the door the coach pulled away charlotte looked at the hamper a picnic she said but were only going half a mile wait till you see the queue papa said it will take us almost an hour to get there it occurred to charlotte that she might be more bored than nervous this evening sure enough the carriage stopped at the admiralty end of the mall half a mile from buckingham palace papa opened the hamper and took out a bottle of champagne the basket also contained chicken sandwiches hothouse peaches and a cake charlotte sipped a glass of champagne but she could not eat anything she looked out of the window the pavements were thronged with idlers watching the procession of the mighty she saw a tall man with a thin handsome face leaning on a bicycle and staring intently at their coach something about his look made charlotte shiver and turn away after such a grand exit from the house she found that the anticlimax of sitting in the queue was calming by the time the coach passed through the palace gates and approached the grand entrance she was beginning to feel more her normal selfskeptical irreverent and impatient the coach stopped and the door was opened charlotte gathered her train in her left arm picked up her skirts with her right hand stepped down from the coach and walked into the palace the great redcarpeted hall was a blaze of light and color despite her skepticism she felt a thrill of excitement when she saw the crowd of whitegowned women and men in glittering uniforms the diamonds flashed the swords clanked and the plumes bobbed redcoated beefeaters stood at attention on either side charlotte and mama left their wraps in the cloakroom then escorted by papa and aleks walked slowly through the hall and up the grand staircase between the yeomen of the guard with their halberds and the massed red and white roses from there they went through the picture gallery and into the first of three state drawing rooms with enormous chandeliers and mirrorbright parquet floors here the procession ended and people stood around in groups chatting and admiring one anothers clothes charlotte saw her cousin belinda with uncle george and aunt clarissa the two families greeted each other uncle george was wearing the same clothes as papa but because he was so fat and redfaced he looked awful in them charlotte wondered how aunt clarissa who was young and pretty felt about being married to such a lump papa was surveying the room as if looking for someone have you seen churchill he said to uncle george good lord what do you want him for papa took out his watch we must take our places in the throne roomwell leave you to look after charlotte if we may clarissa papa mama and aleks left belinda said to charlotte your dress is gorgeous its awfully uncomfortable i knew you were going to say that youre ever so pretty thank you belinda lowered her voice i say prince orlov is rather dashing hes very sweet i think hes more than sweet whats that funny look in your eye belinda lowered her voice even more you and i must have a long talk very soon about what remember what we discussed in the hideaway when we took those books from the library at walden hall charlotte looked at her uncle and aunt but they had turned away to talk to a darkskinned man in a pink satin turban of course i remember about that silence descended suddenly the crowd fell back toward the sides of the room to make a gangway in the middle charlotte looked around and saw the king and queen enter the drawing room followed by their pages several members of the royal family and the indian bodyguard there was a great sigh of rustling silk as every woman in the room sank to the floor in a curtsy in the throne room the orchestra concealed in the minstrels gallery struck up god save the king lydia looked toward the huge doorway guarded by gilt giants two attendants walked in backward one carrying a gold stick and one a silver the king and queen entered at a stately pace smiling faintly they mounted the dais and stood in front of the twin thrones the rest of their entourage took their places nearby remaining standing queen mary wore a gown of gold brocade and a crown of emeralds shes no beauty lydia thought but they say he adores her she had once been engaged to her husbands elder brother who had died of pneumonia and the switch to the new heir to the throne had seemed coldly political at the time however everyone now agreed that she was a good queen and a good wife lydia would have liked to know her personally the presentations began one by one the wives of ambassadors came forward curtsied to the king curtsied to the queen then backed away the ambassadors followed dressed in a great variety of gaudy comicopera uniforms all but the united states ambassador who wore ordinary black evening clothes as if to remind everyone that americans did not really believe in this sort of nonsense as the ritual went on lydia looked around the room at the crimson satin on the walls the heroic frieze below the ceiling the enormous candelabra and the thousands of flowers she loved pomp and ritual beautiful clothes and elaborate ceremonies they moved and soothed her at the same time she caught the eye of the duchess of devonshire who was the queens mistress of the robes and they exchanged a discreet smile she spotted john burns the socialist president of the board of trade and was amused to see the extravagant gilt embroidery of his court dress when the diplomatic presentations ended the king and queen sat down the royal family the diplomats and the most senior nobility followed suit lydia and walden along with the lesser nobility had to remain standing at last the presentation of the debutantes began each girl paused just outside the throne room while an attendant took her train from her arm and spread it behind her then she began the endless walk along the red carpet to the thrones with all eyes on her if a girl could look graceful and unselfconscious there she could do it anywhere as the debutante approached the dais she handed her invitation card to the lord chamberlain who read out her name she curtsied to the king then to the queen few girls curtsied elegantly lydia thought she had had a great deal of trouble getting charlotte to practice at all perhaps other mothers had the same problem after the curtsies the deb walked on careful not to turn her back on the thrones until she was safely hidden in the watching crowd the girls followed one another so closely that each was in danger of treading on the train of the one in front the ceremony seemed to lydia to be less personal more perfunctory than it used to be she herself had been presented to queen victoria in the season of the year after she married walden the old queen had not sat on a throne but on a high stool which gave the impression that she was standing lydia had been surprised at how little victoria was she had had to kiss the queens hand that part of the ceremony had now been dispensed with presumably to save time it made the court seem like a factory for turning out the maximum number of debs in the shortest possible time still the girls of today did not know the difference and probably would not care if they did suddenly charlotte was at the entrance and the attendant was laying down her train then giving her a gentle push and she was walking along the red carpet head held high looking perfectly serene and confident lydia thought this is the moment i have lived for the girl ahead of charlotte curtsiedand then the unthinkable happened instead of getting up from her curtsy the debutante looked at the king stretched out her arms in a gesture of supplication and cried in a loud voice your majesty for gods sake stop torturing women lydia thought a suffragette her eyes flashed to her daughter charlotte was standing dead still halfway to the dais staring at the tableau with an expression of horror on her ashen face the shocked silence in the throne room lasted for only a second two gentlemeninwaiting were the fastest to react they sprang forward took the girl firmly by either arm and marched her unceremoniously away the queen was blushing crimson the king managed to look as if nothing had happened lydia looked again at charlotte thinking why did my daughter have to be next in line now all eyes were on charlotte lydia wanted to call out to her pretend it never happened just carry on charlotte stood still a little color came back into her cheeks lydia could see that she was taking a deep breath then she walked forward lydia could not breathe charlotte handed her card to the lord chamberlain who said presentation of lady charlotte walden charlotte stood before the king lydia thought careful charlotte curtsied perfectly she curtsied again to the queen she half turned and walked away lydia let out her breath in a long sigh the woman standing next to lydia a baroness whom she vaguely recognized but did not really knowwhispered she handled that very well shes my daughter lydia said with a smile walden was secretly amused by the suffragette spirited girl he thought of course if charlotte had done such a thing at the court he would have been horrified but as it was someone elses daughter he regarded the incident as a welcome break in the interminable ceremony he had noticed how charlotte had carried on unruffled he would have expected no less of her she was a highly selfassured young lady and in his opinion lydia should congratulate herself on the girls upbringing instead of worrying all the time he used to enjoy these occasions years ago as a young man he had quite liked to put on court dress and cut a dash in those days he had had the legs for it too now he felt foolish in knee breeches and silk stockings not to mention a damn great steel sword and he had attended so many courts that the colorful ritual no longer fascinated him he wondered how king george felt about it walden liked the king of course by comparison with his father edward vii george was a rather colorless mild fellow the crowds would never shout good old georgie the way they had shouted good old teddy but in the end they would like george for his quiet charm and his modest way of life he knew how to be firm although as yet he did it too rarely and walden liked a man who could shoot straight walden thought he would turn out very well indeed finally the last debutante curtsied and passed on and the king and queen stood up the orchestra played the national anthem again the king bowed and the queen curtsied first to the ambassadors then to the ambassadors wives then to the duchesses and lastly to the ministers the king took the queen by the hand the pages picked up her train the attendants went out backward the royal couple left followed by the rest of the company in order of precedence they divided to go into three supper rooms one for the royal family and their close friends one for the diplomatic corps and one for the rest walden was a friend but not an intimate friend of the king he went with the general assembly aleks went with the diplomats in the supper room walden met up with his family again lydia was glowing walden said congratulations charlotte lydia said who was that awful girl i heard someone say shes the daughter of an architect walden replied that explains it said lydia charlotte looked mystified why does that explain it walden smiled your mama means that the girl is not quite out of the top drawer but why does she think the king tortures women she was talking about the suffragettes but lets not go into all that tonight this is a grand occasion for us lets have supper it looks marvelous there was a long buffet table loaded with flowers and hot and cold food servants in the scarletandgold royal livery waited to offer the guests lobster filleted trout quail york ham plovers eggs and a host of pastries and desserts walden got a loaded plate and sat down to eat after standing about in the throne room for more than two hours he was hungry sooner or later charlotte would have to learn about the suffragettes their hunger strikes and the consequent forcefeeding but the subject was indelicate to say the least and the longer she remained in blissful ignorance the better walden thought at her age life should be all parties and picnics frocks and hats gossip and flirtation but everyone was talking about the incident and that girl waldens brother george sat beside him and said without preamble shes a miss mary blomfield daughter of the late sir arthur blomfield her mother was in the drawing room at the time when she was told what her daughter had done she fainted right off he seemed to relish the scandal only thing she could do i suppose walden replied damn shame for the family george said you wont see blomfields at court again for two or three generations we shant miss them no walden saw churchill pushing through the crowd toward where they sat he had written to churchill about his talk with aleks and he was impatient to discuss the next stepbut not here he looked away hoping churchill would get the hint he should have known better than to hope that such a subtle message would get through churchill bent over waldens chair can we have a few words together walden looked at his brother george wore an expression of horror walden threw him a resigned look and got up lets walk in the picture gallery churchill said walden followed him out churchill said i suppose you too will tell me that this suffragette protest is all the fault of the liberal party i expect it is walden said but that isnt what you want to talk about no indeed the two men walked side by side through the long gallery churchill said we cant acknowledge the balkans as a russian sphere of influence i was afraid youd say that what do they want the balkans for i mean forgetting all this nonsense about sympathy with slav nationalism they want passage through to the mediterranean that would be to our advantage if they were our allies exactly they reached the end of the gallery and stopped churchill said is there some way we can give them that passage without redrawing the map of the balkan peninsula ive been thinking about that churchill smiled and youve got a counterproposal yes lets hear it walden said what were talking about here is three stretches of water the bosporus the sea of marmara and the dardanelles if we can give them those waterways they wont need the balkans now suppose that whole passage between the black sea and the mediterranean could be declared an international waterway with free passage to ships of all nations guaranteed jointly by russia and england churchill started walking again slow and thoughtful walden walked beside him waiting for his answer eventually churchill said that passage ought to be an international waterway in any event what youre suggesting is that we offer as if it were a concession something which we want anyway yes churchill looked up and grinned suddenly when it comes to machiavellian maneuvering theres no one to beat the english aristocracy all right go ahead and propose it to orlov you dont want to put it to the cabinet no not even to the foreign secretary not at this stage the russians are certain to want to modify the proposaltheyll want details of how the guarantee is to be enforced at leastso ill go to the cabinet when the deal is fully elaborated very well walden wondered just how much the cabinet knew about what churchill and he were up to churchill too could be machiavellian were there wheels within wheels churchill said where is orlov now in the diplomatic supper room lets go and put it to him right away walden shook his head thinking that people were right when they accused churchill of being impulsive this is not the moment we cant wait for the moment walden every day counts it will take a bigger man than you to bully me walden thought he said youre going to have to leave that to my judgment churchill ill put this to orlov tomorrow morning churchill seemed disposed to argue but he restrained himself visibly and said i dont suppose germany will declare war tonight very well he looked at his watch im going to leave keep me fully informed of course goodbye churchill went down the staircase and walden went back into the supper room the party was breaking up now that the king and queen had disappeared and everyone had been fed there was nothing to stay for walden rounded up his family and took them downstairs they met up with aleks in the great hall while the ladies went into the cloakroom walden asked one of the attendants to summon his carriage all in all he thought as he waited it had been a rather successful evening the mall reminded feliks of the streets of the old equerries quarter of moscow it was a wide straight avenue that ran from trafalgar square to buckingham palace on one side was a series of grand houses including st jamess palace on the other side was st jamess park the carriages and motor cars of the great were lined up on both sides of the mall for half its length chauffeurs and coachmen leaned against their vehicles yawning and fidgeting waiting to be summoned to the palace to collect their masters and mistresses the walden carriage waited on the park side of the mall their coachman in the blueandpink walden livery stood beside the horses reading a newspaper by the light of a carriage lamp a few yards away in the darkness of the park feliks stood watching him feliks was desperate his plan was in ruins he had not understood the difference between the english words coachman and footman and consequently he had misunderstood the notice in the times about summoning carriages he had thought that the driver of the coach would wait at the palace gate until his master emerged then would come running to fetch the coach at that point feliks had planned he would have overpowered the coachman taken his livery and driven the coach to the palace himself what happened in fact was that the coachman stayed with the vehicle and the footman waited at the palace gate when the coach was wanted the footman would come running then he and the coachman would go with the carriage to pick up the passengers that meant feliks had to overpower two people not one and the difficulty was that it had to be done surreptitiously so that none of the hundreds of other servants in the mall would know anything was wrong since realizing his mistake a couple of hours ago he had worried at the problem while he watched the coachman chatting with his colleagues examining a nearby rollsroyce car playing some kind of game with halfpennies and polishing the carriage windows it might have been sensible to abandon the plan and kill orlov another day but feliks hated that idea for one thing there was no certainty that another good opportunity would arise for another feliks wanted to kill him now he had been anticipating the bang of the gun the way the prince would fall he had composed the coded cable which would go to ulrich in geneva he had pictured the excitement in the little printing shop and then the headlines in the worlds newspapers and then the final wave of revolution sweeping through russia i cant postpone this any longer he thought i want it now as he watched a young man in green livery approached the walden coachman and said what ho william so the coachmans name is william feliks thought william said mustnt grumble john feliks did not understand that anything in the news said john yeah revolution the king says that next year all the coachmen can go in the palace for supper and the toffs will wait in the mall a likely tale youre telling me john moved on i can get rid of william feliks thought but what about the footman in his mind he ran over the probable sequence of events walden and orlov would come to the palace door the doorman would alert waldens footman who would run from the palace to the carriagea distance of about a quarter of a mile the footman would see feliks dressed in the coachmans clothes and would sound the alarm suppose the footman arrived at the parking place to find that the carriage was no longer there that was a thought the footman would wonder whether he had misremembered the spot he would look up and down in something of a panic he would search for the coach finally he would admit defeat and return to the palace to tell his master that he could not find the coach by which time feliks would be driving the coach and its owner through the park it could still be done it was more risky than before but it could still be done there was no more time for reflection the first two or three footmen were already running down the mall the rollsroyce car in front of the walden coach was summoned william put on his top hat in readiness feliks emerged from the bushes and walked a little way toward him calling hey hey william the coachman looked toward him frowning feliks beckoned urgently come here quick william folded his newspaper hesitated then walked slowly toward feliks feliks allowed his own tension to put a note of panic into his voice look at this he said pointing to the bushes do you know anything about this what william said mystified he drew level and peered the way feliks was pointing this feliks showed him the gun if you make a noise ill shoot you william was terrified feliks could see the whites of his eyes in the half dark he was a heavily built man but he was older than feliks if he does something foolish and messes this up ill kill him feliks thought savagely walk on feliks said the man hesitated ive got to get him out of the light walk you bastard william walked into the bushes feliks followed him when they were about fifty yards away from the mall feliks said stop william stopped and turned around feliks thought if hes going to fight this is where he will do it he said take off your clothes what undress youre mad william whispered youre rightim mad take off your clothes william hesitated if i shoot him will people come running will the bushes muffle the sound could i kill him without making a hole in his uniform could i take his coat off and run away before anyone arrived feliks cocked the gun william began to undress feliks could hear the increasing activity in the mall motor cars were started harnesses jingled hooves clattered and men shouted to one another and to their horses any minute now the footman might come running for the walden coach faster feliks said william got down to his underwear the rest also feliks said william hesitated feliks lifted the gun william pulled off his undershirt dropped his underpants and stood naked shivering with fear covering his genitals with his hands turn around said feliks william turned his back lie on the ground facedown he did so feliks put down the gun hurriedly he took off his coat and hat and put on the livery coat and the top hat which william had dropped on the ground he contemplated the knee breeches and white stockings but decided to leave them when he was sitting up on the coach no one would notice his trousers and boots especially in the uncertain light of the streetlamps he put the gun into the pocket of his own coat and folded the coat over his arm he picked up williams clothes in a bundle william tried to look around dont move feliks said sharply softly he walked away william would stay there for a while then naked as he was he would try to get back to the walden house unobserved it was highly unlikely that he would report that he had been robbed of his clothes before he had a chance to get some more unless he was an extraordinarily immodest man of course if he had known feliks was going to kill prince orlov he might have thrown modesty to the windsbut how could he possibly guess that feliks pushed williams clothes under a bush then walked out into the lights of the mall this was where things might go wrong until now he had been merely a suspicious person lurking in the bushes from this moment on he was plainly an impostor if one of williams friendsjohn for instanceshould look closely at his face the game would be up he climbed rapidly onto the coach put his own coat on the seat beside him adjusted his top hat released the brake and flicked the reins the coach pulled out into the road he sighed with relief ive got this far he thought ill get orlov as he drove down the mall he watched the pavements looking for a running footman in the blueandpink livery the worst possible mischance would be for the walden footman to see him now recognize the colors and jump onto the back of the coach feliks cursed as a motor car pulled out in front of him forcing him to slow the horses to a halt he looked around anxiously there was no sign of the footman after a moment the road was clear and he went on at the palace end of the avenue he spotted an empty space on the right the side of the road farther from the park the footman would come along the opposite pavement and would not see the coach he pulled into the space and set the brake he climbed down from the seat and stood behind the horses watching the opposite pavement he wondered whether he would get out of this alive in his original plan there had been a good chance that walden would get into the carriage without so much as a glance at the coachman but now he would surely notice that his footman was missing the palace doorman would have to open the coach door and pull down the steps would walden stop and speak to the coachman or would he postpone inquiries until he got home if he were to speak to feliks then feliks would have to reply and his voice would give the game away what will i do then feliks thought ill shoot orlov at the palace door and take the consequences he saw the footman in blueandpink running along the far side of the mall feliks jumped on the coach released the brake and drove into the courtyard of buckingham palace there was a queue ahead of him the beautiful women and the wellfed men climbed into their carriages and cars behind him somewhere in the mall the walden footman was running up and down hunting for his coach how long before he returned the palace servants had a fast and efficient system for loading guests into vehicles while the passengers were getting into the carriage at the door a servant was calling the owners of the second in line and another servant was inquiring the name of the people for the third the line moved and a servant approached feliks the earl of walden feliks said the servant went inside they mustnt come out too soon feliks thought the line moved forward and now there was only a motor car in front of him pray god it doesnt stall he thought the chauffeur held the doors for an elderly couple the car pulled away feliks moved the coach to the porch halting it a little too far forward so that he was beyond the wash of light from inside and his back was to the palace doors he waited not daring to look around he heard the voice of a young girl say in russian and how many ladies proposed marriage to you this evening cousin aleks a drop of sweat ran down into felikss eye and he wiped it away with the back of his hand a man said where the devil is my footman feliks reached into the pocket of the coat beside him and got his hand on the butt of the revolver six shots left he thought out of the corner of his eye he saw a palace servant spring forward and a moment later he heard the door of the coach being opened the vehicle rocked slightly as someone got in i say william wheres charles feliks tensed he imagined he could feel waldens eyes boring into the back of his head the girls voice said come on papa from inside the carriage williams getting deaf in his old age waldens words were muffled as he got into the coach the door slammed right away coachman said the palace servant feliks breathed out and drove away the release of tension made him feel weak for a moment then as he guided the carriage out of the courtyard he felt a surge of elation orlov was in his power shut in a box behind him caught like an animal in a trap nothing could stop feliks now he drove into the park holding the reins in his right hand he struggled to get his left arm into his topcoat that done he switched the reins to his left hand and got his right arm in he stood up and shrugged the coat up over his shoulders he felt in the pocket and touched the gun he sat down again and wound a scarf around his neck he was ready now he had to choose his moment he had only a few minutes the walden house was less than a mile from the palace he had bicycled along this road the night before a reconnoiter he had found two suitable places where a streetlamp would illuminate his victim and there was thick shrubbery nearby into which he could disappear afterward the first spot loomed up fifty yards ahead as he approached it he saw a man in evening dress pause beneath the lamp to light his cigar he drove past the spot the second place was a bend in the road if there was someone there feliks would just have to take a chance and shoot the intruder if necessary six bullets he saw the bend he made the horses trot a little faster from inside the coach he heard the young girl laugh he came to the bend his nerves were as taut as piano wire now he dropped the reins and heaved on the brake the horses staggered and the carriage shuddered and jerked to a halt from inside the coach he heard a woman cry and a man shout something about the womans voice bothered him but there was no time to wonder why he jumped down to the ground pulled the scarf up over his mouth and nose took the gun from his pocket and cocked it full of strength and rage he flung open the coach door four a woman cried out and time stood still feliks knew the voice the sound hit him like a mighty blow the shock paralyzed him he was supposed to locate orlov point the gun at him pull the trigger make sure he was dead with another bullet then turn and run into the bushes instead he looked for the source of the cry and saw her face it was startlingly familiar as if he had last seen it only yesterday instead of nineteen years ago her eyes were wide with panic and her small red mouth was open lydia he stood at the door of the coach with his mouth open under the scarf the gun pointing nowhere and he thought my lydiahere in this carriage as he stared at her he was dimly aware that walden was moving with uncanny slowness close by him on his left but all feliks could think was this is how she used to look wideeyed and openmouthed when she lay naked beneath me her legs wrapped around my waist and she stared at me and began to cry out with delight then he saw that walden had drawn a sword for gods sake a sword and the blade was glinting in the lamplight as it swept down and feliks moved too slowly and too late and the sword bit into his right hand and he dropped the gun and it went off with a bang as it hit the road the explosion broke the spell walden drew back the sword and thrust at felikss heart feliks moved sideways the point of the sword went through his coat and jacket and stuck into his shoulder he jumped back reflexively and the sword came out he felt a rush of warm blood inside his shirt he stared down at the road looking for the gun but he could not see it he looked up again but saw that walden and orlov had bumped into one another as they tried simultaneously to get out through the narrow carriage door felikss right arm hung limply at his side he realized he was unarmed and helpless he could not even strangle orlov for his right arm was useless he had failed utterly and all because of the voice of a woman from the past after all that he thought bitterly after all that full of despair he turned and ran away walden roared damned villain felikss wound hurt at every step he heard someone running behind him the footsteps were too light to be waldens orlov was chasing him he teetered on the edge of hysteria as he thought orlov is chasing meand i am running away he darted off the road and into the bushes he heard walden shout aleks come back hes got a gun they dont know i dropped it feliks thought if only i still had it i could shoot orlov now he ran a little farther then stopped listening he could hear nothing orlov had given up he leaned against a tree he was exhausted by his short sprint when he had caught his breath he took off his topcoat and the stolen livery coat and gingerly touched his wounds they hurt like the devil which he thought was probably a good sign for if they had been very grave they would have been numb his shoulder bled slowly and throbbed his hand had been sliced in the fleshy part between thumb and forefinger and it bled fast he had to get out of the park before walden had a chance to raise the hue and cry with difficulty he drew on the topcoat he left the livery coat on the ground where it lay he squeezed his right hand under his left armpit to relieve the pain and slow the flow of blood wearily he headed toward the mall lydia it was the second time in his life that she had caused a catastrophe the first time in in st petersburg no he would not allow himself to think about her not yet he needed his wits about him now he saw with relief that his bicycle was where he had left it under the overhanging branches of a big tree he wheeled it across the grass to the edge of the park had walden alerted the police yet were they looking for a tall man in a dark coat he stared at the scene in the mall the footmen were still running the car engines roaring the carriages maneuvering how long had it been since feliks had climbed up onto the walden coachtwenty minutes in that time the world had turned over he took a deep breath and wheeled the bicycle into the road everyone was busy nobody looked at him keeping his right hand in his coat pocket he mounted the machine he pushed off and began to pedal steering with his left hand there were bobbies all around the palace if walden mobilized them quickly they could cordon off the park and the roads around it feliks looked ahead toward admiralty arch there was no sign of a roadblock once past the arch he would be in the west end and they would have lost him he began to get the knack of cycling onehanded and increased his speed as he approached the arch a motor car drew alongside him and at the same time a policeman stepped into the road ahead feliks stopped the bicycle and prepared to runbut the policeman was merely holding up the traffic to permit another car belonging presumably to some kind of dignitary to emerge from a gateway when the car came out the policeman saluted then waved the traffic on feliks cycled through the arch and into trafalgar square too slow walden he thought with satisfaction it was midnight but the west end was bright with streetlights and crowded with people and traffic there were policemen everywhere and no other cyclists feliks was conspicuous he considered abandoning the bicycle and walking back to camden town but he was not sure he could make the journey on foot he seemed to be tiring very easily from trafalgar square he rode up st martin s lane then left the main streets for the back alleys of theatreland a dark lane was suddenly illuminated as a stage door opened and a bunch of actors came out talking loudly and laughing farther on he heard groans and sighs and passed a couple making love standing up in a doorway he crossed into bloomsbury here it was quieter and darker he cycled north up gower street past the classical facade of the deserted university pushing the pedals became an enormous effort and he ached all over just a mile or two more he thought he dismounted to cross the busy euston road the lights of the traffic dazzled him he seemed to be having difficulty focusing his eyes outside euston station he got on the bicycle again and pedaled off suddenly he felt dizzy a streetlight blinded him the front wheel wobbled and hit the curb feliks fell he lay on the ground dazed and weak he opened his eyes and saw a policeman approaching he struggled to his knees have you been drinkin the policeman said feel faint feliks managed the policeman took his right arm and hauled him to his feet the pain in his wounded shoulder brought feliks to his senses he managed to keep his bleeding right hand in his pocket the policeman sniffed audibly and said hmm his attitude became more genial when he discovered that feliks did not smell of drink will you be all right in a minute foreigner are you the policeman had noticed his accent french feliks said i work at the embassy the policeman became more polite would you like a cab no thank you i have only a little way to go the policeman picked up the bicycle i should wheel it home if i were you feliks took the bicycle from him i will do that very good sir bong noowee bonne nuit officer with an effort feliks produced a smile pushing the bicycle with his left hand he walked away ill turn into the next alley and sit down for a rest he resolved he looked back over his shoulder the policeman was still watching him he made himself keep on walking although he desperately needed to lie down the next alley he thought but when he came to an alley he passed it thinking not this one but the next and in that way he got home it seemed hours later that he stood outside the high terraced house in camden town he peered through a fog at the number on the door to make sure this was the right place to get to his room he had to go down a flight of stone steps to the basement area he leaned the bicycle against the wroughtiron railings while he opened the little gate he then made the mistake of trying to wheel the bicycle down the steps it slid out of his grasp and fell into the area with a loud clatter a moment later his landlady bridget appeared at the street door in a shawl what the divil is it she called feliks sat on the steps and made no reply he decided he would not move for a while until he felt stronger bridget came down and helped him to his feet youve had a few too many drinks she said she made him walk down the steps to the basement door give us your key she said feliks had to use his left hand to take the key from his right trouser pocket he gave it to her and she opened the door they went in feliks stood in the middle of the little room while she lit the lamp lets have your coat off she said he let her remove his coat and she saw the bloodstains have you been fightin feliks went and lay on the mattress bridget said you look as if you lost i did said feliks and he passed out an agonizing pain brought him around he opened his eyes to see bridget bathing his wounds with something that stung like fire this hand should be stitched she said tomorrow feliks breathed she made him drink from a cup it was warm water with gin in it she said i havent any brandy he lay back and let her bandage him i could fetch the doctor but i couldnt be payin him tomorrow she stood up ill look at you first thing in the morning thank you she went out and at last feliks allowed himself to remember it has happened in the long run of ages that everything which permits men to increase their production or even to continue it has been appropriated by the few the land belongs to the few who may prevent the community from cultivating it the coalpits which represent the labor of generations belong again to the few the laceweaving machine which represents in its present state of perfection the work of three generations of lancashire weavers belongs also to the few and if the grandsons of the very same weaver who invented the first laceweaving machine claim their right to bring one of these machines into motion they will be told hands off this machine does not belong to you the railroads belong to a few shareholders who may not even know where is situated the railway which brings them a yearly income larger than that of a medieval king and if the children of those people who died by the thousands in digging the tunnels should gather and goa ragged and starving crowdto ask bread or work from the shareholders they would be met with bayonets and bullets feliks looked up from kropotkins pamphlet the bookshop was empty the bookseller was an old revolutionist who made his money selling novels to wealthy women and kept a hoard of subversive literature in the back of the shop feliks spent a lot of time in here he was nineteen he was about to be thrown out of the prestigious spiritual academy for truancy indiscipline long hair and associating with nihilists he was hungry and broke and soon he would be homeless and life was wonderful he cared about nothing other than ideas and he was learning every day new things about poetry history psychology andmost of allpolitics laws on property are not made to guarantee either to the individual or to society the enjoyment of the produce of their own labor on the contrary they are made to rob the producer of a part of what he has created when for example the law establishes mr soandsos right to a house it is not establishing his right to a cottage he has built for himself or to a house he has erected with the help of some of his friends in that case no one would have disputed his right on the contrary the law is establishing his right to a house which is not the product of his labor the anarchist slogans had sounded ridiculous when he had first heard them property is theft government is tyranny anarchy is justice it was astonishing how when he had really thought about them they came to seem not only true but crashingly obvious kropotkins point about laws was undeniable no laws were required to prevent theft in felikss home village if one peasant stole anothers horse or his chair or the coat his wife had embroidered then the whole village would see the culprit in possession of the goods and make him give them back the only stealing that went on was when the landlord demanded rent and the policeman was there to enforce that theft it was the same with government the peasants needed no one to tell them how the plow and the oxen were to be shared between their fields they decided among themselves it was only the plowing of the landlords fields that had to be enforced we are continually told of the benefits conferred by laws and penalties but have the speakers ever attempted to balance the benefits attributed to laws and penalties against the degrading effects of these penalties upon humanity only calculate all the evil passions awakened in mankind by the atrocious punishments inflicted in our streets man is the cruelest animal on earth and who has pampered and developed the cruel instincts if it is not the king the judge and the priests armed with law who caused flesh to be torn off in strips boiling pitch to be poured onto wounds limbs to be dislocated bones to be crushed men to be sawn asunder to maintain their authority only estimate the torrent of depravity let loose in human society by the informing which is countenanced by judges and paid in hard cash by governments under pretext of assisting in the discovery of crime only go into the jails and study what man becomes when he is steeped in the vice and corruption which oozes from the very walls of our prisons finally consider what corruption what depravity of mind is kept up among men by the idea of obedience the very essence of law of chastisement of authority having the right to punish of the necessity for executioners jailers and informersin a word by all the attributes of law and authority consider this and you will assuredly agree that a law inflicting penalties is an abomination which should cease to exist peoples without political organization and therefore less depraved than ourselves have perfectly understood that the man who is called criminal is simply unfortunate and that the remedy is not to flog him to chain him up or to kill him but to help him by the most brotherly care by treatment based on equality by the usages of life among honest men feliks was vaguely aware that a customer had come into the shop and was standing close to him but he was concentrating on kropotkin no more laws no more judges liberty equality and practical human sympathy are the only effective barriers we can oppose to the antisocial instincts of certain among us the customer dropped a book and he lost his train of thought he glanced away from his pamphlet saw the book lying on the floor beside the customers long skirt and automatically bent down to pick it up for her as he handed it to her he saw her face he gasped why youre an angel he said with perfect honesty she was blond and petite and she wore a pale gray fur the color of her eyes and everything about her was pale and light and fair he thought he would never see a more beautiful woman and he was right she stared back at him and blushed but he did not turn away it seemed incredibly that she found something fascinating in him too after a moment he looked at her book it was anna karenina sentimental rubbish he said he wished he had not spoken for his words broke the spell she took the book and turned away he saw then that there was a maid with her for she gave the book to the maid and left the shop the maid paid for the book looking through the window feliks saw the woman get into a carriage he asked the bookseller who she was her name was lydia he learned and she was the daughter of count shatov he found out where the count lived and the next day he hung around outside the house in the hope of seeing her she went in and out twice in her carriage before a groom came out and chased feliks off he did not mind for the last time her carriage passed she had looked directly at him the next day he went to the bookshop for hours he read bakunins federalism socialism and antitheologism without understanding a single word every time a carriage passed he looked out of the window whenever a customer came into the shop his heart missed a beat she came in at the end of the afternoon this time she left the maid outside she murmured a greeting to the bookseller and came to the back of the shop where feliks stood they stared at one another feliks thought she loves me why else would she come he meant to speak to her but instead he threw his arms around her and kissed her she kissed him back hungrily opening her mouth hugging him digging her fingers into his back it was always like that with them when they met they threw themselves at one another like animals about to fight they met twice more in the bookshop and once after dark in the garden of the shatov house that time in the garden she was in her nightclothes feliks put his hands under the woolen nightgown and touched her body all over as boldly as if she were a street girl feeling and exploring and rubbing and all she did was moan she gave him money so that he could rent a room of his own and thereafter she came to see him almost every day for six astonishing weeks the last time was in the early evening he was sitting at the table wrapped in a blanket against the cold reading proudhons what is property by candlelight when he heard her footstep on the stairs he took his trousers off she rushed in wearing an old brown cloak with a hood she kissed him sucked his lips bit his chin and pinched his sides she turned and threw off the cloak underneath it she was wearing a white evening gown that must have cost hundreds of rubles unfasten me quickly she said feliks began to undo the hooks at the back of the dress im on my way to a reception at the british embassy i only have an hour she said breathlessly hurry please in his haste he ripped one of the hooks out of the material damn ive torn it never mind she stepped out of the dress then pulled off her petticoats her chemise and her drawers leaving on her corset hose and shoes she flung herself into his arms as she was kissing him she pulled down his underpants she said oh god i love the smell of your thing when she talked dirty it drove him wild she pulled her breasts out of the top of her corset and said bite them bite them hard i want to feel them all evening a moment later she pulled away from him she lay on her back on the bed where the corset ended moisture glistened in the sparse blond hair between her thighs she spread her legs and lifted them into the air opening herself to him he gazed at her for a moment then fell on her she grabbed his penis with her hands and pushed it inside her greedily the heels of her shoes tore the skin of his back and he did not care look at me she said look at me he looked at her with adoration in his eyes an expression of panic came over her face she said look at me im coming then still staring into his eyes she opened her mouth and screamed do you think other people are like us she said in what way filthy he lifted his head from her lap and grinned only the lucky ones she looked at his body curled up between her legs youre so compact and strong youre perfect she said look how your belly is flat and how neat your bottom is and how lean and hard your thighs are she ran a finger along the line of his nose you have the face of a prince im a peasant not when youre naked she was in a reflective mood before i met you i was interested in mens bodies and all that but i used to pretend i wasnt even to myself then you came along and i just couldnt pretend anymore he licked the inside of her thigh she shuddered have you ever done this to another girl no did you use to pretend as well no i think i knew that somehow theres a look about you wild and free like an animal you never obey anyone you just do what you want i never before met a girl who would let me they all wanted to really any girl would why he said egotistically because your face is so cruel and your eyes are so kind is that why you let me kiss you in the bookshop i didnt let youi had no choice you could have yelled for help afterward by then all i wanted was for you to do it again i must have guessed what you were really like it was her turn to be egotistical what am i really like cold as ice on the surface hot as hell below she giggled im such an actor everyone in st petersburg thinks im so good im held up as an example to younger girls just like anna karenina now that i know how bad i really am i have to pretend to be twice as virginal as before you cant be twice as virginal as anything i wonder if theyre all pretending she resumed take my father if he knew i was here like this hed die of rage but he must have had the same feelings when he was youngdont you think i think its an imponderable feliks said but what would he do really if he found out horsewhip you hed have to catch me first feliks was struck by a thought how old are you almost eighteen my god i could go to jail for seducing you id make father get you out he rolled over on to his front and looked at her what are we going to do lydia when in the long term were going to be lovers until i come of age and then well get married he stared at her do you mean that of course she seemed genuinely surprised that he had not made the same assumption what else could we do you want to marry me yes isnt that what you want oh yes he breathed thats what i want she sat up with her legs spread on either side of his face and stroked his hair then thats what well do feliks said you never tell me how you manage to get away to come here its not very interesting she said i tell lies i bribe servants and i take risks tonight for example the reception at the embassy starts at half past six i left home at six oclock and ill get there at a quarter past seven the carriage is in the parkthe coachman thinks im taking a walk with my maid the maid is outside this house dreaming about how she will spend the ten rubles i will give her for keeping her mouth shut its ten to seven feliks said oh god quick do it to me with your tongue before i have to go that night feliks was asleep dreaming about lydia s fatherwhom he had never seenwhen they burst into his room carrying lamps he woke instantly and jumped out of bed at first he thought students from the university were playing a prank on him then one of them punched his face and kicked him in the stomach and he knew they were the secret police he assumed they were arresting him on account of lydia and he was terrified for her would she be publicly disgraced was her father crazy enough to make her give evidence in court against her lover he watched the police put all his books and a bundle of letters in a sack the books were all borrowed but none of the owners was foolish enough to put his name inside the letters were from his father and his sister natashahe had never had any letters from lydia and now he was thankful for that he was marched out of the building and thrown into a fourwheeled cab they drove across the chain bridge and then followed the canals as if avoiding the main streets feliks asked am i going to the litovsky prison nobody replied but when they went over the palace bridge he realized he was being taken to the notorious fortress of st peter and st paul and his heart sank on the other side of the bridge the carriage turned left and entered a darkened arched passage it stopped at a gate feliks was taken into a reception hall where an army officer looked at him and wrote something in a book he was put in the cab again and driven deeper into the fortress they stopped at another gate and waited several minutes until it was opened from the inside by a soldier from there feliks had to walk through a series of narrow passages to a third iron gate which led to a large damp room the prison governor sat at a table he said you are charged with being an anarchist do you admit it feliks was elated so this was nothing to do with lydia admit it he said i boast of it one of the policemen produced a book which was signed by the governor feliks was stripped naked then given a green flannel dressing gown a pair of woolen stockings and two yellow felt slippers much too big from there an armed soldier took him through more gloomy corridors to a cell a heavy oak door closed behind him and he heard a key turn in the lock the cell contained a bed a table a stool and a washstand the window was an embrasure in an enormously thick wall the floor was covered with painted felt and the walls were cushioned with some kind of yellow upholstery feliks sat on the bed this was where peter i had tortured and killed his own son this was where princess tarakanova had been kept in a cell which flooded so that the rats climbed all over her to save themselves from drowning this was where catherine ii buried her enemies alive dostoyevsky had been imprisoned here feliks thought proudly so had bakunin who had been chained to a wall for two years nechayev had died here feliks was at once elated to be in such heroic company and terrified at the thought that he might be here forever the key turned in the lock a little bald man with spectacles came in carrying a pen a bottle of ink and some paper he set them down on the table and said write the names of all the subversives you know feliks sat down and wrote karl marx friedrich engels peter kropotkin jesus christ the bald man snatched away the paper he went to the door of the cell and knocked two hefty guards came in they strapped feliks to the table and took off his slippers and stockings they began to lash the soles of his feet with canes the torture went on all night when they pulled out his fingernails he began to give them madeup names and addresses but they told him they knew they were false when they burned the skin of his testicles with a candle flame he named all his student friends but still they said he was lying each time he passed out they revived him sometimes they would stop for a while and allow him to think it was all over at last then they would begin again and he would beg them to kill him so that the pain would stop they carried on long after he had told them everything he knew it must have been around dawn that he passed out for the last time when he came round he was lying on the bed there were bandages on his feet and hands he was in agony he wanted to kill himself but he was too weak to move the bald man came into the cell in the evening when he saw him feliks began to sob with terror the man just smiled and went away he never came back a doctor came to see feliks each day feliks tried without success to pump him for information did anyone outside know that feliks was here had there been any messages had anyone tried to visit the doctor just changed the dressings and went away feliks speculated lydia would have gone to his room and found the place in disarray someone in the house would have told her the secret police had taken him away what would she have done then would she make frantic inquiries careless of her reputation would she have been discreet and gone quietly to see the minister of the interior with some story about the boyfriend of her maid having been jailed in error every day he hoped for word from her but it never came eight weeks later he could walk almost normally and they released him without explanation he went to his lodging he expected to find a message from her there but there was nothing and his room had been let to someone else he wondered why lydia had not continued to pay the rent he went to her house and knocked at the front door a servant answered feliks said feliks davidovich kschessinsky presents his compliments to lydia shatova the servant slammed the door finally he went to the bookshop the old bookseller said hello ive got a message for you it was brought yesterday by her maid feliks tore open the envelope with trembling fingers it was written not by lydia but by the maid it read i have been let go and have no job it is all your fault she is wed and gone to england yesterday now you know the wages of sin he looked up at the bookseller with tears of anguish in his eyes is that all he cried he learned no more for nineteen years normal regulations had been temporarily suspended in the walden house and charlotte sat in the kitchen with the servants the kitchen was spotless for of course the family had dined out the fire had gone out in the great range and the high windows were wide open letting in the cool night air the crockery used for servants meals was racked neatly in the dresser the cooks knives and spoons hung from a row of hooks her innumerable bowls and pans were out of sight in the massive oak cupboards charlotte had had no time to be frightened at first when the coach stopped so abruptly in the park she had been merely puzzled and after that her concern had been to stop mama screaming when they got home she had found herself a little shaky but now looking back she found the whole thing rather exciting the servants felt the same way it was very reassuring to sit around the massive bleached wooden table and talk things over with these people who were so much a part of her life the cook who had always been motherly pritchard whom charlotte respected because papa respected him the efficient and capable mrs mitchell who as housekeeper always had a solution to any problem william the coachman was the hero of the hour he described several times the wild look in his assailants eyes as the man menaced him with the gun basking in the awestruck gaze of the underhouseparlormaid he recovered rapidly from the indignity of having walked into the kitchen stark naked of course pritchard explained i naturally presumed the thief just wanted williams clothes i knew charles was at the palace so he could drive the coach i thought i wouldnt inform the police until after speaking to his lordship charles the footman said imagine how i felt when i found the carriage gone i said to myself im sure it was left here oh well i thinks williams moved it i run up and down the mall i look everywhere in the end i go back to the palace heres trouble i says to the doorman the earl of waldens carriage has gone missing he says to me walden he saysnot very respectful mrs mitchell interrupted palace servants they think theyre better than the nobility he says to me waldens gone mate i thought gorblimey im for it i come running through the park and halfway home i find the carriage and my lady having hysterics and my lord with blood on his sword mrs mitchell said and after all that nothing stolen a lewnatic said charles an ingenious lewnatic there was general agreement the cook poured the tea and served charlotte first how is my lady now she said oh shes all right charlotte said she went to bed and took a dose of laudanum she must be asleep by now and the gentlemen papa and prince orlov are in the drawing room having a brandy the cook sighed heavily robbers in the park and suffragettes at the courti dont know what were coming to therell be a socialist revolution said charles you mark my words well all be murdered in our beds the cook said lugubriously charlotte said what did the suffragette mean about the king torturing women as she spoke she looked at pritchard who was sometimes willing to explain to her things she was not supposed to know about she was talking about forcefeeding pritchard said apparently its painful forcefeeding when they wont eat theyre fed by force charlotte was mystified how on earth is that done several ways said pritchard with a look that indicated he would not go into detail about all of them a tube through the nostrils is one the underhouseparlormaid said i wonder what they feed them charles said probably ot soup i cant believe this charlotte said why should they refuse to eat its a protest said pritchard makes difficulties for the prison authorities prison charlotte was astonished why are they in prison for breaking windows making bombs disturbing the peace but what do they want there was a silence as the servants realized that charlotte had no idea what a suffragette was finally pritchard said they want votes for women oh charlotte thought did i know that women couldnt vote she was not sure she had never thought about that sort of thing i think this discussion has gone quite far enough said mrs mitchell firmly youll be in trouble mr pritchard for putting wrong ideas into my ladys head charlotte knew that pritchard never got in trouble because he was practically papas friend she said i wonder why they care so much about something like voting there was a ring and they all looked instinctively at the bell board front door said pritchard at this time of night he went out pulling on his coat charlotte drank her tea she felt tired the suffragettes were puzzling and rather frightening she decided but all the same she wanted to know more pritchard came back plate of sandwiches please cook he said charles take a fresh soda siphon to the drawing room he began to arrange plates and napkins on a tray well come on charlotte said who is it a gentleman from scotland yard said pritchard basil thomson was a bulletheaded man with lightcolored receding hair a heavy mustache and a penetrating gaze walden had heard of him his father had been archbishop of york thomson had been educated at eton and oxford and had done service in the colonies as a native commissioner and as prime minister of tonga he had come home to qualify as a barrister and then had worked in the prison service ending up as governor of dartmoor prison with a reputation as a riot breaker from prisons he had gravitated toward police work and had become an expert on the mixed criminalanarchist milieu of londons east end this expertise had got him the top job in the special branch the political police force walden sat him down and began to recount the evenings events as he spoke he kept an eye on aleks the boy was superficially calm but his face was pale he sipped steadily at a glass of brandyandsoda and his left hand clutched rhythmically at the arm of his chair at one point thomson interrupted walden saying did you notice when the carriage picked you up that the footman was missing yes i did walden said i asked the coachman where he was but the coachman seemed not to hear then because there was such a crush at the palace door and my daughter was telling me to hurry up i decided not to press the matter until we got home our villain was relying on that of course he must have a cool nerve go on the carriage stopped suddenly in the park and the door was thrown open by the man what did he look like tall he had a scarf or something over his face dark hair staring eyes all criminals have staring eyes thomson said earlier on had the coachman got a better look at him not much at that time the man wore a hat and of course it was dark hm and then walden took a deep breath at the time he had been not so much frightened as angry but now when he looked back on it he was full of fear for what might have happened to aleks or lydia or charlotte he said lady walden screamed and that seemed to disconcert the fellow perhaps he had not expected to find any women in the coach anyway he hesitated and thank god he did he thought i poked him with my sword and he dropped the gun did you do him much damage i doubt it i couldnt get a swing in that confined space and of course the sword isnt particularly sharp i bloodied him though i wish i had chopped off his damned head the butler came in and conversation stopped walden realized he had been talking rather loudly he tried to calm himself pritchard served sandwiches and brandyandsoda to the three men walden said youd better stay up pritchard but you can send everyone else to bed very good my lord when he had gone walden said it is possible that this was just a robbery i have let the servants think that and lady walden and charlotte too however a robber would hardly have needed such an elaborate plan to my mind i am perfectly certain that it was an attempt on alekss life thomson looked at aleks im afraid i agree have you any idea how he knew where to find you aleks crossed his legs my movements havent been secret that must change tell me sir has your life ever been threatened i live with threats aleks said tightly there has never been an attempt before is there any reason why you in particular should be the target of nihilists or revolutionists for them it is enough that i am a pprince walden realized that the problems of the english establishment with suffragettes and liberals and trade unions were trivial by comparison with what the russians had to cope with and he felt a surge of sympathy for aleks aleks went on in a quiet controlled voice however i am known to be something of a reformer by russian standards they could pick a more appropriate victim even in london thomson agreed theres always a russian aristocrat or two in london for the season walden said what are you getting at thomson said im wondering whether the villain knew what prince orlov is doing here and whether his motive for tonights attack was to sabotage your talks walden was dubious how would the revolutionists have found that out im just speculating thomson replied would this be an effective way to sabotage your talks very effective indeed walden said the thought made him go cold if the czar were to be told that his nephew had been assassinated in london by a revolutionistespecially if it were an expatriate russian revolutionisthe would go through the roof you know thomson how the russians feel about our having their subversives hereour opendoor policy has caused friction at the diplomatic level for years something like this could destroy anglorussian relations for twenty years there would be no question of an alliance then thomson nodded i was afraid of that well theres no more we can do tonight ill set my department to work at dawn well search the park for clues and interview your servants and i expect well round up a few anarchists in the east end aleks said do you think you will catch the man walden longed for thomson to give a reassuring answer but it was not forthcoming it wont be easy thomson said hes obviously a planner so hell have a bolthole somewhere weve no proper description of him unless his wounds take him to hospital our chances are slim he may try to kill me again aleks said so we must take evasive action i propose you should move out of this house tomorrow well take the top floor of one of the hotels for you in a false name and give you a bodyguard lord walden will have to meet with you secretly and youll have to cut out social engagements of course of course thomson stood up its very late ill set all this in motion walden rang for pritchard youve got a carriage waiting thomson yes let us speak on the telephone tomorrow morning pritchard saw thomson out and aleks went off to bed walden told pritchard to lock up then went upstairs he was not sleepy as he undressed he let himself relax and feel all the conflicting emotions that he had so far held at bay he felt proud of himself at firstafter all he thought i drew a sword and fought off an assailant not bad for a man of fifty with a gouty leg then he became depressed when he recalled how coolly they had all discussed the diplomatic consequences of the death of aleksbright cheerful shy handsome clever aleks whom walden had seen grow into a man he got into bed and lay awake reliving the moment when the carriage door flew open and the man stood there with the gun and now he was frightened not for himself or aleks but for lydia and charlotte the thought that they might have been killed made him tremble in his bed he remembered holding charlotte in his arms eighteen years ago when she had blond hair and no teeth he remembered her learning to walk and forever falling on her bottom he remembered giving her a pony of her own and thinking that her joy when she saw it gave him the biggest thrill of his life he remembered her just a few hours ago walking into the royal presence with her head held high a grown woman and a beautiful one if she died he thought i dont know that i could bear it and lydia if lydia were dead i would be alone the thought made him get up and go through to her room there was a nightlight beside her bed she was in a deep sleep lying on her back her mouth a little open her hair a blond skein across the pillow she looked soft and vulnerable i have never been able to make you understand how much i love you he thought suddenly he needed to touch her to feel that she was warm and alive he got into bed with her and kissed her her lips responded but she did not wake up lydia he thought i could not live without you lydia had lain awake for a long time thinking about the man with the gun it had been a brutal shock and she had screamed in sheer terrorbut there was more to it than that there had been something about the man something about his stance or his shape or his clothes that had seemed dreadfully sinister in an almost supernatural way as if he were a ghost she wished she could have seen his eyes after a while she had taken another dose of laudanum and then she slept she dreamed that the man with the gun came to her room and got into bed with her it was her own bed but in the dream she was eighteen years old again the man put his gun down on the white pillow beside her head he still had the scarf around his face she realized that she loved him she kissed his lips through the scarf he made love to her beautifully she began to think that she might be dreaming she wanted to see his face she said who are you and a voice said stephen she knew this was not so but the gun on the pillow had somehow turned into stephens sword with blood on its point and she began to have doubts she clung to the man on top of her afraid that the dream would end before she was satisfied then dimly she began to suspect that she was doing in reality what she was doing in the dream yet the dream persisted strong physical pleasure possessed her she began to lose control just as her climax began the man in the dream took the scarf from his face and in that moment lydia opened her eyes and saw stephens face above her and then she was overcome by ecstasy and for the first time in nineteen years she cried for joy five charlotte looked forward with mixed feelings to belindas comingout ball she had never been to a town ball although she had been to lots of country balls many of them at walden hall she liked to dance and she knew she did it well but she hated the cattlemarket business of sitting out with the wallflowers and waiting for a boy to pick you out and ask you to dance she wondered whether this might be handled in a more civilized way among the smart set they got to uncle george and aunt clarissas mayfair house half an hour before midnight which mama said was the earliest time one could decently arrive at a london ball a striped canopy and a red carpet led from the curb to the garden gate which had somehow been transformed into a roman triumphal arch but even that did not prepare charlotte for what she saw when she passed through the arch the whole side garden had been turned into a roman atrium she gazed about her in wonderment the lawns and the flower beds had been covered over with a hardwood dance floor stained in black and white squares to look like marble tiles a colonnade of white pillars linked with chains of laurel bordered the floor beyond the pillars in a kind of cloister there were raised benches for the sittersout in the middle of the floor a fountain in the form of a boy with a dolphin splashed in a marble basin the streams of water lit by colored spotlights on the balcony of an upstairs bedroom a band played ragtime garlands of smilax and roses decorated the walls and baskets of begonias hung from the balcony a huge canvas roof painted sky blue covered the whole area from the eaves of the house to the garden wall its a miracle charlotte said papa said to his brother quite a crowd george we invited eight hundred what the devil happened to you in the park oh it wasnt as bad as it sounded papa said with a forced smile he took george by the arm and they moved to one side to talk charlotte studied the guests all the men wore full evening dresswhite tie white waistcoat and tails it particularly suited the young men or at least the slim men charlotte thought it made them look quite dashing as they danced observing the dresses she decided that hers and her mothers though rather tasteful were a trifle oldfashioned with their wasp waists and ruffles and sweepers aunt clarissa wore a long straight slender gown with a skirt almost too tight to dance in and belinda had harem pants charlotte realized she knew nobody who will dance with me she wondered after papa and uncle george however aunt clarissas younger brother jonathan waltzed with her then introduced her to three men who were at oxford with him each of whom danced with her she found their conversation monotonous they said the floor was good and the bandgottliebswas good then they ran out of steam charlotte tried do you believe that women should have the vote the replies she got were certainly not no opinion and youre not one of them are you the last of her partners whose name was freddie took her into the house for supper he was a rather sleek young man with regular featureshandsome i suppose charlotte thoughtand fair hair he was at the end of his first year at oxford oxford was rather jolly he said but he confessed he was not much of a one for reading books and he rather thought he would not go back in october the inside of the house was festooned with flowers and bright with electric light for supper there were hot and cold soup lobster quail strawberries ice cream and hothouse peaches always the same old food for supper freddie said they all use the same caterer do you go to a lot of balls charlotte asked fraid so all the time really in the season charlotte drank a glass of champagnecup in the hope that it would make her feel more gay then she left freddie and wandered through a series of reception rooms in one of them several games of bridge were under way two elderly duchesses held court in another in a third older men played billiards while younger men smoked charlotte found belinda there with a cigarette in her hand charlotte had never seen the point of tobacco unless one wanted to look sophisticated belinda certainly looked sophisticated i adore your dress belinda said no you dont but you look sensational how did you persuade your stepmother to let you dress like that shed like to wear one herself she seems so much younger than my mama which she is of course and being a stepmother makes a difference whatever happened to you after the court oh it was extraordinary a madman pointed a gun at us your mama was telling me werent you simply terrified i was too busy calming mama afterward i was scared to death why did you say at the palace that you wanted to have a long talk with me ah listen she took charlotte aside away from the young men ive discovered how they come out what babies oh charlotte was all ears do tell belinda lowered her voice they come out between your legs where you make water its too small it stretches how awful charlotte thought but thats not all belinda said ive found out how they start how belinda took charlottes elbow and they walked to the far side of the room they stood in front of a mirror garlanded with roses belindas voice fell almost to a whisper when you get married you know you have to go to bed with your husband do you yes papa and mama have separate bedrooms dont they adjoin yes thats so that they can get into the same bed why because to start a baby the husband has to put his pego into that placewhere the babies come out whats a pego hush its a thing men have between their legshavent you ever seen a picture of michelangelos david no well its a thing they make water with looks like a finger and you have to do that to start babies yes and all married people have to do it yes how dreadful who told you all this viola pontadarvy she swore it was true and somehow charlotte knew it was true hearing it was like being reminded of something she had forgotten it seemed unaccountably to make sense yet she felt physically shocked it was the slightly queasy feeling she sometimes got in dreams when a terrible suspicion turned out to be correct or when she was afraid of falling and suddenly found she was falling im jolly glad you found out she said if one got married without knowing how embarrassing it would be your mother is supposed to explain it all to you the night before your wedding but if your mother is too shy you just find out when it happens thank heaven for viola pontadarvy charlotte was struck by a thought has all this got something to do with bleeding you know every month i dont know i expect it has its all connectedall the things people dont talk about well now we know why they dont talk about itits so disgusting the thing you have to do in bed is called sexual intercourse but viola says the common people call it swiving she knows a lot shes got brothers they told her years ago how did they find out from older boys at school boys are ever so interested in that sort of thing well charlotte said it does have a sort of horrid fascination suddenly she saw in the mirror the reflection of aunt clarissa what are you two doing huddled in a corner she said charlotte flushed but apparently aunt clarissa did not want an answer for she went on do please move around and talk to people belindait is your party she went away and the two girls moved on through the reception rooms the rooms were arranged on a circular plan so that you could walk through them all and end up where you had started at the top of the staircase charlotte said i dont think i could ever bring myself to do it couldnt you belinda said with a funny look what do you mean i dont know ive been thinking about it it might be quite nice charlotte stared at her belinda looked embarrassed i must go and dance she said see you later on she went down the stairs charlotte watched her go and wondered how many more shocking secrets life had to reveal she went back into the supper room and got another glass of champagnecup what a peculiar way for the human race to perpetuate itself she thought she supposed animals did something similar what about birds no birds had eggs and such words pego and swiving all these hundreds of elegant and refined people around her knew those words but never mentioned them because they were never mentioned they were embarrassing because they were embarrassing they were never mentioned there was something very silly about the whole thing if the creator had ordained that people should swive why pretend that they did not she finished her drink and went outside to the dance floor papa and mama were dancing a polka and doing it rather well mama had got over the incident in the park but it still preyed on papas mind he looked very fine in white tie and tails when his leg was bad he would not dance but obviously it was giving him no trouble tonight he was surprisingly light on his feet for a big man mama seemed to be having a wonderful time she was able to let herself go a bit when she danced her usual studied reserve fell away and she smiled radiantly and let her ankles show when the polka was over papa caught charlottes eye and came over may i have this dance lady charlotte certainly my lord it was a waltz papa seemed distracted but he whirled her around the floor expertly she wondered whether she looked radiant like mama probably not suddenly she thought of papa and mama swiving and found the idea terribly embarrassing papa said are you enjoying your first big ball yes thank you she said dutifully you seem thoughtful im on my best behavior the lights and the bright colors blurred slightly and suddenly she had to concentrate on staying upright she was afraid she might fall over and look foolish papa sensed her unsteadiness and held her a little more firmly a moment later the dance ended papa took her off the floor he said are you feeling quite well fine but i was dizzy for a moment have you been smoking charlotte laughed certainly not thats the usual reason young ladies feel dizzy at balls take my advice when you want to try tobacco do it in private i dont think i want to try it she sat out the next dance and then freddie turned up again as she danced with him it occurred to her that all the young men and girls including freddie and herself were supposed to be looking for husbands or wives during the season especially at balls like this for the first time she considered freddie as a possible husband for herself it was unthinkable then what kind of husband do i want she wondered she really had no idea freddie said jonathan just said freddie meet charlotte but i gather youre called lady charlotte walden yes who are you marquis of chalfont actually so charlotte thought were socially compatible a little later she and freddie got into conversation with belinda and freddies friends they talked about a new play called pygmalion which was said to be absolutely hilarious but quite vulgar the boys spoke of going to a boxing match and belinda said she wanted to go too but they all said it was out of the question they discussed jazz music one of the boys was something of a connoisseur having lived for a while in the united states but freddie disliked it and talked rather pompously about the negrification of society they all drank coffee and belinda smoked another cigarette charlotte began to enjoy herself it was charlottes mama who came along and broke up the party your father and i are leaving she said shall we send the coach back for you charlotte realized she was tired no ill come she said what time is it four oclock they went to get their wraps mama said did you have a lovely evening yes thank you mama so did i who were those young men they know jonathan were they nice the conversation got quite interesting in the end papa had called the carriage already as they drove away from the bright lights of the party charlotte remembered what had happened last time they rode in a carriage and she felt scared papa held mamas hand they seemed happy charlotte felt excluded she looked out of the window in the dawn light she could see four men in silk hats walking up park lane going home from some nightclub perhaps as the carriage rounded hyde park corner charlotte saw something odd whats that she said mama looked out whats what dear on the pavement looks like people thats right what are they doing sleeping charlotte was horrified there were eight or ten of them up against a wall bundled in coats blankets and newspapers she could not tell whether they were men or women but some of the bundles were small enough to be children she said why do they sleep there i dont know dear mama said papa said because theyve nowhere else to sleep of course they have no homes no i didnt know there was anyone that poor charlotte said how dreadful she thought of all the rooms in uncle georges house the food that had been laid out to be picked at by eight hundred people all of whom had had dinner and the elaborate gowns they wore new each season while people slept under newspapers she said we should do something for them we papa said what should we do build houses for them all of them how many are there papa shrugged thousands thousands i thought it was just those few charlotte was devastated couldnt you build small houses theres no profit in house property especially at that end of the market perhaps you should do it anyway why because the strong should take care of the weak ive heard you say that to mr samson samson was the bailiff at walden hall and he was always trying to save money on repairs to tenanted cottages we already take care of rather a lot of people papa said all the servants whose wages we pay all the tenants who farm our land and live in our cottages all the workers in the companies we invest in all the government employees who are paid out of our taxes i dont think thats much of an excuse charlotte interrupted those poor people are sleeping on the street what will they do in winter mama said sharply your papa doesnt need excuses he was born an aristocrat and he has managed his estate carefully he is entitled to his wealth those people on the pavement are idlers criminals drunkards and neerdowells even the children dont be impertinent remember you still have a great deal to learn im just beginning to realize how much charlotte said as the carriage turned into the courtyard of their house charlotte glimpsed one of the street sleepers beside the gate she decided she would take a closer look the coach stopped beside the front door charles handed mama down then charlotte charlotte ran across the courtyard william was closing the gates just a minute charlotte called she heard papa say what the devil she ran out into the street the sleeper was a woman she lay slumped on the pavement with her shoulders against the courtyard wall she wore a mans boots woolen stockings a dirty blue coat and a very large oncefashionable hat with a bunch of grubby artificial flowers in its brim her head was slumped sideways and her face was turned toward charlotte there was something familiar about the round face and the wide mouth the woman was young charlotte cried annie the sleeper opened her eyes charlotte stared at her in horror two months ago annie had been a housemaid at walden hall in a crisp clean uniform with a little white hat on her head a pretty girl with a large bosom and an irrepressible laugh annie what happened to you annie scrambled to her feet and bobbed a pathetic curtsy oh lady charlotte i was hoping i would see you you was always good to me ive nowhere to turn but how did you get like this i was let go mlady without a character when they found out i was expecting the baby i know i done wrong but youre not married but i was courting jimmy the undergardener charlotte recalled belindas revelations and realized that if all that was true it would indeed be possible for girls to have babies without being married where is the baby i lost it you lost it i mean it came too early mlady it was born dead how horrible charlotte whispered that was something else she had not known to be possible and why isnt jimmy with you he run away to sea he did love me i know but he was frightened to wedhe was only seventeen annie began to cry charlotte heard papas voice charlotte come in this instant she turned to him he stood at the gate in his evening clothes with his silk hat in his hand and suddenly she saw him as a big smug cruel old man she said this is one of the servants you care for so well papa looked at the girl annie what is the meaning of this annie said jimmy run away mlord so i couldnt wed and i couldnt get another position because you never gave me a character and i was ashamed to go home so i come to london you came to london to beg papa said harshly papa charlotte cried you dont understand charlotte i understand perfectly well mama appeared and said charlotte get away from that creature shes not a creature shes annie annie mama shrilled shes a fallen woman thats enough papa said this family does not hold discussions in the street let us go in immediately charlotte put her arm around annie she needs a bath new clothes and a hot breakfast dont be ridiculous mama said the sight of annie seemed to have made her almost hysterical all right papa said take her into the kitchen the parlormaids will be up by now tell them to take care of her then come and see me in the drawing room mama said stephen this is insane let us go in said papa they went in charlotte took annie downstairs to the kitchen a skivvy was cleaning the range and a kitchenmaid was slicing bacon for breakfast it was just past five oclock charlotte had not realized they started work so early they both looked at her in astonishment when she walked in in her ball gown with annie at her side charlotte said this is annie she used to work at walden hall shes had some bad luck but shes a good girl she must have a bath find new clothes for her and burn her old ones then give her breakfast for a moment they were both dumbstruck then the kitchenmaid said very good mlady ill see you later annie charlotte said annie seized charlottes arm oh thank you mlady charlotte went out now there will be trouble she thought as she went upstairs she did not care as much as she might have she almost felt that her parents had betrayed her what had her years of education been for when in one night she could find out that the most important things had never been taught her no doubt they talked of protecting young girls but charlotte thought deceit might be the appropriate term when she thought of how ignorant she had been until tonight she felt so foolish and that made her angry she marched into the drawing room papa stood beside the fireplace holding a glass mama sat at the piano playing doubleminor chords with a pained expression on her face they had drawn back the curtains the room looked odd in the morning with yesterdays cigar butts in the ashtrays and the cold early light on the edges of things it was an evening room and wanted lamps and warmth drinks and footmen and a crowd of people in formal clothes everything looked different today now then charlotte papa began you dont understand what kind of woman annie is we let her go for a reason you know she did something very wrong which i cannot explain to you i know what she did charlotte said sitting down and i know who she did it with a gardener called jimmy mama gasped papa said i dont believe you have any idea what youre talking about and if i havent whose fault is it charlotte burst out how did i manage to reach the age of eighteen without learning that some people are so poor they sleep in the street that maids who are expecting babies get dismissed and thatthatmen are not made the same as women dont stand there telling me i dont understand these things and i have a lot to learn ive spent all my life learning and now i discover most of it was lies how dare you how dare you she burst into tears and hated herself for losing control she heard mama say oh this is too foolish papa sat beside her and took her hand im sorry you feel that way he said all young girls are kept in ignorance of certain things it is done for their own good we have never lied to you if we did not tell you just how cruel and coarse the world is that was only because we wanted you to enjoy your childhood for as long as possible perhaps we made a mistake mama snapped we wanted to keep you out of the trouble that annie got into i wouldnt put it quite like that papa said mildly charlottes rage evaporated she felt like a child again she wanted to put her head on papas shoulder but her pride would not let her shall we forgive each other and be pals again papa said an idea which had been quietly budding in charlottes mind now blossomed and she spoke without thinking would you let me take annie as my personal maid papa said well we wont even think of it mama said hysterically it is quite out of the question that an eighteenyearold girl who is the daughter of an earl should have a scarlet woman as a maid no absolutely and finally no then what will she do charlotte asked calmly she should have thought of that whenshe should have thought of that before papa said charlotte we cannot possibly have a woman of bad character live in this house even if i would allow it the servants would be scandalized half of them would give notice we shall hear mutterings even now just because the girl has been allowed into the kitchen you see it is not just mama and i who shun such peopleit is the whole of society then i shall buy her a house charlotte said and give her an allowance and be her friend youve no money mama said my russian grandfather left me something papa said but the money is in my care until you reach the age of twentyone and i will not allow it to be used for that purpose then what is to be done with her charlotte said desperately ill make a bargain with you papa said i will give her money to get decent lodgings and ill see that she gets a job in a factory what would be my part of the bargain you must promise not to try to make contact with her ever charlotte felt very tired papa had all the answers she could no longer argue with him and she did not have the power to insist she sighed all right she said good girl now then i suggest you go and find her and tell her the arrangement then say goodbye im not sure i can look her in the eye papa patted her hand she will be very grateful youll see when youve spoken to her you go to bed ill see to all the details charlotte did not know whether she had won or lost whether papa was being cruel or kind whether annie should feel saved or spurned very well she said wearily she wanted to tell papa that she loved him but the words would not come after a moment she got up and left the room on the day after the fiasco feliks was awakened at noon by bridget he felt very weak bridget stood beside his bed with a large cup in her hand feliks sat up and took the cup the drink was wonderful it seemed to consist of hot milk sugar melted butter and lumps of bread while he drank it bridget moved around his room tidying up singing a sentimental song about boys who gave their lives for ireland she went away and came back again with another irishwoman of her own age who was a nurse the woman stitched his hand and put a dressing on the puncture wound in his shoulder feliks gathered from the conversation that she was the local abortionist bridget told her that feliks had been in a fight in a pub the nurse charged a shilling for the visit and said you wont die if youd had yourself seen to straightaway you wouldnt have bled so much as it is youll feel weak for days when she had gone bridget talked to him she was a heavy goodnatured woman in her late fifties her husband had got into some kind of trouble in ireland and they had fled to the anonymity of london where he died of the booze she said she had two sons who were policemen in new york and a daughter who was in service in belfast there was a vein of bitterness in her which showed in an occasional sarcastically humorous remark usually at the expense of the english while she was explaining why ireland should have home rule feliks went to sleep she woke him again in the evening to give him hot soup on the following day his physical wounds began visibly to heal and he started to feel the pain of his emotional wounds all the despair and selfreproach which he had felt in the park as he ran away now came back to him running away how could it happen lydia she was now lady walden he felt nauseated he made himself think clearly and coolly he had known that she married and went to england obviously the englishman she married was likely to be both an aristocrat and a man with a strong interest in russia equally obviously the person who negotiated with orlov had to be a member of the establishment and an expert on russian affairs i couldnt have guessed it would turn out to be the same man feliks thought but i should have realized the possibility the coincidence was not as remarkable as it had seemed but it was no less shattering twice in his life feliks had been utterly blindly deliriously happy the first time was when at the age of fourbefore his mother diedhe had been given a red ball the second was when lydia fell in love with him but the red ball had never been taken from him he could not imagine a greater happiness than that which he had had with lydianor a disappointment more appalling than the one that followed there had certainly been no such highs and lows in felikss emotional life since then after she left he began to tramp the russian countryside dressed as a monk preaching the anarchist gospel he told the peasants that the land was theirs because they tilled it that the wood in the forest belonged to anyone who felled a tree that nobody had a right to govern them except themselves and because selfgovernment was no government it was called anarchy he was a wonderful preacher and he made many friends but he never fell in love again and he hoped he never would his preaching phase had ended in during the national student strike when he was arrested as an agitator and sent to siberia the years of wandering had already inured him to cold hunger and pain but now working in a chain gang using wooden tools to dig out gold in a mine laboring on when the man chained to his side had fallen dead seeing boys and women flogged he came to know darkness bitterness despair and finally hatred in siberia he had learned the facts of life steal or starve hide or be beaten fight or die there he had acquired cunning and ruthlessness there he had learned the ultimate truth about oppression that it works by turning its victims against each other instead of against their oppressors he escaped and began the long journey into madness which ended when he killed the policeman outside omsk and realized that he had no fear he returned to civilization as a fullblooded revolutionist it seemed incredible to him that he had once scrupled to throw bombs at the noblemen who maintained those siberian convict mines he was enraged by the governmentinspired pogroms against the jews in the west and south of russia he was sickened by the wrangling between bolsheviks and mensheviks at the second congress of the social democratic party he was inspired by the magazine that came from geneva called bread and liberty with the quote from bakunin on its masthead the urge to destroy is also a creative urge finally hating the government disenchanted with the socialists and convinced by the anarchists he went to a mill town called bialystock and founded a group called struggle those had been the glory years he would never forget young nisan farber who had knifed the millowner outside the synagogue on the day of atonement feliks himself had shot the chief of police then he took the fight to st petersburg where he founded another anarchist group the unauthorized and planned the successful assassination of the grand duke sergey that yearin st petersburg there were killings bank robberies strikes and riots the revolution seemed only days away then came the repressionmore fierce more efficient and a great deal more bloodthirsty than anything the revolutionists had ever done the secret police came in the middle of the night to the homes of the unauthorized and they were all arrested except feliks who killed one policeman and maimed another and escaped to switzerland for by then nobody could stop him he was so determined and powerful and angry and ruthless in all those years and even in the quiet years in switzerland that followed he had never loved anyone there had been people of whom he had grown mildly fonda pigkeeper in georgia an old jewish bombmaker in bialystock ulrich in genevabut they tended to pass into and then out of his life there had been women too many women sensed his violent nature and shied away from him but those of them who found him attractive found him extremely so occasionally he had yielded to the temptation and he had always been more or less disappointed his parents were both dead and he had not seen his sister for twenty years looking back he could see his life since lydia as a slow slide into anesthesia he had survived by becoming less and less sensitive through the experiences of imprisonment torture the chain gang and the long brutal escape from siberia he no longer cared even for himself this he had decided was the meaning of his lack of fear for one could only be afraid on account of something for which one cared he liked it this way his love was not for people it was for the people his compassion was for starving peasants in general and sick children and frightened soldiers and crippled miners in general he hated nobody in particular just all princes all landlords all capitalists and all generals in giving his personality over to a higher cause he knew he was like a priest and indeed like one priest in particular his father he no longer felt diminished by this comparison he respected his fathers highmindedness and despised the cause it served he feliks had chosen the right cause his life would not be wasted this was the feliks that had formed over the years as his mature personality emerged from the fluidity of youth what had been so devastating about lydias scream he thought was that it had reminded him that there might have been a different feliks a warm and loving man a sexual man a man capable of jealousy greed vanity and fear would i rather be that man he asked himself that man would long to stare into her wide gray eyes and stroke her fine blond hair to see her collapse into helpless giggles as she tried to learn how to whistle to argue with her about tolstoy to eat black bread and smoked herrings with her and to watch her screw up her pretty face at her first taste of vodka that man would be playful he would also be concerned he would wonder whether lydia was happy he would hesitate to pull the trigger for fear she might be hit by a ricochet he might be reluctant to kill her nephew in case she were fond of the boy that man would make a poor revolutionist no he thought as he went to sleep that night i would not want to be that man he is not even dangerous in the night he dreamed that he shot lydia but when he woke up he could not remember whether it had made him sad on the third day he went out bridget gave him a shirt and a coat which had belonged to her husband they fitted badly for he had been shorter and wider than feliks felikss own trousers and boots were still wearable and bridget had washed the blood off he mended the bicycle which had been damaged when he dropped it down the steps he straightened a buckled wheel patched a punctured tire and taped the split leather of the saddle he climbed on and rode a short distance but he realized immediately that he was not yet strong enough to go far on it he walked instead it was a glorious sunny day at a secondhand clothes stall in mornington crescent he gave a halfpenny and bridgets husbands coat for a lighter coat that fitted him he felt peculiarly happy walking through the streets of london in the summer weather ive nothing to be happy about he thought my clever wellorganized daring assassination plan fell to pieces because a woman cried out and a middleaged man drew a sword what a fiasco it was bridget who had cheered him up he decided she had seen that he was in trouble and she had given help without thinking twice it reminded him of the greatheartedness of the people in whose cause he fired guns and threw bombs and got himself sliced up with a sword it gave him strength he made his way to st jamess park and took up his familiar station opposite the walden house he looked across at the pristine white stonework and the high elegant windows you can knock me down he thought but you cant knock me out if you knew i was back here again youd tremble in your patentleather shoes he settled down to watch the trouble with a fiasco was that it put the intended victim on his guard it would now be very difficult indeed to kill orlov because he would be taking precautions but feliks would find out what those precautions were and he would evade them at eleven am the carriage went out and feliks thought he saw behind the glass a spadeshaped beard and a top hat walden it came back at one it went out again at three this time with a feminine hat inside belonging presumably to lydia or perhaps to the daughter of the family whoever it was returned at five in the evening several guests came and the family apparently dined at home there was no sign of orlov it rather looked as if he had moved out ill find him then he thought on his way back to camden town he bought a newspaper when he arrived home bridget offered him tea so he read the paper in her parlor there was nothing about orlov either in the court circular or the social notes bridget saw what he was reading interesting material for a fellow such as yourself she said sarcastically youll be making up your mind which of the balls to attend tonight no doubt feliks smiled and said nothing bridget said i know what you are you know youre an anarchist feliks was very still who are you going to kill she said i hope its the bloody king she drank tea noisily well dont stare at me like that you look as if youre about to slit me throat you neednt worry i wont tell on you my husband did for a few of the english in his time feliks was nonplussed she had guessedand she approved he did not know what to say he stood up and folded his newspaper youre a good woman he said if i was twenty years younger id kiss you get away before i forget myself thank you for the tea feliks said he went out he spent the rest of the evening sitting in the drab basement room staring at the wall thinking of course orlov was lying low but where if he was not at the walden house he might be at the russian embassy or at the home of one of the embassy staff or at a hotel or at the home of one of waldens friends he might even be out of london at a house in the country there was no way to check all the possibilities it was not going to be so easy he began to worry he considered following walden around it might be the best he could do but it was unsatisfactory although it was possible for a bicycle to keep pace with a carriage in london it could be exhausting for the cyclist and feliks knew that he could not contemplate it for several days suppose then that over a period of three days walden visited several private houses two or three offices a hotel or two and an embassyhow would feliks find out which of those buildings orlov was in it was possible but it would take time meanwhile the negotiations would be progressing and war drawing nearer and suppose that after all that orlov was still living in waldens house and had decided simply not to go out feliks went to sleep gnawing at the problem and woke up in the morning with the solution he would ask lydia he polished his boots washed his hair and shaved he borrowed from bridget a white cotton scarf which worn around his throat concealed the fact that he had neither collar nor tie at the secondhand clothes stall in mornington crescent he found a bowler hat which fitted him he looked at himself in the stallholders cracked frosted mirror he looked dangerously respectable he walked on he had no idea how lydia would react to him he was quite sure that she had not recognized him on the night of the fiasco his face had been covered and her scream had been a reaction to the sight of an anonymous man with a gun assuming he could get in to see her what would she do would she throw him out would she immediately begin to tear off her clothes the way she had used to would she be merely indifferent thinking of him as someone she knew in her youth and no longer cared for he wanted her to be shocked and dazed and still in love with him so that he would be able to make her tell him a secret suddenly he could not remember what she looked like it was very odd he knew she was a certain height neither fat nor thin with pale hair and gray eyes but he could not bring to mind a picture of her if he concentrated on her nose he could see that or he could visualize her vaguely without definite form in the bleak light of a st petersburg evening but when he tried to focus on her she faded away he arrived at the park and hesitated outside the house it was ten oclock would they have got up yet in any event he thought he should probably wait until walden left the house it occurred to him that he might even see orlov in the hallat a time when he had no weapon if i do ill strangle him with my hands he thought savagely he wondered what lydia was doing right now she might be dressing ah yes he thought i can picture her in a corset brushing her hair before a mirror or she might be eating breakfast there would be eggs and meat and fish but she would eat a small piece of a soft roll and a slice of apple the carriage appeared at the entrance a minute or two later someone got in and it drove to the gate feliks stood on the opposite side of the road as it emerged suddenly he was looking straight at walden behind the window of the coach and walden was looking at him feliks had an urge to shout hey walden i fucked her first instead he grinned and doffed his hat walden inclined his head in acknowledgment and the carriage passed on feliks wondered why he felt so elated he walked through the gateway and across the courtyard he saw that there were flowers in every window of the house and he thought ah yes she always loved flowers he climbed the steps to the porch and pulled the bell at the front door perhaps she will call the police he thought a moment later a servant opened the door feliks stepped inside good morning he said good morning sir the servant said so i do look respectable i should like to see the countess of walden it is a matter of great urgency my name is konstantin dmitrich levin i am sure she will remember me from st petersburg yes sir konstantin konstantin dmitrich levin let me give you my card feliks fumbled inside his coat ach i brought none thats all right sir konstantin dmitrich levin yes if you will be so good as to wait here ill see if the countess is in feliks nodded and the servant went away six the queen anne bureaubookcase was one of lydias favorite pieces of furniture in the london house two hundred years old it was of black lacquer decorated in gold with vaguely chinese scenes of pagodas willow trees islands and flowers the flap front folded down to form a writing table and to reveal redvelvetlined pigeonholes for letters and tiny drawers for paper and pens there were large drawers in the bombé base and the top above her eye level as she sat at the table was a bookcase with a mirrored door the ancient mirror showed a cloudy distorted reflection of the morning room behind her on the writing table was an unfinished letter to her sister alekss mother in st petersburg lydias handwriting was small and untidy she had written in russian i dont know what to think about charlotte and then she had stopped she sat looking into the cloudy mirror musing it was turning out to be a very eventful season in the worst possible way after the suffragette protest at the court and the madman in the park she had thought there could be no more catastrophes and for a few days life had been calm charlotte was successfully launched aleks was no longer around to disturb lydias equanimity for he had fled to the savoy hotel and did not appear at society functions belindas ball had been a huge success that night lydia had forgotten her troubles and had a wonderful time she had danced the waltz the polka the twostep the tango and even the turkey trot she had partnered half the house of lords several dashing young men andmost of allher husband it was not really chic to dance with ones own husband quite as much as she had but stephen looked so fine in his white tie and tails and he danced so well that she had given herself up to pleasure her marriage was definitely in one of its happier phases looking back over the years she had the feeling that it was often like this in the season and then annie had turned up to spoil it all lydia had only the vaguest recollection of annie as a housemaid at walden hall one could not possibly know all the servants at an establishment as large as that there were some fifty indoor staff and then the gardeners and grooms nor was one known to all the servants on one famous occasion lydia had stopped a passing maid in the hall and asked her whether lord walden was in his room and had received the reply ill go and see madamwhat name shall i say however lydia remembered the day mrs braithwaite the housekeeper at walden hall had come to her with the news that annie would have to go because she was pregnant mrs braithwaite did not say pregnant she said overtaken in moral transgression both lydia and mrs braithwaite were embarrassed but neither was shocked it had happened to housemaids before and it would happen again they had to be let goit was the only way to run a respectable houseand naturally they could not be given references in those circumstances without a character a maid could not get another job in service of course but normally she did not need a job for she either married the father of the child or went home to mother indeed years later when she had brought up her children such a girl might even find her way back into the house as a laundrymaid or kitchenmaid or in some other capacity which would not bring her into contact with her employers lydia had assumed that annies life would follow that course she remembered that a young undergardener had left without giving notice and run away to seathat piece of news had come to her attention because of the difficulty of finding boys to work as gardeners for a sensible wage these daysbut of course no one ever told her the connection between annie and the boy were not harsh lydia thought as employers were relatively generous yet charlotte reacted as if annies plight were my fault i dont know where she gets her ideas what was it she said i know what annie did and i know who she did it with in heavens name where did the child learn to speak like that i dedicated my whole life to bringing her up to be pure and clean and decent not like me dont even think that she dipped her pen in the inkwell she would have liked to share her worries with her sister but it was so hard in a letter it was hard enough in person she thought charlotte was the one with whom she really wanted to share her thoughts why is it that when i try i become shrill and tyrannical pritchard came in a mr konstantin dmitrich levin to see you my lady lydia frowned i dont think i know him the gentleman said it was a matter of urgency mlady and seemed to think you would remember him from st petersburg pritchard looked dubious lydia hesitated the name was distinctly familiar from time to time russians whom she hardly knew would call on her in london they usually began by offering to take back messages and ended by asking to borrow the passage money lydia did not mind helping them all right she said show him in pritchard went out lydia inked her pen again and wrote what can one do when the child is eighteen years old and has a will of her own stephen says i worry too much i wish i cant even talk to stephen properly she thought he just makes soothing noises the door opened and pritchard said mr konstantin dmitrich levin lydia spoke over her shoulder in english ill be with you in a moment mr levin she heard the butler close the door as she wrotethat i could believe him she put down her pen and turned around he spoke to her in russian how are you lydia lydia whispered oh my god it was as if something cold and heavy descended over her heart and she could not breathe feliks stood in front of her tall and thin as ever in a shabby coat with a scarf holding a foolish english hat in his left hand he was as familiar as if she had seen him yesterday his hair was still long and black without a hint of gray there was that white skin the nose like a curved blade the wide mobile mouth and the sad soft eyes he said im sorry to shock you lydia could not speak she struggled with a storm of mixed emotions shock fear delight horror affection and dread she stared at him he was older his face was lined there were two sharp creases in his cheeks and downturning wrinkles at the corners of his lovely mouth they seemed like lines of pain and hardship in his expression there was a hint of something which had not been there beforeperhaps ruthlessness or cruelty or just inflexibility he looked tired he was studying her too you look like a girl he said wonderingly she tore her eyes away from him her heart pounded like a drum dread became her dominant feeling if stephen should come back early she thought and walk in here now and give me that look that says who is this man and i were to blush and mumble and i wish youd say something feliks said her eyes returned to him with an effort she said go away no suddenly she knew she did not have the strength of will to make him leave she looked over to the bell which would summon pritchard feliks smiled as if he knew what was in her mind its been nineteen years he said youve aged she said abruptly youve changed what did you expect i expected this he said that you would be afraid to admit to yourself that you are happy to see me he had always been able to see into her soul with those soft eyes what was the use of pretending he knew all about pretending she recalled he had understood her from the moment he first set eyes on her well he said arent you happy im frightened too she said and then she realized she had admitted to being happy and you she added hastily how do you feel i dont feel much at all anymore he said his face twisted into an odd pained smile it was a look she had never seen on him in the old days she felt intuitively that he was telling the truth at that moment he drew up a chair and sat close to her she jerked back convulsively he said i wont hurt you hurt me lydia gave a laugh that sounded unexpectedly brittle youll ruin my life you ruined mine he replied then he frowned as if he had surprised himself oh feliks i didnt mean to he was suddenly tense there was a heavy silence he gave that hurt smile again and said what happened she hesitated she realized that all these years she had been longing to explain it to him she began that night you tore my gown what are you going to do about this tear in your gown feliks asked the maid will put a stitch in it before i arrive at the embassy lydia replied your maid carries needles and thread around with her why else would one take ones maid when one goes out to dinner why indeed he was lying on the bed watching her dress she knew that he loved to see her put her clothes on he had once done an imitation of her pulling up her drawers which had made her laugh until it hurt she took the gown from him and put it on everybody takes an hour to dress for the evening she said until i met you i had no idea it could be done in five minutes button me up she looked in the mirror and tidied her hair while he fastened the hooks at the back of her gown when he had finished he kissed her shoulder she arched her neck dont start again she said she picked up the old brown cloak and handed it to him he helped her on with it he said the lights go out when you leave she was touched he was not often sentimental she said i know how you feel will you come tomorrow yes at the door she kissed him and said thank you i love you dearly he said she left him as she went down the stairs she heard a noise behind her and looked back felikss neighbor was watching her from the door of the next apartment he looked embarrassed when he caught her eye she nodded politely to him and he withdrew it occurred to her that he could probably hear them making love through the wall she did not care she knew that what she was doing was wicked and shameful but she refused to think about it she went out into the street her maid was waiting on the corner together they walked to the park where the carriage was waiting it was a cold evening but lydia felt as if she were glowing with her own warmth she often wondered whether people could tell just by looking at her that she had been making love the coachman put down the step of the carriage for her and avoided her eyes he knows she thought with surprise then she decided that that was fanciful in the coach the maid hastily repaired the back of lydias gown lydia changed the brown cloak for a fur wrap the maid fussed with lydias hair lydia gave her ten rubles for her silence then they were at the british embassy lydia composed herself and went in it was not difficult she found to assume her other personality and become the modest virginal lydia whom polite society knew as soon as she entered the real world she was terrified by the brute power of her passion for feliks and she became quite genuinely a trembling lily it was no act indeed for most of the hours in the day she felt that this wellbehaved maiden was her real self and she thought she must be somehow possessed while she was with feliks but when he was there and also when she was alone in bed in the middle of the night she knew that it was her official persona that was evil for it would have denied her the greatest joy she had ever known so she entered the hall dressed in becoming white looking young and a little nervous she met her cousin kiril who was nominally her escort he was a widower of thirtysomething years an irritable man who worked for the foreign minister he and lydia did not much like each other but because his wife was dead and because lydias parents did not enjoy going out kiril and lydia had let it be known that they should be invited together lydia always told him not to trouble to call for her this was how she managed to meet feliks clandestinely youre late kiril said im sorry she replied insincerely kiril took her into the salon they were greeted by the ambassador and his wife and then introduced to lord highcombe elder son of the earl of walden he was a tall handsome man of about thirty in wellcut but rather sober clothes he looked very english with his short light brown hair and blue eyes he had a smiling open face which lydia found mildly attractive he spoke good french they made polite conversation for a few moments then he was introduced to someone else he seems rather pleasant lydia said to kiril dont be fooled kiril told her rumor has it that hes a tearaway you surprise me he plays cards with some officers i know and they were telling me that he drinks them under the table some nights you know so much about people and its always bad kirils thin lips twisted in a smile is that my fault or theirs lydia said why is he here in st petersburg well the story is that he has a very rich and domineering father with whom he doesnt see eye to eye so hes drinking and gambling his way around the world while he waits for the old man to die lydia did not expect to speak to lord highcombe again but the ambassadors wife seeing them both as eligible seated them side by side at dinner during the second course he tried to make conversation i wonder whether you know the minister of finance he said im afraid not lydia said coldly she knew all about the man of course and he was a great favorite of the czar but he had married a woman who was not only divorced but also jewish which made it rather awkward for people to invite him she suddenly thought how scathing feliks would be about such prejudices then the englishman was speaking again i should be most interested to meet him i understand hes terribly energetic and forwardlooking his transsiberian railway project is marvelous but people say hes not very refined im sure sergey yulevich witte is a loyal servant of our adored sovereign lydia said politely no doubt highcombe said and turned back to the lady on his other side he thinks im boring lydia thought a little later she asked him do you travel a great deal most of the time he replied i go to africa almost every year for the big game how fascinating what do you shoot lion elephant a rhinoceros once in the jungle the hunting is in the grasslands to the east but i did once go as far south as the rain forest just to see it and is it how it is pictured in books yes even to the naked black pygmies lydia felt herself flush and she turned away now why did he have to say that she thought she did not speak to him again they had conversed enough to satisfy the dictates of etiquette and clearly neither of them was keen to go further after dinner she played the ambassadors wonderful grand piano for a while then kiril took her home she went straight to bed to dream of feliks the next morning after breakfast a servant summoned her to her fathers study the count was a small thin exasperated man of fiftyfive lydia was the youngest of his four childrenthe others were a sister and two brothers all married their mother was alive but in continual bad health the count saw little of his family he seemed to spend most of his time reading he had one old friend who came to play chess lydia had vague memories of a time when things were different and they were a jolly family around a big dinner table but it was a long time ago nowadays a summons to the study meant only one thing trouble when lydia went in he was standing in front of the writing table his hands behind his back his face twisted with fury lydias maid stood near the door with tears on her cheeks lydia knew then what the trouble was and she felt herself tremble there was no preamble her father began by shouting you have been seeing a boy secretly lydia folded her arms to stop herself shaking how did you find out she said with an accusing look at the maid her father made a disgusted noise dont look at her he said the coachman told me of your extraordinarily long walks in the park yesterday i had you followed his voice rose again how could you act like thatlike a peasant girl how much did he know not everything surely im in love lydia said in love he roared you mean youre in heat lydia thought he was about to strike her she took several paces backward and prepared to run he knew everything it was total catastrophe what would he do he said the worst of it is you cant possibly marry him lydia was aghast she was prepared to be thrown out of the house cut off without a penny and humiliated but he had in mind worse punishment than that why cant i marry him she cried because hes practically a serf and an anarchist to boot dont you understandyoure ruined then let me marry him and live in ruin no he yelled there was a heavy silence the maid still in tears sniffed monotonously lydia heard a ringing in her ears this will kill your mother the count said lydia whispered what are you going to do youll be confined to your room for now as soon as i can arrange it youll enter a convent lydia stared at him in horror it was a sentence of death she ran from the room never to see feliks againthe thought was utterly unbearable tears rolled down her face she ran to her bedroom she could not possibly suffer this punishment i shall die she thought i shall die rather than leave feliks forever she would leave her family forever as soon as this idea occurred to her she knew it was the only thing to doand the time to do it was now before her father sent someone to lock her into her room she looked in her purse she had only a few rubles she opened her jewelry case she took out a diamond bracelet a gold chain and some rings and stuffed them into her purse she put on her coat and ran down the back stairs she left the house by the servants door she hurried through the streets people stared at her running in her fine clothes with tears on her face she did not care she had left society for good she was going to elope with feliks she quickly became exhausted and slowed to a walk suddenly the whole affair did not seem so disastrous she and feliks could go to moscow or to a country town or even abroad perhaps germany feliks would have to find work he was educated so he could at least be a clerk possibly better she might take in sewing they would rent a small house and furnish it cheaply they would have children strong boys and pretty girls the things she would lose seemed worthless silk dresses society gossip ubiquitous servants huge houses and delicate foods what would it be like living with him they would get into bed and actually go to sleep togetherhow romantic they would take walks holding hands not caring who saw that they were in love they would sit by the fireside in the evenings playing cards or reading or just talking any time she wanted she could touch him or kiss him or take off her clothes for him she reached his house and climbed the stairs what would his reaction be he would be shocked then elated then he would become practical they would have to leave immediately he would say for her father could send people after them to bring her back he would be decisive well go to x he would say and he would talk about tickets and a suitcase and disguises she took out her key but the door to his apartment hung open and askew on its hinges she went in calling feliks its meoh she stopped in the doorway the whole place was in a mess as if it had been robbed or there had been a fight feliks was not there suddenly she was terribly afraid she walked around the small apartment feeling dazed stupidly looking behind the curtains and under the bed all his books were gone the mattress had been slashed the mirror was broken the one in which they had watched themselves making love one afternoon when it had been snowing outside lydia wandered aimlessly into the hallway the occupant of the next apartment stood in his doorway lydia looked at him what happened she said he was arrested last night the man replied and the sky fell in she felt faint she leaned against the wall for support arrested why where was he who had arrested him how could she elope with him if he was in jail it seems he was an anarchist the neighbor grinned suggestively and added whatever else he might have been it was too much to bear that this should have happened on the very day that father had father lydia whispered father did this you look ill the neighbor said would you like to come in and sit down for a moment lydia did not like the look on his face she could not cope with this leering man on top of everything else she pulled herself together and without answering him made her way slowly down the stairs and went out into the street she walked slowly going nowhere wondering what to do somehow she had to get feliks out of jail she had no idea how to go about it she should appeal to the minister of the interior to the czar she did not know how to reach them except by going to the right receptions she could writebut she needed feliks today could she visit him in jail at least then she would know how he was and he would know she was fighting for him maybe if she arrived in a coach dressed in fine clothes she could overawe the jailer but she did not know where the jail wasthere might be more than oneand she did not have her carriage and if she went home her father would lock her up and she would never see feliks she fought back the tears she was so ignorant of the world of police and jails and criminals whom could she ask felikss anarchist friends would know all about that sort of thing but she had never met them and did not know where to find them she thought of her brothers maks was managing the family estate in the country and he would see feliks from fathers point of view and would completely approve of what father had done dmitriemptyheaded effeminate dmitriwould sympathize with lydia but be helpless there was only one thing to do she must go and plead with her father for felikss release wearily she turned around and headed for home her anger toward her father grew with every step she took he was supposed to love her care for her and ensure her happinessand what did he do tried to ruin her life she knew what she wanted she knew what would make her happy whose life was it who had the right to decide she arrived home in a rage she went straight to the study and walked in without knocking youve had him arrested she accused yes her father said his mood had altered his mask of fury had gone to be replaced by a thoughtful calculating look lydia said you must have him released immediately they are torturing him at this moment no lydia whispered oh no they are flogging the soles of his feet lydia screamed father raised his voice with thin flexible canes there was a paper knife on the writing table which quickly cut the soft skin i will kill him until there is so much blood lydia went berserk she picked up the paper knife and rushed at her father she lifted the knife high in the air and brought it down with all her might aiming at his skinny neck screaming all the while i hate you i hate you i hate you he moved aside caught her wrist forced her to drop the knife and pushed her into a chair she burst into hysterical tears after a few minutes her father began to speak again calmly as if nothing had happened i could have it stopped immediately he said i can have the boy released whenever i choose oh please lydia sobbed ill do anything you say will you he said she looked up at him through her tears an access of hope calmed her did he mean it would he release feliks anything she said anything i had a visitor while you were out he said conversationally the earl of walden he asked permission to call on you who the earl of walden he was lord highcombe when you met him last evening but his father died in the night so now hes the earl earl is the english for count lydia stared at her father uncomprehendingly she remembered meeting the englishman but she could not understand why her father was suddenly rambling on about him she said dont torture me tell me what i must do to make you release feliks marry the earl of walden her father said abruptly lydia stopped crying she stared at him dumbstruck was he really saying this it sounded insane he continued walden will want to marry quickly you would leave russia and go to england with him this appalling affair could be forgotten and nobody need know its the ideal solution and feliks lydia breathed the torture would stop today the boy would be released the moment you leave for england you would never see him again as long as you live no lydia whispered in gods name no they were married eight weeks later you really tried to stab your father feliks said with a mixture of awe and amusement lydia nodded she thought thank god he has not guessed the rest of it feliks said im proud of you it was a terrible thing to do he was a terrible man i dont think so anymore there was a pause feliks said softly so you never betrayed me after all the urge to take him into her arms was almost irresistible she made herself sit frozen still the moment passed your father kept his word he mused the torture stopped that day they let me out the day after you left for england how did you know where i had gone i got a message from the maid she left it at the bookshop of course she didnt know of the bargain you had made the things they had to say were so many and so weighty that they sat in silence lydia was still afraid to move she noticed that he kept his right hand in his coat pocket all the time she did not remember his having that habit before can you whistle yet he said suddenly she could not help laughing i never got the knack they lapsed into quiet again lydia wanted him to leave and with equal desperation she wanted him to stay eventually she said what have you been doing since then feliks shrugged a good deal of traveling you bringing up my daughter the years in between seemed to be an uncomfortable topic for both of them lydia said what made you come here oh feliks seemed momentarily confused by the question i need to see orlov aleks why theres an anarchist sailor in jaili have to persuade orlov to release him you know how things are in russia theres no justice only influence aleks isnt here anymore someone tried to rob us in our carriage and he got frightened where can i find him feliks said he seemed suddenly tense the savoy hotelbut i doubt if hell see you i can try this is important to you isnt it yes youre still political its my life most young men lose interest as they grow older he smiled ruefully most young men get married and have a family lydia was full of pity feliks im so sorry he reached out and took her hand she snatched it back and stood up dont touch me she said he looked at her in surprise ive learned my lesson even if you havent she said i was brought up to believe that lust is evil and destroys for a while when we were together i stopped believing that or at least i pretended to stop and look what happenedi ruined myself and i ruined you my father was rightlust does destroy ive never forgotten that and i never will he looked at her sadly is that what you tell yourself its true the morality of tolstoy doing good may not make you happy but doing wrong will certainly make you unhappy she took a deep breath i want you to go away now and never come back he looked at her in silence for a long moment then he stood up very well he said lydia thought her heart would break he took a step toward her she stood still knowing she should move away from him unable to do so he put his hands on her shoulders and looked into her eyes and then it was too late she remembered how it used to be when they looked into each others eyes and she was lost he drew her to him and kissed her folding her into his arms it was just like always his restless mouth on her soft lips busy loving gentle she was melting she pushed her body against his there was a fire in her loins she shuddered with pleasure she searched for his hands and held them in her own just to have something to hold a part of his body to grip to squeeze with all her might he gave a shout of pain they broke apart she stared at him nonplussed he held his right hand to his mouth she saw that he had a nasty wound and in squeezing his hand she had made it bleed she moved to take his hand to say sorry but he stepped back a change had come over him the spell was broken he turned and strode to the door horrified she watched him go out the door slammed lydia gave a cry of loss she stood for a moment gazing at the place where he had been she felt as if she had been ravaged she fell into a chair she began to shake uncontrollably her emotions whirled and boiled for minutes and she could not think straight eventually they settled leaving one predominant feeling relief that she had not yielded to the temptation to tell him the last chapter of the story that was a secret lodged deep within her like a piece of shrapnel in a healedover wound and there it would stay until the day she died when it would be buried with her feliks stopped in the hall to put on his hat he looked at himself in the mirror and his face twisted into a grin of savage triumph he composed his features and went out into the midday sunshine she was so gullible she had believed his halfbaked story about an anarchist sailor and she had told him without a seconds hesitation where to find orlov he was exultant that she was still so much in his power she married walden for my sake he thought and now i have made her betray her husband nevertheless the interview had had its dangerous moments for him as she was telling her story he had watched her face and a dreadful grief had welled up within him a peculiar sadness that made him want to cry but it had been so long since he had shed tears that his body seemed to have forgotten how and those dangerous moments had passed im not really vulnerable to sentiment he told himself i lied to her betrayed her trust in me kissed her and ran away i used her fate is on my side today its a good day for a dangerous task he had dropped his gun in the park so he needed a new weapon for an assassination in a hotel room a bomb would be best it did not have to be aimed accurately for wherever it landed it would kill everyone in the room if walden should happen to be there with orlov at the time so much the better feliks thought it occurred to him that then lydia would have helped him kill her husband so he put her out of his mind and began to think about chemistry he went to a chemists shop in camden town and bought four pints of common acid in concentrated form the acid came in two twopint bottles and cost four shillings and fivepence including the price of the bottles which was refundable he took the bottles home and put them on the floor of the basement room he went out again and bought another four pints of the same acid in a different shop the chemist asked him what he was going to use it for cleaning he said and the man seemed satisfied in a third chemists he bought four pints of a different acid finally he bought a pint of pure glycerine and a glass rod a foot long he had spent sixteen shillings and eightpence but he would get four shillings and threepence back for the bottles when they were empty that would leave him with just under three pounds because he had bought the ingredients in different shops none of the chemists had any reason to suspect that he was going to make explosives he went up to bridgets kitchen and borrowed her largest mixing bowl would you be baking a cake she asked him he said yes dont blow us all up then i wont nevertheless she took the precaution of spending the afternoon with a neighbor feliks went back downstairs took off his jacket rolled up his sleeves and washed his hands he put the mixing bowl in the washbasin he looked at the row of large brown bottles with their groundglass stoppers lined up on the floor the first part of the job was not very dangerous he mixed the two kinds of acid together in bridgets kitchen bowl waited for the bowl to cool then rebottled the twotoone mixture he washed the bowl dried it put it back into the sink and poured the glycerine into it the sink was fitted with a rubber plug on a chain he wedged the plug into the drain hole sideways so that it was partly blocked he turned on the tap when the water level reached almost to the rim of the kitchen bowl he turned the tap partly but not completely off so that the water was flowing out as fast as it was flowing in and the level in the sink stayed constant without overflowing into the kitchen bowl the next part had killed more anarchists than the okhrana gingerly he began to add the mixed acids to the glycerine stirring gently but constantly with the glass rod the basement room was very warm occasionally a wisp of reddishbrown smoke came off the bowl a sign that the chemical reaction was beginning to get out of control then feliks would stop adding acid but carry on stirring until the flow of water through the washbasin cooled the bowl and moderated the reaction when the fumes were gone he waited a minute or two then carried on mixing this is how ilya died he recalled standing over a sink in a basement room mixing acids and glycerine perhaps he was impatient when they finally cleared the rubble there was nothing left of ilya to bury afternoon turned into evening the air became cooler but feliks perspired all the same his hand was as steady as a rock he could hear children in the street outside playing a game and chanting a rhyme salt mustard vinegar pepper salt mustard vinegar pepper he wished he had ice he wished he had electric light the room filled with acid fumes his throat was raw the mixture in the bowl stayed clear he found himself daydreaming about lydia in the daydream she came into the basement room stark naked smiling and he told her to go away because he was busy salt mustard vinegar pepper he poured the last bottle of acid as slowly and gently as the first still stirring he increased the stream of water from the tap so that it overflowed into the bowl then he meticulously washed away the surplus acids when he had finished he had a bowl of nitroglycerine it was an explosive liquid twenty times as powerful as gunpowder it could be detonated by a blasting cap but such a detonator was not essential for it could also be set off by a lighted match or even the warmth from a nearby fire feliks had known a foolish man who carried a bottle of nitroglycerine in the breast pocket of his coat until the heat of his body detonated it and killed him and three other people and a horse on a st petersburg street a bottle of nitroglycerine would explode if smashed or just dropped on the floor or shaken or even jerked hard with the utmost care feliks dipped a clean bottle into the bowl and let it fill slowly with the explosive when it was full he closed the bottle making sure that there was no nitroglycerine caught between the neck of the bottle and the groundglass stopper there was some liquid left in the bowl of course it could not be poured down the sink feliks went over to his bed and picked up the pillow the stuffing seemed to be cotton waste he tore a small hole in the pillow and pulled out some of the stuff it was chopped rag mixed with a few feathers he poured some of it into the nitroglycerine remaining in the bowl the stuffing absorbed the liquid quite well feliks added more stuffing until all the liquid was soaked up then he rolled it into a ball and wrapped it in newspaper it was now much more stable like dynamitein fact dynamite was what it was it would detonate much less rapidly than the pure liquid lighting the newspaper might do it and it might not what was really required was a paper drinking straw packed with gunpowder but feliks did not plan to use the dynamite for he needed something reliable and immediate he washed and dried the mixing bowl again he plugged the sink filled it with water then gently placed the bottle of nitroglycerine in the water to keep cool he went upstairs and returned bridgets kitchen bowl he came back down and looked at the bomb in the sink he thought i wasnt afraid all afternoon i was never frightened of dying i still have no fear that made him glad he went off to reconnoiter the savoy hotel seven walden observed that both lydia and charlotte were subdued at tea he too was thoughtful the conversation was desultory after he had changed for dinner walden sat in the drawing room sipping sherry waiting for his wife and his daughter to come down they were to dine out at the pontadarvys it was another warm evening so far it had been a fine summer for weather if for nothing else shutting aleks up in the savoy hotel had not done anything to hasten the slow pace of negotiating with the russians aleks inspired affection like a kitten and had the kittens surprisingly sharp teeth walden had put to him the counterproposal an international waterway from the black sea to the mediterranean aleks had said flatly that this was not good enough for in wartimewhen the strait would become vitalneither britain nor russia with the best will in the world could prevent the turks from closing the channel russia wanted not only the right of passage but also the power to enforce that right while walden and aleks argued about how russia might be given that power the germans had completed the widening of the kiel canal a strategically crucial project which would enable their dreadnoughts to pass from the north sea battleground to the safety of the baltic in addition germanys gold reserves were at a record high as a result of the financial maneuvers that had prompted churchills visit to walden hall in may germany would never be better prepared for war every day that passed made an anglorussian alliance more indispensable but aleks had true nervehe would make no concessions in haste and as walden learned more about germanyits industry its government its army its natural resourceshe realized that it had every chance of replacing britain as the most powerful nation in the world personally he did not much mind whether britain was first second or ninth so long as she was free he loved england he was proud of his country her industry provided work for millions and her democracy was a model for the rest of the world her population was becoming more educated and following that process more of her people had the vote even the women would get it sooner or later especially if they stopped breaking windows he loved the fields and the hills the opera and the music hall the frenetic glitter of the metropolis and the slow reassuring rhythms of country life he was proud of her inventors her playwrights her businessmen and her craftsmen england was a damn good place and it was not going to be spoiled by squareheaded prussian invaders not if walden could help it he was worried because he was not sure he could help it he wondered just how far he really understood modern england with its anarchists and suffragettes ruled by young firebrands like churchill and lloyd george swayed by even more disruptive forces such as the burgeoning labor party and the evermorepowerful trade unions waldens kind of people still ruledthe wives were good society and the husbands were the establishmentbut the country was not as governable as it had used to be sometimes he had a terribly depressing feeling that it was all slipping out of control charlotte came in reminding him that politics was not the only area of life in which he seemed to be losing his grip she was still wearing her tea gown walden said we must go soon ill stay at home if i may she said ive a slight headache therell be no hot dinner unless you warn cook quickly i shant want it ill have a tray in my room you look a little pale have a small glass of sherry itll give you an appetite all right she sat down and he poured the drink for her as he gave it to her he said annie has a job and a home now im glad she replied coldly he took a deep breath it must be said that i was at fault in that affair oh charlotte said astonished is it so rare for me to admit that im in the wrong he wondered he went on of course i didnt know that her young man had run off and she was ashamed to go to her mother but i should have inquired as you quite rightly said the girl was my responsibility charlotte said nothing but sat beside him on the sofa and took his hand he was touched he said you have a kind heart and i hope youll always stay that way might i also be permitted to hope that you will learn to express your generous feelings with a little more equanimity she looked up at him ill do my best papa i often wonder whether weve protected you too much of course it was your mama who decided how you should be brought up but i must say i agreed with her nearly all the time there are people who say that children ought not to be protected from well what might be called the facts of life but those people are very few and they tend to be an awfully coarse type they were quiet for a while as usual lydia was taking forever to dress for dinner there was more that walden wanted to say to charlotte but he was not sure he had the courage in his mind he rehearsed various openings none of which was less than acutely embarrassing she sat with him in contented silence and he wondered whether she had some idea of what was going on in his mind lydia would be ready in a moment it was now or never he cleared his throat youll marry a good man and together with him youll learn about all sorts of things that are mysterious and perhaps a little worrying to you now that might be enough he thought this was the moment to back down to duck the issue courage but there is one thing you need to know in advance your mother should tell you really but somehow i think she may not so i shall he lit a cigar just to have something to do with his hands he was past the point of no return he rather hoped lydia would come in now to put a stop to the conversation but she did not you said you know what annie and the gardener did well they arent married so it was wrong but when you are married its a very fine thing to do indeed he felt his face redden and hoped she would not look up just now its very good just physically you know he plunged on impossible to describe perhaps a bit like feeling the heat from a coal fire however the main thing is the thing im sure you dont realize is how wonderful the whole thing is spiritually somehow it seems to express all the affection and tenderness and respect and well just the love there is between a man and his wife you dont necessarily understand that when youre young girls especially tend to see only the well coarse aspect and some unfortunate people never discover the good side of it at all but if youre expecting it and you choose a good kind sensible man for your husband its sure to happen so thats why ive told you have i embarrassed you terribly to his surprise she turned her head and kissed his cheek yes but not as much as youve embarrassed yourself she said that made him laugh pritchard came in the carriage is ready my lord and my lady is waiting in the hall walden stood up not a word to mama now he murmured to charlotte im beginning to see why everybody says youre such a good man charlotte said enjoy your evening goodbye he said as he went out to join his wife he thought sometimes i get it right anyway after that charlotte almost changed her mind about going to the suffragette meeting she had been in a rebellious mood following the annie incident when she saw the poster stuck to the window of a jewelers shop in bond street the headline votes for women had caught her eye then she had noticed that the hall in which the meeting was to be held was not far from her house the notice did not name the speakers but charlotte had read in the newspapers that the notorious mrs pankhurst often appeared at such meetings without prior warning charlotte had stopped to read the poster pretending for the benefit of marya who was chaperoning her to be looking at a tray of bracelets as she was reading a boy came out of the shop and began to scrape the poster off the window there and then charlotte decided to go to the meeting now papa had shaken her resolution it was a shock to see that he could be fallible vulnerable even humble and even more of a revelation to hear him talk of sexual intercourse as if it were something beautiful she realized that she was no longer raging inwardly at him for allowing her to grow up in ignorance suddenly she saw his point of view but none of that altered the fact that she was still horribly ignorant and she could not trust mama and papa to tell her the whole truth about things especially about things like suffragism i will go she decided she rang the bell for pritchard and asked for a salad to be brought up to her room then she went upstairs one of the advantages of being a woman was that no one ever crossquestioned you if you said you had a headache women were supposed to have headaches every now and then when the tray came she picked at the food for a while until the time came when the servants would be having their supper then she put on a hat and coat and went out it was a warm evening she walked quickly toward knightsbridge she felt a peculiar sense of freedom and realized that she had never before walked the streets of a city unaccompanied i could do anything she thought i have no appointments and no chaperone nobody knows where i am i could have dinner in a restaurant i could catch a train to scotland i could take a room in a hotel i could ride on an omnibus i could eat an apple in the street and drop the core in the gutter she felt conspicuous but nobody looked at her she had always had the vague impression that if she went out alone strange men would embarrass her in unspecified ways in reality they did not seem to see her the men were not lurking they were all going somewhere wearing their evening clothes or their worsted suits or their frock coats how could there be any danger she thought then she remembered the madman in the park and she began to hurry as she approached the hall she noticed more and more women heading the same way some were in pairs or in groups but many were alone like charlotte she felt safer outside the hall was a crowd of hundreds of women many wore the suffragette colors of purple green and white some were handing out leaflets or selling a newspaper called votes for women there were several policemen about wearing rather strained expressions of amused contempt charlotte joined the queue to get in when she reached the door a woman wearing a stewards armband asked her for sixpence charlotte turned automatically then realized she did not have marya or a footman or a maid to pay for things she was alone and she had no money she had not anticipated that she would have to pay to get into the hall she was not quite sure where she would have got sixpence even if she had foreseen the need im sorry she said i havent any money i didnt know she turned to leave the steward reached out to stop her its all right the woman said if youve no money you get in free she had a middleclass accent and although she spoke kindly charlotte imagined that she was thinking such fine clothes and no money charlotte said thank you ill send you a check then she went in blushing furiously thank heaven i didnt try to have dinner in a restaurant or catch a train she thought she had never needed to worry about carrying money around with her her chaperone always had petty cash papa kept accounts with all the shops in bond street and if she wanted to have lunch at claridges or morning coffee in the café royal she would simply leave her card on the table and the bill would be sent to papa but this was one bill he would not pay she took her seat in the hall quite close to the front she did not want to miss anything after all this trouble if im going to do this kind of thing often she thought ill have to think of a way to get my hands on proper moneygrubby pennies and gold sovereigns and crumpled banknotes she looked around her the place was almost full of women with just a scattering of men the women were mostly middleclass wearing serge and cotton rather than cashmere and silk there were a few who looked distinctly more wellbred than the averagethey talked more quietly and wore less jewelryand those women seemedlike charlotteto be wearing last years coats and rather undistinguished hats as if to disguise themselves as far as charlotte could see there were no workingclass women in the audience up on the platform was a table draped with a purple green and white votes for women banner a small lectern stood on the table behind it was a row of six chairs charlotte thought all these womenrebelling against men she did not know whether to be thrilled or ashamed the audience applauded as five women walked onto the stage they were all impeccably dressed in rather lessthanfashionable clothesnot a hobble skirt or a cloche hat among them were these really the people who broke windows slashed paintings and threw bombs they looked too respectable the speeches began they meant little to charlotte they were about organization finance petitions amendments divisions and byelections she was disappointed she was learning nothing ought she to read books about this before going to a meeting in order to understand the proceedings after almost an hour she was ready to leave then the current speaker was interrupted two women appeared at the side of the stage one was an athleticlooking girl in a motoring coat walking with her and leaning on her for support was a small slight woman in a pale green spring coat and a large hat the audience began to applaud the women on the platform stood up the applause grew louder with shouts and cheers someone near charlotte stood up and in seconds a thousand women were on their feet mrs pankhurst walked slowly to the lectern charlotte could see her quite clearly she was what people called a handsome woman she had dark deepset eyes a wide straight mouth and a strong chin she would have been beautiful but for a rather fat flat nose the effects of her repeated imprisonments and hunger strikes showed in the fleshlessness of her face and hands and the yellow color of her skin she seemed weak thin and feeble she raised her hands and the cheering and applause died down almost instantly she began to speak her voice was strong and clear although she did not seem to shout charlotte was surprised to notice that she had a lancashire accent she said in i was elected to the manchester board of guardians in charge of a workhouse the first time i went into that place i was horrified to see little girls seven and eight years old on their knees scrubbing the cold stones of the long corridors these little girls were clad summer and winter in thin cotton frocks low in the neck and shortsleeved at night they wore nothing at all nightdresses being considered too good for paupers the fact that bronchitis was epidemic among them most of the time had not suggested to the guardians any change in the fashion of the clothes i need hardly add that until i arrived all the guardians were men i found that there were pregnant women in that workhouse scrubbing floors doing the hardest kind of work almost until their babies came into the world many of them were unmarried women very very young mere girls these poor mothers were allowed to stay in the hospital after confinement for a short two weeks then they had to make a choice of staying in the workhouse and earning their living by scrubbing and other workin which case they were separated from their babiesor of taking their discharges they could stay and be paupers or they could leaveleave with a twoweekold baby in their arms without hope without home without money without anywhere to go what became of those girls and what became of their hapless infants charlotte was stunned by the public discussion of such delicate matters unmarried mothers mere girls without homes without money and why should they be separated from their babies in the workhouse could this be true there was worse to come mrs pankhursts voice rose a fraction under the law if a man who ruins a girl pays down a lump sum of twenty pounds the boarding home is immune from inspection as long as a baby farmer takes only one child at a time the twenty pounds being paid the inspectors cannot inspect the house baby farmers a man who ruins a girl the terms were unfamiliar to charlotte but they were dreadfully selfexplanatory of course the babies die with hideous promptness and then the baby farmers are free to solicit another victim for years women have tried to get the poor law changed to protect all illegitimate children and to make it impossible for any rich scoundrel to escape liability for his child over and over again it has been tried but it has always failed here her voice became a passionate cry because the ones who really care about the thing are mere women the audience burst into applause and a woman next to charlotte cried hear hear charlotte turned to the woman and grabbed her arm is this true she said is this true but mrs pankhurst was speaking again i wish i had time and strength to tell you of all the tragedies i witnessed while i was on that board in our outrelief department i was brought into contact with widows who were struggling desperately to keep their homes and families together the law allowed these women relief of a certain very inadequate kind but for herself and one child it offered no relief except the workhouse even if the woman had a baby at her breast she was regarded under the law as an ablebodied man women we are told should stay at home and take care of their children i used to astound my men colleagues by saying to them when women have the vote they will see that mothers can stay at home and care for their children in i was appointed to the office of registrar of births and deaths in manchester even after my experience on the board of guardians i was shocked to be reminded over and over again of what little respect there was in the world for women and children i have had little girls of thirteen come to my office to register the births of their babiesillegitimate of course there was nothing that could be done in most cases the age of consent is sixteen years but a man can usually claim that he thought the girl was over sixteen during my term of office a very young mother of an illegitimate child exposed her baby and it died the girl was tried for murder and sentenced to death the man who was from the point of view of justice the real murderer of the baby received no punishment at all many times in those days i asked myself what was to be done i had joined the labor party thinking that through its councils something vital might come some demand for womens enfranchisement that the politicians could not possibly ignore nothing came all those years my daughters had been growing up one day christabel startled me with the remark how long you women have been trying for the vote for my part i mean to get it since that day i have had two mottoes one has been votes for women the other for my part i mean to get it someone shouted so do i and there was another outburst of cheering and clapping charlotte was feeling dazed it was as if she like alice in the story had walked through the looking glass and found herself in a world where nothing was what it seemed when she had read in the newspapers about suffragettes no mention had been made of the poor law of thirteenyearold mothers was it possible or of little girls catching bronchitis in the workhouse charlotte would have believed none of it had she not seen with her own eyes annie a decent ordinary maid from norfolk sleeping on a london pavement after being ruined by a man what did a few broken windows matter while this sort of thing was going on it was many years before we lighted the torch of militancy we had tried every other measure and our years of work and suffering and sacrifice had taught us that the government would not yield to right and justice but it would yield to expediency we had to make every department of english life insecure and unsafe we had to make english law a failure and the courts theaters of farce we had to discredit the government in the eyes of the world we had to spoil english sports hurt business destroy valuable property demoralize the world of society shame the churches upset the whole orderly conduct of life we had to do as much of this guerrilla warfare as the people of england would tolerate when they come to the point of saying to the government stop this in the only way it can be stopped by giving the women of england representation then we should extinguish our torch the great american statesman patrick henry summed up the causes that led to the american revolution like this we have petitioned we have remonstrated we have supplicated we have prostrated ourselves at the foot of the throne and it has all been in vain we must fighti repeat it sir we must fight patrick henry was advocating killing people as the proper means of securing the political freedom of men the suffragettes have not done that and never will in fact the moving spirit of militancy is a deep and abiding reverence for human life it was in this spirit that our women went forth to war last year on january thirtyfirst a number of putting greens were burned with acids on february seventh and eighth telegraph and telephone wires were cut in several places and for some hours all communication between london and glasgow was suspended a few days later windows in various of londons smartest clubs were broken and the orchid houses at kew were wrecked and many valuable blooms destroyed by cold the jewel room at the tower of london was invaded and a showcase broken on february eighteenth a country house that was being built on waltononthehill for mr lloyd george was partially destroyed a bomb having been exploded in the early morning before the arrival of the workmen over one thousand women have gone to prison in the course of this agitation have suffered their imprisonment have come out of prison injured in health weakened in body but not in spirit not one of those women would if women were free be lawbreakers they are women who seriously believe that the welfare of humanity demands this sacrifice they believe that the horrible evils which are ravaging our civilization will never be removed until women get the vote there is only one way to put a stop to this agitation there is only one way to break down this agitation it is not by deporting us no someone shouted it is not by locking us up in jail the whole crowd shouted no it is by doing us justice yes charlotte found herself shouting with the rest the little woman on the platform seemed to radiate righteous indignation her eyes blazed she clenched her fists she tilted up her chin and her voice rose and fell with emotion the fire of suffering whose flame is upon our sisters in prison is burning us also for we suffer with them we partake of their affliction and we shall share their victory byandby this fire will breathe into the ear of many a sleeper the one word awake and she will arise to slumber no more it will descend with the gift of tongues upon many who have hitherto been dumb and they will go forth to preach the news of deliverance its light will be seen afar off by many who suffer and are sorrowful and oppressed and will irradiate their lives with a new hope for the spirit which is in women today cannot be quenched it is stronger than all tyranny cruelty and oppression it is strongereventhandeathitself during the day a dreadful suspicion had dawned on lydia after lunch she had gone to her room to lie down she had been unable to think about anything but feliks she was still vulnerable to his magnetism it was foolish to pretend otherwise but she was no longer a helpless girl she had resources of her own and she was determined that she would not lose control would not let feliks wreck the placid life she had so carefully made for herself she thought of all the questions she had not asked him what was he doing in london how did he earn his living how had he known where to find her he had given pritchard a false name clearly he had been afraid that she would not let him in she realized why konstantin dmitrich levin had seemed familiar it was the name of a character in anna karenina the book she had been buying when she first met feliks it was an alias with a double meaning a sly mnemonic which lit up a host of dim memories like a taste recalled from childhood they had argued about the novel it was brilliantly real lydia had said for she knew what it was like when passion was released in the soul of a respectable woman anna was lydia but the book was not about anna said feliks it was about levin and his search for the answer to the question how should i live tolstoys answer was in your heart you know what is right feliks argued that it was this kind of emptyheaded moralitydeliberately ignorant of history economics and psychologywhich had led to the utter incompetence and degeneracy of the russian ruling class that was the night they ate pickled mushrooms and she tasted vodka for the first time she had been wearing a turquoise dress which turned her gray eyes blue feliks had kissed her toes and then yes he was sly to remind her of all that had he been in london a long time she wondered or had he come just to see aleks there was presumably a reason for approaching an admiral in london about the release of a sailor imprisoned in russia for the first time it occurred to lydia that feliks might not have told her the truth about that after all he was still an anarchist in he had been determinedly nonviolent but he might have changed if stephen knew that i had told an anarchist where to find aleks she had worried about it through tea she had worried about it while the maid was putting up her hair with the result that the job was not properly done and she looked a fright she had worried about it through dinner with the result that she had been less than vivacious with the marchioness of quort mr chamberlain and a young man called freddie who kept hoping aloud that there was nothing seriously wrong with charlotte she recalled felikss cut hand which had caused him to give such a shout when she squeezed it she had only glimpsed the wound but it looked as if it had been bad enough to need stitches nevertheless it was not until the end of the evening when she sat in her bedroom at home brushing her hair that it occurred to her to connect feliks with the madman in the park the thought was so frightening that she dropped a goldbacked hairbrush onto the dressing table and broke a glass vial of perfume what if feliks had come to london to kill aleks suppose it was feliks who had attacked the coach in the park not to rob them but to get at aleks had the man with the gun been felikss height and build yes roughly and stephen had wounded him with his sword then aleks had left the house because he was frightened or perhaps she now realized because he knew the robbery had been an assassination attempt and feliks had not known where to find him so he had asked lydia she stared at herself in the mirror the woman she saw there had gray eyes fair eyebrows blond hair a pretty face and the brain of a sparrow could it be true could feliks have deceived her so yesbecause he had spent nineteen years imagining that she had betrayed him she picked up the pieces of broken glass from the vial and put them in a handkerchief then she mopped up the spilled perfume she did not know what to do now she had to warn stephen but how by the way an anarchist called this morning and asked me where aleks had gone and because he used to be my lover i told him she would have to make up a story she thought for a while once upon a time she had been an expert barefaced liar but she was out of practice eventually she decided she could get away with a combination of the lies feliks had told to her and to pritchard she put on a cashmere robe over the silk nightgown and went through to stephens bedroom he was sitting at the window in pajamas and a dressing gown with a small glass of brandy in one hand and a cigar in the other looking out over the moonlit park he was surprised to see her come in for it was always he who went to her room in the night he stood up with a welcoming smile and embraced her she realized that he misunderstood her visit he thought she had come to make love she said i want to talk to you he released her he looked disappointed at this time of night i think i may have done something awfully silly youd better tell me about it they sat down on opposite sides of the cold fireplace suddenly lydia wished she had come to make love she said a man called this morning he said he had known me in st petersburg well the name was familiar and i thought i vaguely recalled him you know how it is sometimes what was his name levin go on he said he wanted to see prince orlov stephen was suddenly very attentive why something to do with a sailor who had been unjustly imprisoned this levin wanted to make a personal plea for the mans release what did you say i told him the savoy hotel damn stephen cursed then apologized pardon me afterward it occurred to me that levin might have been up to no good he had a cut handand i remembered that you had cut the madman in the park so you see it dawned on me gradually ive done something dreadful havent i its not your fault in fact its mine i should have told you the truth about the man in the park but i thought it better not to frighten you i was wrong poor aleks lydia said to think that someone would want to kill him hes so sweet what was levin like the question unsettled lydia for a moment she had been thinking of levin as an unknown assassin now she was forced to describe feliks oh tall thin with dark hair about my age obviously russian a nice face rather lined she tailed off and i yearn for him stephen stood up ill go and rouse pritchard he can drive me to the hotel lydia wanted to say no dont take me to bed instead i need your warmth and tenderness she said im so sorry it may be for the best stephen said she looked at him in surprise why because when he comes to the savoy hotel to assassinate aleks i shall catch him and then lydia knew that before this was over one of the two men she loved would surely kill the other feliks gently lifted the bottle of nitroglycerine out of the sink he crossed the room as if he were walking on eggshells his pillow was on the mattress he had enlarged the rip until it was about six inches long and now he put the bottle through the hole and into the pillow he arranged the stuffing all around the bottle so that the bomb lay cocooned in shockabsorbing material he picked up the pillow and cradling it like a baby placed it in his open suitcase he closed the case and breathed more easily he put on his coat his scarf and his respectable hat carefully he turned the cardboard suitcase on to its edge then picked it up he went out the journey into the west end was a nightmare of course he could not use the bicycle but even walking was nerveracking every second he visualized that brown glass bottle in its pillow every time his foot hit the pavement he imagined the little shock wave which must travel up his body and down his arm to the case in his mind he saw the molecules of nitroglycerine vibrating faster and faster under his hand he passed a woman washing the pavement in front of her house he went by on the road in case he should slip on the wet flagstones and she jeered ascared of getting yer feet wet toff outside a factory in euston a crowd of apprentices poured through the gates chasing a football feliks stood stockstill as they rushed all around him jostling and fighting for the ball then someone kicked it clear and they were gone as quickly as they had arrived crossing the euston road was a dance with death he stood at the curb for five minutes waiting for a goodsized gap in the stream of traffic and then he had to walk across so fast he was almost running in tottenham court road he went into a highclass stationers it was calm and hushed in the shop he set the suitcase down gently on the counter an assistant in a morning coat said can i help you sir i need an envelope please the assistant raised his eyebrows just the one sir yes any particular kind sir just plain but good quality we have blue ivory eaudenil cream beige white very good sir and a sheet of paper one sheet of paper sir they charged him threepence on principle he would have preferred to run off without paying but he could not run with the bomb in his case charing cross road teemed with people on their way to work in shops and offices it was impossible to walk at all without getting buffeted feliks stood in a doorway for a while wondering what to do finally he decided to carry the case in his arms to protect it from the scurrying hordes in leicester square he took refuge in a bank he sat at one of the writing tables where the customers made out their checks there was a tray of pens and an inkwell he put the case on the floor between his feet he relaxed for a moment frockcoated bank clerks padded softly by with papers in their hands feliks took a pen and wrote on the front of his envelope prince a a orlov the savoy hotel strand london w he folded the blank sheet of paper and slipped it inside the envelope just for the sake of its weight he did not want the envelope to seem empty he licked the gummed flap and sealed it shut then he reluctantly picked up the suitcase and left the bank in trafalgar square he dipped his handkerchief in the fountain and cooled his face with it he passed charing cross station and walked east along the embankment near waterloo bridge a small group of urchins lounged against the parapet throwing stones at the seagulls on the river feliks spoke to the most intelligentlooking boy do you want a penny yes guv are your hands clean yes guv the boy showed a pair of filthy hands they would have to do feliks thought do you know where the savoy hotel is too right feliks assumed this meant the same as yes guv he handed the boy the envelope and a penny count to a hundred slowly then take this letter to the hotel do you understand yes guv feliks mounted the steps to the bridge it was thronged with men in bowler hats coming across the river from the waterloo side feliks joined the procession he went into a newsagents and bought the times as he was leaving a young man rushed in through the door feliks stuck out his arm and stopped the man shouting look where youre going the man stared at him in surprise as feliks went out he heard the man say to the shopkeeper nervous type is he foreigner said the shopkeeper and then feliks was outside he turned off the strand and went into the hotel in the lobby he sat down and placed the suitcase on the floor between his feet not much farther now he thought from his seat he could see both doors and the hall porters desk he put his hand inside his coat and consulted an imaginary fob watch then opened his newspaper and settled down to wait as if he were early for an appointment he pulled the suitcase closer to his seat and stretched out his legs on either side of it to protect it against an accidental kick from a careless passerby the lobby was crowded it was just before ten oclock this is when the ruling class has breakfast feliks thought he had not eaten he had no appetite today he examined the other people in the lobby over the top of the times there were two men who might be detectives feliks wondered whether they might impede his escape but even if they hear the explosion he thought how will they know which of the dozens of people walking through this lobby was responsible for it nobody knows what i look like only if i were being chased would they know ill have to make sure im not chased he wondered whether the urchin would come after all the boy had his penny already perhaps by now he had thrown the envelope into the river and gone off to the sweet shop if so feliks would simply have to go through the whole rigmarole again until he found an honest urchin he read an article in the newspaper looking up every few seconds the government wanted to make those who gave money to the womens social and political union liable to pay for damage done by suffragettes they planned to bring in special legislation to make this possible how foolish governments are when they become intransigent feliks thought everyone will just give money anonymously where was that urchin he wondered what orlov was doing right now in all probability he was in one of the rooms of the hotel a matter of yards above felikss head eating breakfast or shaving or writing a letter or having a discussion with walden id like to kill walden too feliks thought it was not impossible that the two of them should walk through the lobby at any minute that was too much to hope for what would i do if it happened thought feliks i would throw the bomb and die happy through the glass door he saw the urchin the boy came along the narrow road which led to the hotel entrance feliks could see the envelope in his hand he held it by one corner almost distastefully as if it were dirty and he were clean instead of the reverse he approached the door but was stopped by a commissionaire in a top hat there was some discussion inaudible from inside then the boy went away the commissionaire came into the lobby with the envelope in his hand feliks tensed would it work the commissionaire handed in the envelope at the bell captains desk the captain looked at it picked up a pencil scribbled something in the top righthand cornera room numberand summoned a bellboy it was working feliks stood up gently lifted his case and headed for the stairs the bellboy passed him on the first floor and went on up feliks followed it was almost too easy he allowed the bellboy to get one flight of stairs ahead then he quickened his step to keep him in view on the fifth floor the boy walked along the corridor feliks stopped and watched the boy knocked on a door it was opened a hand came out and took the envelope got you orlov the bellboy made a pantomime of going away and was called back feliks could not hear the words the boy received a tip he said thank you very much indeed sir very kind of you the door closed feliks started to walk along the corridor the boy saw his case and reached for it saying can i help you with that sir no feliks said sharply very good sir said the boy and he passed on feliks walked to the door of orlovs room were there no more security precautions walden might imagine that a killer could not get into a london hotel room but orlov would know better for a moment feliks was tempted to go away and do some more thinking or perhaps more reconnaissance but he was too close to orlov now he put the suitcase down on the carpet outside the door he opened the case reached inside the pillow and carefully withdrew the brown bottle he straightened up slowly he knocked on the door eight walden looked at the envelope it was addressed in a neat characterless hand it had been written by a foreigner for an englishman would have put prince orlov or prince aleksey but not prince a a orlov walden would have liked to know what was inside but aleks had moved out of the hotel in the middle of the night and walden could not open it in his absenceit was after all another gentlemans mail he handed it back to basil thomson who had no such scruples thomson ripped it open and took out a single sheet of paper blank he said there was a knock at the door they all moved quickly walden went over to the windows away from the door and out of the line of fire and stood behind a sofa ready to duck the two detectives moved to either side of the room and drew their guns thomson stood in the middle of the room behind a large overstuffed easy chair the knock came again thomson called come inits open the door opened and there he stood walden clutched at the back of the sofa he looked frightening he was a tall man in a bowler hat and a black coat buttoned to the neck he had a long gaunt white face in his left hand he held a large brown bottle his eyes swept the room and he understood in a flash that this was a trap he lifted the bottle and said nitro dont shoot thomson barked at the detectives walden was sick with fear he knew what nitroglycerine was if the bottle fell they would all die he wanted to live he did not want to die in an instant of burning agony there was a long moment of silence nobody moved walden stared at the face of the killer it was a shrewd hard determined face every detail was imprinted on waldens mind in that short terrible pause the curved nose the wide mouth the sad eyes the thick black hair showing beneath the brim of the hat is he mad walden wondered bitter heartless sadistic the face showed only that he was fearless thomson broke the silence give yourself up he said put the bottle on the floor stop being a fool walden was thinking if the detectives shoot and the man falls could i get to him in time to catch the bottle before it crashes to the floor no the killer stood motionless bottle raised high hes looking at me not thomson walden realized hes studying me as if he finds me fascinating taking in the details wondering what makes me tick its a personal look hes as interested in me as i am in him he has realized aleks isnt herewhat will he do now the killer spoke to walden in russian youre not as stupid as you look walden thought is he suicidal will he kill us all and himself too better keep him talking then the man was gone walden heard his footsteps running down the corridor walden made for the door the other three were ahead of him out in the corridor the detectives knelt on the floor aiming their guns walden saw the killer running away with a queer fluid step his left arm hanging straight down by his side holding the bottle as steady as possible while he ran if it goes off now walden thought will it kill us at this distance probably not thomson was thinking the same he said shoot two guns crashed the killer stopped and turned was he hit he swung back his arm and hurled the bottle at them thomson and the two detectives threw themselves flat walden realized in a flash that if the nitroglycerine exploded anywhere near them it would be no use to be lying flat the bottle turned over and over in the air as it flew at them it was going to hit the floor five feet away from walden if it landed it would surely explode walden ran toward the flying bottle it descended in a flat arc he reached for it with both hands he caught it his fingers seemed to slip on the glass he fumbled it panicking he almost lost it then he grasped it again dont slip christ jesus dont slip and like a goalkeeper catching a football he drew it to his body cushioning it against his chest and spun around in the direction of travel of the bottle then he lost his balance and fell to his knees and steadied himself still holding the bottle and thinking im going to die nothing happened the others stared at him on his knees cradling the bottle in his arms like a newborn baby one of the detectives fainted feliks stared in amazement at walden for a split second longer then he turned and raced down the stairs walden was amazing what a nerve to catch that bottle he heard a distant shout go after him its happening again he thought im running away again what is the matter with me the stairs were endless he heard running footsteps behind him a shot rang out on the next landing he crashed into a waiter with a tray the waiter fell and crockery and food flew everywhere the pursuer was one or two flights behind him he reached the foot of the staircase he composed himself and walked into the lobby it was still crowded he felt as if he were walking a tightrope out of the corner of his eye he spotted the two men he had identified as possibly detectives they were deep in conversation looking worried they must have heard distant gunfire he walked slowly across the lobby fiercely resisting the urge to break into a run he had the illusion that everyone was staring at him he looked ahead fixedly he reached the door and went out cab sir said the doorman feliks jumped into a waiting cab and it pulled away as it turned into the strand he looked back at the hotel one of the detectives from upstairs burst out of the door followed by the two from the lobby they spoke to the doorman he pointed at felikss cab the detectives drew their guns and ran after the cab the traffic was heavy the cab stopped in the strand feliks jumped out the cabbie shouted oi whats on john feliks dodged through the traffic to the far side of the road and ran north he looked back over his shoulder they were still after him he had to stay ahead until he could lose himself somewhere in a maze of back alleys or a railway station a uniformed policeman saw him running and watched suspiciously from the other side of the street a minute later the detectives saw the policeman and yelled at him he joined the chase feliks ran faster his heart pounded and his breath came in ragged gasps he turned a corner and found himself in the fruit and vegetable market of covent garden the cobbled streets were jammed with trucks and horsedrawn wagons everywhere there were market porters carrying wooden trays on their heads or pushing handcarts barrels of apples were being manhandled off wagons by heavily muscled men in undershirts boxes of lettuce and tomatoes and strawberries were bought and sold by men in bowler hats and fetched and carried by men in caps the noise was terrific feliks plunged into the heart of the market he hid behind a stack of empty crates and peered through the slats after a moment he saw his pursuers they stood still looking around there was some conversation then the four of them split up to search so lydia betrayed me feliks thought as he caught his breath did she know in advance that i was after orlov to kill him no she cant have she wasnt acting a part that morning she wasnt dissembling when she kissed me but if she believed the story about getting a sailor out of jail surely she would never have said anything to walden well perhaps later she realized that i had lied to her so then she warned her husband because she didnt want to have any part in the killing of orlov she didnt exactly betray me she wont kiss me next time there wont be a next time the uniformed policeman was coming his way he moved around the stack of crates and found himself alone in a little backwater concealed by the boxes all around him anyway he thought i escaped their trap thank god for nitroglycerine but they are supposed to be afraid of me i am the hunter i am the one who sets traps its waldenhes the danger twice now he has got in the way who would have thought an aristocrat with gray hair would have had so much spunk he wondered where the policeman was he peeped out he came facetoface with the man the policemans face was forming into an expression of astonishment when feliks grabbed him by the coat and jerked him into the little enclosure the policeman stumbled feliks tripped him he fell on the floor feliks dropped on top of him and got him by the throat he began to squeeze feliks hated policemen he remembered bialystock when the strikebreakersthugs with iron barshad beaten up the workers outside the mill while the police looked on unmoving he remembered the pogrom when the hooligans ran wild in the jewish quarter setting fire to houses and kicking old men and raping the young girls while the police watched laughing he recalled bloody sunday when the troops fired round after round into the peaceful crowd in front of the winter palace and the police watched cheering he saw in his mind the police who had taken him to the fortress of st peter and st paul to be tortured and those who had escorted him to siberia and stolen his coat and those who had burst into the strike meeting in st petersburg with their truncheons waving hitting the womens headsthey always hit the women a policeman was a worker who had sold his soul feliks tightened his grip the mans eyes closed and he stopped struggling feliks squeezed harder he heard a sound his head whipped around a small child of two or three years stood there eating an apple watching him strangle the policeman feliks thought what am i waiting for he let the policeman go the child walked over and looked down at the unconscious man feliks looked out he could not see any of the detectives the child said is he sleepy feliks walked away he got out of the market without seeing any of his pursuers he made his way to the strand he began to feel safe in trafalgar square he caught an omnibus i almost died walden kept thinking i almost died he sat in the hotel suite while thomson gathered his team of detectives somebody gave him a glass of brandyandsoda and that was when he noticed that his hands were shaking he could not put from his mind the image of that bottle of nitroglycerine in his hands he tried to concentrate on thomson the policeman changed visibly as he spoke to his men he took his hands out of his pockets he sat on the edge of his chair and his voice altered from a drawl to a crisp snap walden began to calm down as thomson was talking this man has slipped through our fingers thomson said it is not going to happen a second time we know something about him now and were going to find out a great deal more we know he was in st petersburg during or before because lady walden remembers him we know hes been to switzerland because the suitcase in which he carried the bomb was swiss and we know what he looks like that face walden thought and he clenched his fists thomson went on watts i want you and your lads to spend a little money in the east end the man is almost certainly russian so hes probably an anarchist and jewish but dont count on it lets see if we can put a name to him if we can cable zurich and st petersburg and ask for information richards you start with the envelope it was probably bought singly so a shop assistant might remember the sale woods you work on the bottle its a winchester bottle with a groundglass stopper the name of the manufacturer is stamped on the bottom find out who in london they supply it to send your team around all the shops and see whether any chemists remember a customer answering to the description of our man he will have bought the ingredients for nitroglycerine in several different shops of course and if we can find those shops we will know where in london to look for him walden was impressed he had not realized that the killer had left behind so many clues he began to feel better thomson addressed a young man in a felt hat and soft collar taylor yours is the most important job lord walden and i have seen the killer briefly but lady walden has had a good long look at him youll come with us to see her ladyship and with her help and ours youll draw a picture of the fellow i want the picture printed tonight and distributed to every police station in london by midday tomorrow surely walden thought the man cannot escape us now then he remembered that he had thought the same when they set the trap here in the hotel room and he began to tremble again feliks looked in the mirror he had had his hair cut very short like a prussian and he had plucked his eyebrows until they were thin lines he would stop shaving immediately so that in a day he would look scruffy and in a week his beard and mustache would cover his distinctive mouth and chin unfortunately there was nothing he could do about his nose he had bought a pair of secondhand spectacles with wire rims the lenses were small so he could look over the top of them he had changed his bowler hat and black coat for a blue sailors pea jacket and a tweed cap with a peak a close look would still reveal him as the same man but to a casual glance he was completely different he knew he had to leave bridgets house he had bought all his chemicals within a mile or two of here and when the police learned that they would begin a housetohouse search sooner or later they would end up in this street and one of the neighbors would say i know him he stops in bridgets basement he was on the run it was humiliating and depressing he had been on the run at other times but always after killing someone never before he gathered up his razor his spare underwear his homemade dynamite and his book of pushkin stories and tied them all up in his clean shirt then he went to bridgets parlor jesus mary and joseph what have you done to your eyebrows she said you used to be a handsome man i must leave he said she looked at his bundle i can see your luggage if the police come you dont have to lie to them ill say i threw you out because i suspected you were an anarchist goodbye bridget take off those daft glasses and kiss me feliks kissed her cheek and went out good luck boy she called after him he took the bicycle and for the third time since he had arrived in london he went looking for lodgings he rode slowly he was no longer weak from the sword wounds but his spirit was sapped by his sense of failure he went through north london and the city then crossed the river at london bridge on the far side he headed southeast passing a pub called the elephant and castle in the region of the old kent road he found the kind of slum where he could get cheap accommodation and no questions asked he took a room on the fifth floor of a tenement building owned the caretaker told him lugubriously by the church of england he would not be able to make nitroglycerine here there was no water in the room nor indeed in the buildingjust a standpipe and a privy in the courtyard the room was grim there was a telltale mousetrap in the corner and the one window was covered with a sheet of newspaper the paint was peeling and the mattress stank the caretaker a stooped fat man shuffling in carpet slippers and coughing said if you want to mend the window i can get glass cheap feliks said where can i keep my bicycle i should bring it up here if i were you itll get nicked anywhere else with the bicycle in the room there would be just enough space to get from the door to the bed ill take the room feliks said thatll be twelve shillings then you said three shillings a week four weeks in advance feliks paid him after buying the spectacles and trading in the clothes he now had one pound and nineteen shillings the caretaker said if you want to decorate i can get you halfprice paint ill let you know said feliks the room was filthy but that was the least of his problems tomorrow he had to start looking for orlov again stephen thank heaven youre all right said lydia he put his arm around her of course im all right what happened im afraid we didnt catch our man lydia almost fainted with relief ever since stephen had said i shall catch the man she had been terrified twice over terrified that feliks would kill stephen and terrified that if not she would be responsible for putting feliks in jail for the second time in her life she knew what he had gone through the first time and the thought nauseated her you know basil thomson i think stephen said and this is mr taylor the police artist were all going to help him draw the face of the killer lydias heart sank she would have to spend hours visualizing her lover in the presence of her husband when will this end she thought stephen said by the way where is charlotte shopping lydia told him good i dont want her to know anything about this in particular i dont want her to know where aleks has gone dont tell me either lydia said id rather not know that way i shant be able to make the same mistake again they sat down and the artist got out his sketchbook over and over again he drew that face lydia could have drawn it herself in five minutes at first she tried to make the artist get it wrong by saying not quite when something was exactly right and thats it when something was crucially awry but stephen and thomson had both seen feliks clearly if briefly and they corrected her in the end fearful of being found out she cooperated properly knowing all the time that she might still be helping them to put feliks in prison again they ended up with a very good likeness of the face lydia loved after that her nerves were so bad that she took a dose of laudanum and went to sleep she dreamed that she was going to st petersburg to meet feliks with the devastating logic of dreams it seemed that she drove to catch the ship in a carriage with two duchesses who in real life would have expelled her from polite society had they known of her past however they made a mistake and went to bournemouth instead of southampton there they stopped for a rest although it was five oclock and the ship sailed at seven the duchesses told lydia that they slept together at night and caressed each other in a perverted way somehow this came as no surprise at all although they were both extremely old lydia kept saying we must go now but they took no notice a man came with a message for lydia it was signed your anarchist lover lydia said to the messenger tell my anarchist lover that im trying to get the seven oclock boat there the cat was out of the bag the duchesses exchanged knowing winks at twenty minutes to seven still in bournemouth lydia realized that she had not yet packed her luggage she raced around throwing things into cases but she could never find anything and the seconds ticked by and she was already too late and somehow her case would not fill up and she panicked and went without her luggage and climbed on the carriage and drove herself and lost her way on the seafront at bournemouth and could not get out of town and woke up without getting anywhere near southampton then she lay in bed with her heart beating fast her eyes wide open and staring at the ceiling and she thought it was only a dream thank god thank god feliks went to bed miserable and woke up angry he was angry with himself the killing of orlov was not a superhuman task the man might be guarded but he could not be locked away in an underground vault like money in a bank besides even bank vaults could be robbed feliks was intelligent and determined with patience and persistence he would find a way around all the obstacles they would put in his path he was being hunted well he would not be caught he would travel by the back streets avoid his neighbors and keep a constant lookout for blue police uniforms since he had begun his career of violence he had been hunted many times but he had never been caught so he got up washed at the standpipe in the courtyard remembered not to shave put on his tweed cap his pea jacket and his spectacles had breakfast at a tea stall and cycled avoiding the main roads to st jamess park the first thing he saw was a uniformed policeman pacing up and down outside the walden house that meant he could not take up his usual position for observing the house he had to retreat much farther into the park and watch from a distance he could not stay in the same place for too long either in case the policeman was alert and keeneyed enough to notice at about midday a motor car emerged from the house feliks ran for his bicycle he had not seen the car go in so presumably it was waldens previously the family had always traveled in a coach but there was no reason why they should not have both horsedrawn and motor vehicles feliks was too far away to be able to guess who was inside the car he hoped it was walden the car headed for trafalgar square feliks cut across the grass to intercept it the car was a few yards ahead of him when he reached the road he kept up with it easily around trafalgar square then it drew ahead of him as it headed north on charing cross road he pedaled fast but not desperately so for one thing he did not want to draw attention to himself and for another he wanted to conserve his strength but he was too cautious for when he reached oxford street the car was out of sight he cursed himself for a fool which direction had it taken there were four possibilities left straight on right or sharp right he guessed and went straight on in the traffic jam at the north end of tottenham court road he saw the car again and breathed a sigh of relief he caught up with it as it turned east he risked going close enough to see inside in the front was a man in a chauffeurs cap in the back was someone with gray hair and a beard walden ill kill him too feliks thought by christ ill kill him in the traffic jam outside euston station he passed the car and got ahead taking the chance that walden might look at him when the car caught up again he stayed ahead all down euston road looking back over his shoulder continually to check that the car was still following him he waited at the junction by kings cross breathing hard until the car passed him it turned north he averted his face as it went by then followed the traffic was fairly heavy and he was able to keep pace although he was tiring he began to hope that walden was going to see orlov a house in north london discreet and suburban might be a good hiding place his excitement mounted he might be able to kill them both after half a mile or so the traffic began to thin out the car was large and powerful feliks had to pedal faster and faster he was sweating heavily he thought how much farther heavy traffic at holloway road gave him a brief rest then the car picked up speed along seven sisters road he went as fast as he could any minute now the car might turn off the main road it might be only minutes from its destination all i want is some luck he thought he summoned up his last reserves of strength his legs hurt now and his breath came in ragged gasps the car pulled remorselessly away from him when it was a hundred yards ahead and still accelerating he gave up he coasted to a halt and sat on the bicycle at the side of the road bent over the handlebars waiting to recover he felt faint it was always the way he thought bitterly the ruling class fought in comfort there was walden sitting comfortably in a big smooth car smoking a cigar not even having to drive walden was plainly going out of town orlov could be anywhere north of london within half a days journey by fast motor car feliks was utterly defeatedagain for want of a better idea he turned around and headed back toward st jamess park charlotte was still tingling from mrs pankhursts speech of course there would be misery and suffering while all power was in the hands of one half of the world and that half had no understanding of the problems of the other half men accepted a brutish and unjust world because it was brutish and unjust not to them but to women if women had power there would be nobody left to oppress the day after the suffragette meeting her mind teemed with speculations of this kind she saw all the women around herservants shop assistants nurses in the park even mamain a new light she felt she was beginning to understand how the world worked she no longer resented mama and papa for lying to her they had not really lied to her except by omission besides insofar as deceit was involved they deceived themselves almost as much as they had deceived her and papa had spoken frankly to her against his evident inclinations still she wanted to find out things for herself so that she could be sure of the truth in the morning she got hold of some money by the simple expedient of going shopping with a footman and saying to him give me a shilling later while he waited with the carriage at the main entrance to libertys in regent street she slipped out of a side entrance and walked to oxford street where she found a woman selling the suffragette newspaper votes for women the paper cost a penny charlotte went back to libertys and in the ladies cloakroom hid the newspaper under her dress then she returned to the carriage she read the paper in her room after lunch she learned that the incident at the palace during her debut had not been the first time that the plight of women had been brought to the attention of the king and queen last december three suffragettes in beautiful evening gowns had barricaded themselves inside a box at covent garden the occasion was a gala performance of jeanne darc by raymond roze attended by the king and queen with a large entourage at the end of the first act one of the suffragettes stood up and began to harangue the king through a megaphone it took them half an hour to break down the door and get the women out of the box then forty more suffragettes in the front rows of the gallery stood up threw showers of pamphlets down into the stalls and walked out en masse before and after this incident the king had refused to give an audience to mrs pankhurst arguing that all subjects had an ancient right to petition the king about their grievances the suffragettes announced that a deputation would march to the palace accompanied by thousands of women charlotte realized that the march was to take place todaythis afternoonnow she wanted to be there it was no good understanding what was wrong she told herself if one did nothing about it and mrs pankhursts speech was still ringing in her ears the spirit which is in women today cannot be quenched papa had gone off with pritchard in the motor car mama was lying down after lunch as usual there was nobody to stop her she put on a dowdy dress and her most unprepossessing hat and coat then she went quietly down the stairs and out of the house feliks walked about the park keeping the house always in view racking his brains somehow he had to find out where walden was going in the motor car how might that be achieved could he try lydia again he might at some risk get past the policeman and into the house but would he get out again would lydia not raise the alarm even if she let him go she would hardly tell him the secret of orlovs hiding place now that she knew why he wanted to know perhaps he could seduce herbut where and when he could not follow waldens car on a bike could he follow in another car he could steal one but he did not know how to drive them could he learn even then would waldens chauffeur not notice that he was being followed if he could hide in waldens motor car that meant getting inside the garage opening the trunk spending several hours insideall in the hope that nothing would be put inside the trunk before the journey the odds against success were too high for him to risk everything on that gamble the chauffeur must know of course could he be bribed made drunk kidnapped felikss mind was elaborating these possibilities when he saw the girl come out of the house he wondered who she was she might be a servant for the family always came and went in coaches but she had come out of the main entrance and feliks had never seen servants do that she might be lydias daughter she might know where orlov was feliks decided to follow her she walked toward trafalgar square leaving his bicycle in the bushes feliks went after her and got a closer look her clothes did not look like those of a servant he recalled that there had been a girl in the coach on the night he had first tried to kill orlov he had not taken a good look at her because all his attention had beendisastrouslyriveted to lydia during his many days observing the house he had glimpsed a girl in the carriage from time to time this was probably the girl feliks decided she was sneaking out on a clandestine errand while her father was away and her mother was busy there was something vaguely familiar about her he thought as he tailed her across trafalgar square he was quite sure he had never looked closely at her yet he had a strong sense of déjà vu as he watched her trim figure walk straightbacked and with a determined quick pace through the streets occasionally he saw her face in profile when she turned to cross a road and the tilt of her chin or perhaps something about the eyes seemed to strike a chord deep in his memory did she remind him of the young lydia not at all he realized lydia had always looked small and frail and her features were all delicate this girl had a stronglooking angular face it reminded feliks of a painting by an italian artist which he had seen in a gallery in geneva after a moment the name of the painter came back to him modigliani he got still closer to her and a minute or two later he saw her full face his heart skipped a beat and he thought shes just beautiful where was she going to meet a boyfriend perhaps to buy something forbidden to do something of which her parents would disapprove such as go to a movingpicture show or a music hall the boyfriend theory was the likeliest it was also the most promising possibility from felikss point of view he could find out who the boyfriend was and threaten to give away the girls secret unless she would tell him where orlov was she would not do it readily of course especially if she had been told that an assassin was after orlov but given the choice between the love of a young man and the safety of a russian cousin feliks reckoned that a young girl would choose romance he heard a distant noise he followed the girl around a corner suddenly he was in a street full of marching women many of them wore the suffragette colors of green white and purple many carried banners there were thousands of them somewhere a band played marching tunes the girl joined the demonstration and began to march feliks thought wonderful the route was lined with policemen but they mostly faced inward toward the women so feliks could dodge along the pavement behind their backs he went with the march keeping the girl in sight he had been in need of a piece of luck and he had been given one she was a secret suffragette she was vulnerable to blackmail but there might be more subtle ways of manipulating her one way or another feliks thought ill get what i want from her charlotte was thrilled the march was orderly with female stewards keeping the women in line most of the marchers were welldressed respectablelooking types the band played a jaunty twostep there were even a few men carrying a banner which read fight the government that refuses to give women the parliamentary vote charlotte no longer felt like a misfit with heretical views why she thought all these thousands of women think and feel as i do at times in the last twentyfour hours she had wondered whether men were right in saying that women were weak stupid and ignorant for she sometimes felt weak and stupid and she really was ignorant now she thought if we educate ourselves we wont be ignorant if we think for ourselves we wont be stupid and if we struggle together we wont be weak the band began to play the hymn jerusalem and the women sang the words charlotte joined in lustily i will not cease from mental fight nor shall my sword sleep in my hand i dont care if anybody sees me she thought defiantlynot even the duchesses till we have built jerusalem in englands green and pleasant land the march crossed trafalgar square and entered the mall suddenly there were many more policemen watching the women intently there were also many spectators mostly male along either side of the road they shouted and whistled derisively charlotte heard one of them say all you need is a good swiving and she blushed crimson she noticed that many women carried a staff with a silver arrow fixed to its top she asked the woman nearest her what that symbolized the arrows on prison clothing the woman replied all the women who carry that have been to jail to jail charlotte was taken aback she had known that a few suffragettes had been imprisoned but as she looked around she saw hundreds of silver arrows for the first time it occurred to her that she might end the day in prison the thought made her feel weak i wont go on she thought my house is just there across the park i can be there in five minutes prison i would die she looked back then she thought ive done nothing wrong why am i afraid that i shall go to prison why should i not petition the king unless we do this women will always be weak ignorant and stupid then the band began again and she squared her shoulders and marched in time the facade of buckingham palace loomed up at the end of the mall a line of policemen many on horseback stretched across the front of the building charlotte was near the head of the procession she wondered what the leaders intended to happen when they reached the gates she remembered once coming out of derry toms and seeing an afternoon drunk lurching at her across the pavement a gentleman in a top hat had pushed the drunk aside with his walking cane and the footman had quickly helped charlotte up into the carriage which was waiting at the curb nobody would rush to protect her from a jostling today they were at the palace gates last time i was here charlotte thought i had an invitation the head of the procession came up against the line of policemen for a moment there was deadlock the people behind pressed forward suddenly charlotte saw mrs pankhurst she wore a jacket and skirt of purple velvet a highnecked white blouse and a green waistcoat her hat was purple with a huge white ostrich feather and a veil she had detached herself from the body of the march and somehow had managed unnoticed to reach the far gate of the palace courtyard she was such a brave little figure marching with her head held high to the kings gate she was stopped by a police inspector in a flat hat he was a huge burly man and looked at least a foot taller than she there was a brief exchange of words mrs pankhurst stepped forward the inspector barred her way she tried to push past him then to charlottes horror the policeman grabbed mrs pankhurst in a bear hug lifted her off her feet and carried her away charlotte was enragedand so was every other woman in sight the marchers pressed fiercely against the police line charlotte saw one or two break through and run toward the palace chased by constables the horses shifted their iron hooves clattering threateningly on the pavement the line began to break up several woman struggled with policemen and were thrown to the ground charlotte was terrified of being manhandled some of the male bystanders rushed to the aid of the police and then jostling turned into fighting a middleaged woman close to charlotte was grabbed by the thighs unhand me sir she said indignantly the policeman said my old dear i can grip you where i like today a group of men in straw boaters waded into the crowd pushing and punching the women and charlotte screamed suddenly a team of suffragettes wielding indian clubs counterattacked and straw boaters flew everywhere there were no longer any spectators everyone was in the melee charlotte wanted to run away but every way she turned she saw violence a fellow in a bowler picked up a young woman by getting one arm across her breasts and one hand in the fork of her thighs and charlotte heard him say youve been waiting for this for a long time havent you the bestiality of it all horrified charlotte it was like one of those medieval paintings of purgatory in which everyone is suffering unspeakable tortures but it was real and she was in the middle of it she was pushed from behind and fell down grazing her hands and bruising her knees someone trod on her hand she tried to get up and was knocked down again she realized she might be trampled by a horse and die desperately she grabbed the skirts of a womans coat and hauled herself to her feet some of the women were throwing pepper into the eyes of the men but it was impossible to throw accurately and they succeeded in incapacitating as many women as men the fighting became vicious charlotte saw a woman lying on the ground with blood streaming from her nose she wanted to help the woman but she could not moveit was as much as she could do to stay upright she began to feel angry as well as scared the men police and civilians alike punched and kicked women with relish charlotte thought hysterically why do they grin so to her horror she felt a large hand grasp her breast the hand squeezed and twisted she turned clumsily shoving the arm away from her she was confronted by a man in his middle twenties welldressed in a tweed suit he put out his hands and grabbed both her breasts digging his fingers in hard nobody had ever touched her there she struggled with the man seeing on his face a wild look of mingled hatred and desire he yelled this is what you need aint it then he punched her in the stomach with his fist the blow seemed to sink into her belly the shock was bad and the pain was worse but what made her panic was that she could not breathe she stood bending forward with her mouth open she wanted to gasp she wanted to scream but she could do neither she felt sure she was going to die she was vaguely aware of a very tall man pushing past her dividing the crowd as if it were a field of wheat the tall man grabbed the lapel of the man in the tweed suit and hit him on the chin the blow seemed to knock the young man off his feet and lift him into the air the look of surprise on his face was almost comical at last charlotte was able to breathe and she sucked in air with a great heave the tall man put his arm firmly around her shoulders and said in her ear this way she realized she was being rescued and the sense of being in the hands of someone strong and protective was such a relief that she almost fainted the tall man propelled her toward the edge of the crowd a police sergeant struck at her with a truncheon charlottes protector raised his arm to ward off the blow then gave a shout of pain as the wooden club landed on his forearm he let go of charlotte there was a brief flurry of blows then the sergeant was lying on the ground bleeding and the tall man was once again leading charlotte through the crush suddenly they were out of it when charlotte realized she was safe she began to cry sobbing softly as tears ran down her cheeks the man made her keep walking lets get right away he said he spoke with a foreign accent charlotte had no will of her own she went where he led her after a while she began to recover her composure she realized they were in the victoria area the man stopped outside a lyons corner house and said would you like a cup of tea she nodded and they went in he led her to a chair then sat opposite her she looked at him for the first time for an instant she was frightened again he had a long face with a curved nose his hair was very short but his cheeks were unshaven he looked somehow rapacious but then she saw that there was nothing but compassion in his eyes she took a deep breath and said how can i ever thank you he ignored the question would you like something to eat just tea she had recognized his accent and she began to speak russian where are you from he looked pleased that she could speak his language i was born in tambov province you speak russian very well my mother is russian and my governess a waitress came and he said two teas please love charlotte thought he is learning english from cockneys she said in russian i dont even know your name im charlotte walden feliks kschessinsky you were brave to join that march she shook her head bravery had nothing to do with it i simply didnt know it would be like that she was thinking who and what is this man where did he come from he looks fascinating but hes guarded id like to know more about him he said what did you expect on the march i dont know why do those men enjoy attacking women this is an interesting question he was suddenly animated and charlotte saw that he had an attractive expressive face you see we put women on a pedestal and pretend they are pure in mind and helpless in body so in polite society at least men must tell themselves that they feel no hostility toward women ever nor do they feel lust for womens bodies now here come some womenthe suffragetteswho plainly are not helpless and need not be worshiped what is more they break the law they deny the myths that men have made themselves believe and they can be assaulted with impunity the men feel cheated and they give expression to all the lust and anger which they have been pretending not to feel this is a great release of tension and they enjoy it charlotte looked at him in amazement it was fantastica complete explanation just like that off the top of his head i like this man she thought she said what do you do for a living he became guarded again unemployed philosopher the tea came it was strong and very sweet and it restored charlotte somewhat she was intrigued by this weird russian and she wanted to draw him out she said you seem to think that all thisthe position of women in society and so onis just as bad for men as it is for women im sure of it why he hesitated men and women are happy when they love a shadow passed briefly across his face and was gone the relation of love is not the same as the relation of worship one worships a god only human beings can be loved when we worship a woman we cannot love her then when we discover she is not a god we hate her this is sad i never thought of that charlotte said wonderingly also every religion has good gods and bad gods the lord and the devil so we have good women and bad women and you can do anything you like to the bad women for example suffragettes and prostitutes what are prostitutes he looked surprised women who sell themselves for he used a russian word that charlotte did not know can you translate that swiving he said in english charlotte flushed and looked away he said is this an impolite word im sorry i know no other charlotte screwed up her courage and said in a low voice sexual intercourse he reverted to russian i think you have been put on a pedestal you cant imagine how awful it is she said fiercely to be so ignorant do women really sell themselves that way oh yes respectable married women must pretend not to like sexual intercourse this sometimes spoils it for the men so they go to the prostitutes the prostitutes pretend to like it very much although since they do it so often with so many different people they dont really enjoy it everyone ends up pretending these things are just what i need to know thought charlotte she wanted to take him home and chain him up in her room so that he could explain things to her day and night she said how did we get like thisall this pretending the answer is a lifetime study at least however im sure it has to do with power men have power over women and rich men have power over poor men a great many fantasies are required to legitimize this systemfantasies about monarchy capitalism breeding and sex these fantasies make us unhappy but without them someone would lose his power and men will not give up power even if it makes them miserable but what is to be done a famous question men who will not give up power must have it taken from them a transfer of power from one faction to another faction within the same class is called a coup and this changes nothing a transfer of power from one class to another is called a revolution and this does change things he hesitated although the changes are not necessarily the ones the revolutionaries sought he went on revolutions occur only when the people rise up en masse against their oppressorsas the suffragettes seem to be doing revolutions are always violent for people will always kill to retain power nevertheless they happen for people will always give their lives in the cause of freedom are you a revolutionary he said in english ill give you three guesses charlotte laughed it was the laugh that did it while he spoke a part of felikss mind had been watching her face gauging her reactions he warmed to her and the affection he felt was somehow familiar he thought i am supposed to bewitch her but she is bewitching me and then she laughed she smiled widely crinkles appeared in the corners of her brown eyes she tipped back her head so that her chin pointed forward she held up her hands palms forward in a gesture that was almost defensive and she chuckled richly deep in her throat feliks was transported back in time twentyfive years he saw a threeroomed hut leaning against the side of a wooden church inside the hut a boy and a girl sat opposite one another at a crude table made of planks on the fire was a castiron pot containing a cabbage a small piece of bacon fat and a great deal of water it was almost dark outside and soon the father would be home for his supper fifteenyearold feliks had just told his eighteenyearold sister natasha the joke about the traveler and the farmers daughter she threw back her head and laughed feliks stared at charlotte she looked exactly like natasha he said how old are you eighteen there occurred to feliks a thought so astonishing so incredible and so devastating that his heart stood still he swallowed and said when is your birthday the second of january he gasped she had been born exactly seven months after the wedding of lydia and walden nine months after the last occasion on which feliks had made love to lydia and charlotte looked exactly like felikss sister natasha and now feliks knew the truth charlotte was his daughter nine what is itcharlotte said what you look as if youd seen a ghost you reminded me of someone tell me all about yourself she frowned at him he seemed to have a lump in his throat she thought she said youve got a cold coming i never catch colds whats your earliest memory she thought for a moment i was brought up in a country house called walden hall in norfolk its a beautiful gray stone building with a very lovely garden in summer we had tea outdoors under the chestnut tree i must have been about four years old when i was first allowed to have tea with mama and papa it was very dull there was nothing to investigate on the lawn i always wanted to go around to the back of the house to the stables one day they saddled a donkey and let me ride it i had seen people ride of course and i thought i knew how to do it they told me to sit still or i would fall off but i didnt believe them first somebody took the bridle and walked me up and down then i was allowed to take the reins myself it all seemed so easy that i gave him a kick as i had seen people do to horses and made him trot next thing i knew i was on the ground in tears i just couldnt believe i had really fallen she laughed at the memory it sounds like a happy childhood feliks said you wouldnt say that if you knew my governess her name is marya and shes a russian dragon little ladies always have clean hands shes still aroundshes my chaperone now stillyou had good food and clothes and you were never cold and there was a doctor when you were sick is that supposed to make you happy i would have settled for it whats your best memory when papa gave me my own pony she said immediately i had wanted one so badly it was like a dream come true i shall never forget that day whats he like who feliks hesitated lord walden papa well it was a good question charlotte thought for a complete stranger feliks was remarkably interested in her but she was even more interested in him there seemed to be some deep melancholy beneath his questions it had not been there a few minutes ago perhaps that was because he had had an unhappy childhood and hers seemed so much better i think papa is probably a terribly good man but he will treat me as a child i know im probably frightfully naïve but ill never be anything else unless i learn he wont explain things to me the waywell the way you do he gets very embarrassed if he talks about men and women you know and when he speaks of politics his views seem a bit i dont know smug thats completely natural all his life hes got everything he wanted and got it easily of course he thinks the world is wonderful just as it is except for a few small problems which will get ironed out in time do you love him yes except for the moments when i hate him the intensity of felikss gaze was beginning to make her uncomfortable he seemed to be drinking in her words and memorizing her facial expressions papa is a very lovable man why are you so interested he gave her a peculiar twisted smile ive been fighting the ruling class all my life but i rarely get the chance to talk to one of them charlotte could tell that this was not the real reason and she wondered vaguely why he should lie to her perhaps he was embarrassed about somethingthat was usually the reason why people were less than honest with her she said im not a member of the ruling class any more than one of my fathers dogs is he smiled tell me about your mother she has bad nerves sometimes she has to take laudanum whats laudanum medicine with opium in it he raised his eyebrows that sounds ominous why i thought the taking of opium was considered degenerate not if its for medical reasons ah youre skeptical always come now tell me what you mean if your mother needs opium i suspect it is because she is unhappy rather than because she is ill why should she be unhappy you tell me shes your mother charlotte considered was mama unhappy she certainly was not content in the way papa seemed to be she worried too much and she would fly off the handle without much provocation shes not relaxed she said but i cant think of any reason why she should be unhappy i wonder if it has to do with leaving your native country thats possible feliks said but he did not sound convinced have you any brothers and sisters no my best friend is my cousin belinda shes the same age as me what other friends have you got no other friends just acquaintances other cousins twin boys six years old of course ive loads of cousins in russia but ive never seen any of them except aleks whos much older than me and what are you going to do with your life what a question dont you know i havent made up my mind what are the alternatives thats a big question really i mean im expected to marry a young man of my own class and raise children i suppose i shall have to marry why well walden hall wont come to me when papa dies you know why not it goes with the titleand i cant be the earl of walden so the house will be left to peter the elder of the twins i see and i couldnt make my own living of course you could ive been trained for nothing train yourself what would i do feliks shrugged raise horses be a shopkeeper join the civil service become a professor of mathematics write a play you talk as if i might do anything i put my mind to i believe you could but i have one quite serious idea your russian is perfectyou could translate novels into english do you really think i could ive no doubt whatsoever charlotte bit her lip why is it that you have such faith in me and my parents dont he thought for a minute then smiled if i had brought you up you would complain that you were forced to do serious work all the time and never allowed to go dancing youve no children he looked away i never married charlotte was fascinated did you want to yes she knew she ought not to go on but she could not resist it she wanted to know what this strange man had been like when he was in love what happened the girl married someone else what was her name lydia thats my mothers name is it lydia shatova she was you must have heard of count shatov if you ever spent any time in st petersburg yes i did do you carry a watch what no nor do i he looked around and saw a clock on the wall charlotte followed his glance heavens its five oclock i intended to get home before mother came down for tea she stood up will you be in trouble he said getting up i expect so she turned to leave the café he said oh charlotte what is it i dont suppose you could pay for the tea im a very poor man oh i wonder whether ive any money yes look elevenpence is that enough of course he took sixpence from the palm of her hand and went to the counter to pay its funny charlotte thought the things you have to remember when youre not in society what would marya think of me buying a cup of tea for a strange man she would have apoplexy he gave her the change and held the door for her ill walk part of the way with you thank you feliks took her arm as they walked along the street the sun was still strong a policeman walked toward them and feliks made her stop and look in a shop window while he passed she said why dont you want him to see us they may be looking for people who were seen on the march charlotte frowned that seemed a bit unlikely but he would know better than she they walked on charlotte said i love june the weather in england is wonderful do you think so youve never been to the south of france then you have obviously we go every winter weve a villa in monte carlo she was struck by a thought i hope you dont think im boasting certainly not he smiled you must have realized by now that i think great wealth is something to be ashamed of not proud of i suppose i should have realized but i hadnt do you despise me then no but the wealth isnt yours youre the most interesting person ive ever met charlotte said may i see you again yes he said have you got a handkerchief she took one from her coat pocket and gave it to him he blew his nose you are catching a cold she said your eyes are streaming you must be right he wiped his eyes shall we meet at that café its not a frightfully attractive place is it she said lets think of somewhere else i know well go to the national gallery then if i see somebody i know we can pretend we arent together all right do you like paintings id like you to educate me then its settled how about the day after tomorrow at two oclock fine it occurred to her that she might not be able to get away if something goes wrong and i have to cancel can i send you a note well er i move about a lot he was struck by a thought but you can always leave a message with mrs bridget callahan at number nineteen cork street in camden town she repeated the address ill write that down as soon as i get home my house is just a few hundred yards away she hesitated you must leave me here i hope you wont be offended but it really would be best if no one saw me with you offended he said with his funny twisted smile no not at all she held out her hand goodbye goodbye he shook her hand firmly she turned around and walked away there will be trouble when i get home she thought they will have found out that im not in my room and there will be an inquisition ill say i went for a walk in the park they wont like it somehow she did not care what they thought she had found a true friend she was very happy when she reached the gate she turned and looked back he stood where she had left him watching her she gave a discreet wave he waved back for some reason he looked vulnerable and sad standing there alone that was silly she realized as she remembered how he had rescued her from the riot he was very tough indeed she went into the courtyard and up the steps to the front door walden arrived at walden hall suffering from nervous indigestion he had rushed away from london before lunch as soon as the police artist had finished drawing the face of the assassin and he had eaten a picnic and drunk a bottle of chablis on the way down without stopping the car as well as that he was nervous today he was due for another session with aleks he guessed that aleks had a counterproposal and expected the czars approval of it by cable today he hoped the russian embassy had had the sense to forward cables to aleks at walden hall he hoped the counterproposal was something reasonable something he could present to churchill as a triumph he was fiercely impatient to get down to business with aleks but he knew that in reality a few minutes made no difference and it was always a mistake to appear eager during a negotiation so he paused in the hall and composed himself before walking into the octagon aleks sat at the window brooding with a great tray of tea and cakes untouched beside him he looked up eagerly and said what happened the man came but im afraid we failed to catch him walden said aleks looked away he came to kill me walden felt a surge of pity for him he was young he had a huge responsibility he was in a foreign country and a killer was stalking him but there was no point in letting him brood walden put on a breezy tone of voice we have the mans description nowin fact the police artist has made a drawing of him thomson will catch him in a day or so and youre safe herehe cant possibly find out where you are we thought i was safe at the hotelbut he found out i was there that cant happen again this was a bad start to a negotiating session walden reflected he had to find a way to turn alekss mind to more cheerful subjects have you had tea im not hungry lets go for a walkit will give you an appetite for dinner all right aleks stood up walden got a gunfor rabbits he told aleksand they walked down to the home farm one of the two bodyguards provided by basil thomson followed ten yards behind them walden showed aleks his champion sow the princess of walden shes won first prize in the east anglian agricultural show for the last two years aleks admired the sturdy brick cottages of the tenants the tall whitepainted barns and the magnificent shire horses i dont make any money out of it of course walden said all the profit is spent on new stock or drainage or buildings or fencing but it sets a standard for the tenanted farms and the home farm will be worth a lot more when i die than it was when i inherited it we cant farm like this in russia aleks said good thought walden hes thinking of something else aleks went on our peasants wont use new methods wont touch machinery wont take care of new buildings or good tools they are still serfs psychologically if not legally when there is a bad harvest and they are starving do you know what they do they burn the empty barns the men were mowing hay in the south acre twelve laborers made a ragged line across the field stooped over their scythes and there was a steady swish swish as the tall stalks fell like dominoes samuel jones the oldest of the laborers finished his row first he came over scythe in hand and touched his cap to walden walden shook his callused hand it was like grasping a rock did your lordship find time to go to that there exhibition in lunnun samuel said yes i did walden replied did you see that mowing machine you was talking about walden put on a dubious face its a beautiful piece of engineering sambut i dont know sam nodded machinery never does the job as well as a laborer on the other hand we could cut the hay in three days instead of a fortnightand by getting it in that much faster we run less risk of rain then we could rent the machine to the tenanted farms youd need fewer laborers too sam said walden pretended to be disappointed no he said i couldnt let anyone go it would just mean we need not take on gypsies to help around harvesttime it wouldnt make that much difference then not really and im a bit concerned about how the men would take to ityou know young peter dawkins will find any excuse to make trouble sam made a noncommittal sound anyway walden continued mr samson is going to take a look at the machine next week samson was the bailiff i say walden said as if he had been struck by an idea i dont suppose youd want to go with him sam sam pretended not to care much for the idea to lunnun he said i went there in didnt like it you could go up on the train with mr samsonperhaps take young dawkins with yousee the machine have your dinner in london and come back in the afternoon i dunno what my missus would say id be glad to have your opinion of the machine though well i should be interested thats settled then ill tell samson to make the arrangements walden smiled conspiratorially you can give mrs jones to understand i practically forced you to go sam grinned ill do that mlord the mowing was almost done the men stopped work any rabbits would be hidden within the last few yards of hay walden called dawkins over and gave him the gun youre a good shot peter see if you can get one for yourself and one for the hall they all stood on the edge of the field out of the line of fire then cut the last of the hay from the side to drive the rabbits into the open field four came out and dawkins got two with his first round and one with his second the gunfire made aleks wince walden took the gun and one of the rabbits then he and aleks walked back toward the hall aleks shook his head in admiration you have a wonderful way with the men he said i never seem to be able to strike the right balance between discipline and generosity it takes practice walden said he held up the rabbit we dont really need this at the hallbut i took it to remind them that the rabbits are mine and that any they have are a gift from me not theirs by right if i had a son walden thought this is how i would explain things to him one proceeds by discussion and consent aleks said its the best methodeven if you have to give something away aleks smiled which brings us back to the balkans thank heavenat last walden thought shall i sum up aleks went on we are willing to fight on your side against germany and you are willing to recognize our right to pass through the bosporus and the dardanelles however we want not just the right but the power our suggestion that you should recognize the whole of the balkan peninsula from rumania to crete as a russian sphere of influence did not meet with your approval no doubt you felt it was giving us too much my task then was to formulate a lesser demand one which would secure our sea passage without committing britain to an unreservedly prorussian balkan policy yes walden thought he has a mind like a surgeons knife a few minutes ago i was giving him fatherly advice and now suddenly he seems my equalat the least i suppose this is how it is when your son becomes a man im sorry it has taken so long aleks said i have to send coded cables via the russian embassy to st petersburg and discussion at this distance just cant be as quick as i should like i understand said walden thinking come onout with it there is an area of about ten thousand square miles from constantinople to adrianopleit amounts to half of thracewhich is at present part of turkey its coastline begins in the black sea borders the bosporus the sea of marmara and the dardanelles and finishes in the aegean sea in other words it guards the whole of the passage between the black sea and the mediterranean he paused give us that and were on your side walden concealed his excitement here was a real basis for bargaining he said the problem remains that it isnt ours to give away consider the possibilities if war breaks out aleks said one if turkey is on our side we will have the right of passage anyway however this is unlikely two if turkey is neutral we would expect britain to insist on our right of passage as a sign that turkeys neutrality was genuine and failing that to support our invasion of thrace three if turkey is on the german sidewhich is the likeliest of the three possibilitiesthen britain would concede that thrace is ours as soon as we can conquer it walden said dubiously i wonder how the thracians would feel about all this they would rather belong to russia than to turkey i expect theyd like to be independent aleks gave a boyish smile neither you nor inor indeed either of our governmentsis in the least concerned about what the inhabitants of thrace might prefer quite walden said he was forced to agree it was alekss combination of boyish charm and thoroughly grownup brains which kept putting walden off balance he always thought he had the discussion firmly under control until aleks came out with a punch line which showed that he had been controlling it all along they walked up the hill that led to the back of walden hall walden noticed the bodyguard scanning the woods on either side dust puffed around his heavy brown brogues the ground was dry it had hardly rained for three months walden was excited about alekss counterproposal what would churchill say surely the russians could be given part of thracewho cared about thrace they crossed the kitchen garden an undergardener was watering lettuces he touched his cap to them walden searched for the mans name but aleks beat him to it a fine evening stanley said aleks we could do with a shower your highness but not too much eh quite so your highness aleks is learning walden thought they went into the house walden rang for a footman ill send a telegram to churchill making an appointment for tomorrow morning ill motor to london first thing good aleks said time is running short charlotte got a big reaction from the footman who opened the door to her oh thank goodness youre home lady charlotte he said charlotte gave him her coat i dont know why you should thank goodness william lady walden has been worried about you he said she asked that you should be sent to her as soon as you arrived ill just go and tidy myself up charlotte said lady walden did say immediately and i said ill go and tidy up charlotte went up to her room she washed her face and unpinned her hair there was a dull muscular ache in her tummy from the punch she had received and her hands were grazed but not badly her knees were sure to be bruised but no one ever saw them she went behind the screen and took off her dress it seemed undamaged i dont look as ive been in a riot she thought she heard her bedroom door open charlotte it was mamas voice charlotte slipped into a robe thinking oh dear shes going to be hysterical she came from behind the screen weve been frantic with worry mama said marya came into the room behind her looking selfrighteous and steelyeyed charlotte said well here i am safe and sound so you can stop worrying now mama reddened you impudent child she shrilled she stepped forward and slapped charlottes face charlotte fell back and sat down heavily on the bed she was stunned not by the blow but by the idea of it mama had never struck her before somehow it seemed to hurt more than all the blows she had received during the riot she caught maryas eye and saw a peculiar look of satisfaction on her face charlotte recovered her composure and said i shall never forgive you for that that you should speak of forgiving me in her rage mama was speaking russian and how soon should i forgive you for joining a mob outside buckingham palace charlotte gasped how did you know marya saw you marching along the mall with those those suffragettes i feel so ashamed god knows who else saw you if the king ever finds out we shall be banished from the court i see charlotte was still smarting from the slap she said nastily so you werent worried about my safety just the family reputation mama looked hurt marya butted in we were worried about both keep quiet marya said charlotte youve done enough damage with your tongue marya did the right thing mama said how could she not tell me charlotte said dont you think women should have the vote certainly notand you shouldnt think so either but i do charlotte said there it is you know nothingyoure still a child we always come back to that dont we im a child and i know nothing who is responsible for my ignorance marya has been in charge of my education for fifteen years as for being a child you know perfectly well that im nothing of the kind you would be quite happy to see me married by christmas and some girls are mothers by the age of thirteen married or not mama was shocked who tells you such things certainly not marya she never told me anything important nor did you mamas voice became almost pleading you have no need of such knowledgeyoure a lady you see what i mean you want me to be ignorant well i dont intend to be mama said plaintively i only want you to be happy no you dont charlotte said stubbornly you want me to be like you no no no mama cried i dont want you to be like me i dont she burst into tears and ran from the room charlotte stared after her mystified and ashamed marya said you see what youve done charlotte looked her up and down gray dress gray hair ugly face smug expression go away marya youve no conception of the trouble and heartache youve caused this afternoon charlotte was tempted to say if you had kept your mouth shut there would have been no heartache instead she said get out you listen to me little charlotte im lady charlotte to you youre little charlotte and charlotte picked up a hand mirror and hurled it at marya marya squealed the missile was badly aimed and smashed against the wall marya scuttled out of the room now i know how to deal with her charlotte thought it occurred to her that she had won something of a victory she had reduced mama to tears and chased marya out of her room thats something she thought i may be stronger than they after all they deserved rough treatment marya went to mama behind my back and mama slapped me but i didnt grovel and apologize and promise to be good in future i gave as good as i got i should be proud so why do i feel so ashamed i hate myself lydia thought i know how charlotte feels but i cant tell her that i understand i always lose control i never used to be like this i was always calm and dignified when she was a little girl i could laugh at her peccadilloes now shes a woman dear god what have i done shes tainted with the blood of her father of feliks im sure of it what am i going to do i thought if i pretended she was stephens daughter she might actually become like a daughter of stepheninnocent ladylike english it was no good all those years the bad blood was in her dormant and now its coming out now the amoral russian peasant in her ancestry is taking her over when i see those signs i panic i cant help it im cursed were all cursed the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children even unto the third and fourth generation when will i be forgiven feliks is an anarchist and charlotte is a suffragette feliks is a fornicator and charlotte talks about thirteenyearold mothers she has no idea how awful it is to be possessed by passion my life was ruined hers will be too thats what im afraid of thats what makes me shout and cry and get hysterical and smack her but sweet jesus dont let her ruin herself shes all ive lived for i shall lock her away if only she would marry a nice boy soon before she has time to go right off the rails before everybody realizes there is something wrong with her breeding i wonder if freddie will propose to her before the end of the seasonthat would be the answer i must make sure he does i must have her married quickly then it will be too late for her to ruin herself besides with a baby or two she wont have time i must make sure she meets freddie more often shes quite pretty shell be a good enough wife to a strong man who can keep her under control a decent man who will love her without unleashing her dark desires a man who will sleep in an adjoining room and share her bed once a week with the light out freddie is just right for her then shell never have to go through what ive been through shell never have to learn the hard way that lust is wicked and destroys the sin wont be passed down yet another generation she wont be wicked like me she thinks i want her to be like me if only she knew if only she knew feliks could not stop crying people stared at him as he walked through the park to retrieve his bicycle he shook with uncontrollable sobs and the tears poured down his face this had never happened to him before and he could not understand it he was helpless with grief he found the bicycle where he had left it beneath a bush and the familiar sight calmed him a little what is happening to me he thought lots of people have children now i know that i have too so what and he burst into tears again he sat down on the dry grass beside the bicycle shes so beautiful he thought but he was not weeping for what he had found he was weeping for what he had lost for eighteen years he had been a father without knowing it while he was wandering from one grim village to another while he was in jail and in the gold mine and walking across siberia and making bombs in bialystock she had been growing up she had learned to walk and to talk and to feed herself and tie her bootlaces she had played on a green lawn under a chestnut tree in summer and had fallen off a donkey and cried her father had given her a pony while feliks had been working on the chain gang she had worn white frocks in summer and woolen stockings in winter she had always been bilingual in russian and english someone else had read storybooks to her someone else had said ill catch you and chased her screaming with delight up the stairs someone else had taught her to shake hands and say how do you do someone else had bathed her and brushed her hair and made her finish up her cabbage many times feliks had watched russian peasants with their children and had wondered how in their lives of misery and grinding poverty they managed to summon up affection and tenderness for the infants who took the bread from their mouths now he knew the love just came whether you wanted it or not from his recollections of other peoples children he could visualize charlotte at different stages of development as a toddler with a protruding belly and no hips to hold up her skirt as a boisterous sevenyearold tearing her frock and grazing her knees as a lanky awkward girl of ten with ink on her fingers and clothes always a little too small as a shy adolescent giggling at boys secretly trying her mothers perfume crazy about horses and then and then this beautiful brave alert inquisitive admirable young woman and im her father he thought her father what was it she had said youre the most interesting person ive ever metmay i see you again he had been preparing to say goodbye to her forever when he knew that he would not have to his selfcontrol had begun to disintegrate she thought he had a cold ah she was young still to make such bright cheerful remarks to a man whose heart was breaking im becoming maudlin he thought i must pull myself together he stood up and picked up the bicycle he mopped his face with the handkerchief she had given him it had a bluebell embroidered in one corner and he wondered whether she had done that herself he mounted the bicycle and headed for the old kent road it was suppertime but he knew he would not be able to eat that was just as well for his money was running low and tonight he did not have the spirit to steal he looked forward now to the darkness of his tenement room where he could spend the night alone with his thoughts he would go over every minute of this encounter from the moment she emerged from the house to that last goodbye wave he would have liked a bottle of vodka for company but he could not afford it he wondered whether anyone had ever given charlotte a red ball the evening was mild but the city air was stale the pubs of the old kent road were already filling up with brightly dressed workingclass women and their husbands boyfriends or fathers on impulse feliks stopped outside one the sound of an elderly piano wafted through the open door feliks thought id like someone to smile at me even if its only a barmaid i could afford half a pint of ale he tied his bicycle to a railing and went in the place was stifling full of smoke and the unique beery smell of an english pub it was early but already there was a good deal of loud laughter and feminine squeals everyone seemed enormously cheerful feliks thought nobody knows how to spend money better than the poor he joined the crush at the bar the piano began a new tune and everyone sang once a young maiden climbed an old mans knee begged for a story do uncle please why are you single why live alone have you no babies have you no home i had a sweetheart years years ago where is she now pet you will soon know list to my story ill tell it all i believed her faithless after the ball the stupid sentimental emptyheaded damn song brought tears to felikss eyes and he left the pub without ordering his beer he cycled away leaving the laughter and music behind that kind of jollity was not for him it never had been and never would be he made his way back to the tenement and carried the bicycle up the stairs to his room on the top floor he took off his hat and coat and lay on the bed he would see her again in two days they would look at paintings together he would go to the municipal bathhouse before meeting her he decided he rubbed his chin there was nothing he could do to make the beard grow decently in two days he cast his mind back to the moment when she came out of the house he had seen her from a distance never dreaming what was i thinking of at that moment he wondered and then he remembered i was asking myself whether she might know where orlov is i havent thought about orlov all afternoon in all probability she does know where he is if not she could find out i might use her to help me kill him am i capable of that no i am not i will not do it no no no what is happening to me walden saw churchill at the admiralty at twelve noon the first lord was impressed thrace he said surely we can give them half of thrace who the devil cares if they have the whole of it thats what i thought walden said he was pleased with churchills reaction now will your colleagues agree i believe they will churchill said thoughtfully ill see grey after lunch and asquith this evening and the cabinet walden did not want to do a deal with aleks only to have it vetoed by the cabinet tomorrow morning walden stood up so i can plan to go back to norfolk late tomorrow splendid have they caught that damned anarchist yet im having lunch with basil thomson of the special branchill find out then keep me informed naturally and thank you for this proposal i mean churchill looked out of the window dreamily thrace he murmured to himself who has ever even heard of it walden left him to his reverie he was in a buoyant mood as he walked from the admiralty to his club in pall mall he usually ate lunch at home but he did not want to trouble lydia with policemen especially as she was in a rather strange mood at the moment no doubt she was worried about aleks as walden was the boy was the nearest thing to a son that they had if anything should happen to him he went up the steps of his club and just inside the door handed his hat and gloves to a flunky what a lovely summer were having my lord the man said the weather had been remarkably fine for months walden reflected as he went up to the dining room when it broke there would probably be storms we shall have thunder in august he thought thomson was waiting he looked rather pleased with himself what a relief it will be if hes caught the assassin walden thought they shook hands and walden sat down a waiter brought the menu well said walden have you caught him all but thomson said that meant no walden thought his heart sank oh damn he said the wine waiter came walden asked thomson do you want a cocktail no thank you walden approved cocktails were a nasty american habit perhaps a glass of sherry yes please two walden said to the waiter they ordered brown windsor soup and poached salmon and walden chose a bottle of hock to wash it down walden said i wonder if you realize quite how important this is my negotiations with prince orlov are almost complete if he were to be assassinated now the whole thing would fall throughwith serious consequences for the security of this country i do realize my lord thomson said let me tell you what progress weve made our man is feliks kschessinsky thats so hard to say that i propose we call him feliks he is forty the son of a country priest and he comes from tambov province my opposite number in st petersburg has a very thick file on him he has been arrested three times and is wanted in connection with half a dozen murders dear god walden muttered my friend in st petersburg adds that he is an expert bomb maker and an extremely vicious fighter thomson paused you were terribly brave to catch that bottle walden gave a thin smile he preferred not to be reminded the soup came and the two men ate in silence for a while thomson sipped his hock frugally walden liked this club the food was not as good as he got at home but there was a relaxed atmosphere the chairs in the smoking room were old and comfortable the waiters were old and slow the wallpaper was faded and the paintwork was dull they still had gas lighting men such as walden came here because their homes were spickandspan and feminine i thought you said you had all but caught him walden said as the poached salmon arrived i havent told you the half of it yet ah at the end of may he arrived at the jubilee street anarchist club in stepney they didnt know who he was and he told them lies hes a cautious manquite rightly so from his point of view for one or two of those anarchists are working for me my spies reported his presence but the information didnt come to my notice at that stage because he appeared to be harmless said he was writing a book then he stole a gun and moved on without telling anyone where he was going of course thats right slippery fellow a waiter collected their plates and said will you have a slice off the joint gentlemen its mutton today they both had mutton with redcurrant jelly roast potatoes and asparagus thomson said he bought the ingredients for his nitroglycerine in four different shops in camden town we made housetohouse inquiries there thomson took a mouthful of mutton and walden asked impatiently hes been living at nineteen cork street camden in a house owned by a widow called bridget callahan but hes moved on yes damn it thomson cant you see the fellows cleverer than you thomson looked at him coolly and made no comment walden said i beg your pardon that was discourteous of me the fellows got me rattled thomson went on mrs callahan says she threw feliks out because she thought he was a suspicious character why didnt she report him to the police thomson finished his mutton and put down his knife and fork she says she had no real reason to i found that suspicious so i checked up on her her husband was an irish rebel if she knew what our friend feliks was up to she might well have been sympathetic walden wished thomson would not call feliks our friend he said do you think she knows where the man went if she does she wont say but i cant think why he should tell her the point is he may come back are you having the place watched surreptitiously one of my men has already moved into the basement room as a tenant incidentally he found a glass rod of the kind used in chemistry laboratories evidently feliks made up his nitroglycerine right there in the sink it was chilling to walden to think that in the heart of london anyone could buy a few chemicals mix them together in a washhandbasin and make a bottle of dreadfully explosive liquidthen walk with it into a suite in a west end hotel the mutton was followed by a savory of foie gras walden said whats your next move the picture of feliks is hanging up in every police station in the county of london unless he locks himself indoors all day hes bound to be spotted by an observant bobby sooner or later but just in case that should be later rather than sooner my men are visiting cheap hotels and lodging houses showing the picture suppose he changes his appearance its a bit difficult in his case thomson was interrupted by the waiter both men refused the black forest gateau and chose ices instead walden ordered half a bottle of champagne thomson went on he cant hide his height nor his russian accent and he has distinctive features he hasnt had time to grow a beard he may wear different clothes shave himself bald or wear a wig if i were he i should go about in a uniform of some kindas a sailor or a footman or a priest but policemen are alert to that sort of thing after their ices they had stilton cheese and sweet biscuits with some of the clubs vintage port it was all too vague walden felt feliks was loose and walden would not feel safe until the fellow was locked up and chained to the wall thomson said feliks is clearly one of the top killers of the international revolutionist conspiracy he is very well informed for example he knew that prince orlov was going to be here in england he is also clever and formidably determined however we have hidden orlov away walden wondered what thomson was getting at by contrast thomson went on you are still walking about the streets of london as large as life why should i not if i were feliks i would now concentrate on you i would follow you in the hope that you might lead me to orlov or i would kidnap you and torture you until you told me where he was walden lowered his eyes to hide his fear how could he do that alone he may have help i want you to have a bodyguard walden shook his head ive got my man pritchard he would risk his life for mehe has done in the past is he armed no can he shoot very well he used to come with me to africa in my biggame hunting days thats when he risked his life for me then let him carry a pistol all right walden assented ill be going to the country tomorrow ive got a revolver there which he can have to finish the meal walden had a peach and thomson took a melba pear afterward they went into the smoking room for coffee and biscuits walden lit a cigar i think i shall walk home for my digestions sake he tried to say it calmly but his voice sounded oddly highpitched id rather you didnt thomson said havent you brought your carriage no i should be happier about your safety if you were to go everywhere in your own vehicles from now on very well walden sighed i shall have to eat less for today take a cab perhaps ill accompany you do you really think thats necessary he might be waiting for you outside this club how would he find out which club i belong to by looking you up in whos who yes of course walden shook his head one just doesnt think of these things thomson looked at his watch i should get back to the yard if youre ready certainly they left the club feliks was not lying in wait outside they took a cab to waldens house then thomson took the cab on to scotland yard walden went into the house it felt empty he decided to go to his room he sat at the window and finished his cigar he felt the need to talk to someone he looked at his watch lydia would have had her siesta and would now be putting on a gown ready to have tea and receive callers he went through to her room she was sitting at her mirror in a robe she looks strained he thought its all this trouble he put his hands on her shoulders looking at her reflection in the mirror then bent to kiss the top of her head feliks kschessinsky what she seemed frightened thats the name of our assassin does it mean something to you no i thought you seemed to recognize it it it rings a bell basil thomson has found out all about the fellow hes a killer a thoroughly evil type its not impossible that you might have come across him in st petersburgthat would explain why he seemed vaguely familiar when he called here and why his name rings a bell yesthat must be it walden went to the window and looked out over the park it was the time of day when nannies took their charges for a walk the paths were crowded with perambulators and every bench was occupied by gossiping women in unfashionable clothes it occurred to walden that lydia might have had some connection with feliks back in st petersburgsome connection which she did not want to admit the thought was shaming and he pushed it out of his mind he said thomson believes that when feliks realizes aleks is hidden away he will try to kidnap me lydia got up from her chair and came to him she put her arms around his waist and laid her head on his chest she did not speak walden stroked her hair i must go everywhere in my own coach and pritchard must carry a pistol she looked up at him and to his surprise he saw that her gray eyes were full of tears she said why is this happening to us first charlotte gets involved in a riot then youre threatenedit seems were all in jeopardy nonsense youre in no danger and charlotte is only being a silly girl and ill be well protected he stroked her sides he could feel the warmth of her body through the thin robeshe was not wearing her corset he wanted to make love to her right now they had never done it in daylight he kissed her mouth she pressed her body against his and he realized that she too wanted to make love he could not remember her being like this ever before he glanced toward the door thinking to lock it he looked at her and she gave a barely perceptible nod a tear rolled down her nose walden went to the door someone knocked damn walden said quietly lydia turned her face away from the door and dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief pritchard came in excuse me my lord an urgent telephone communication from mr basil thomson they have tracked the man feliks to his lodging if you want to be in at the kill mr thomson will pick you up here in three minutes get my hat and coat walden told him ten when feliks went out to get the morning paper he seemed to see children every way he turned in the courtyard a group of girls played a game involving dancing and chanting the boys were playing cricket with a wicket chalked on the wall and a piece of rotten planking for a bat in the street older boys were pushing handcarts he bought his newspaper from an adolescent girl as he went back to his room his way was blocked by a naked baby crawling up the stairs as he looked at the childit was a girlshe stood up unsteadily and slowly toppled backward feliks caught her and put her down on the landing her mother came out of an open door she was a pale young woman with greasy hair already very pregnant with another child she scooped the baby girl up off the floor and disappeared back into her room with a suspicious look at feliks every time he considered exactly how he would bamboozle charlotte into telling him the whereabouts of orlov he seemed to run up against a brick wall in his mind he visualized getting the information out of her sneakily without her knowing she was telling him or by giving her a cockandbull story like the one he had given lydia or by telling her straight out that he wanted to kill orlov and his imagination recoiled at each scene when he thought about what was at stake he found his feelings ridiculous he had a chance to save millions of lives and possibly spark the russian revolutionand he was worried about lying to an upperclass girl it was not as if he intended to do her any harmjust use her deceive her and betray her trust his own daughter whom he had only just met to occupy his hands he began to fashion the homemade dynamite into a primitive bomb he packed the nitroglycerinesoaked cotton waste into a cracked china vase he considered the problem of detonation burning paper alone might not be sufficient he stuffed half a dozen matches into the cotton so that only their bright red heads showed it was difficult to get the matches to stand upright because his hands were unsteady my hands never shake what is happening to me he twisted a piece of newspaper into a taper and stuck one end into the middle of the match heads then tied the heads together with a length of cotton he found it very difficult to tie the knot he read all the international news in the times plowing doggedly through the turgid english sentences he was more or less sure that there would be a war but more or less sure no longer seemed enough he would have been happy to kill a useless idler like orlov then find out that it had been to no purpose but to destroy his relationship with charlotte to no purpose relationship what relationship you know what relationship reading the times made his head ache the print was too small and his room was dark it was a wretchedly conservative newspaper it ought to be blown up he longed to see charlotte again he heard shuffling footsteps on the landing outside then there was a knock at the door come in he called carelessly the caretaker came in coughing morning good morning mr price what did the old fool want now whats that said price nodding to the bomb on the table homemade candle feliks said lasts months what do you want i wondered if you needed a spare pair of sheets i can get them at a very low price no thank you feliks said goodbye goodbye then price went out i should have hidden that bomb feliks thought what is happening to me yes hes in there price said to basil thomson tension knotted in waldens stomach they sat in the back of a police car parked around the corner from canada buildings where feliks was with them was an inspector from the special branch and a uniformed superintendent from southwark police station if they could catch feliks now then aleks would be safe what a relief that will be walden thought thomson said mr price went to the police station to report that he had rented a room to a suspicious character with a foreign accent who had very little money and was growing a beard as if to change his appearance he identified feliks from our artists drawing well done price thank you sir the uniformed superintendent unfolded a largescale map he was maddeningly slow and deliberate canada buildings consists of three fivestory tenements around a courtyard each building has three stairwells as you stand at the entrance to the courtyard toronto house is on your right feliks is on the middle staircase and the top floor behind toronto house is the yard of a builders merchant walden contained his impatience on your left is vancouver house and behind vancouver house is another street the third building straight ahead of you as you stand at the courtyard entrance is montreal house which backs on to the railway line thomson pointed to the map whats that in the middle of the courtyard the privy replied the superintendent and a real stinker too with all those people using it walden thought get on with it thomson said it seems to me that feliks has three ways out of the courtyard first the entrance obviously well block that second at the opposite end of the courtyard on the left the alley between vancouver house and montreal house it leads to the next street put three men in the alley superintendent very good sir third the alley between montreal house and toronto house this alley leads to the builders yard another three men in there the superintendent nodded now do these tenements have back windows yes sir so feliks has a fourth escape route from toronto house out of the back window and across the builders yard better put six men in the builders yard finally lets have a nice show of strength right here in the middle of the courtyard to encourage him to come along quietly does all that meet with your approval superintendent more than adequate id say sir he doesnt know what kind of man were dealing with walden thought thomson said you and inspector sutton here can make the arrest got your gun sutton sutton pulled aside his coat to show a small revolver strapped under his arm walden was surprised he had thought that no british policeman ever carried a firearm obviously the special branch was different he was glad thomson said to sutton take my advicehave it in your hand when you knock on his door he turned to the uniformed superintendent youd better take my gun the superintendent was mildly offended ive been twentyfive years in the force and never felt the lack of a firearm sir so if its all the same to you i shant begin now policemen have died trying to arrest this man im afraid ive never been taught to shoot sir good god walden thought despairingly how can people like us deal with people like feliks thomson said lord walden and i will be at the courtyard entrance youll stay in the car sir well stay in the car lets go thought walden lets go said thomson feliks realized he was hungry he had not eaten for more than twentyfour hours he wondered what to do now that he had stubble on his chin and workingclass clothes he would be watched by shopkeepers so it would be more difficult for him to steal he pulled himself up at that thought its never difficult to steal he told himself lets see i could go to a suburban housethe kind where they are likely to have only one or two servantsand walk in at the tradesmens entrance there would be a maid in the kitchen or perhaps a cook i am a madman i would say with a smile but if you make me a sandwich i wont rape you i would move toward the door to block her escape she might scream in which case i should go away and try another house but most likely she would give me the food thank you i would say you are kind then i would walk away it is never difficult to steal money was a problem feliks thought as if i could afford a pair of sheets the caretaker was an optimist surely he knew that feliks had no money surely he knows ive no money on reflection prices reason for coming to felikss room was suspicious was he just optimistic or was he checking i seem to be slowing down feliks thought he stood up and went to the window jesus christ the courtyard was alive with blueuniformed policemen feliks stared down at them in horror the sight made him think of a nest of worms wriggling and crawling over one another in a hole in the ground his instincts screamed run run run where they had blocked all exits from the courtyard feliks remembered the back windows he ran from his room and along the landing to the back of the tenement there a window looked out on to the builders yard behind he peered down into the yard and saw five or six policemen taking up positions among the piles of bricks and stacks of planking there was no escape that way that left only the roof he ran back to his room and looked out the policemen were still all but two menone in uniform and one in plain clotheswho were walking purposefully across the courtyard toward felikss stair he picked up his bomb and the box of matches and ran down to the landing below a small door with a latch gave access to a cupboard beneath the stairs feliks opened the door and placed the bomb inside he lit the paper fuse and closed the cupboard door he turned around he had time to run up the stairs before the fuse burned down the baby girl was crawling up the stairs shit he picked her up and dashed through the door into her room her mother sat on the dirty bed staring vacantly at the wall feliks thrust the baby into her arms and yelled stay here dont move the woman looked scared he ran out the two men were one floor below feliks raced up the stairs dont blow now dont blow now dont to his landing they heard him and one shouted hey you they broke into a run feliks dashed into his room picked up the cheap straightbacked chair carried it out to the landing and positioned it directly under the trapdoor leading to the loft the bomb had not exploded perhaps it would not work feliks stood on the chair the two men hit the stairs feliks pushed open the trapdoor the uniformed policeman shouted youre under arrest the plainclothes man raised a gun and pointed it at feliks the bomb went off there was a big dull thud like something very heavy falling and the staircase broke up into matchwood which flew everywhere and the two men were flung backward and the debris burst into flames and feliks hauled himself up into the loft damn hes exploded a damn bomb thomson shouted walden thought its going wrongagain there was a crash as shards of glass from a fourthfloor window hit the ground walden and thomson jumped out of the car and ran across the courtyard thomson picked two uniformed policemen at random you and youcome inside with me he turned to walden you stay here they ran inside walden backed across the courtyard looking up at the windows of toronto house where is feliks he heard a policeman say heve gorn out the back you mark my words four or five slates fell off the roof and shattered in the courtyardloosened walden assumed by the explosion walden kept feeling the urge to look back over his shoulder as if feliks might suddenly appear behind him from nowhere the residents of the tenements were coming to their doors and windows to see what was going on and the courtyard began to fill with people some of the policemen made halfhearted attempts to send them back inside a woman ran out of toronto house screaming fire where is feliks thomson and a policeman came out carrying sutton he was unconscious or dead walden looked more closely no he was not dead his pistol was gripped in his hand more slates fell off the roof the policeman with thomson said its a bloody mess in there walden said did you see where feliks is couldnt see anything thomson and the policeman went back inside more slates fell walden was struck by a thought he looked up there was a hole in the roof and feliks was climbing up through it there he is walden yelled they all watched helpless as feliks crawled out of the loft and scrambled up the roof to the ridge if i had a gun walden knelt over the unconscious body of sutton and prized the pistol from his fingers he looked up feliks was kneeling on the peak of the roof i wish it were a rifle walden thought as he lifted the gun he sighted along the barrel feliks looked at him their eyes met feliks moved a shot rang out he felt nothing he began to run it was like running along a tightrope he had to hold out his arms for balance he had to place his feet squarely on the narrow ridge and he had to avoid thinking about the fiftyfoot drop to the courtyard there was another shot feliks panicked he ran at top speed the end of the roof loomed up he could see the downsloping roof of montreal house ahead he had no idea how wide the gap was between the two buildings he slowed down hesitating then walden fired again feliks ran full tilt at the end of the ridge he jumped he flew through the air he heard his own voice as if distantly screaming he caught a momentary glimpse of three policemen in the alley fifty feet below him staring up at him openmouthed then he hit the roof of montreal house landing hard on his hands and knees the impact winded him he slid backward down the roof his feet hit the gutter it seemed to give under the strain and he thought he was going to slide right off the edge of the roof and fall fall endlesslybut the gutter held and he stopped sliding he was frightened a distant corner of his mind protested but im never frightened he scrambled up the roof to the peak and then down the other side montreal house backed on to the railway there were no policemen on the lines or the embankment they didnt anticipate this feliks thought exultantly they thought i was trapped in the courtyard it never occurred to them that i might escape over the rooftops now all i have to do is get down he peered over the gutter at the wall of the building beneath him there were no drainpipesthe gutters emptied through spouts which jutted out from the edge of the roof like gargoyles but the topfloor windows were close to the eaves and had wide ledges with his right hand feliks grasped the gutter and pulled it testing its strength since when have i cared whether i live or die you know since when he positioned himself over a window gripped the gutter with both hands and slowly eased himself over the edge for a moment he hung free his feet found the window ledge he took his right hand from the gutter and felt the brickwork around the window for a handhold he got his fingers into a shallow groove then let go of the gutter with his other hand he looked through the window inside a man saw him and shouted in fright feliks kicked the window in and dropped into the room he pushed the frightened occupant aside and rushed out through the doorway he ran down the stairs four at a time if he could reach the ground floor he could get out through the back windows and onto the railway line he reached the last landing and stopped at the top of the last flight of stairs breathing hard a blue uniform appeared at the front entrance feliks spun around and raced to the back of the landing he lifted the window it stuck he gave a mighty heave and threw it open he heard boots running up the stairs he clambered over the windowsill eased himself out hung by his hands for a moment pushed himself away from the wall and dropped he landed in the long grass of the railway embankment to his right two men were jumping over the fence of the builders yard a shot came from his far left a policeman came to the window from which feliks had jumped he ran up the embankment to the railway there were four or five pairs of lines in the distance a train was approaching fast it seemed to be on the farthermost track he suffered a moment of cowardice frightened to cross in front of the train then he broke into a run the two policemen from the builders yard and the one from montreal house chased him across the tracks from the far left a voice shouted clear the field of fire the three pursuers were making it difficult for walden to get a shot feliks glanced over his shoulder they had fallen back a shot rang out he began to duck and zigzag the train sounded very loud he heard its whistle there was another shot he turned aside suddenly then stumbled and fell onto the last pair of railway lines there was a terrific thunder in his ears he saw the locomotive bearing down on him he jerked convulsively catapulting himself off the track and onto the gravel on the far side the train roared past his head he caught a splitsecond glimpse of the enginemans face white and scared he stood up and ran down the embankment walden stood at the fence watching the train basil thomson came up beside him those policemen who had got onto the railway line ran across to the last track then stood there helpless waiting for the train to pass it seemed to take forever when it had gone there was no sign of feliks the buggers got away a policeman said basil thomson said goddamn it all to hell walden turned away and walked back to the car feliks dropped down on the far side of a wall and found himself in a poor street of small row houses he was also in the goalmouth of an improvised soccer pitch a group of small boys in large caps stopped playing and stared at him in surprise he ran on it would take them a few minutes to redeploy the police on the far side of the railway line they would come looking for him but they would be too late by the time they got a search under way he would be half a mile from the railway and still moving he kept running until he reached a busy shopping street there on impulse he jumped on an omnibus he had escaped but he was terribly worried this kind of thing had happened to him before but previously he had never been scared he had never panicked he remembered the thought that had gone through his mind as he slid down the roof i dont want to die in siberia he had lost the ability to feel fear now it had come back for the first time in years he wanted to stay alive i have become human again he thought he looked out of the window at the mean streets of southeast london wondering whether the dirty children and the whitefaced women could look at him and see a reborn man it was a disaster it would slow him down cramp his style interfere with his work im afraid he thought i want to live i want to see charlotte again eleven the first tram of the day woke feliks with its noise he opened his eyes and watched it go by striking bright blue sparks from the overhead cable dulleyed men in working clothes sat at its windows smoking and yawning on their way to jobs as street cleaners and market porters and road menders the sun was low and bright but feliks was in the shade of waterloo bridge he lay on the pavement with his head to the wall wrapped in a blanket of newspapers on one side of him was a stinking old woman with the red face of a drunkard she looked fat but now feliks could see between the hem of her dress and the tops of her mans boots a few inches of dirty white legs like sticks and he concluded that her apparent obesity must be due to several layers of clothing feliks liked her last night she had amused all the vagrants by teaching him the vulgar english words for various parts of the body feliks had repeated them after her and everyone had laughed on his other side was a redhaired boy from scotland for him sleeping in the open was an adventure he was tough and wiry and cheerful looking now at his sleeping face feliks saw that he had no morning beard he was terribly young what would happen to him when winter came there were about thirty of them in a line along the pavement all lying with their heads to the wall and their feet toward the road covered with coats or sacks or newspapers feliks was the first to stir he wondered whether any of them had died in the night he got up he ached after a night on the cold street he walked out from under the bridge into the sunshine today he was to meet charlotte no doubt he looked and smelled like a tramp he contemplated washing himself in the thames but the river appeared to be dirtier than he was he went looking for a municipal bathhouse he found one on the south side of the river a notice on the door announced that it would open at nine oclock feliks thought that characteristic of social democratic government they would build a bathhouse so that working men could keep clean then open it only when everyone was at work no doubt they complained that the masses failed to take advantage of the facilities so generously provided he found a tea stall near waterloo station and had breakfast he was severely tempted by the friedegg sandwiches but he could not afford one he had his usual bread and tea and saved the money for a newspaper he felt contaminated by his night with the deadbeats that was ironic he thought for in siberia he had been glad to sleep with pigs for warmth it was not difficult to understand why he felt differently now he was to meet his daughter and she would be fresh and clean smelling of perfume and dressed in silk with gloves and a hat and perhaps a parasol to shade her from the sun he went into the railway station and bought the times then sat on a stone bench outside the bathhouse and read the paper while he waited for the place to open the news shocked him to the core austrian heir and his wife murdered shot in bosnian town a students political crime bomb thrown earlier in the day the emperors grief the austrohungarian heirpresumptive the archduke francis ferdinand and his wife the duchess of hohenberg were assassinated yesterday morning at sarajevo the capital of bosnia the actual assassin is described as a high school student who fired bullets at his victims with fatal effect from an automatic pistol as they were returning from a reception at the town hall the outrage was evidently the fruit of a carefully laid plot on their way to the town hall the archduke and his consort had narrowly escaped death an individual described as a compositor from trebinje a garrison town in the extreme south of herzegovina had thrown a bomb at their motor car few details of this first outrage have been received it is stated that the archduke warded off the bomb with his arm and that it exploded behind the car injuring the occupants of the second carriage the author of the second outrage is stated to be a native of grahovo in bosnia no information as to his race or creed is yet forthcoming it is presumed that he belongs to the serb or orthodox section of the bosnian population both criminals were immediately arrested and were with difficulty saved from being lynched while this tragedy was being enacted in the bosnian capital the aged emperor francis joseph was on his way from vienna to his summer residence at ischl he had an enthusiastic sendoff from his subjects in vienna and an even more enthusiastic reception on reaching ischl feliks was stunned he was delighted that another useless aristocratic parasite had been destroyed another blow struck against tyranny and he felt ashamed that a schoolboy had been able to kill the heir to the austrian throne while he feliks had failed repeatedly to kill a russian prince but what occupied his mind most was the change in the world political picture that must surely follow the austrians with the germans backing them would take their revenge on serbia the russians would protest would the russians mobilize their army if they were confident of british support they probably would russian mobilization would mean german mobilization and once the germans had mobilized no one could stop their generals from going to war feliks painstakingly deciphered the tortured english of the other reports on the same page to do with the assassination there were stories headlined official report of the crime austrian emperor and the news tragedy of a royal house and scene of the murder from our special correspondent there was a good deal of nonsense about how shocked and horrified and grieved everyone was plus repeated assertions that there was no cause for undue alarm and that tragic though it was the murder would make no real difference to europesentiments which feliks had already come to recognize as being characteristic of the times which would have described the four horsemen of the apocalypse as strong rulers who could do nothing but good for the stability of the international situation so far there was no talk of austrian reprisals but it would come feliks was sure and then then there would be war there was no real reason for russia to go to war feliks thought angrily the same applied to england it was france and germany that were belligerent the french had been wanting since to win back their lost territories of alsace and lorraine and the german generals felt that germany would be a secondclass power until she began to throw her weight about what might stop russia from going to war a quarrel with her allies what would cause a quarrel between russia and england the killing of orlov if the assassination in sarajevo could start a war another assassination in london could stop a war and charlotte could find orlov wearily feliks contemplated afresh the dilemma that had haunted him for the last fortyeight hours was anything changed by the murder of the archduke did that give him the right to take advantage of a young girl it was almost time for the bathhouse to open a small crowd of women carrying bundles of washing gathered around the door feliks folded his newspaper and stood up he knew that he would use her he had not resolved the dilemmahe had simply decided what to do his whole life seemed to lead up to the murder of orlov there was a momentum in his progress toward that goal and he could not be deflected even by the knowledge that his life had been founded on a mistake poor charlotte the doors opened and feliks went into the bathhouse to wash charlotte had it all planned lunch was at one oclock when the waldens had no guests by twothirty mama would be in her room lying down charlotte would be able to sneak out of the house in time to meet feliks at three she would spend an hour with him by fourthirty she would be at home in the morning room washed and changed and demurely ready to pour tea and receive callers with mama it was not to be at midday mama ruined the whole plan by saying oh i forgot to tell youwere lunching with the duchess of middlesex at her house in grosvenor square oh dear charlotte said i really dont feel like a luncheon party dont be sillyyoull have a lovely time i said the wrong thing charlotte thought immediately i should have said ive got a splitting headache and i cant possibly go i was too halfhearted i could have lied if id known in advance but i cant do it on the spur of the moment she tried again im sorry mama i dont want to go youre coming and no nonsense mama said i want the duchess to get to know youshe really is most useful and the marquis of chalfont will be there luncheon parties generally started at onethirty and went on past three i might be home by threethirty so i could get to the national gallery by four charlotte thought but by then he will have given up and gone away and besides even if he is still waiting i would have to leave him almost immediately in order to be home for tea she wanted to talk to him about the assassination she was eager to hear his views she did not want to have lunch with the old duchess and who is the marquis of chalfont you know freddie hes charming dont you think oh him charming i havent noticed i could write a note address it to that place in camden town and leave it on the hall table on my way out for the footman to post but feliks doesnt actually live at that address and anyway he wouldnt get the note before three oclock mama said well notice him today i fancy you may have bewitched him who freddie charlotte you really must pay a little attention to a young man when he pays attention to you so that was why she was so keen on this lunch party oh mama dont be silly whats silly about it mama said in an exasperated voice ive hardly spoken three sentences to him then its not your conversation that has bewitched him please all right i wont tease go and change put on that cream dress with the brown laceit suits your coloring charlotte gave in and went up to her room i suppose i should be flattered about freddie she thought as she took off her dress why cant i get interested in any of these young men maybe im just not ready for all that yet at the moment theres too much else to occupy my mind at breakfast papa said there would be a war because of the shooting of the archduke but girls arent supposed to be too interested in that sort of thing the summit of my ambition should be to get engaged before the end of my first seasonthats what belinda is thinking about but not all girls are like belindaremember the suffragettes she got dressed and went downstairs she sat and made idle conversation while mama drank a glass of sherry then they went to grosvenor square the duchess was an overweight woman in her sixties she made charlotte think of an old wooden ship rotting beneath a new coat of paint the lunch was a real hen party if this were a play charlotte thought there would be a wildeyed poet a discreet cabinet minister a cultured jewish banker a crown prince and at least one remarkably beautiful woman in fact the only men present apart from freddie were a nephew of the duchess and a conservative mp each of the women was introduced as the wife of soandso if i ever get married charlotte thought i shall insist on being introduced as myself not as somebodys wife of course it was difficult for the duchess to have interesting parties because so many people were banned from her table all liberals all jews anybody in trade anybody who was on the stage all divorcées and all of the many people who had at one time or another offended against the duchesss idea of what was the done thing it made for a dull circle of friends the duchesss favorite topic of conversation was the question of what was ruining the country the main candidates were subversion by lloyd george and churchill vulgarity diaghilev and the postimpressionists and supertax one shilling and threepence in the pound today however the ruin of england took second place to the death of the archduke the conservative mp explained at somewhat tedious length why there would be no war the wife of a south american ambassador said in a littlegirlish tone which infuriated charlotte what i dont understand is why these nihilists want to throw bombs and shoot people the duchess had the answer to that her doctor had explained to her that all suffragettes had a nervous ailment known to medical science as hysteria and in her view the revolutionists suffered from the male equivalent of this disease charlotte who had read the times from cover to cover that morning said on the other hand perhaps the serbs simply dont want to be ruled by austria mama gave her a black look and everyone else glanced at her for a moment as if she were quite mad and then ignored what she had said freddie was sitting next to her his round face always seemed to gleam slightly he spoke to her in a low voice i say you do say the most outrageous things what was outrageous about it charlotte demanded well i mean to say anyone would think you approved of people shooting archdukes i think if the austrians tried to take over england you would shoot archdukes wouldnt you youre priceless freddie said charlotte turned away from him she was beginning to feel as if she had lost her voice nobody seemed to hear anything she said it made her very cross meanwhile the duchess was getting into her stride the lower classes were idle she said and charlotte thought you who have never done a days work in your life why the duchess said she understood that nowadays each workman had a lad to carry his tools around surely a man could carry his own tools she said as a footman held out for her a silver salver of boiled potatoes beginning her third glass of sweet wine she said that they drank so much beer in the middle of the day that they were incapable of working in the afternoon people today wanted to be mollycoddled she said as three footmen and two maids cleared away the third course and served the fourth it was no business of the governments to provide poor relief and medical insurance and pensions poverty would encourage the lower orders to be thrifty and that was a virtue she said at the end of a meal which would have fed a workingclass family of ten for a fortnight people must be selfreliant she said as the butler helped her rise from the table and walk into the drawing room by this time charlotte was boiling with suppressed rage who could blame revolutionists for shooting people like the duchess freddie handed her a cup of coffee and said shes a marvelous old warhorse isnt she charlotte said i think shes the nastiest old woman ive ever met freddies round face became furtive and he said hush at least charlotte thought no one could say im encouraging him a carriage clock on the mantel struck three with a tinkling chime charlotte felt as if she were in jail feliks was now waiting for her on the steps of the national gallery she had to get out of the duchesss house she thought what am i doing here when i could be with someone who talks sense the conservative mp said i must get back to the house his wife stood up to go with him charlotte saw her way out she approached the wife and spoke quietly i have a slight headache she said may i come with you you must pass my house on the way to westminster certainly lady charlotte said the wife mama was talking to the duchess charlotte interrupted them and repeated the headache story i know mama would like to stay a little longer so im going with mrs shakespeare thank you for a lovely lunch your grace the duchess nodded regally i managed that rather well charlotte thought as she walked out into the hall and down the stairs she gave her address to the shakespeares coachman and added theres no need to drive into the courtyardjust stop outside on the way mrs shakespeare advised her to take a spoonful of laudanum for the headache the coachman did as he had been told and at threetwenty charlotte was standing on the pavement outside her home watching the coach drive off instead of going into the house she headed for trafalgar square she arrived just after threethirty and ran up the steps of the national gallery she could not see feliks hes gone she thought after all that then he emerged from behind one of the massive pillars as if he had been lying in wait and she was so pleased to see him she could have kissed him im sorry to have made you wait about she said as she shook his hand i got involved in a dreadful luncheon party it doesnt matter now that youre here he was smiling but uneasily likecharlotte thoughtsomeone saying hello to a dentist before having a tooth pulled they went inside charlotte loved the cool hushed museum with its glass domes and marble pillars gray floors and beige walls and the paintings shouting out color and beauty and passion at least my parents taught me to look at pictures she said he turned his sad dark eyes on her theres going to be a war of all the people who had spoken of that possibility today only feliks and papa had seemed to be moved by it papa said the same thing but i dont understand why france and germany both think they stand to gain a lot by war austria russia and england may get sucked in they walked on feliks did not seem to be interested in the paintings charlotte said why are you so concerned shall you have to fight im too old but i think of all the millions of innocent russian boys straight off the farm who will be crippled or blinded or killed in a cause they dont understand and wouldnt care about if they did charlotte had always thought of war as a matter of men killing one another but feliks saw it as men being killed by war as usual he showed her things in a new light she said i never looked at it that way the earl of walden never looked at it that way either thats why he will let it happen im sure papa wouldnt let it happen if he could help youre wrong feliks interrupted he is making it happen charlotte frowned puzzled what do you mean thats why prince orlov is here her puzzlement deepened how do you know about aleks i know more about it than you do the police have spies among the anarchists but the anarchists have spies among the police spies we find things out walden and orlov are negotiating a treaty the effect of which will be to drag russia into the war on the british side charlotte was about to protest that papa would not do such a thing then she realized that feliks was right it explained some of the remarks passed between papa and aleks while aleks was staying at the house and it explained why papa was shocking his friends by consorting with liberals like churchill she said why would he do that im afraid he doesnt care how many russian peasants die so long as england dominates europe yes of course papa would see it in those terms she thought its awful she said why dont you tell people expose the whole thingshout it from the rooftops who would listen wouldnt they listen in russia they will if we can find a dramatic way of bringing the thing to their notice such as feliks looked at her such as kidnapping prince orlov it was so outrageous that she laughed then stopped abruptly it crossed her mind that he might be playing a game pretending in order to make a point then she looked at his face and knew that he was deadly serious for the first time she wondered whether he was perfectly sane you dont mean that she said incredulously he smiled awkwardly do you think im crazy she knew he was not she shook her head youre the sanest man i ever met then sit down and ill explain it to you she allowed herself to be led to a seat the czar already distrusts the english because they let political refugees like me come to england if one of us were to kidnap his favorite nephew there would be a real quarreland then they could not be sure of each others help in a war and when the russian people learn what orlov was trying to do to them they will be so angry that the czar will not be able to make them go to war anyway do you see charlotte watched his face as he talked he was quiet reasonable and only a little tense there was no mad light of fanaticism in his eye everything he said made sense but it was like the logic of a fairy taleone thing followed from another but it seemed to be a story about a different world not the world she lived in i do see she said but you cant kidnap aleks hes such a nice man that nice man will lead a million other nice men to their deaths if hes allowed to this is real charlotte not like the battles in these paintings of gods and horses walden and orlov are discussing warmen cutting each other open with swords boys getting their legs blown off by cannonballs people bleeding and dying in muddy fields screaming in pain with no one to help them this is what walden and orlov are trying to arrange half the misery in the world is caused by nice young men like orlov who think they have the right to organize wars between nations she was struck by a frightening thought youve already tried once to kidnap him he nodded in the park you were in the carriage it went wrong oh my word she felt sickened and depressed he took her hand you know im right dont you it seemed to her that he was right his world was the real world she was the one who lived in a fairy tale in fairyland the debutantes in white were presented to the king and queen and the prince went to war and the earl was kind to his servants who all loved him and the duchess was a dignified old lady and there was no such thing as sexual intercourse in the real world annies baby was born dead because mama let annie go without a reference and a thirteenyearold mother was condemned to death because she had let her baby die and people slept on the streets because they had no homes and there were baby farms and the duchess was a vicious old harridan and a grinning man in a tweed suit punched charlotte in the stomach outside buckingham palace i know youre right she said to feliks thats very important he said you hold the key to the whole thing me oh no i need your help no please dont say that you see i cant find orlov its not fair she thought it has all happened too quickly she felt miserable and trapped she wanted to help feliks and she could see how important it was but aleks was her cousin and he had been a guest in her househow could she betray him will you help me feliks said i dont know where aleks is she said evasively but you could find out yes will you she sighed i dont know charlotte you must theres no must about it she flared everyone tells me what i must doi thought you had more respect for me he looked crestfallen i wish i didnt have to ask you she squeezed his hand ill think about it he opened his mouth to protest and she put a finger to his lips to silence him youll have to be satisfied with that she said at seventhirty walden went out in the lanchester wearing evening dress and a silk hat he was using the motor car all the time now in an emergency it would be faster and more maneuverable than a carriage pritchard sat in the driving seat with a revolver holstered beneath his jacket civilized life seemed to have come to an end they drove to the back entrance of number ten downing street the cabinet had met that afternoon to discuss the deal walden had worked out with aleks now walden was to hear whether or not they had approved it he was shown into the small dining room churchill was already there with asquith the prime minister they were leaning on the sideboard drinking sherry walden shook hands with asquith how do you do prime minister good of you to come lord walden asquith had silver hair and a cleanshaven face there were traces of humor in the wrinkles around his eyes but his mouth was small thinlipped and stubbornlooking and he had a broad square chin walden thought there was in his voice a trace of yorkshire accent which had survived the city of london school and balliol college oxford he had an unusually large head which was said to contain a brain of machinelike precision but then walden thought people always credit prime ministers with more brains than theyve got asquith said im afraid the cabinet would not approve your proposal waldens heart sank to conceal his disappointment he adopted a brisk manner why not the opposition came mainly from lloyd george walden looked at churchill and raised his eyebrows churchill nodded you probably thought like everyone else that lg and i vote alike on every issue now you know otherwise whats his objection matter of principle churchill answered he says were passing the balkans around like a box of chocolates help yourself choose your favorite flavor thrace bosnia bulgaria serbia small countries have their rights he says thats what comes of having a welshman in the cabinet a welshman and a solicitor too i dont know which is worse his levity irritated walden this is his project as much as mine he thought why isnt the man as dismayed as i am they sat down to dinner the meal was served by one butler asquith ate sparingly churchill drank too much walden thought walden was gloomy mentally damning lloyd george with every mouthful at the end of the first course asquith said we must have this treaty you know there will be a war between france and germany sooner or later and if the russians stay out of it germany will conquer europe we cant have that walden asked what must be done to change lloyd georges mind asquith smiled thinly if i had a pound note for every time that question has been asked id be a rich man the butler served a quail to each man and poured claret churchill said we must come up with a modified proposal which will meet lgs objection churchills casual tone infuriated walden you know perfectly well its not that simple he snapped no indeed asquith said mildly still we must try thrace to be an independent country under russian protection something like that ive spent the past month beating them down walden said wearily still the murder of poor old francis ferdinand changes the complexion of things asquith said now that austria is getting aggressive in the balkans again the russians need more than ever that toehold in the area which in principle were trying to give them walden set aside his disappointment and began to think constructively after a moment he said what about constantinople what do you mean suppose we offered constantinople to the russianswould lloyd george object to that he might say it was like giving cardiff to the irish republicans churchill said walden ignored him and looked at asquith asquith put down his knife and fork well now that he has made his principled stand he may be keen to show how reasonable he can be when offered a compromise i think he may buy it will it be enough for the russians walden was not sure but he was buoyed by his new idea impulsively he said if you can sell it to lloyd george i can sell it to orlov splendid said asquith now then what about this anarchist waldens optimism was punctured theyre doing everything possible to protect aleks but still its damned worrying i thought basil thomson was a good man excellent walden said but im afraid feliks might be even better churchill said i dont think we should let the fellow frighten us i am frightened gentlemen walden interrupted three times feliks has slipped through our grasp the last time we had thirty policemen to arrest him i dont see how he can get at aleks now but the fact that i cant see a way doesnt mean that he cant see a way and we know what will happen if aleks is killed our alliance with russia will fall through feliks is the most dangerous man in england asquith nodded his expression somber if youre less than perfectly satisfied with the protection orlov is getting please contact me directly thank you the butler offered walden a cigar but he sensed that he was finished here life must go on he said and i must go to a crush at mrs glenvilles ill smoke my cigar there dont tell them where you had dinner churchill said with a smile i wouldnt daretheyd never speak to me again walden finished his port and stood up when will you put the new proposal to orlov asquith asked ill motor to norfolk first thing in the morning splendid the butler brought waldens hat and gloves and he took his leave pritchard was standing at the garden gate chatting to the policeman on duty back to the house walden told him he had been rather rash he reflected as they drove he had promised to secure alekss consent to the constantinople plan but he was not sure how it was worrying he began to rehearse the words he would use tomorrow he was home before he had made any progress well need the car again in a few minutes pritchard very good my lord walden entered the house and went upstairs to wash his hands on the landing he met charlotte is mama getting ready he said yes shell be a few minutes how goes your politicking slowly why have you suddenly got involved in all that sort of thing again he smiled in a nutshell to stop germany conquering europe but dont you worry your pretty little head i shant worry but where on earth have you hidden cousin aleks he hesitated there was no harm in her knowing yet once she knew she would be capable of accidentally letting the secret out better for her to be left in the dark he said if anyone asks you say you dont know he smiled and went on up to his room there were times when the charm of english life wore thin for lydia usually she liked crushes several hundred people would gather at someones home to do nothing whatsoever there was no dancing no formal meal no cards you shook hands with the hostess took a glass of champagne and wandered around some great house chatting to your friends and admiring peoples clothes today she was struck by the pointlessness of the whole thing her discontent took the form of nostalgia for russia there she felt the beauties would surely be more ravishing the intellectuals less polite the conversations deeper the evening air not so balmy and soporific in truth she was too worriedabout stephen about feliks and about charlotteto enjoy socializing she ascended the broad staircase with stephen on one side of her and charlotte on the other her diamond necklace was admired by mrs glenville they moved on stephen peeled off to talk to one of his cronies in the lords lydia heard the words amendment bill and listened no more they moved through the crowd smiling and saying hello lydia kept thinking what am i doing here charlotte said by the way mama where has aleks gone i dont know dear lydia said absently ask your father good evening freddie freddie was interested in charlotte not lydia ive been thinking about what you said at lunch he said ive decided that the difference is were english lydia left them to it in my day she thought political discussions were decidedly not the way to win a man but perhaps things have changed it begins to look as if freddie will be interested in whatever charlotte wants to talk about i wonder if he will propose to her oh lord what a relief that would be in the first of the reception rooms where a string quartet played inaudibly she met her sisterinlaw clarissa they talked about their daughters and lydia was secretly comforted to learn that clarissa was terribly worried about belinda i dont mind her buying those ultrafashionable clothes and showing her ankles and i shouldnt mind her smoking cigarettes if only she were a little more discreet about it clarissa said but she goes to the most dreadful places to listen to nigger bands playing jazz music and last week she went to a boxing match what about her chaperone clarissa sighed ive said she can go out without a chaperone if shes with girls we know now i realize that was a mistake i suppose charlotte is always chaperoned in theory yes lydia said but shes frightfully disobedient once she sneaked out and went to a suffragette meeting lydia was not prepared to tell clarissa the whole disgraceful truth a suffragette meeting did not sound quite as bad as a demonstration she added charlotte is interested in the most unladylike things such as politics i dont know where she gets her ideas oh i feel the same clarissa said belinda was always brought up with the very best of music and good society and wholesome books and a strict governess so naturally one wonders where on earth she got her taste for vulgarity the worst of it is i cant make her realize that i am worried for her happiness not my own oh im so glad to hear you say that lydia said its just how i feel charlotte seems to think theres something false or silly about our protecting her she sighed we must marry them off quickly before they come to any harm absolutely is anyone interested in charlotte freddie chalfont ah yes id heard that he even seems to be prepared to talk politics to her but im afraid shes not awfully interested in him what about belinda the opposite problem she likes them all oh dear lydia laughed and moved on feeling better in some ways clarissa as a stepmother had a more difficult task than lydia i suppose i have much to be thankful for she thought the duchess of middlesex was in the next room most people stayed on their feet at a crush but the duchess characteristically sat down and let people come to her lydia approached her just as lady gaystephens was moving away i gather charlotte is quite recovered from her headache the duchess said yes indeed its kind of you to inquire oh i wasnt inquiring the duchess said my nephew saw her in the national gallery at four oclock the national gallery what in heavens name was she doing there she had sneaked out again but lydia was not going to let the duchess know that charlotte had been misbehaving she has always been fond of art she improvised she was with a man the duchess said freddie chalfont must have a rival the little minx lydia concealed her fury indeed she said forcing a smile who is he just one of their set lydia said desperately oh no said the duchess with a malicious smile he was about forty and wearing a tweed cap a tweed cap lydia was being humiliated and she knew it but she hardly cared who could the man be what was charlotte thinking of her reputation they were holding hands the duchess added and she smiled broadly showing rotten teeth lydia could no longer pretend that everything was all right oh my god she said what has the child got into now the duchess said in my day the chaperone system was found effective in preventing this sort of thing lydia was suddenly very angry at the pleasure the duchess was taking in this catastrophe that was a hundred years ago she snapped she walked away a tweed cap holding hands forty years old it was too appalling to be contemplated the cap meant he was workingclass the age meant he was a lecher and the handholding implied that matters had already gone far perhaps too far what can i do she thought helplessly if the child goes out of the house without my knowledge oh charlotte charlotte you dont know what youre doing to yourself what was the boxing match like charlotte asked belinda in a horrid sort of way it was terribly exciting belinda said these two enormous men wearing nothing but their shorts standing there trying to beat each other to death charlotte did not see how that could be exciting it sounds dreadful i got so worked upbelinda lowered her voicethat i almost let peter go too far what do you mean you know afterward in the cab on the way home i let him kiss me and so on whats and so on belinda whispered he kissed my bosom oh charlotte frowned was it nice heavenly well well charlotte tried to picture freddie kissing her bosom and somehow she knew it would not be heavenly mama walked past and said were leaving charlotte belinda said she looks cross charlotte shrugged nothing unusual in that were going to a coon show afterwardwhy dont you come with us whats a coon show jazz its wonderful music mama wouldnt let me your mama is so oldfashioned youre telling me id better go bye charlotte went down the stairs and got her wrap from the cloakroom she felt as if two people were inhabiting her skin like dr jekyll and mr hyde one of them smiled and made polite conversation and talked to belinda about girlish matters the other thought about kidnapping and treachery and asked sly questions in an innocent tone of voice without waiting for her parents she went outside and said to the footman the earl of waldens car a couple of minutes later the lanchester pulled up at the curb it was a warm evening and pritchard had the hood down he got out of the car and held the door for charlotte she said pritchard where is prince orlov its supposed to be a secret my lady you can tell me id rather you asked your papa mlady it was no good she could not bully these servants who had known her as a baby she gave up and said youd better go into the hall and tell them im waiting in the car very good mlady charlotte sat back on the leather seat she had asked the three people who might have known where aleks was and none of them would tell her they did not trust her to keep the secret and the maddening thing was that they were of course quite right she still had not decided whether to help feliks however now if she could not get the information he wanted perhaps she would not have to make the agonizing decision what a relief that would be she had arranged to meet feliks the day after tomorrow same place same time what would he say when she turned up emptyhanded would he despise her for failing no he was not like that he would be terribly disappointed perhaps he would be able to think of another way to find out where aleks was she could not wait to see him again he was so interesting and she learned so much from him that the rest of her life seemed unbearably dull without him even the anxiety of this great dilemma into which he had thrown her was better than the boredom of choosing dresses for yet another day of empty social routine papa and mama got into the car and pritchard drove off papa said whats the matter lydia you look rather upset mama looked at charlotte what were you doing in the national gallery this afternoon charlottes heart missed a beat she had been found out someone had spied on her now there would be trouble her hands started to shake and she held them together in her lap i was looking at pictures you were with a man papa said oh no charlotte what is all this hes just somebody i met charlotte said you wouldnt approve of him of course we wouldnt approve mama said he was wearing a tweed cap papa said a tweed cap who the devil is he hes a terribly interesting man and he understands things and he holds your hand mama interrupted papa said sadly charlotte how vulgar in the national gallery theres no romance charlotte said youve nothing to fear nothing to fear mama said with a brittle laugh that evil old duchess knows all about it and shell tell everyone papa said how could you do this to your mama charlotte could not speak she was close to tears she thought i did nothing wrong just held a conversation with someone who talks sense how can they be soso brutish i hate them papa said youd better tell me who he is i expect he can be paid off charlotte shouted i should think hes one of the few people in the world who cant i suppose hes some radical mama said no doubt it is he who has been filling your head with foolishness about suffragism he probably wears sandals and eats potatoes with the skins on she lost her temper he probably believes in free love if you have no i havent charlotte said i told you theres no romance a tear rolled down her nose im not the romantic type i dont believe you for a minute papa said disgustedly nor will anyone else whether you realize it or not this episode is a social catastrophe for all of us wed better put her in a convent mama said hysterically and she began to cry im sure that wont be necessary papa said mama shook her head i didnt mean it im sorry to be so shrill but i just get so worried however she cant stay in london after this certainly not the car pulled into the courtyard of their house mama dried her eyes so that the servants would not see her upset charlotte thought and so they will stop me from seeing feliks and send me away and lock me up i wish now i had promised to help him instead of hesitating and saying i would think about it at least then he would know im on his side well they wont win i shant live the life they have mapped out for me i shant marry freddie and become lady chalfont and raise fat complacent children they cant keep me locked away forever as soon as im twentyone ill go and work for mrs pankhurst and read books about anarchism and start a rest home for unmarried mothers and if i ever have children i will never never tell them lies they went into the house papa said come into the drawing room pritchard followed them in would you like some sandwiches my lord not just now leave us alone for a while would you pritchard pritchard went out papa made a brandyandsoda and sipped it think again charlotte he said will you tell us who this man is she wanted to say hes an anarchist who is trying to prevent your starting a war but she merely shook her head then you must see he said almost gently that we cant possibly trust you you could have once she thought bitterly but not anymore papa spoke to mama shell just have to go to the country for a month its the only way to keep her out of trouble then after the cowes regatta she can come to scotland for the shooting he sighed perhaps shell be more manageable by next season mama said well send her to walden hall then charlotte thought theyre talking about me as if i werent here papa said im driving down to norfolk in the morning to see aleks again ill take her with me charlotte was stunned aleks was at walden hall i never even thought of that now i know shed better go up and pack mama said charlotte stood up and went out keeping her face down so that they should not see the light of triumph in her eyes twelve at a quarter to three feliks was in the lobby of the national gallery charlotte would probably be late like last time but anyway he had nothing better to do he was nervy and restless sick of waiting and sick of hiding he had slept rough again the last two nights once in hyde park and once under the arches at charing cross during the day he had hidden in alleys and railway sidings and patches of waste ground coming out only to get food it reminded him of being on the run in siberia and the memory was unpleasant even now he kept moving going from the lobby into the domed rooms glancing at the pictures and returning to the lobby to look for her he watched the clock on the wall at half past three she still had not come she had got involved in another dreadful luncheon party she would surely be able to find out where orlov was she was an ingenious girl he was certain even if her father would not tell her straightforwardly she would think of a way to discover the secret whether she would pass the information on was another matter she was strongwilled too he wished he wished a lot of things he wished he had not deceived her he wished he could find orlov without her help he wished human beings did not make themselves into princes and earls and kaisers and czars he wished he had married lydia and known charlotte as a baby he wished she would come it was four oclock most of the paintings meant nothing to him the sentimental religious scenes the portraits of smug dutch merchants in their lifeless homes he liked bronzinos allegory but only because it was so sensual art was an area of human experience which he had passed by perhaps one day charlotte would lead him into the forest and show him the flowers but it was unlikely first he would have to live through the next few days and escape after killing orlov even that much was not certain then he would have to retain charlottes affection despite having used her lied to her and killed her cousin that was close to impossible but even if it happened he would have to find ways of seeing her while avoiding the police no there was not much chance he would know her after the assassination he thought make the most of her now it was fourthirty shes not just late he thought with a sinking heart she is unable to come i hope shes not in trouble with walden i hope she didnt take risks and get found out i wish she would come running up the steps out of breath and a little flushed with her hat slightly awry and an anxious look on her pretty face and say im terribly sorry to have made you wait about i got involved in the building seemed to be emptying out feliks wondered what to do next he went outside and down the steps to the pavement there was no sign of her he went back up the steps and was stopped at the door by a commissionaire too late mate the man said were closing feliks turned away he could not wait about on the steps in the hope that she would come later for he would be too conspicuous right here in trafalgar square anyway she was now two hours late she was not going to come she was not going to come face it he thought she has decided to have nothing more to do with me and quite sensibly but would she not have come if only to tell me that she might have sent a note she might have sent a note she had bridgets address she would have sent a note feliks headed north he walked through the alleys of theatreland and the quiet squares of bloomsbury the weather was changing all the time he had been in england it had been sunny and warm and he had yet to see rain but for the last day or so the atmosphere had seemed oppressive as if a storm were slowly gathering he thought i wonder what it is like to live in bloomsbury in this prosperous middleclass atmosphere where there is always enough to eat and money left over for books but after the revolution we will take down the railings around the parks he had a headache he had not suffered headaches since childhood he wondered whether it was caused by the stormy air more likely it was worry after the revolution he thought headaches will be prohibited would there be a note from her waiting at bridgets house he imagined it dear mr kschessinsky i regret i am unable to keep our appointment today yours truly lady charlotte walden no it would surely not be like that dear feliks prince orlov is staying at the home of the russian naval attaché a wilton place third floor left front bedroom your affectionate friend charlotte that was more like it dear father yesi have learned the truth but my papa has locked me in my room please come and rescue me your loving daughter charlotte kschessinsky dont be a damned fool he reached cork street and looked along the road there were no policemen guarding the house no hefty characters in plain clothes reading newspapers outside the pub it looked safe his heart lifted theres something marvelous about a warm welcome from a woman he thought whether shes a slip of a girl like charlotte or a fat old witch like bridget ive spent too much of my life with menor alone he knocked on bridgets door as he waited he looked down at the window of his old basement room and saw that there were new curtains the door opened bridget looked at him and smiled widely its my favorite international terrorist begod she said come in you darling man he went into her parlor do you want some tea its hot yes please he sat down did the police trouble you i was interrogated by a superintendent you must be a big cheese what did you tell him she looked contemptuous hed left his truncheon at homehe got nothing out of me feliks smiled have you got a letter but she was still talking did you want your room back ive let it to another fellow but ill chuck him outhes got sidewhiskers and i never could abide sidewhiskers no i dont want my room youve been sleeping rough i can tell by the look on you thats right whatever it was you came to london to do you havent done it yet no somethings happenedyouve changed yes what then he was suddenly grateful for someone to whom he could talk about it years ago i had a love affair i didnt know it but the woman had a baby a few days ago i met my daughter ah she looked at him with pity in her eyes you poor bugger as if you didnt have enough on your mind already is she the one that wrote the letter feliks gave a grunt of satisfaction theres a letter i supposed thats what you came for she went to the mantelpiece and reached behind the clock and is the poor girl mixed up with oppressors and tyrants yes i thought so from the crest you dont get much luck do you she handed him the letter feliks saw the crest on the back of the envelope he ripped it open inside were two pages covered with neat stylish handwriting walden hall july st dear feliks by the time you get this you will have waited in vain for me at our rendezvous i am most awfully sorry to let you down unfortunately i was seen with you on monday and it is assumed i have a clandestine lover if shes in trouble she seems cheerful enough about it feliks thought i have been banished to the country for the rest of the season however it is a blessing in disguise nobody would tell me where aleks was but now i know because he is here feliks was filled with savage triumph so thats where the rats have their nest bridget said is this child helping you she was my only hope then you deserve to look troubled i know take a train from liverpool street station to waldenhall halt this is our village the house is three miles out of the village on the north road however dont come to the house of course on the lefthand side of the road you will see a wood i always ride through the wood along the bridle path before breakfast between and oclock i will look out for you each day until you come once she decided whose side she was on feliks thought there were no half measures im not sure when this will get sent i will put it on the hall table as soon as i see some other letters for posting there that way nobody will see my handwriting on an envelope and the footman will just pick it up along with all the rest when he goes to the post office shes a brave girl feliks said aloud i am doing this because you are the only person i ever met who talks sense to me yours most affectionately charlotte feliks sat back in his seat and closed his eyes he was so proud of her and so ashamed of himself that he felt close to tears bridget took the letter from his unresisting fingers and began to read so she doesnt know youre her father she said no why is she helping you then she believes in what im doing bridget made a disgusted noise men like yourself always find women to help them i should know bechrist she read on she writes like a schoolgirl yes how old is she eighteen old enough to know her own mind aleks is the one youre after feliks nodded what is he a russian prince then he deserves to die hes dragging russia into war bridget nodded and youre dragging charlotte into it do you think im doing wrong she handed the letter back to him she seemed angry well never be sure will we politics is like that life is like that feliks tore the envelope in half and dropped it in the wastepaper bin he intended to rip up the letter but he could not bring himself to do it when its all over he thought this may be all i have to remember her by he folded the two sheets of paper and put them in his coat pocket he stood up ive got a train to catch do you want me to make you a sandwich to take with you he shook his head thank you im not hungry have you money for your fare i never pay train fares she put her hand into the pocket of her apron and took out a sovereign here you can buy a cup of tea as well its a lot of money i can afford it this week away with you before i change my mind feliks took the coin and kissed her goodbye you have been kind to me its not for you its for my sean god rest his merry soul goodbye good luck to you boy feliks went out walden was in an optimistic mood as he entered the admiralty building he had done what he had promised he had sold constantinople to aleks the previous afternoon aleks had sent a message to the czar recommending acceptance of the british offer walden was confident that the czar would follow the advice of his favorite nephew especially after the assassination in sarajevo he was not so sure that lloyd george would bend to the will of asquith he was shown into the office of the first lord of the admiralty churchill bounced up out of his chair and came around his desk to shake hands we sold it to lloyd george he said triumphantly thats marvelous walden said and i sold it to orlov i knew you would sit down i might have known better than to expect a thankyou walden thought but even churchill could not damp his spirits today he sat on a leather chair and glanced around the room at the charts on the walls and the naval memorabilia on the desk we should hear from st petersburg at any time he said the russian embassy will send a note directly to you the sooner the better churchill said count hayes has been to berlin according to our intelligence he took with him a letter asking the kaiser whether germany would support austria in a war against serbia our intelligence also says the answer was yes the germans dont want to fight serbia no churchill interrupted they want an excuse to fight france once germany mobilizes france will mobilize and that will be germanys pretext for invading france theres no stopping it now do the russians know all this weve told em i hope they believe us can nothing be done to make peace everything is being done churchill said sir edward grey is working night and day as are our ambassadors in berlin paris vienna and st petersburg even the king is firing off telegrams to his cousins kaiser willy and czar nicky itll do no good there was a knock at the door and a young male secretary came in with a piece of paper a message from the russian ambassador sir he said walden tensed churchill glanced at the paper and looked up with triumph in his eyes theyve accepted walden beamed bloody good show the secretary went out churchill stood up this calls for a whiskeyandsoda will you join me certainly churchill opened a cupboard ill have the treaty drafted overnight and bring it down to walden hall tomorrow afternoon we can have a little signing ceremony tomorrow night it will have to be ratified by the czar and asquith of course but thats a formalityso long as orlov and i sign as soon as possible the secretary knocked and came in again mr basil thomson is here sir show him in thomson came in and spoke without preamble weve picked up the trail of our anarchist again good said walden thomson sat down youll remember that i put a man in his old basement room in cork street just in case he should go back there i remember walden said he did go back there when he left my man followed him where did he go to liverpool street station thomson paused and he bought a ticket to waldenhall halt thirteen walden went cold his first thought was for charlotte she was vulnerable there the bodyguards were concentrating on aleks and she had nobody to protect her but the servants how could i have been so stupid he thought he was nearly as worried for aleks the boy was almost like a son to walden he thought he was safe in waldens homeand now feliks was on his way there with a gun or a bomb to kill him and perhaps charlotte too and sabotage the treaty walden burst out why the devil havent you stopped him thomson said mildly i dont think its a good idea for one man alone to go up against our friend feliks do you weve seen what he can do against several men he seems not to care about his own life my chappie has instructions to follow him and report its not enough i know my lord thomson interrupted churchill said let us be calm gentlemen at least we know where the fellow is with all the resources of his majestys government at our disposal we shall catch him what do you propose thomson as a matter of fact ive already done it sir i spoke by telephone with the chief constable of the county he will have a large detachment of men waiting at waldenhall halt to arrest feliks as he gets off the train meanwhile in case anything should go wrong my chappie will stick to him like glue that wont do walden said stop the train and arrest him before he gets anywhere near my home i did consider that thomson said the dangers outweigh the advantages much better to let him go on thinking hes safe then catch him unawares churchill said i agree its not your home walden said youre going to have to leave this to the professionals churchill said walden realized he could not overrule them he stood up i shall motor to walden hall immediately will you come thomson not tonight im going to arrest the callahan woman once weve caught feliks we have to mount a prosecution and she may be our chief witness ill come down tomorrow to interrogate feliks i dont know how you can be so confident walden said angrily well catch him this time thomson said i hope to god youre right the train steamed into the falling evening feliks watched the sun setting over the english wheatfields he was not young enough to take mechanical transport for granted he still found traveling by train almost magical the boy who had walked in clogs across the muddy russian meadows could not have dreamed this he was alone in the carriage but for a young man who seemed intent on reading every line of this evenings pall mall gazette felikss mood was almost gay tomorrow morning he would see charlotte how fine she would look on a horse with the wind streaming through her hair they would be working together she would tell him where orlovs room was where he was to be found at different times of the day she would help him get hold of a weapon it was her letter that had made him so cheerful he realized she was on his side now come what may except except that he had told her he was going to kidnap orlov each time he recalled this he wanted to squirm in his seat he tried to put it out of his mind but the thought was like an itch that could not be ignored and had to be scratched well he thought what is to be done i must begin to prepare her for the news at least perhaps i should tell her that i am her father what a shock it will be for a moment he was tempted by the idea of going away vanishing and never seeing her again leaving her in peace no he thought that is not her destiny nor is it mine i wonder what my destiny is after the killing of orlov shall i die he shook his head as if he could get rid of the thought like shaking off a fly this was no time for gloom he had plans to make how will i kill orlov there will be guns to steal in an earls country house charlotte can tell me where they are or bring me one failing that there will be knives in the kitchen and i have my bare hands he flexed his fingers will i have to go into the house or will orlov come out shall i do it by day or by night shall i kill walden too politically the death of walden would make no difference but i should like to kill him anyway so its personalso what he thought again of walden catching the bottle dont underestimate that man he told himself i must be careful that charlotte has an alibino one must ever know she helped me the train slowed down and entered a little country station feliks tried to recall the map he had looked at in liverpool street station he seemed to remember that waldenhall halt was the fourth station after this one his traveling companion at last finished the pall mall gazette and put it down on the seat beside him feliks decided that he could not plan the assassination until he had seen the lay of the land so he said may i read your newspaper the man seemed startled englishmen did not speak to strangers on trains feliks recalled by all means the man said feliks had learned that this phrase meant yes he picked up the paper thank you he glanced at the headlines his companion stared out of the window as if embarrassed he had the kind of facial hair that had been fashionable when feliks was a boy feliks tried to remember the english word sidewhiskers that was it sidewhiskers did you want your room back ive let it to another fellow but ill chuck him outhes got sidewhiskers and i never could abide sidewhiskers and now feliks recalled that this man had been behind him in the queue at the ticket office he felt a stab of fear he held the newspaper in front of his face in case his thoughts should show in his expression he made himself think calmly and clearly something bridget had said had made the police suspicious enough to place a watch on her house they had done that by the simple means of having a detective live in the room feliks had vacated the detective had seen feliks call had recognized him and had followed him to the station standing behind feliks in the queue he had heard him ask for waldenhall halt and bought himself a ticket to the same destination then he had boarded the train along with feliks no not quite feliks had sat in the train for ten minutes or so before it pulled out the man with the sidewhiskers had jumped aboard at the last minute what had he been doing in those few missing minutes he had probably made a phone call feliks imagined the conversation as the detective sat in the stationmasters office speaking into a telephone the anarchist returned to the house in cork street sir im following him now where are you at liverpool street station he bought a ticket to waldenhall halt hes on the train now has it left not for another seven minutes are there any police in the station just a couple of bobbies its not enough this man is dangerous i can have the train delayed while you get a team down here our anarchist might get suspicious and bolt for it no you stay with him and what feliks wondered would they do then they could either take him off the train somewhere along the route or wait to catch him at waldenhall halt either way he had to get off the train fast what to do about the detective he must be left behind on the train unable to give the alarm so that feliks would have time to get clear i could tie him up if i had anything to tie him with feliks thought i could knock him out if i had something heavy and hard to hit him with i could strangle him but that would take time and someone might see i could throw him off the train but i want to leave him on the train the train began to slow down they might be waiting for me at the next station he thought i wish i had a weapon does the detective have a gun i doubt it i could break the window and use a shard of glass to cut his throatbut that would surely draw a crowd i must get off the train a few houses could be seen alongside the railway track they were coming into a village or a small town the brakes of the train squealed and a station slid into view feliks watched intently for signs of a police trap the platform appeared empty the locomotive shuddered to a halt with a hiss of steam people began to get off a handful of passengers walked past felikss window heading for the exit a family with two small children a woman with a hatbox a tall man in tweeds i could hit the detective he thought but its so hard to knock somebody unconscious with just your fists the police trap could be at the next station i must get off now a whistle blew feliks stood up the detective looked startled feliks said is there a toilet on the train the detective was thrown by this er sure to be he said thank you he doesnt know whether to believe me feliks thought he stepped out of the compartment and into the corridor he ran to the end of the carriage the train chuffed and jerked forward feliks looked back the detective poked his head out of the compartment feliks went into the toilet and came back out again the detective was still watching the train moved a little faster feliks went to the carriage door the detective came running feliks turned back and punched him full in the face the blow stopped the detective in his tracks feliks hit him again in the stomach a woman screamed feliks got him by the coat and dragged him into the toilet the detective struggled and threw a wild punch which caught feliks in the ribs and made him gasp he got the detectives head in his hands and banged it against the edge of the washbasin the train picked up speed feliks banged the detectives head again and then again the man went limp feliks dropped him and stepped out of the toilet he went to the door and opened it the train was moving at running speed a woman at the other end of the corridor watched him whitefaced feliks jumped the door banged shut behind him he landed running he stumbled and regained his balance the train moved on faster and faster feliks walked to the exit you left it a bit late said the ticket man feliks nodded and handed over his ticket this ticket takes you three more stations the ticket man said i changed my mind at the last minute there was a squeal of brakes they both looked along the track the train was stopping someone had pulled the emergency brake the ticket man said here whats going on feliks forced himself to shrug unconcernedly search me he said he wanted to run but that would be the worst thing he could do the ticket man hovered torn between his suspicion of feliks and his concern for the train finally he said you wait here and ran along the platform the train stopped a couple of hundred yards out of the station feliks watched the ticket man run to the end of the platform and down on to the embankment he looked around he was alone he walked briskly out of the station and into the town a few minutes later a car with three policemen in it went past him at top speed heading for the station on the outskirts of the town feliks climbed over a gate and went into a wheatfield where he lay down to wait for nightfall the big lanchester roared up the drive to walden hall all the lights were on in the house a uniformed policeman stood at the door and another was patrolling sentryfashion along the terrace pritchard brought the car to a halt the policeman at the entrance stood to attention and saluted pritchard opened the car door and walden got out mrs braithwaite the housekeeper came out of the house to greet him good evening my lord hello mrs braithwaite whos here sir arthur is in the drawing room with prince orlov walden nodded and they entered the house together sir arthur langley was the chief constable and an old school friend of waldens have you dined my lord said mrs braithwaite no perhaps a piece of game pie and a bottle of burgundy i leave it to you very good my lord mrs braithwaite went away and walden entered the drawing room aleks and sir arthur were leaning on the mantelpiece with brandy glasses in their hands both wore evening dress sir arthur said hello stephen how are you walden shook his hand did you catch the anarchist im afraid he slipped through our fingers damnation walden exclaimed i was afraid of that no one would listen to me he remembered his manners and shook hands with aleks i dont know what to say to you dear boyyou must think were a lot of fools he turned back to sir arthur what the devil happened anyway feliks hopped off the train at tingley where was thomsons precious detective in the toilet with a broken head marvelous walden said bitterly he slumped into a chair by the time the town constabulary had been roused feliks had melted away hes on his way heredo you realize that yes of course said sir arthur in a soothing tone your men should be instructed that next time he is sighted hes to be shot ideally yesbut of course they dont have guns they damn well should have i think youre right but public opinion before we discuss that tell me what is being done very well ive got five patrols covering the roads between here and tingley they wont see him in the dark perhaps not but at least their presence will slow him down if not stop him altogether i doubt it what else ive brought a constable and a sergeant to guard the house i saw them outside theyll be relieved every eight hours day and night the prince already has two bodyguards from the special branch and thomson is sending four more down here by car tonight theyll take twelvehour shifts so hell always have three men with him my men arent armed but thomsons arethey have revolvers my recommendation is that until feliks is caught prince orlov should remain in his room and be served his food and so on by the bodyguards aleks said i will do that walden looked at him he was pale but calm hes very brave walden thought if i were he i should be raging about the incompetence of the british police walden said i dont think a few bodyguards is enough we need an army well have one by tomorrow morning sir arthur replied were mounting a search beginning at nine oclock why not at dawn because the army has to be mustered a hundred and fifty men will be coming here from all over the county most of them are now in bedthey have to be visited and given their instructions and they have to make their ways here mrs braithwaite came in with a tray there was cold game pie half a chicken a bowl of potato salad bread rolls cold sausages sliced tomatoes a wedge of cheddar cheese several kinds of chutney and some fruit a footman followed with a bottle of wine a jug of milk a pot of coffee a dish of ice cream an apple tart and half of a large chocolate cake the footman said im afraid the burgundy hasnt had time to breathe my lordshall i decant it yes please the footman fussed with a small table and a place setting walden was hungry but he felt too tense to eat i dont suppose i shall be able to sleep either he thought aleks helped himself to more brandy he is drinking steadily walden realized his movements were deliberate and machinelike as if he had himself rigidly under control where is charlotte walden said suddenly aleks answered she went to bed she mustnt leave the house while all this is going on mrs braithwaite said shall i tell her my lord no dont wake her ill see her at breakfast walden took a sip of wine hoping it would relax him a little we could move you again aleks if it would make you feel better aleks gave a tight little smile i dont think theres much point do you feliks always manages to find me the best plan is for me to hide in my room sign the treaty as soon as possible and then go home walden nodded the servants went out sir arthur said um there is something else stephen he seemed embarrassed i mean the question of just what made feliks suddenly catch a train to waldenhall halt in all the panic walden had not even considered that yeshow in heavens name did he find out as i understand it only two groups of people knew where prince orlov had gone one is the embassy staff who of course have been passing telegrams and so on to and fro the other group is your people here a traitor among my servants walden said the thought was chilling yes said sir arthur hesitantly or of course among the family lydias dinner party was a disaster with stephen away his brother george had to sit in as host which made the numbers uneven more seriously lydia was so distracted that her conversation was barely polite let alone sparkling all but the most kindhearted guests asked after charlotte knowing full well that she was in disgrace lydia just said that she had gone to the country for a few days rest she spoke mechanically hardly knowing what she was saying her mind was full of nightmares feliks being arrested stephen being shot feliks being beaten stephen bleeding feliks running stephen dying she longed to tell someone how she felt but with her guests she could talk only of last nights ball the prospects for the cowes regatta the balkan situation and lloyd georges budget fortunately they did not linger after dinner they were all going to a ball or a crush or a concert as soon as the last one had left lydia went into the hall and picked up the telephone she could not speak to stephen for walden hall was not yet on the phone so she called winston churchills home in eccleston square he was out she tried the admiralty number ten and the national liberal club without success she had to know what had happened finally she thought of basil thomson and she telephoned scotland yard thomson was still at his desk working late lady walden how are you he said lydia thought people will be polite she said what is the news bad im afraid our friend feliks has slipped through our fingers again relief washed over lydia in a tidal wave thank thank you she said i dont think you need to worry too much thomson went on prince orlov is well guarded now lydia blushed with shame she had been so pleased that feliks was all right that she had momentarily forgotten to worry about aleks and stephen i ill try not to worry she said good night good night lady walden she put down the phone she went upstairs and rang for her maid to come and unlace her she felt distraught nothing was resolved everyone she loved was still in danger how long could it go on feliks would not give up she was sure unless he got caught the maid came and unbuttoned her gown and unlaced her corset some ladies confided in their maids lydia knew she did not she had once in st petersburg she decided to write to her sister for it was too early to go to bed she told the maid to bring writing paper from the morning room she put on a wrap and sat by the open window staring into the darkness of the park the evening was close it had not rained for three months but during the last few days the weather had become thundery and soon there would surely be storms the maid brought paper pens ink and envelopes lydia took a sheet of paper and wrote dear tatyana she did not know where to begin how can i explain about charlotte she thought when i dont understand her myself and i darent say anything about feliks for tatyana might tell the czar and if the czar knew how close aleks had come to being killed feliks is so clever how on earth did he find out where aleks is hiding we wouldnt even tell charlotte charlotte lydia went cold charlotte she stood upright and cried oh no he was about forty and wearing a tweed cap a sense of inevitable horror possessed her it was like one of those crucifying dreams in which you think of the worst thing that could possibly happen and that thing immediately begins to happen the ladder falls the child is run over the loved one dies she buried her face in her hands she felt dizzy i must think i must try to think please god help me think charlotte met a man in the national gallery that evening she asked me where aleks was i didnt tell her perhaps she asked stephen too he wouldnt have told her then she was sent home to walden hall and of course she discovered that aleks was there two days later feliks went to waldenhall halt make this be a dream she prayed make me wake up now please and find myself in my own bed make it be morning it was not a dream feliks was the man in the tweed cap charlotte had met her father they had been holding hands it was horrible horrible had feliks told charlotte the truth had he said i am your real father had he revealed the secret of nineteen years did he even know surely he must have why else would she be collaborating with him my daughter conspiring with an anarchist to commit murder she must be helping him still what can i do i must warn stephenbut how can i do that without telling him hes not charlottes father i wish i could think she rang for her maid again i must find a way to put an end to this she thought i dont know what im going to do but i must do something when the maid came she said start packing i shall leave first thing in the morning i have to go to walden hall after dark feliks headed across the fields it was a warm humid night and very dark heavy clouds hid the stars and the moon he had to walk slowly for he was almost blind he found his way to the railway line and turned north walking along the tracks he could go a little faster for there was a faint shine on the steel lines and he knew there would be no obstacles he passed through dark stations creeping along the deserted platforms he heard rats in the empty waiting rooms he had no fear of rats once upon a time he had killed them with his hands and eaten them the names of the stations were stamped on sheetmetal signs and he could read them by touch when he reached waldenhall halt he recalled charlottes directions the house is three miles out of the village on the north road the railway line was running roughly northnortheast he followed it another mile or so measuring the distance by counting his paces he had reached one thousand six hundred when he bumped into someone the man gave a shout of surprise and then feliks had him by the throat an overpowering smell of beer came from the man feliks realized he was just a drunk going home and relaxed his grip dont be frightened the man said in a slurred voice all right feliks said he let go its the only way i can get home see without getting lost on your way then the man moved on a moment later he said dont go to sleep on the linethe milk train comes at four oclock feliks made no reply and the drunk shuffled off feliks shook his head disgusted with himself for being so jumpy he might have killed the man he was weak with relief this would not do he decided to find the road he moved off the railway line stumbled across a short stretch of rough ground then came up against a flimsy threewire fence he waited for a moment what was in front of him a field someones back garden the village green there was no darkness like a dark night in the country with the nearest streetlight a hundred miles away he heard a sudden movement close to him and out of the corner of his eye he saw something white he bent down and fumbled on the ground until he found a small stone then threw it in the direction of the white thing there was a whinny and a horse cantered away feliks listened if there were dogs nearby the whinny ought to make them bark he heard nothing he stooped and clambered through the fence he walked slowly across the paddock once he stumbled into a bush he heard another horse but did not see it he came up against another wire fence climbed through it and bumped into a wooden building immediately there was a tremendous noise of chickens clucking a dog started to bark a light came on in the window of a house feliks threw himself flat and lay still the light showed him that he was in a small farmyard he had bumped into the henhouse beyond the farmhouse he could see the road he was looking for the chickens quieted the dog gave a last disappointed howl and the light went out feliks walked to the road it was a dirt road bordered by a dry ditch beyond the ditch there seemed to be woodland feliks remembered on the lefthand side of the road you will see a wood he was almost there he walked north along the uneven road his hearing strained for the sound of someone approaching after more than a mile he sensed that there was a wall on his left a little farther on the wall was broken by a gate and he saw a light he leaned on the iron bars of the gate and peered through there seemed to be a long drive at its far end he could see dimly illuminated by a pair of flickering lamps the pillared portico of a vast house as he watched a tall figure walked across the front of the house a sentry in that house he thought is prince orlov i wonder which is his bedroom window suddenly he heard the sound of a car approaching very fast he ran back ten paces and threw himself into the ditch a moment later the cars headlights swept along the wall and it pulled up in front of the gate someone got out feliks heard knocking there must be a gatehouse he realized he had not seen it in the darkness a window was opened and a voice shouted whos there another voice replied police from the special branch of scotland yard just a minute feliks lay perfectly still he heard footsteps as the man who had got out of the car moved around restlessly a door was opened a dog barked and a voice said quiet rex feliks stopped breathing was the dog on a lead would it smell feliks would it come snuffling along the ditch and find him and start to bark the iron gates creaked open the dog barked again the voice said shut up rex a car door slammed and the car moved off up the drive the ditch was dark again now feliks thought if the dog finds me i can kill it and the gatekeeper and run away he tensed ready to jump up as soon as he heard a snuffling sound near to his ear the gates creaked shut a moment later the gatehouse door slammed feliks breathed again fourteen charlotte woke at six oclock she had drawn back the curtains of her bedroom windows so that the first rays of the sun would shine on her face and rouse her from sleep it was a trick she had used years ago when belinda was staying over and the two of them had liked to roam around the house while the grownups were still in bed and there was no one to tell them to behave like little ladies her first thought was for feliks they had failed to catch himhe was so clever today he would surely be waiting for her in the wood she jumped out of bed and looked outside the weather had not yet broken he would have been dry in the night anyway she washed in cold water and dressed quickly in a long skirt riding boots and a jacket she never wore a hat for these morning rides she went downstairs she saw nobody there would be a maid or two in the kitchen lighting fires and heating water but otherwise the servants were still in bed she went out of the south front door and almost bumped into a large uniformed policeman heavens she exclaimed who are you constable stevenson miss he called her miss because he did not know who she was im charlotte walden she said pardon me mlady thats all right what are you doing here guarding the house mlady oh i see guarding the prince you mean how reassuring how many of you are there two outside and four inside the inside men are armed but therell be a lot more later how so big search party mlady i hear therell be a hundred and fifty men here by nine well get this anarchist chappienever you fear how splendid was you thinking of going riding mlady i shouldnt if i was you not today no i shant charlotte lied she walked away around the east wing of the house to the back the stables were deserted she went inside and found her mare spats so called because of the white patches on her forelegs she talked to her for a minute stroking her nose and gave her an apple then she saddled her led her out of the stable and mounted her she rode away from the back of the house and around the park in a wide circle staying out of sight and out of earshot of the policeman she galloped across the west paddock and jumped the low fence into the wood she walked spats through the trees until she came to the bridle path then let her trot it was cool in the wood the oak and beech trees were heavy with leaf shading the path in the patches where the sun came through dew rose from the ground like wisps of steam charlotte felt the heat of those stray sunbeams as she rode through them the birds were very loud she thought what can he do against a hundred and fifty men his plan was impossible now aleks was too well guarded and the hunt for feliks was too well organized at least charlotte could warn him off she reached the far end of the wood without seeing him she was disappointed she had been sure he would be here today she began to worry for if she did not see him she could not warn him and then he would surely be caught but it was not yet seven oclock perhaps he had not begun to watch out for her she dismounted and walked back leading spats perhaps feliks had seen her and was waiting to check whether she had been followed she stopped in a glade to watch a squirrel they did not mind people although they would run away from dogs suddenly she felt she was being watched she turned around and there he was looking at her with a peculiarly sad expression he said hello charlotte she went to him and held both his hands his beard was quite full now his clothes were covered with bits of greenery you look dreadfully tired she said in russian im hungry did you bring food oh dear no she had brought an apple for her horse and nothing for feliks i didnt think of it never mind ive been hungrier listen she said you must go away immediately if you leave now you can escape why should i escape i want to kidnap orlov she shook her head its impossible now he has armed bodyguards the house is patrolled by policemen and by nine oclock there will be a hundred and fifty men searching for you he smiled and if i escape what will i do with the rest of my life but i wont help you commit suicide lets sit on the grass he said i have something to explain to you she sat with her back against a broad oak tree feliks sat in front of her and crossed his legs like a cossack dappled sunlight played across his weary face he spoke rather formally in complete sentences which sounded as if they might have been rehearsed i told you i was in love once with a woman called lydia and you said thats my mothers name do you remember i remember everything youve ever said to me she wondered what this was all about it was your mother she stared at him you were in love with mama more than that we were lovers she used to come to my apartment alonedo you understand what i mean charlotte blushed with confusion and embarrassment yes i do her father your grandfather found out the old count had me arrested then he forced your mother to marry walden oh how terrible charlotte said softly for some reason she was frightened of what he might say next you were born seven months after the wedding he seemed to think that was very significant charlotte frowned feliks said do you know how long it takes for a baby to grow and be born no it takes nine months normally although it can take less charlottes heart was pounding what are you getting at you might have been conceived before the wedding does that mean you might be my father she said incredulously theres more you look exactly like my sister natasha charlottes heart seemed to rise into her throat and she could hardly speak you think you are my father im sure of it oh god charlotte put her face in her hands and stared into space seeing nothing she felt as if she were waking from a dream and could not yet figure out which aspects of the dream had been real she thought of papa but he was not her papa she thought of mama having a lover she thought of feliks her friend and suddenly her father she said did they lie to me even about this she was so disoriented that she felt she would not be able to stand upright it was as if someone had told her that all the maps she had ever seen were forgeries and she really lived in brazil or that the real owner of walden hall was pritchard or that horses could talk but merely kept silent by choice but it was much worse than all those things she said if you were to tell me that i am a boy but my mother always dressed me in girls clothing it would be like this she thought mama and feliks that made her blush again feliks took her hand and stroked it he said i suppose all the love and concern that a man normally gives to his wife and children went in my case into politics i have to try to get orlov even if its impossible the way a man would have to try to save his child from drowning even if the man could not swim charlotte suddenly realized how confused feliks must feel about her the daughter he had never really had she understood now the odd painful way he had looked at her sometimes you poor man she said he bit his lip you have such a generous heart she did not know why he should say that what are we going to do he took a deep breath could you get me inside the house and hide me she thought for a moment yes she said he mounted the horse behind her the beast shook its head and snorted as if offended that it should be expected to carry a double weight charlotte urged it into a trot she followed the bridle path for a while then turned off it at an angle and headed through the wood they went through a gate across a paddock and into a little lane feliks did not yet see the house he realized she was circling around it to approach from the north side she was an astonishing child she had such strength of character had she inherited it from him he wanted to think so he was very happy to have told her the truth about her birth he had the feeling she had not quite accepted it but she would she had listened to him turn her world upside down and she had reacted with emotion but without hysteriashe did not get that kind of equanimity from her mother from the lane they turned into an orchard now looking between the tops of the trees feliks could see the roofs of walden hall the orchard ended in a wall charlotte stopped the horse and said youd better walk beside me from here that way if anyone should glance out of a window they wont be able to see you very easily feliks jumped off they walked alongside the wall and followed it around a comer whats behind the wall feliks asked kitchen garden better not talk now youre marvelous feliks whispered but she did not hear they stopped at the next corner feliks could see some low buildings and a yard the stables charlotte murmured stay here for a moment when i give you the signal follow me as fast as you can where are we going over the roofs she rode into the yard dismounted and looped the reins over a rail feliks watched her cross to the far side of the little yard look both ways then come back and look inside the stables he heard her say oh hello peter a boy of about twelve years came out taking off his cap good morning mlady feliks thought how will she get rid of him charlotte said wheres daniel having his breakfast mlady go and fetch him will you and tell him to come and unsaddle spats i can do it mlady no i want daniel charlotte said imperiously off you go marvelous feliks thought the boy ran off charlotte turned toward feliks and beckoned he ran to her she jumped onto a low iron bunker then climbed onto the corrugated tin roof of a leanto shed and from there got onto the slate roof of a onestory stone building feliks followed they edged along the slate roof moving sideways on all fours until it ended up against a brick wall then they crawled up the slope to the ridge of the roof feliks felt dreadfully conspicuous and vulnerable charlotte stood upright and peeped through a window in the brick wall feliks whispered whats in there parlormaids bedroom but theyre downstairs by now laying the breakfast table she clambered onto the window ledge and stood upright the bedroom was an attic room and the window was in the gable end so that the roof peaked just above the window and sloped down either side charlotte moved along the sill then cocked her leg over the edge of the roof it looked dangerous feliks frowned frightened that she would fall but she hauled herself onto the roof with ease feliks did the same now were out of sight charlotte said feliks looked around she was right they could not be seen from the ground he relaxed a fraction there are four acres of roof charlotte told him four acres most russian peasants havent got that much land it was quite a sight on all sides were roofs of every material size and pitch ladders and strips of decking were provided so that people could move around without treading on the slates and tiles the guttering was as complex as the piping in the oil refinery feliks had seen at batum ive never seen such a big house he said charlotte stood up come on follow me she led him up a ladder to the next roof along a board footway then up a short flight of wooden steps leading to a small square door set in a wall she said at one time this must have been the way they got out onto the roofs for maintenancebut now everybody has forgotten about it she opened the door and crawled through gratefully feliks followed her into the welcoming darkness lydia borrowed a motor car and driver from her brotherinlaw george and having lain awake all night left london very early the car entered the drive at walden hall at nine oclock and she was astonished to see in front of the house and spreading over the park hundreds of policemen dozens of vehicles and scores of dogs georges driver threaded the car through the crowd to the south front of the house there was an enormous tea urn on the lawn and the policemen were queuing up with cups in their hands pritchard walked by carrying a mountain of sandwiches on a huge tray and looking harassed he did not even notice that his mistress had arrived a trestle table had been set up on the terrace and behind it sat stephen with sir arthur langley giving instructions to half a dozen police officers who stood in front of them in a semicircle lydia went over to them sir arthur had a map in front of him she heard him say each team will have a local man to keep you on the correct route and a motorcyclist to dash back here and report progress every hour stephen looked up saw lydia and left the group to speak to her good morning my dear this is a pleasant surprise how did you get here i borrowed georges car what is going on search parties oh with all these men looking for him how could feliks possibly escape stephen said still i wish you had stayed in town i should have been happier for your safety and i should have spent every minute wondering whether bad news was on its way and what would count as good news she wondered perhaps if feliks were simply to give up and go away but he would not do that she was sure she studied her husbands face beneath his customary poise there were signs of tiredness and tension poor stephen first his wife and now his daughter deceiving him a guilty impulse made her reach up and touch his cheek dont wear yourself out she said a whistle blew the policemen hastily drained their teacups stuffed the remains of sandwiches into their mouths put on their helmets and formed themselves into six groups each around a leader lydia stood with stephen watching there were a lot of shouted orders and a good deal more whistling finally they began to move out the first group went south fanning out across the park and entered the wood two more headed west into the paddock the other three groups went down the drive toward the road lydia regarded her lawn it looked like the site of a sundayschool outing when all the children have gone home mrs braithwaite began to organize the cleaningup with a pained expression on her face lydia went into the house she met charlotte in the hall charlotte was surprised to see her hello mama she said i didnt know you were coming down one gets so bored in town lydia said automatically then she thought what rubbish we talk how did you get here i borrowed uncle georges car lydia saw that charlotte was making small talk and thinking of something else you must have started very early charlotte said yes lydia wanted to say stop it lets not pretend why dont we speak the truth but she could not bring herself to do it have all those policemen gone yet charlotte asked she was looking at lydia in a strange way as if seeing her for the first time it made lydia uncomfortable i wish i could read my daughters mind she thought she replied yes theyve all gone splendid that was one of stephens wordssplendid there was after all something of stephen in charlotte the curiosity the determination the poisesince she had not inherited those things she must have acquired them simply by imitating him lydia said i hope they catch this anarchist and watched charlottes reaction im sure they will charlotte said gaily shes very brighteyed lydia thought why should she look that way when hundreds of policemen are combing the county for feliks why is she not depressed and anxious as i am it must be that she does not expect them to catch him for some reason she thinks he is safe charlotte said tell me something mama how long does it take for a baby to grow and be born lydias mouth fell open and the blood drained from her face she stared at charlotte thinking she knows she knows charlotte smiled and nodded looking faintly sad never mind she said youve answered my question she went on down the stairs lydia held on to the banister feeling faint feliks had told charlotte it was just too cruel after all these years she felt angry at feliks why had he ruined charlottes life this way the hall spun around her head and she heard a maids voice say are you all right my lady her head cleared a little tired after the journey she said take my arm the maid took her arm and together they walked upstairs to lydias room another maid was already unpacking lydias cases there was hot water ready for her in the dressing room lydia sat down leave me now you two she said unpack later the maids went out lydia unbuttoned her coat but did not have the energy to take it off she thought about charlottes mood it had been almost vivacious even though there was obviously a lot on her mind lydia understood that she recognized it she had sometimes felt that way it was the mood you were in when you had spent time with feliks you felt that life was endlessly fascinating and surprising that there were important things to be done that the world was full of color and passion and change charlotte had seen feliks and she believed him to be safe lydia thought what am i going to do wearily she took off her clothes she spent time washing and dressing again taking the opportunity to calm herself she wondered how charlotte felt about felikss being her father she obviously liked him very much people do lydia thought people love him where had charlotte got the strength to hear such news without collapsing lydia decided she had better take care of the housekeeping she looked in the mirror and composed her face then she went out on the way downstairs she met a maid with a tray laden with sliced ham scrambled eggs fresh bread milk coffee and grapes who is that for she asked for lady charlotte mlady said the maid lydia passed on had charlotte not even lost her appetite she went into the morning room and sent for cook mrs rowse was a thin nervous woman who never ate the kind of rich food she prepared for her employers she said i understand mr thomson will be arriving for lunch mlady and mr churchill also for dinner lydia discussed the menus with her then sent her away why on earth was charlotte having such a massive breakfast in her room she wondered and so late in the country charlotte was normally up early and had finished breakfast before lydia surfaced she sent for pritchard and made the table plan with him pritchard told her that aleks was having all his meals in his room until further notice it made little difference to the table plan they still had too many men and in the present situation lydia could hardly invite people to make up the right numbers she did the best she could then sent pritchard away where had charlotte seen feliks and why was she confident that he would not be caught had she found him a hiding place was he in some impenetrable disguise she moved around the room looking at the pictures the little bronzes the glass ornaments the writing desk she had a headache she began to rearrange the flowers in a big vase by the window and knocked over the vase she rang for someone to clear up the mess then left the room her nerves were very bad she contemplated taking some laudanum these days it did not help her as much as it used to what will charlotte do now will she keep the secret why dont children talk to one she went along to the library with the vague idea of getting a book to take her mind off everything when she walked in she gave a guilty start on seeing that stephen was there at his desk he looked up at her as she entered smiled in a welcoming way and went on writing lydia wandered along the bookshelves she wondered whether to read the bible there had been a great deal of biblereading in her childhood and family prayers and much churchgoing she had had stern nurses who were keen on the horrors of hell and the penalties of uncleanliness and a lutheran german governess who talked a great deal about sin but since lydia had committed fornication and brought retribution upon herself and her daughter she had never been able to take any consolation from religion i should have gone into that convent she thought and put myself right with god my fathers instinct was correct she took a book at random and sat down with it open on her lap stephen said thats an unusual choice for you he could not read the title from where he was sitting but he knew where all the authors were placed on the shelves he read so many books lydia did not know how he found the time she looked at the spine of the book she was holding it was thomas hardys wessex poems she did not like hardy did not like those determined passionate women nor the strong men whom they made helpless they had often sat like this she and stephen especially when they first came to walden hall she recalled nostalgically how she would sit and read while he worked he had been less tranquil in those days she remembered he used to say that nobody could make money out of agriculture anymore and that if this family were to continue to be rich and powerful it would have to get ready for the twentieth century he had sold off some farms at that time many thousands of acres at very low prices then he had put the money into railroads and banks and london property the plan must have worked for he soon stopped looking worried it was after the birth of charlotte that everything seemed to settle down the servants adored the baby and loved lydia for producing her lydia got used to english ways and was well liked by london society there had been eighteen years of tranquillity lydia sighed those years were coming to an end for a while she had buried the secrets so successfully that they tormented nobody but her and even she had been able to forget them at times but now they were coming out she had thought that london was at a safe distance from st petersburg but perhaps california would have been a better choice or it might be that nowhere was far enough the time of peace was over it was all falling apart what would happen now she looked down at the open page and read she would have given a world to breathe yes truly so much his life seemed hanging on her mind and hence she lied her heart persuaded throughly twas worth her soul to be a moment kind is that me she wondered did i give my soul when i married stephen in order to save feliks from incarceration in the fortress of st peter and st paul ever since then ive been playing a part pretending im not a wanton sinful brazen whore but i am and im not the only one other women feel the same why else would the viscountess and charlie stott want adjoining bedrooms and why would lady girard tell me about them with a wink if she did not understand how they felt if i had been just a little wanton perhaps stephen would have come to my bed more often and we might have had a son she sighed again penny for em stephen said what a penny for your thoughts lydia smiled will i never stop learning english expressions ive never heard that one nobody ever stops learning it means tell me what youre thinking i was thinking about walden hall going to georges son when you die unless we have a son she looked at his face the bright blue eyes the neat gray beard he was wearing a blue tie with white spots he said is it too late i dont know she said thinking that depends on what charlotte does next do lets keep trying he said this was an unusually frank conversation stephen had sensed that she was in a mood to be candid she got up from her chair and went over to stand beside him he had a bald spot on the back of his head she noticed how long had that been there yes she said lets keep trying she bent down and kissed his forehead then on impulse she kissed his lips he closed his eyes after a moment she broke away he looked a little embarrassed they rarely did this sort of thing during the day for there were always so many servants about she thought why do we live the way we do if it doesnt make us happy she said i do love you he smiled i know you do suddenly she could stand it no longer she said i must go and change for lunch before basil thomson arrives he nodded she felt his eyes following her as she left the room she went upstairs wondering whether there might still be a chance that she and stephen could be happy she went into her bedroom she was still carrying the book of poems she put it down charlotte held the key to all this lydia had to talk to her one could say difficult things after all if one had the courage and what now was left to lose without having a clear idea of what she would say she headed for charlottes room on the next floor her footsteps made no noise on the carpet she reached the top of the staircase and looked along the corridor she saw charlotte disappearing into the old nursery she was about to call out then stopped herself what had charlotte been carrying it had looked very much like a plate of sandwiches and a glass of milk puzzled lydia went along to charlottes bedroom there on the table was the tray lydia had seen the maid carrying all the ham and all the bread had gone why would charlotte order a tray of food then make sandwiches of it and eat it in the nursery there was nothing in the nursery as far as lydia knew except furniture covered with dust sheets was charlotte so anxious that she needed to retreat into the cosy world of childhood lydia decided to find out she felt uneasy about interrupting charlottes private ritual whatever it was but then she thought its my house shes my daughter and perhaps i ought to know and it might create a moment of intimacy and help me say what i need to say so she left charlottes bedroom and went along the corridor and into the nursery charlotte was not there lydia looked around there was the old rocking horse his ears making twin peaks in the dust sheet through an open door she could see the schoolroom with maps and childish drawings on the wall another door led to the bedroom that too was empty but for shrouds will all this ever be used again lydia wondered will we have nurses and diapers and tiny tiny clothes and a nanny and toy soldiers and exercise books filled with clumsy handwriting and ink blots but where was charlotte the closet door was open suddenly lydia remembered of course charlottes hideaway the little room she thought no one else knew of where she used to go when she had been naughty she had furnished it herself with bits and pieces from around the house and everyone had pretended not to know how certain things had disappeared one of the few indulgent decisions lydia had made was to allow charlotte her hideaway and to forbid marya to discover it for lydia herself hid away sometimes in the flower room and she knew how important it was to have a place of your own so charlotte still used that little room lydia moved closer more reluctant now to disturb charlottes privacy but tempted all the same no she thought ill leave her be then she heard voices was charlotte talking to herself lydia listened carefully talking to herself in russian then there was another voice a mans voice replying in russian in low tones a voice like a caress a voice which sent a sexual shudder through lydias body feliks was in there lydia thought she would faint feliks within touching distance hidden in walden hall while the police searched the county for him hidden by charlotte i mustnt scream she put her fist to her mouth and bit herself she was shaking i must get away i cant think straight i dont know what to do her head ached horribly i need a dose of laudanum she thought that prospect gave her strength she controlled her trembling after a moment she tiptoed out of the nursery she almost ran along the corridor and down the stairs to her room the laudanum was in the dresser she opened the bottle she could not hold the spoon steady so she took a gulp directly from the bottle after a few moments she began to feel calmer she put the bottle and the spoon away and closed the drawer a feeling of mild contentment began to come over her as her nerves settled down her head ached less nothing would really matter now for a while she went to her wardrobe and opened the door she stood staring at the rows of dresses totally unable to make up her mind what to wear for lunch feliks paced the tiny room like a caged tiger three steps each way bending his head to avoid the ceiling listening to charlotte alekss door is always locked she said there are two armed guards inside and one outside the inside ones wont unlock the door unless their colleague outside tells them to one outside and two inside feliks scratched his head and cursed in russian difficulties there are always difficulties he thought here i am right in the house with an accomplice in the household and still it isnt easy why shouldnt i have the luck of those boys in sarajevo why did it have to turn out that im a part of this family he looked at charlotte and thought not that i regret it she caught his look and said what nothing whatever happens im glad i found you me too but what are you going to do about aleks could you draw a plan of the house charlotte made a face i can try you must know ityouve lived here all your life well i know this part of coursebut there are bits of the house ive never been in the butlers bedroom the housekeepers rooms the cellars the place over the kitchens where they store flour and things do your best one plan for each floor she found a piece of paper and a pencil among her childish treasures and knelt at the little table feliks ate another sandwich and drank the rest of the milk she had taken a long time to bring him the food because the maids had been working in her corridor as he ate he watched her draw frowning and biting the end of her pencil at one point she said one doesnt realize how difficult this is until one tries it she found an eraser among her old crayons and used it frequently feliks noticed that she was able to draw perfectly straight lines without using a rule he found the sight of her like this very touching so she must have sat he thought for years in the schoolroom drawing houses then mama and papa and later the map of europe the leaves of the english trees the park in winter walden must have seen her like this many times why have you changed your clothes feliks asked oh everybody has to change all the time here every hour of the day has its appropriate clothes you see you must show your shoulders at dinnertime but not at lunch you must wear a corset for dinner but not for tea you cant wear an indoor gown outside you can wear woolen stockings in the library but not in the morning room you cant imagine the rules i have to remember he nodded he was no longer capable of being surprised by the degeneracy of the ruling class she handed him her sketches and he became businesslike again he studied them where are the guns kept he said she touched his arm dont be so abrupt she said im on your sideremember suddenly she was grownup again feliks smiled ruefully i had forgotten he said the guns are kept in the gun room she pointed it out on the plan you really did have an affair with mama yes i find it so hard to believe that she would do such a thing she was very wild then she still is but she pretends otherwise you really think shes still like that i know it everything everything turns out to be different from how i thought it was thats called growing up she was pensive what should i call you i wonder what do you mean i should feel very strange calling you father feliks will do for now you need time to get used to the idea of me as your father shall i have time her young face was so grave that he held her hand why not what will you do when you have aleks he looked away so that she should not see the guilt in his eyes that depends just how and when i kidnap him but most likely ill keep him tied up right here youll have to bring us food and youll have to send a telegram to my friends in geneva in code telling them what has happened then when the news has achieved what we want it to achieve well let orlov go and then they will look for me in london so ill go north there seem to be some big townsbirmingham manchester hullwhere i could lose myself after a few weeks ill make my way back to switzerland then eventually to st petersburgthats the place to be thats where the revolution will start so ill never see you again you wont want to he thought he said why not i may come back to london you may go to st petersburg we might meet in paris who can tell if there is such a thing as fate it seems determined to bring us together i wish i could believe this i wish i could thats true she said with a brittle smile and he saw that she did not believe it either she got to her feet now i must get you some water to wash in dont bother ive been a good deal dirtier than this i dont mind but i do you smell awful ill be back in a minute with that she went out it was the dreariest luncheon walden could remember in years lydia was in some kind of daze teristically nervy dropping her cutlery and knocking over a glass thomson was taciturn sir arthur langley attempted to be convivial but nobody responded walden himself was withdrawn obsessed by the puzzle of how feliks had found out that aleks was at walden hall he was tortured by the ugly suspicion that it had something to do with lydia after all lydia had told feliks that aleks was at the savoy hotel and she had admitted that feliks was vaguely familiar from st petersburg days could it be that feliks had some kind of hold on her she had been behaving oddly as if distracted all summer and now as he thought about lydia in a detached way for the first time in nineteen years he admitted to himself that she was sexually lukewarm of course wellbred women were supposed to be like that but he knew perfectly well that this was a polite fiction and that women generally suffered the same longings as men was it that lydia longed for someone else someone from her past that would explain all sorts of things which until now had not seemed to need explanation it was perfectly horrible he found to look at his lifetime companion and see a stranger after lunch sir arthur went back to the octagon where he had set up his headquarters walden and thomson put on their hats and took their cigars out onto the terrace the park looked lovely in the sunshine as always from the distant drawing room came the crashing opening chords of the tchaikovsky piano concerto lydia was playing walden felt sad then the music was drowned by the roar of a motorcycle as another messenger came to report the progress of the search to sir arthur so far there had been no news a footman served coffee then left them alone thomson said i didnt want to say this in front of lady walden but i think we may have a clue to the identity of the traitor walden went cold thomson said last night i interviewed bridget callahan the cork street landlady im afraid i got nothing out of her however i left my men to search her house this morning they showed me what they had found he took from his pocket an envelope which had been torn in half and handed the two pieces to walden walden saw with a shock that the envelope bore the walden hall crest thomson said do you recognize the handwriting walden turned the pieces over the envelope was addressed mr f kschessinsky co cork street london n walden said oh dear god not charlotte he wanted to cry thomson was silent she led him here walden said my own daughter he stared at the envelope willing it to disappear the handwriting was quite unmistakable like a juvenile version of his own script look at the postmark thomson said she wrote it as soon as she arrived here it was mailed from the village how could this happen walden said thomson made no reply feliks was the man in the tweed cap walden said it all fits he felt hopelessly sad almost bereaved as if someone dear to him had died he looked out over his park at trees planted fifty years ago by his father at a lawn that had been cared for by his family for a hundred years and it all seemed worthless worthless he said quietly you fight for your country and you are betrayed from within by socialists and revolutionists you fight for your class and youre betrayed by liberals you fight for your family and even they betray you charlotte why charlotte why he felt a choking sensation what a damnable life this is thomson what a damnable life ill have to interview her thomson said so will i walden stood up he looked at his cigar it had gone out he threw it away lets go in they went in in the hall walden stopped a maid do you know where lady charlotte is i believe shes in her room my lord shall i go and see yes tell her i wish to speak to her in her room immediately very good mlord thomson and walden waited in the hall walden looked around the marble floor the carved staircase the stucco ceiling the perfect proportionsworthless a footman drifted by silently eyes lowered a motorcycle messenger came in and headed for the octagon pritchard crossed the hall and picked up the letters for posting from the hall table just as he must have the day charlottes treacherous letter to feliks was written the maid came down the stairs lady charlotte is ready to see you my lord walden and thomson went up charlottes room was on the second floor at the front of the house looking over the park it was sunny and light with pretty fabrics and modern furniture its a long time since ive been in here walden thought vaguely you look rather fierce papa charlotte said ive reason to be walden replied mr thomson has just given me the most dreadful piece of news of my whole life charlotte frowned thomson said lady charlotte where is feliks charlotte turned white ive no idea of course walden said dont be so damned cool how dare you swear at me i beg your pardon thomson said perhaps if youd leave it to me my lord very well walden sat down in the window seat thinking how did i find myself apologizing thomson addressed charlotte lady charlotte im a policeman and i can prove that you have committed conspiracy to murder now my concern and your fathers is to let this go no further and in particular to ensure that you will not have to go to jail for a period of many years walden stared at thomson jail surely hes merely frightening her but no he realized with a sense of overwhelming dread hes right shes a criminal thomson went on as long as we can prevent the murder we feel we can cover up your participation but if the assassin succeeds i will have no option but to bring you to trialand then the charge will not be conspiracy to murder but accessory to murder in theory you could be hanged no walden shouted involuntarily yes thomson said quietly walden buried his face in his hands thomson said you must save yourself that agonyand not only yourself but your mama and papa you must do everything in your power to help us find feliks and save prince orlov it could not be walden thought desperately he felt as if he were going insane my daughter could not be hanged but if aleks is killed charlotte will have been one of the murderers but it would never come to trial who was home secretary mckenna walden did not know him but asquith would intervene to prevent a prosecution wouldnt he thomson said tell me when you last saw feliks walden watched charlotte waiting for her response she stood behind a chair gripping its back with both hands her knuckles showed white but her face appeared calm finally she spoke i have nothing to tell you walden groaned aloud how could she continue to be like this now that she was found out what was going on in her mind she seemed a stranger he thought when did i lose her do you know where feliks is now thomson asked her she said nothing have you warned him of our security precautions here she looked blank how is he armed nothing each time you refuse to answer a question you become a little more guilty do you realize that walden noticed a change of tone in thomsons voice and looked at him he seemed genuinely angry now let me explain something to you thomson said you may think that your papa can save you from justice he is perhaps thinking the same thing but if orlov dies i swear to you that i will bring you to trial for murder now think about that thomson left the room charlotte was dismayed to see him go with a stranger in the room she had just about managed to keep her composure alone with papa she was afraid she would break down ill save you if i can papa said sadly charlotte swallowed thickly and looked away i wish hed be angry she thought i could cope with that he looked out of the window im responsible you see he said painfully i chose your mother i fathered you and i brought you up youre nothing but what ive made you i cant understand how this has happened i really cant he looked back at her can you explain it to me please yes i can she said she was eager to make him understand and she was sure he would if she could tell it right i dont want you to succeed in making russia go to war because if you do millions of innocent russians will be killed or wounded to no purpose he looked surprised is that it he said is that why youve done these awful things is that what feliks is trying to achieve perhaps he will understand she thought joyfully yes she said she went on enthusiastically feliks also wants a revolution in russiaeven you might think that could be a good thingand he believes it will begin when the people there find out that aleks has been trying to drag them into war do you think i want a war he said incredulously do you think i would like it do you think it would do me any good of course notbut youd let it happen under certain circumstances everyone wouldeven feliks who wants a revolution you tell me and if theres to be a war we must win it is that an evil thing to say his tone was almost pleading she was desperate for him to understand i dont know whether its evil but i do know its wrong the russian peasants know nothing of european politics and they care less but they will be shot to pieces and have their legs blown off and all awful things like that because you made an agreement with aleks she fought back tears papa cant you see thats wrong but think of it from the british point of viewfrom your own personal point of view imagine that freddie chalfont and peter and jonathan go to war as officers and their men are daniel the groom and peter the stable lad and jimmy the bootboy and charles the footman and peter dawkins from the home farmwouldnt you want them to get some help wouldnt you be glad that the whole of the russian nation was on their side of courseespecially if the russian nation had chosen to help them but they wont choose will they papa you and aleks will choose you should be working to prevent war not to win it if germany attacks france we have to help our friends and it would be a disaster for britain if germany conquered europe how could there be a bigger disaster than a war should we never fight then only if were invaded if we dont fight the germans in france well have to fight them here are you sure its likely when it happens then we should fight listen this country hasnt been invaded for eight hundred and fifty years why because weve fought other people on their territory not ours that is why you lady charlotte walden grew up in a peaceful and prosperous country how many wars were fought to prevent war if we had not fought on other peoples territory would they have fought at all who knows he said wearily i wish you had studied more history i wish you and i had talked more about this sort of thing with a son i would havebut lord i never dreamed my daughter would be interested in foreign policy and now im paying the price for that mistake what a price charlotte i promise you that the arithmetic of human suffering is not as straightforward as this feliks has led you to believe could you not believe me when i tell you that could you not trust me no she said stubbornly feliks wants to kill your cousin does that make no difference hes going to kidnap aleks not kill him papa shook his head charlotte hes tried twice to kill aleks and once to kill me he has killed many people in russia hes not a kidnapper charlotte hes a murderer i dont believe you but why he said plaintively did you tell me the truth about suffragism did you tell me the truth about annie did you tell me that in democratic britain most people still cant vote did you tell me the truth about sexual intercourse no i didnt to her horror charlotte saw that his cheeks were wet with tears it may be that everything i ever did as a father was mistaken i didnt know the world would change the way it has i had no idea of what a womans role would be in the world of it begins to look as if i have been a terrible failure but i did what i thought best for you because i loved you and i still do its not your politics that are making me cry its the betrayal you see i mean i shall fight tooth and nail to keep you out of the courts even if you do succeed in killing poor aleks because youre my daughter the most important person in the world to me for you i will let justice and reputation and england go to hell i would do wrong for you without a moments hesitation for me you come above all principles all politics everything thats how it is in families what hurts me so much is that you will not do the same for me will you she wanted desperately to say yes will you be loyal to me for all that i may be in the wrong just because i am your father but youre not she thought she bowed her head she could not look at him they sat in silence for a minute then papa blew his nose he got up and went to the door he took the key out of the lock and went outside he closed the door behind him charlotte heard him turn the key locking her in she burst into tears it was the second appalling dinner party lydia had given in two days she was the only woman at the table sir arthur was glum because his vast search operation had utterly failed to turn up feliks charlotte and aleks were locked in their rooms basil thomson and stephen were being icily polite to each other for thomson had found out about charlotte and feliks and had threatened to send charlotte to jail winston churchill was there he had brought the treaty with him and he and aleks had signed it but there was no rejoicing on that account for everyone knew that if aleks were to be assassinated then the czar would refuse to ratify the deal churchill said that the sooner aleks was off english soil the better thomson said he would devise a secure route and arrange a formidable bodyguard and aleks could leave tomorrow everyone went to bed early for there was nothing else to do lydia knew she would not sleep everything was unresolved she had spent the afternoon in an indecisive haze drugged with laudanum trying to forget that feliks was there in her house aleks would leave tomorrow if only he could be kept safe for a few more hours she wondered whether there might be some way she could make feliks lie low for another day could she go to him and tell him a lie say that he would have his opportunity of killing aleks tomorrow night he would never believe her the scheme was hopeless but once she had conceived the idea of going to see feliks she could not get it out of her mind she thought out of this door along the passage up the stairs along another passage through the nursery through the closet and there she closed her eyes tightly and pulled the sheet up over her head everything was dangerous it was best to do nothing at all to be motionless paralyzed leave charlotte alone leave feliks alone forget aleks forget churchill but she did not know what was going to happen charlotte might go to stephen and say youre not my father stephen might kill feliks feliks might kill aleks charlotte might be accused of murder feliks might come here to my room and kiss me her nerves were bad again and she felt another headache coming on it was a very warm night the laudanum had worn off but she had drunk a lot of wine at dinner and she still felt woozy for some reason her skin was tender tonight and every time she moved the silk of her nightdress seemed to scrape her breasts she was irritable both mentally and physically she halfwished stephen would come to her then she thought no i couldnt bear it felikss presence in the nursery was like a bright light shining in her eyes keeping her awake she threw off the sheet got up and went to the window she opened it wider the breeze was hardly cooler than the air in the room leaning out and looking down she could see the twin lamps burning at the portico and the policeman walking along the front of the house his boots crunching distantly on the gravel drive what was feliks doing up there was he making a bomb loading a gun sharpening a knife or was he sleeping content to wait for the right moment or wandering around the house trying to find a way to get past alekss bodyguards theres nothing i can do she thought nothing she picked up her book it was hardys wessex poems why did i choose this she thought it opened at the page she had looked at that morning she turned up the nightlight sat down and read the whole poem it was called her dilemma the two were silent in a sunless church whose mildewed walls uneven pavingstones and wasted carvings passed antique research and nothing broke the clocks full monotones leaning against a wormy poppyhead so wan and worn that he could scarcely stand for he was soon to diehe softly said tell me you love meholding hard her hand she would have given a world to breathe yes truly so much his life seemed hanging on her mind and hence she lied her heart persuaded throughly twas worth her soul to be a moment kind but the sad need thereof his nearing death so mocked humanity that she shamed to prize a world conditioned thus or care for breath where nature such dilemmas could devise thats right she thought when life is like this who can do right her headache was so bad she thought her skull would split she went to the drawer and took a gulp from the bottle of laudanum then she took another gulp then she went to the nursery fifteen something had gone wrong feliks had not seen charlotte since midday when she had brought him a basin a jug of water a towel and a cake of soap there must have been some kind of trouble to keep her awayperhaps she had been forced to leave the house or perhaps she felt she might be under observation but she had not given him away evidently for here he was anyway he did not need her anymore he knew where orlov was and he knew where the guns were he was not able to get into orlovs room for the security seemed too good so he would have to make orlov come out he knew how to do that he had not used the soap and water because the little hideaway was too cramped to allow him to stand up straight and wash himself and anyway he did not care much about cleanliness but now he was very hot and sticky and he wanted to feel fresh before going about his work so he took the water out into the nursery it felt very strange to be standing in the place where charlotte had spent so many hours of her childhood he put the thought out of his mind this was no time for sentiment he took off all his clothes and washed himself by the light of a single candle a familiar pleasant feeling of anticipation and excitement filled him and he felt as if his skin were glowing i shall win tonight he thought savagely no matter how many i have to kill he rubbed himself all over roughly with the towel his movements were jerky and there was a tight sensation in the back of his throat which made him want to shout this must be why warriors yell war cries he thought he looked down at his body and saw that he had the beginnings of an erection then he heard lydia say why youve grown a beard he spun around and stared into the darkness stupefied she came forward into the circle of candlelight her blond hair was unpinned and hung around her shoulders she wore a long pale nightdress with a fitted bodice and a high waist her arms were bare and white she was smiling they stood still looking at one another several times she opened her mouth to speak but no words came out feliks felt the blood rush to his loins how long he thought wildly how long since i stood naked before a woman she moved but it did not break the spell she stepped forward and knelt at his feet she closed her eyes and nuzzled his body as feliks looked down on her unseeing face candlelight glinted off the tears on her cheeks lydia was nineteen again and her body was young and strong and tireless the simple wedding was over and she and her new husband were in the little cottage they had taken in the country outside snow fell quietly in the garden they made love by candlelight she kissed him all over and he said i have always loved you all these years although it was only weeks since they had met his beard brushed her breasts although she could not remember his growing a beard she watched his hands busy all over her body in all the secret places and she said its you youre doing this to me its you feliks feliks as if there had ever been anyone else who did these things to her who gave her this rolling swelling pleasure with her long fingernail she scratched his shoulder she watched as the blood welled up then leaned forward and licked it greedily youre an animal he said they touched one another busily all the time they were like children let loose in a sweet shop moving restlessly from one thing to another touching and looking and tasting unable to believe in their astonishing good fortune she said im so glad we ran away together and for some reason that made him look sad so she said stick your finger up me and the sad look went and desire masked his face but she realized that she was crying and she could not understand why suddenly she realized that this was a dream and she was terrified of waking up so she said lets do it now quickly and they came together and she smiled through her tears and said we fit they seemed to move like dancers or courting butterflies and she said this is ever so nice dear jesus this is ever so nice and then she said i thought this would never happen to me again and her breath came in sobs he buried his face in her neck but she took his head in her hands and pushed it away so that she could see him now she knew that this was not a dream she was awake there was a taut string stretched between the back of her throat and the base of her spine and every time it vibrated her whole body sang a single note of pleasure which got louder and louder look at me she said as she lost control and he said gently im looking and the note got louder im wicked she cried as the climax hit her look at me im wicked and her body convulsed and the string got tighter and tighter and the pleasure more piercing until she felt she was losing her mind and then the last high note of joy broke the string and she slumped and fainted feliks laid her gently on the floor her face in the candlelight was peaceful all the tension gone she looked like one who had died happy she was pale but breathing normally she had been half asleep probably drugged feliks knew but he did not care he felt drained and weak and helpless and grateful and very much in love we could start again he thought shes a free woman she could leave her husband we could live in switzerland charlotte could join us this is not an opium dream he told himself he and lydia had made such plans before in st petersburg nineteen years ago and they had been utterly impotent against the wishes of respectable people it doesnt happen not in real life he thought they would frustrate us all over again they will never let me have her but i shall have my revenge he got to his feet and quickly put on his clothes he picked up the candle he looked at her once more her eyes were still closed he wanted to touch her once more to kiss her soft mouth he hardened his heart never again he thought he turned and went through the door he walked softly along the carpeted corridor and down the stairs his candle made weird moving shadows in the doorways i may die tonight but not before i have killed orlov and walden he thought i have seen my daughter i have lain with my wife now i will kill my enemies and then i can die on the secondfloor landing he stepped on a hard floor and his boot made a loud noise he froze and listened he saw that there was no carpet here but a marble floor he waited there was no noise from the rest of the house he took off his boots and went on in his bare feethe had no socks the lights were out all over the house would anyone be roaming around might someone come down to raid the larder feeling hungry in the middle of the night might a butler dream he heard noises and make a tour of the house to check might orlovs bodyguards need to go to the bathroom feliks strained his hearing ready to snuff out the candle and hide at the slightest noise he stopped in the hall and took from his coat pocket the plans of the house charlotte had drawn for him he consulted the groundfloor plan briefly holding the candle close to the paper then turned to his right and padded along the corridor he went through the library into the gun room he closed the door softly behind him and looked around a great hideous head seemed to leap at him from the wall and he jumped and grunted with fear the candle went out in the darkness he realized he had seen a tigers head stuffed and mounted on the wall he lit the candle again there were trophies all around the walls a lion a deer and even a rhinoceros walden had done some biggame hunting in his time there was also a big fish in a glass case feliks put the candle down on the table the guns were racked along one wall there were three pairs of doublebarreled shotguns a winchester rifle and something that feliks thought must be an elephant gun he had never seen an elephant gun he had never seen an elephant the guns were secured by a chain through their trigger guards feliks looked along the chain it was fastened by a large padlock to a bracket screwed into the wooden end of the rack feliks considered what to do he had to have a gun he thought he might be able to snap the padlock given a tough piece of iron such as a screwdriver to use as a lever but it seemed to him that it might be easier to unscrew the bracket from the wood of the rack and then pass chain padlock and bracket through the trigger guards to free the guns he looked again at charlottes plan next to the gun room was the flower room he picked up his candle and went through the communicating door he found himself in a small cold room with a marble table and a stone sink he heard a footstep he doused his candle and crouched down the sound had come from outside from the gravel path it had to be one of the sentries the light of a flashlight flickered outside feliks flattened himself against the door beside the window the light grew stronger and the footsteps became louder they stopped right outside and the flashlight shone in through the window by its light feliks could see a rack over the sink and a few tools hanging by hooks shears secateurs a small hoe and a knife the sentry tried the door against which feliks stood it was locked the footsteps moved away and the light went feliks waited a moment what would the sentry do presumably he had seen the glimmer of felikss candle but he might think it had been the reflection of his own torch or someone in the house might have had a perfectly legitimate reason to go into the flower room or the sentry might be the ultracautious type and come and check leaving the doors open feliks went from the flower room through the gun room and into the library feeling his way in the dark holding his unlit candle in his hand he sat on the floor in the library behind a big leather sofa and counted slowly to one thousand nobody came the sentry was not the cautious type he went back into the gun room and lit the candle the windows were heavily curtained herethere had been no curtains in the flower room he went cautiously into the flower room took the knife he had seen over the rack came back into the gun room and bent over the gun rack he used the blade of the knife to undo the screws that held the bracket to the wood of the rack the wood was old and hard but eventually the screws came loose and he was able to unchain the guns there were three cupboards in the room one held bottles of brandy and whiskey together with glasses another held bound copies of a magazine called horse and hound and a huge leatherbound ledger marked game book the third was locked that must be where the ammunition was kept feliks broke the lock with the garden knife of the three types of guns availablewinchester shotgun or elephant gunhe preferred the winchester however as he searched through the boxes of ammunition he realized there were no cartridges here either for the winchester or for the elephant gun those weapons must have been kept as souvenirs he had to be content with a shotgun all three pairs were twelvebore and all the ammunition consisted of cartridges of numbersix shot to be sure of killing his man he would have to fire at close rangeno more than twenty yards to be absolutely certain and he would have only two shots before reloading still he thought i only want to kill two people the image of lydia lying on the nursery floor kept coming back to him when he thought of how they had made love he felt exultant he no longer felt the fatalism which had gripped him immediately afterward why should i die he thought and when i have killed walden who knows what might happen then he loaded the gun and now lydia thought i shall have to kill myself she saw no other possibility she had descended to the depths of depravity for the second time in her life all her years of selfdiscipline had come to nothing just because feliks had returned she could not live with the knowledge of what she was she wanted to die now she considered how it might be done what could she take that was poisonous there must be rat poison somewhere on the premises but of course she did not know where an overdose of laudanum she was not sure she had enough you could kill yourself with gas she recalled but stephen had converted the house to electric light she wondered whether the top stories were high enough for her to die by jumping from a window she was afraid she might merely break her back and be paralyzed for years she did not think she had the courage to slash her wrists and besides it would take so long to bleed to death the quickest way would be to shoot herself she thought she could probably load a gun and fire it she had seen it done innumerable times but she remembered the guns were locked up then she thought of the lake yes that was the answer she would go to her room and put on a robe then she would leave the house by a side door so that the policemen should not see her and she would walk across the west side of the park beside the rhododendrons and through the woods until she came to the waters edge then she would just keep walking until the cool water closed over her head then she would open her mouth and a minute or so later it would be all over she left the nursery and walked along the corridor in the dark she saw a light under charlottes door and hesitated she wanted to see her little girl one last time the key was in the lock on the outside she unlocked the door and went in charlotte sat in a chair by the window fully dressed but asleep her face was pale but for the redness around her eyes she had unpinned her hair lydia closed the door and went over to her charlotte opened her eyes whats happened she said nothing lydia said she sat down charlotte said do you remember when nannie went away yes you were old enough for a governess and i didnt have another baby i had forgotten all about it for years ive just remembered you never knew did you that i thought nannie was my mother i dont know did you think so you always called me mama and her nannie yes charlotte spoke slowly almost desultorily as if she were lost in the fog of distant memory you were mama and nannie was nannie but everybody had a mother you see and when nannie said you were my mother i said dont be silly nannie you are my mother and nannie just laughed then you sent her away i was brokenhearted i never realized marya never told you of coursewhat governess would charlotte was just repeating the memory not accusing her mother just explaining something she went on so you see i have the wrong mother and now i have the wrong father too the new thing made me remember the old i suppose lydia said you must hate me i understand i hate myself i dont hate you mama ive been dreadfully angry toward you but ive never hated you but you think im a hypocrite not even that a feeling of peace came over lydia charlotte said im beginning to understand why youre so fiercely respectable why you were so determined that i should never know anything of sex you just wanted to save me from what happened to you and ive found out that there are hard decisions and that sometimes one cant tell whats good and right to do and i think ive judged you harshly when i had no right to judge you at all and im not very proud of myself do you know that i love you yes and i love you mama and thats why i feel so wretched lydia was dazed this was the last thing she had expected after all that had happenedthe lies the treachery the anger the bitternesscharlotte still loved her she was suffused with a kind of tranquil joy kill myself she thought why should i kill myself we should have talked like this before lydia said oh youve no idea how much i wanted to charlotte said you were always so good at telling me how to curtsy and carry my train and sit down gracefully and put up my hair and i longed for you to explain important things to me in the same wayabout falling in love and having babiesbut you never did i never could lydia said i dont know why charlotte yawned i think ill sleep now she stood up lydia kissed her cheek then embraced her charlotte said i love feliks too you know that hasnt changed i understand said lydia i do too good night mama good night lydia went out quickly and closed the door behind her she hesitated outside what would charlotte do if the door were left unlocked lydia decided to save her the anxiety of the decision she turned the key in the lock she went down the stairs heading for her own room she was so glad she had talked to charlotte perhaps she thought this family could be mended after all ive no idea how but surely it might be done she went into her room where have you been said stephen now that feliks had a weapon all he had to do was get orlov out of his room he knew how to do that he was going to burn the house down carrying the gun in one hand and the candle in the other he walkedstill barefootthrough the west wing and across the hall into the drawing room just a few more minutes he thought give me just a few more minutes and i will be done he passed through two dining rooms and a serving room and entered the kitchens here charlottes plans became vague and he had to search for the way out he found a large roughhewn door closed with a bar he lifted the bar and quietly opened the door he put out his candle and waited in the doorway after a minute or so he found he could just about make out the outlines of the buildings that was a relief he was afraid to use the candle outside because of the sentries in front of him was a small cobbled courtyard on its far side if the plan was right there was a garage a workshop anda petroleum tank he crossed the yard the building in front of him had once been a barn he guessed part of it was enclosedthe workshop perhapsand the rest was open he could vaguely make out the great round headlamps of two large cars where was the fuel tank he looked up the building was quite high he stepped forward and something hit his forehead it was a length of flexible pipe with a nozzle at the end it hung down from the upper part of the building it made sense they put the cars in the barn and the petroleum tank in the hayloft they simply drove the cars into the courtyard and filled them with fuel from the pipe good he thought now he needed a container a twogallon can would be ideal he entered the garage and walked around the cars feeling with his feet careful not to stumble over anything noisy there were no cans he recalled the plans again he was close to the kitchen garden there might be a watering can in that region he was about to go and look when he heard a sniff he froze the policeman went by feliks could hear the beat of his own heart the light from the policemans oil lamp meandered around the courtyard did i shut the kitchen door feliks thought in a panic the lamp shone on the door it looked shut the policeman went on feliks realized he had been holding his breath and he let it out in a long sigh he gave the policeman a minute to get some distance away then he went in the same direction looking for the kitchen garden he found no cans there but he stumbled over a coil of hose he estimated its length at about a hundred feet it gave him a wicked idea first he needed to know how frequently the policeman patrolled he began to count still counting he carried the garden hose back to the courtyard and concealed it and himself behind the motor cars he had reached nine hundred and two when the policeman came around again he had about fifteen minutes he attached one end of the hose to the nozzle of the petroleum pipe then walked across the courtyard paying out the hose as he went he paused in the kitchen to find a sharp meat skewer and to relight his candle then he retraced his steps through the house laying the hose through the kitchen the serving room the dining rooms the drawing room the hall and the passage and into the library the hose was heavy and it was difficult to do the job silently he listened all the while for footsteps but all he heard was the noise of an old house settling down for the night everyone was in bed he was sure but would someone come down to get a book from the library or a glass of brandy from the drawing room or a sandwich from the kitchen if that were to happen now he thought the game would be up just a few more minutesjust a few more minutes he had been worried about whether the hose would be long enough but it just reached through the library door he walked back following the hose making holes in it every few yards with the sharp point of the meat skewer he went out through the kitchen door and stood in the garage he held his shotgun twohanded like a club he seemed to wait an age at last he heard footsteps the policeman passed him and stopped shining his torch on the hose and gave a grunt of surprise feliks hit him with the gun the policeman staggered feliks hissed fall down damn you and hit him again with all his might the policeman fell down and feliks hit him again with savage satisfaction the man was still feliks turned to the petroleum pipe and found the place where the hose was connected there was a tap to stop and start the flow of petroleum feliks turned on the tap before we were married lydia said impulsively i had a lover good lord said stephen why did i say that she thought because lying about it has made everyone unhappy and im finished with all that she said my father found out about it he had my lover jailed and tortured he said that if i would agree to marry you the torture would stop immediately and that as soon as you and i had left for england my lover would be released from jail she watched his face he was not as hurt as she had expected but he was horrified he said your father was wicked i was wicked to marry without love oh now stephen looked pained for that matter i wasnt in love with you i proposed to you because my father had died and i needed a wife to be countess of walden it was later that i fell so desperately in love with you id say i forgive you but theres nothing to forgive could it be this easy she thought might he forgive me everything and go on loving me it seemed that because death was in the air anything was possible she found herself plunging on theres more to be told she said and its worse his expression was painfully anxious youd better tell me i was i was already with child when i married you stephen paled charlotte lydia nodded silently she shes not mine no oh god now i have hurt you she thought this you never dreamed she said oh stephen i am so dreadfully sorry he stared at her not mine he said stupidly not mine she thought of how much it meant to him more than anyone else the english nobility talked about breeding and bloodlines she remembered him looking at charlotte and murmuring bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh it was the only verse of the bible she had ever heard him quote she thought of her own feelings of the mystery of the child starting life as part of oneself and then becoming a separate individual but never completely separate it must be the same for men she thought sometimes one thinks it isnt but it must be his face was gray and drawn he looked suddenly older he said why are you telling me this now i cant she thought i cant reveal any more ive hurt him so much already but it was as if she was on a downhill slope and could not stop she blurted because charlotte has met her real father and she knows everything oh the poor child stephen buried his face in his hands lydia realized that his next question would be who is the father she was overcome by panic she could not tell him that it would kill him but she needed to tell him she wanted the weight of these guilty secrets to be lifted forever dont ask she thought not yet its too much he looked up at her his face was frighteningly expressionless he looked like a judge she thought impassively pronouncing sentence and she was the guilty prisoner in the dock dont ask he said and the father is feliks of course she gasped he nodded as if her reaction was all the confirmation he needed what will he do she thought fearfully she watched his face but she could not read his expression he was like a stranger to her he said oh dear god in heaven what have we done lydia was suddenly garrulous he came along just when she was beginning to see her parents as frail human beings of course and there he was full of life and ideas and iconoclasm just the kind of thing to enchant an independentminded young girl i know something like that happened to me and so she got to know him and became fond of him and helped him but she loves you stephen shes yours in that way people cant help loving you cant help it his face was wooden she wished he would curse or cry or abuse her or even beat her but he sat there looking at her with that judges face and said and you did you help him not intentionally no but i havent helped you either i am such a hateful evil woman he stood up and held her shoulders his hands were cold as the grave he said but are you mine i wanted to be stepheni really did he touched her cheek but no love showed in his face she shuddered she said i told you it was too much to forgive he said do you know where feliks is she made no reply if i tell she thought it will be like killing feliks if i dont tell it will be like killing stephen you do know he said she nodded dumbly will you tell me she looked into his eyes if i tell him she thought will he forgive me stephen said choose she felt as if she were falling headlong into a pit stephen raised his eyebrows expectantly lydia said hes in the house good god where lydias shoulders slumped it was done she had betrayed feliks for the last time hes been hiding in the nursery she said dejectedly his expression was no longer wooden his cheeks colored and his eyes blazed with fury lydia said say you forgive me please he turned around and ran from the room feliks ran through the kitchen and through the serving room carrying his candle the shotgun and his matches he could smell the sweet slightly nauseating vapor of petrol in the dining room a thin steady jet was spouting through a hole in the hosepipe feliks shifted the hose across the room so that the fire would not destroy it too quickly then struck a match and threw it on to a petrolsoaked patch of rug the rug burst into flames feliks grinned and ran on in the drawing room he picked up a velvet cushion and held it to another hole in the hosepipe for a minute he put the cushion down on a sofa set fire to it and threw some more cushions onto it they blazed merrily he ran across the hall and along the passage to the library here the petrol was gushing out of the end of the pipe and running over the floor feliks pulled handfuls of books off the shelves and threw them on the floor into the spreading puddle then he crossed the room and opened the communicating door to the gun room he stood in the doorway for a moment then threw his candle into the puddle there was a noise like a huge gust of wind and the library caught fire books and petrol burned fiercely in a moment the curtains were ablaze then the seats and the paneling caught the petrol continued to pour out of the hosepipe feeding the fire feliks laughed aloud he turned into the gun room he stuffed a handful of extra cartridges into the pocket of his coat he went from the gun room into the flower room he unbolted the door to the garden opened it quietly and stepped out he walked directly west away from the house for two hundred paces containing his impatience then he turned south for the same distance and finally he walked east until he was directly opposite the main entrance to the house looking at it across the darkened lawn he could see the second police sentry standing in front of the portico illuminated by the twin lamps smoking a pipe his colleague lay unconscious perhaps dead in the kitchen courtyard feliks could see the flames in the windows of the library but the policeman was some distance away from there and he had not noticed them yet he would see them at any moment between feliks and the house about fifty yards from the portico was a big old chestnut tree feliks walked toward it across the lawn the policeman seemed to be looking more or less in felikss direction but he did not see him feliks did not care if he sees me he thought ill shoot him dead it doesnt matter now no one could stop the fire everyone will have to leave the house any minute now any minute now ill kill them both he came up behind the tree and leaned against it with the shotgun in his hands now he could see flames at the opposite end of the house in the dining room windows he thought what are they doing in there walden ran along the corridor to the bachelor wing and knocked on the door of the blue room where thomson was sleeping he went in what is it thomsons voice said from the bed walden turned on the light feliks is in the house good god thomson got out of bed how charlotte let him in walden said bitterly thomson was hastily putting on trousers and a jacket do we know where in the nursery have you got your revolver no but ive got three men with orlov remember ill peel two of them off and then take feliks im coming with you id rather dont argue walden shouted i want to see him die thomson gave a queer sympathetic look then ran out of the room walden followed they went along the corridor to alekss room the bodyguard outside the door stood up and saluted thomson thomson said its barrett isnt it yes sir whos inside bishop and anderson sir get them to open up barrett tapped on the door immediately a voice said password mississippi said barrett the door opened whats on charlie oh its you sir thomson said how is orlov sleeping like a baby sir walden thought lets get on with it thomson said feliks is in the house barrett and anderson come with me and his lordship bishop stay inside the room check that your pistols are loaded please all of you walden led the way along the bachelor wing and up the back stairs to the nursery suite his heart was pounding and he felt the curious mixture of fear and eagerness which had always come over him when he got a big lion in the sights of his rifle he pointed at the nursery door thomson whispered is there electric light in that room yes walden replied wheres the switch lefthand side of the door at shoulder height barrett and anderson drew their pistols walden and thomson stood on either side of the door out of the line of fire barrett threw open the door anderson dashed in and stepped to one side and barrett threw the light switch nothing happened walden looked into the room anderson and barrett were checking the school room and the bedrom a moment later barrett said no one here sir the nursery was bare and bright with light there was a bowl of dirty water on the floor and next to it a crumpled towel walden pointed to the closet door through there is a little attic barrett opened the closet door they all tensed barrett went through with his gun in his hand he came back a moment later he was there thomson scratched his head walden said we must search the house thomson said i wish we had more men well start with the west wing walden said come on they followed him out of the nursery and along the corridor to the staircase as they went down the stairs walden smelled smoke whats that he said thomson sniffed walden looked at barrett and anderson neither of them was smoking the smell became more powerful and now walden could hear a noise like wind in the trees suddenly he was filled with fear my house is on fire he shouted he raced down the stairs the hall was full of smoke walden ran across the hall and pushed open the door of the drawing room heat hit him like a blow and he staggered back the room was an inferno he despaired it could never be put out he looked along to the west wing and saw that the library was afire too he turned thomson was right behind him walden shouted my house is burning down thomson took his arm and pulled him back to the staircase anderson and barrett stood there walden found he could breathe and hear more easily in the center of the hall thomson was very cool and collected he began to give orders anderson go and wake up those two bobbies outside send one to find a garden hose and a tap send the other running to the village to telephone for a fire engine then run up the back stairs and through the servants quarters waking everyone tell them to get out the quickest way they can then gather on the front lawn to be counted barrett go wake up mr churchill and make sure he gets out ill fetch orlov walden you get lydia and charlotte move walden ran up the stairs and into lydias room she was sitting on the chaise longue in her nightdress and her eyes were red with weeping the house is on fire walden said breathlessly go out quickly on to the front lawn ill get charlotte then he thought of something the dinner bell no he said you get charlotte ill ring the bell he raced down the stairs again thinking why didnt i think of this before in the hall was a long silk rope which would ring bells all over the house to warn guests and servants that a meal was about to be served walden pulled on the rope and heard faintly the response of the bells from various parts of the house he noticed a garden hose trailing through the hall was somebody fighting the fire already he could not think who he kept on pulling the rope feliks watched anxiously the blaze was spreading too quickly already large areas of the second floor were burninghe could see the glow in the windows he thought come out you fools what were they doing he did not want to burn everyone in the househe wanted them to come out the policeman in the portico seemed to be asleep ill give the alarm myself feliks thought desperately i dont want the wrong people to die suddenly the policeman looked around his pipe fell out of his mouth he dashed into the porch and began to hammer on the door at last thought feliks now raise the alarm you fool the policeman ran around to a window and broke it just then the door opened and someone rushed out in a cloud of smoke its happening feliks thought he hefted the shotgun and peered through the darkness he could not see the face of the newcomer the man shouted something and the policeman ran off ive got to be able to see their faces feliks thought but if i go too close ill be seen too soon the newcomer rushed back into the house before feliks could recognize him ill have to get nearer feliks thought and take the chance he moved across the lawn within the house bells began to ring now they will come thought feliks lydia ran along the smokefilled corridor how could this happen so quickly in her room she had smelled nothing but now there were flames flickering underneath the doors of the bedrooms she passed the whole house must be blazing the air was too hot to breathe she reached charlottes room and turned the handle of the door of course it was locked she turned the key she tried again to open the door it would not move she turned the handle and threw her weight against the door something was wrong the door was jammed lydia began to scream and scream mama charlottes voice came from within the room lydia bit her lip hard and stopped screaming charlotte open the door i cant i cant i cant its locked ive unlocked it and it wont open and the house is on fire oh dear jesus help me help the door shook and the handle rattled as charlotte tried to open it from the inside mama yes mama stop screaming and listen carefully to methe floor has shifted and the door is wedged in its frameit will have to be broken downgo and fetch help i cant leave you mama go and get help or ill burn to death oh godall right lydia turned and ran choking toward the staircase walden was still ringing the bell through the smoke he saw aleks flanked by thomson and the third detective bishop coming down the stairs lydia and churchill and charlotte should be here too he thought then he realized that they might come down any one of several staircases the only place to check was out on the front lawn where everyone had been told to gather bishop shouted walden come here the detective ran across ring this keep going as long as you can bishop took the rope and walden followed aleks out of the house it was a very sweet moment for feliks he lifted the gun and walked toward the house orlov and another man walked toward him they had not yet seen him as they came closer walden appeared behind them like rats in a trap feliks thought triumphantly the man feliks did not know looked back over his shoulder and spoke to walden orlov was twenty yards away this is it feliks thought he put the stock of the gun to his shoulder aimed carefully at orlovs chest andjust as orlov opened his mouth to speakpulled the trigger a large black hole appeared in orlovs nightshirt as an ounce of numbersix shot about four hundred pellets tore into his body the other two men heard the bang and stared at feliks in astonishment blood gushed from orlovs chest and he fell backward i did it feliks thought exultantly i killed him now for the other tyrant he pointed the gun at walden dont move he yelled walden and the other man stood motionless they all heard a scream feliks looked in the direction from which the sound came lydia was running out of the house with her hair on fire feliks hesitated for a split second then he dashed toward her walden did the same as he ran feliks dropped the gun and tore off his coat he reached lydia a moment before walden he wrapped the coat around her head smothering the flames she pulled the coat off her head and yelled at them charlotte is trapped in her room walden turned and ran toward the house feliks ran with him lydia sobbing with fright saw thomson dart forward and pick up the shotgun feliks had dropped she watched in horror as thomson raised it and took aim at felikss back no she screamed she threw herself at thomson knocking him off balance the gun discharged into the ground thomson stared at her in bewilderment dont you know she shouted hysterically hes suffered enough charlottes carpet was smoldering she put her fist to her mouth and bit her knuckles to stop herself from screaming she ran to her washstand picked up the jug of water and threw it into the middle of the room it made more smoke not less she went to the window opened it and looked out smoke and flames poured out of the windows below her the wall of the house was faced with smooth stone there was no way to climb down if i have to ill jump it will be better than burning she thought the idea terrified her and she bit her knuckles again she ran to the door and shook the handle impotently somebody help quickly she screamed flames rose from the carpet and a hole appeared in the center of the floor she ran around the edge of the room to be near the window ready to jump she heard someone sobbing and realized it was she the hall was full of smoke feliks could hardly see he stayed close behind walden thinking not charlotte i wont let charlotte die not charlotte they ran up the staircase the whole second floor was ablaze the heat was terrific walden dashed through a wall of flame and feliks followed him walden stopped outside a door and was seized by a fit of coughing helpless he pointed at the door feliks rattled the handle and pushed the door with his shoulder it would not move he shook walden and shouted run at the door he and waldenstill coughingstood on the other side of the corridor facing the door feliks said now they threw themselves at the door together the wood split but the door stayed shut walden stopped coughing his face showed sheer terror again he shouted at feliks they stood against the opposite wall now they threw themselves at the door it cracked a little more from the other side of the door they heard charlotte scream walden gave a roar of anger he looked about him desperately he picked up a heavy oak chair feliks thought it was too heavy for walden to lift but walden raised it above his head and smashed it against the door the wood began to splinter in a frenzy of impatience feliks put his hands into the crack and began to tear at the splintered wood his fingers became slippery with blood he stood back and walden swung with the chair again again feliks pulled out the shards his hands were full of splinters he heard walden muttering something and realized it was a prayer walden swung the chair a third time the chair broke its seat and legs coming away from its back but there was a hole in the door big enough for feliksbut not for waldento crawl through feliks dragged himself through the hole and fell into the bedroom the floor was on fire and he could not see charlotte charlotte he shouted at the top of his voice here her voice came from the far side of the room feliks ran around the outside of the room where the fire was less she was sitting on the sill of the open window breathing in ragged gulps he picked her up by the waist and threw her over his shoulder he ran back around the edge of the room to the door walden reached through the door to take her walden put his head and one shoulder through the hole to take charlotte from feliks he could see that felikss face and hands were burned black and his trousers were on fire charlottes eyes were open and wide with terror behind feliks the floor began to collapse walden got one arm beneath charlottes body feliks seemed to stagger walden withdrew his head put his other arm through the hole and got his hand under charlottes armpit flames licked around her nightdress and she screamed walden said all right papas got you suddenly he was taking her entire weight he drew her through the hole she fainted and went limp as he pulled her out the bedroom floor fell in and walden saw felikss face as feliks dropped into the inferno walden whispered may god have mercy on your soul then he ran downstairs lydia was held in an iron grip by thomson who would not let her go into the blazing house she stood staring at the door willing the two men to appear with charlotte a figure appeared who was it it came closer it was stephen he was carrying charlotte thomson let lydia go she ran to them stephen laid charlotte gently on the grass lydia stared at him in a panic she said whatwhat shes not dead stephen said just fainted lydia got down on the grass cradled charlottes head in her lap and felt her chest beneath her left breast there was a strong heartbeat oh my baby lydia said stephen sat beside her she looked at him his trousers had burned and his skin was black and blistered but he was alive she looked toward the door stephen saw her glance lydia became aware that churchill and thomson were standing near listening stephen took lydias hand he saved her he said then he passed her to me then the floor fell in hes dead lydias eyes filled with tears stephen saw and squeezed her hand he said i saw his face as he fell i dont think ill ever forget it as long as i live you see his eyes were open and he was conscious buthe wasnt frightened in fact he looked satisfied the tears streamed down lydias face churchill spoke to thomson get rid of the body of orlov poor aleks lydia thought and she cried for him too thomson said incredulously what churchill said hide it bury it throw it into the fire i dont care how you do it i just want you to get rid of that body lydia stared at him aghast and through a film of tears she saw him take a sheaf of papers from the pocket of his dressing gown the agreement is signed churchill said the czar will be told that orlov died by accident in the fire that burned down walden hall orlov was not murdered do you understand there was no assassin he looked around at each of them with his aggressive pudgy face set in a fierce scowl there was never anybody called feliks stephen stood up and went over to where alekss body lay someone had covered his face lydia heard stephen say aleks my boy what am i going to say to your mother he bent down and folded the hands over the hole in the chest lydia looked at the fire burning down all those years of history consuming the past stephen came over and stood beside her he whispered there was never anybody called feliks she looked up at him behind him the sky in the east was pearly gray soon the sun
