chapter one a bad start to a birthday i wake up feeling sick this is partly because i drank so much wine with my friends last night but mostly because todays my thirtieth birthday thirty years old i cant believe it i just cant believe it how can i be thirty ok ok i know thirty isnt exactly old but its a lot older than twentynine believe me you see i had a long list of things i wanted to do before i was thirty actually now ive got two lists my original list and a new one because three weeks ago my life changed forever but ill tell you about that in a moment here are the lists list one travel around the world write a bestselling book buy a house or a flat preferably with a garden and a sea view give up smoking give up headaches due to drinking too much give up problem boyfriends go skiing this christmas instead of visiting my family list two have a conversation with brad courtney lasting longer than five minutes and without my knees shaking get through a whole day at work without annoying brad courtney with my careless mistakes tell my boyfriend barry i do not want to go out with him any more tell brad courtney i love him get married to brad courtney go skiing this christmas with brad courtney have brad courtneys children preferably a girl and a boy both with his beautiful dark eyes by now i think you will have guessed that three weeks ago i met brad courtney and fell madly in love with him you might also have guessed that hes not in love with me yet i work for brad or at least i do while his assistant june weatherby is in hospital june broke her leg when she fell off a horse i wouldnt want you to think im happy that shes lying in pain in her bed at the hospital because im not of course however i am very happy that her accident has given me the chance to work for brad if junes horse had been a calm sort of horse instead of a wild one called flame then id never have met brad and id never have fallen in love with him i work for a temp agency you see they find temporary staff for people like brad ive never had a job for longer than two months and most of them are only for two or three weeks sometimes even one week i like the variety the different people and the different work or at least i used to now i think id be happy to stay at the courtney art gallery forever brad oh brad i know it must be almost time to get up but as its my birthday im allowing myself to stay in bed for a little longer to dream about him brads so handsome so clever so important hes also so attached to his perfect girlfriend tania life just isnt fair after a while i carefully open my eyes and look at the clock five past ten five past ten im an hour late i jump out of bed and quickly get dressed brad courtney might be handsome clever and important but he also has a habit of being cross im in serious trouble again in the three weeks ive been working at the art gallery ive already been late four times and how will i ever marry brad and have his children if he asks me to leave my job and i never see him again shoes shoes i cry as i run from the bedroom trying to brush my hair and button up my blouse at the same time almost tripping over as i go the living rooms untidy with the remains of the small party i held last night there are wine glasses wine bottles chocolate papers but no shoes think alex think i tell myself holding my head then i see one shoe underneath the sofa one shoe wheres the other one oh hell i go back into the bedroom with one shoe on and eventually find the other one hiding under the bed i quickly put it on and run to the front door theres a pile of birthday cards on the doormat and i pick them up and run to catch the bus i often walk to work it takes about twenty minutes or so but its a nice walk through the park and then along the seafront into the centre of brighton i like it at all times of the year last winter there was even snow on the beach but this morning theres no time for a pleasant walk and luckily for me theres a bus coming down the hill i put my hand out to stop it where are you going love the bus driver smiles at me so do the other passengers either everyones being very friendly or i look down at my clothes and realise my coats buttoned up wrongly on one side its dragging on the floor and on the other side its lifted up to my knees i smile at everybody pretending to be perfectly happy to wear my coat like that and take a seat right at the back of the bus then i sigh and close my eyes what a way to start a birthday tired ill embarrassed and late for work still at least ive been sent plenty of birthday cards unless theyre all christmas cards and everybodys forgotten my birthday the first one i open is a birthday card from my brother rob i cant think of you as being thirty it says on the front and inside is without dying of laughter theres a badge attached to the front thirty today it says well i wont be wearing that the card from mum and dad isnt much better theres a note inside written in mums untidy handwriting thirty years old i cant believe so much time has passed it almost makes me feel old fantastic i search the pile of envelopes to find a card that might be a bit more cheerful and recognise the handwriting of my friend susan beauty queen it says on the front of the card thats better even if it isnt true i suppose im almost pretty but im certainly not beautiful especially when ive got a headache and i havent had time to put any makeup on i open the card wishing you all you wish for yourself in the year ahead susan has written frowning i put the cards back into my bag my friends have very clear ideas about what they want from life susan wants to be an office manager diana wants to save the world and kerry wants to be a famous dancer they all care about their work a lot whereas i just do a little of this and a little of that without ever getting very far perhaps its time to change all that perhaps i should make up my mind to do the things on both my lists in the year ahead yes why not after all i might not be interested in being an office manager or a dancer but i am interested in brad courtney very interested ok so ive only known him for three weeks but what difference does that make i fell in love with him at first sight at the job interview yes this time next year ill be married to brad ill also be finishing off my bestselling book before going on a skiing holiday over christmas with brad and while were on holiday well try to make a baby no two babies twins a son and daughter a little brad and a little bradette werent you getting off here love the bus driver calls out to me kindly and i get quickly to my feet oh yes yes thank you how can i have been so busy with my daydreams that i almost travelled past my bus stop arent i late enough already have a good day love the driver says just before the bus doors close and looking back i see hes laughing the courtney art gallery is in ship street just off the seafront when i get there its almost half past ten i stop a few metres away and take a few deep breaths then i walk up to the door but the door wont open the gallerys locked amazed i stand there and look through the window the gallery is never closed on monday mornings wheres brad i stand there worrying for a while and then suddenly i see a familiar face next to mine in the glass brad i turn my face going red as it often does when im near him oh how i wish it didnt but hes so attractive and i like him so much it makes me feel nervous and when i feel nervous i either cant think of anything to say or i say the wrong thing and end up looking stupid today though im too worried about brad to think about myself he looks tired and ill and his face is very pale im so sorry alex he is saying youve been here since nine oclock er i say wondering whether i should explain about being late myself it was very good of you to wait he continues and i shut up well it wont harm anyone if he thinks ive been waiting outside the gallery for one and a half hours will it and hell never know i was late come on he says ill buy you a coffee to apologise er thanks i say but hes already walking quickly away i run after him wondering whether i should ask what has happened or whether i should just wait until he tells me but what if he doesnt tell me ill die of curiosity er i say running after him along the street is everything all right no he answers walking quickly on oh i say and because i cant think of anything else to say after that i remain quiet until were seated at a table in the sea view cafe at the end of the street we order coffee and when it arrives brad drinks his silently for a while before looking at me across the table alex he says seriously i have a very important question to ask you i swallow feeling nervous again hes going to ask me out to dinner he is brad courtneys going to ask me out on a date perhaps he knows its my birthday yyes i say in a shaking voice and he looks at me with his beautiful dark eyes why are you wearing one black shoe and one white shoe he asks what i say for a long moment i dont understand him and then he begins to laugh loudly i look nervously down at my feet and see that its true on my left foot im wearing a black shoe and on my right foot im wearing a white shoe i remember the laughter of the bus driver and the smiles of the other passengers and i understand suddenly why they were so amused oh no i groan putting down my coffee cup i close my eyes covering my face with my hands brads still laughing and for a horrible moment i imagine myself at our wedding there i am at the church in a white wedding dress im walking with my father towards brad and all the guests are turning to look at me brad turns to look at me too smiling then suddenly he starts to laugh exactly as hes laughing now i look down at my feet there they are at the bottom of my beautiful wedding dress one in a white shoe and the other in a black shoe and suddenly all the guests are laughing even the priests laughing and my face is turning bright red oh thats so funny brads saying now thank you alex youve quite cheered me up all right i say my face really red now is it the latest fashion he asks if i go back outside will i see other people wearing different coloured shoes one red shoe and one brown shoe perhaps or what about one green and one blue he begins to laugh again and i sit and look at him i try to make myself hate him but i cant do why were you late this morning i ask and immediately he stops laughing and drinks some more of his coffee before he can answer the cafe door opens bringing in both a man and the wind straight from the sea i recognise the man its arthur grant one of the gallery artists he paints landscapes and is one of brads most successful clients this is probably one of the reasons why brads always so friendly towards him arthur brads calling out to him good to see you let me buy you a coffee arthur grant is never a happy man but today he looks angry as well as unhappy where have you been he demands ive been trying to get into the gallery ever since nine oclock this morning there was nobody there brad looks at me across the table my face goes red again im so sorry arthur brad says staff problems quite unavoidable please sit down and have a coffee no thank you arthur says coldly i only came to tell you i wont be showing my paintings next month after all what brad gasps i wont be showing my paintings at the courtney art gallery next month or anyother month there you are ive told you good day arthur turns away but arthur brad calls after him arthur but arthur grant has already gone now its brads turn to cover his face with his hands i dont believe this he groans how bad can a day get theres silence for a while and then stupidly i decide to speak i wonder why hes decided to cancel the exhibition brad looks at me and immediately i wish i had remained silent exactly what time did you arrive at work today alex he asks i look down at the table oh er more or less just before i arrived myself brad helps me out and i nod my head miserably theres silence for a while then finally brad speaks come back june weatherby he says cruelly please he finishes his coffee and walks to the door take the rest of the day off he says and alex make sure you get an early night tonight wont you then he turns and walks from the cafe leaving me to pay the bill chapter two a bit about my peculiar family i hate june weatherby she reminds me of a girl who used to be in my class at school helen peters we children used to call her saint helen because she was so perfect at everything the teachers all loved her and somehow i know june weatherbys school teachers loved her too i also know that neither june weatherby nor saint helen would ever leave the house wearing different coloured shoes by now its eleven oclock i pay for the coffee and leave the cafe brads nowhere to be seen and for a moment i wait on the pavement wondering what to do with my unexpected day off work i dont actually want a day off you see yes i know that sounds crazy most people would be celebrating but all it means to me is a whole day of not being with brad even brad laughing at my mistakes is better than no brad at all a cold december winds blowing straight off the sea its not a day to be standing around so finally i start to walk towards home along the seafront all the big old hotels are in this part of the town they were built almost a hundred and fifty years ago when brighton first became a popular place for holidays and they still look good today especially with all their christmas decorations up i suppose the grand hotels a bit ridiculous but i do like it actually ive always thought it looks a bit like a big white cake a big white wedding cake oh how i wish i was the sort of girl who wakes up on time every morning the sort of girl who always has a tidy flat and cupboards full of clean clothes someone who can cook delicious meals and organise perfect parties that type of girl would be really useful at the courtney art gallery so useful in fact that brad courtney wouldnt be able to imagine life without her alex hi im so full of miserable thoughts that i dont see my friend diana until ive almost walked into her shes standing outside the grand hotel holding a huge bunch of flowers thats her job you see delivering flowers her delivery vans parked on the road it has a picture on the side of a man and a woman kissing kiss flowers it says for that perfect someone in your life happy birthday i try to smile thanks diana are those flowers for me only if your names kitten she smiles kitten i ask thats what it says on the card to kitten from puppy diana tells me i can tell what diana thinks she hates kiss flowers and is embarrassed to drive the van around shes only doing the flower delivery job to save some money so she can travel to africa to study rare animals i think its lovely i say and she frowns at me dont tell me she says youre thinking about that brad courtney arent you youre wishing he would send you some kiss flowers i bet youd like him to call you kitten if you met him youd understand i tell her hes so so perfect so fantastic yes i know youve told me several times before anyway why arent you at work i frown remembering the mystery of the locked gallery i dont know i say brad gave me the day off the gallerys closed diana doesnt think this is anything to worry about wonderful she says you can do something really special on your birthday what i ask miserably feeling sorry for myself everyone else is at work go shopping diana suggests no money well go swimming then she tries again no energy no money and no energy ok diana thinks for a while i know i could give you a lift to rottingdean thats where my next flower delivery is you could visit your mother i think about it for a while wondering if this is really how i want to spend my birthday and then i sigh all right then thanks ok just let me deliver these flowers to kitten and ill be right with you here you can wait in the van diana hands me the van keys and disappears inside the hotel at this point i think id better tell you something about my parents you see i love them both very much but theyre not exactly relaxing people in fact theyre both a bit crazy crazy and unusual they dont live their lives the way other people live their lives they dont even think the way other people think actually its probably a good idea for you to meet them because then youll understand why i sometimes find life so difficult myself one of my first memories ever is of a school sports day when i was about six years old there was a school sports day every summer we children ran in races and our parents came to watch all the mothers wore nice summer dresses with flower patterns on them and summer shoes my mother wore a flowerpatterned dress too but unfortunately she also wore flowers in her hair lots of them and she didnt wear any shoes none at all actually when i was six years old i thought she looked very pretty but i do still remember the other mothers looking at her and laughing thats when i first realised she was different to other mothers oh by the way mums name is willow a willow is a type of tree that often grows close to rivers dads name is moon moon is well you know what the moon is these are my parents earth names their real names are betty mum and jeff dad they chose their earth names two years ago because they said they wanted to feel closer to nature ive made it very clear to mum and dad that i dont want to have an earth name myself but i still see mum looking at me sometimes and i know shes thinking about names when im not there they probably call me star or wood but im quite happy with alex thank you i dont even like alexandra which is my full name my brother rob lets mum and dad call him tree but then he lives hundreds of kilometres away in scotland so he doesnt see them very often besides there arent any trees on the isle of skye where he lives so perhaps he feels his earth name is useful diana is coming back out of the hotel now to my surprise shes still holding kittens flowers happy birthday she says getting into the van and giving the flowers to me didnt kitten want them i ask and she laughs no she didnt she says starting the van in fact she told me she thought puppy was a dog she says shes given up men completely poor puppy i say burying my nose in the flowers to smell them but diana doesnt seem to care he probably only gave her flowers because he felt guilty about something she says i look at her as she turns the van round and we drive along the seafront towards the palace pier have you always hated men di i ask and she seems quite surprised who says i hate men i dont hate them i just well pity them i suppose theyre so weak compared to us women i laugh you just havent met the right men di thats all i tell her brad isnt weak at all diana smiles at me of course not i was forgetting all about the wonderful perfect strong mr courtney ha ha i know shes joking but i dont mind i like diana shes good for me because shes so confident ive never known her to have any doubts about anything she decided three years ago she wanted to study rare animals and shes been working hard to save the money ever since ill really miss her when she leaves next year come on she says now tell me exactly what makes brad courtney so perfect and dont just go on about his looks you know they dont count for me some of the most interesting animals are the most ugly well brad is rare like one of your rare animals there arent many men like him around come on alex try to tell me exactly what makes him so rare i sigh its so difficult to put into words di and theres no use saying that looks dont come into it because they do i dont know when brad enters a room its suddenly different id know he was there even if i was looking the other way its chemical diana still looks doubtful youre talking about lust not love alex you just want to take him to bed and make love to him i dont deny this because its true i do want brad to make love to me but it isnt all i want but those feelings of lust just dont last for long do they she continues which is fine if you can accept that if you got involved with brad it would just last for a few weeks but i know you youve probably got your wedding planned already you see how well my friends know me youve probably even thought of names for the children youre going to have with him people do meet fall in love and get married i object and she nods of course they do and maybe im wrong about brad but i dont think so you havent seen the way he looks at me sometimes di i try to explain its as if as if he sees right inside me and knows everything about me my face feels suddenly hot its as if he can see through my clothes diana sighs again ok she says i give up i tried to make you see sense but can see im wasting my time lets talk about something else your book have you started writing your book yet i pull a face youll remember item number two on list number one the bestselling book dianas always asking me if ive started to write it you see if writing a bestselling book was something diana wanted to do she would just sit down and do it she wouldnt just think about it for years as ive done no not yet i reply you should do she says i bet youd feel really good if you actually started to write it the van has now left the houses of brighton behind out of view far below us is the marina with its shops and boats and next to us are green fields in the holiday season people play games here but today the grass is empty rottingdean is six kilometres from brighton and in the summer this road is busy with tourists and opentop buses its fun to sit at the top of the bus with the wind blowing through your hair from the sea but i wont be catching an opentop bus home today its far too cold i sit quietly and think about what diana said about my book she might be wrong about brad but she is right about this i would feel good if i started to write it yes ill make a start as soon as i get home from visiting mum and dad perhaps ill write an adventure story something really exciting that could be turned into a film about hidden gold in the jungle there could be robbers and maybe a girl getting kidnapped i could base the girl on me only make her more beautiful and muds braver and the hero the man who would fight the robbers and save the girl well the hero could be just like brad brad its useless i cant think about anything but him i sigh diana looks at me brad she asks and i nod diana shakes her head oh dear well perhaps you should ask your mother for advice about mr courtney if you wont listen to me she suggests i look at her diana i say you have met my mother havent you she laughs oh yes she says i was forgetting soon after this we arrive in rottingdean and diana stops outside my parents house by the way alex she says as i get out of the van you do know youre wearing different coloured shoes dont you its the latest fashion i say didnt you know chapter three life should be like a colourful vase your mr courtney sounds fantastic my mother says and i smile thinking how annoyed diana would be if she could hear much better than boring barry mum well sorry darling barrys very nice of course but he is a bit boring you have to agree ive always wanted you to have an exciting life hes the type to want you to live in a small house in a small town and to have two children a girl and a boy you had a girl and a boy i remind her today my mothers dressed in a short orange skirt and a red pullover her hairs orange too and shes had it cut really short like a boys for some reason shes wearing a red hat even though shes indoors and the house is warm she certainly isnt typical of people who live in rottingdean neither is dad mum noticed my odd shoes straight away but she thought they looked really good from now on shell probably wear odd shoes herself yes darling i did have a boy and a girl but i didnt mind if i had two girls or two boys or even three girls and three boys the point is we didnt plan it all out the way barry plans things out we left it up to nature nature how often have i heard that word from my mother i wonder mum notices my expression dont look like that darling natures a wonderful thing and your feelings for this brad sound very natural to me id love to meet him no no no poor barry has met mum and dad a few times actually he quite likes them even though he thinks theyre strange theyre always very nice to him the poor man has no idea they think hes boring but brad no i cant imagine brad meeting my parents at all he thinks im strange enough i havent given you your birthday present yet mum remembers jumping up as she goes out of the room i try to guess what the present will be ive received some very unusual presents from mum and dad over the years as i expect you can imagine playing cards for telling my fortune huge hairy handmade pullovers and once when i was a child a pet sheep actually i loved the sheep i called him woolly willy and he lived in the back garden and kept the grass short here you are darling mum says returning with the biggest vase ive ever seen i made this for you myself wow i hold out my arms for the vase its really heavy thank you mum the vase is blue well a lot of its blue but its also red and green with yellow spots i do hope you like it mums saying i enjoyed making it she looks at me in fact darling that vase is a lot like the life id like you to lead exciting and colourful i put the vase down on the floor and give my mother a kiss ill do my best mum i tell her ill do my best when i set off for home later on i get strange looks from passengers on a bus for the second time that day this time im wearing odd shoes and i can hardly be seen from behind mums vase and kittens flowers i almost expect the bus driver to ask me to buy a ticket for the vase since it is so large it needs its own seat anyway now youve met my mother you can imagine im sure what it was like to grow up with such parents rob my brother is very like mum and dad he never minded being different from other boys and hes grown up to be a man who doesnt mind being different to other men but as a child i always wished and wished to have a mother and father who were like everyone elses mother and father i was terrified of becoming strange like them i still am perhaps thats why i decided to be barrys girlfriend in the first place because hes ordinary and now ive fallen in love with someone whos far from ordinary perhaps im more like mum than i like to think i am in a few years time ill probably have orange hair and be proud of my earth name and ill probably still be wearing odd shoes when i finally get home after carrying the huge vase up the hill from the bus stop its three oclock in the afternoon and im exhausted also my head still hurts from last nights wine maybe i should go to sleep for half an hour yes thats the best thing to do then perhaps when i wake up ill be more in the mood to go out and celebrate my birthday but when i wake up the rooms in total darkness i quickly switch on the light and look at the clock seven oclock i let out a small cry oh no im supposed to be meeting barry in a restaurant at half past seven as i rush around getting changed i feel as if the mornings repeating itself only this time before i leave the house i make quite sure im wearing matching shoes i manage to stop a taxi and much to my surprise i arrive at the restaurant almost on time barry isnt there yet which is odd because usually hes at least ten minutes early as im almost always at least ten minutes late he often has to wait twenty minutes for me strangely this never seems to make him cross sometimes id like him to be cross i know it seems silly but barrys far too nice to me he isnt as boring as mum says he is but he is too nice id probably like him a lot better if he shouted now and then the way brad does brad there he is again popping into my mind brad brad brad i cant go on being barrys girlfriend when all i do is think about brad its cruel and selfish i must tell barry tonight that its over the only thing is as its my birthday hell probably arrive with a present for me oh help miserably i order a drink and sit at a table to wait practising what to say to barry in my mind you see barry i like you very much but barry im sorry but ive met someone else barry thanks so much for the lovely present but actually ive decided oh no this is going to be awful just then a woman comes in as she walks past my table i smell her perfume its very familiar she sits facing me at a table in the far corner of the restaurant and i recognise her straight away tania stevenson brads girlfriend this is definitely the worst birthday ive ever had quickly i pick up a menu and hide behind it looking at tania over the top shes wearing a dress i saw in a shop a few weeks ago a dress that was far too expensive for me to buy it cost more than i earn at the gallery in a week her blonde shoulderlength hair is perfect of course and so is her makeup suddenly i feel very untidy ive brushed my hair but it would never look as perfect as tanias even if i brushed it for a whole hour the little black dress im wearing is over a year old and a bit too tight for me at the moment my weights always changing you see sometimes im quite thin but more often im a little fat i take after my mother that way the difference is my mother doesnt mind whereas i do i need a cigarette i definitely need a cigarette ok i know ive given up but this is a crisis did i bring any cigarettes with me yes surely i did i begin to search anxiously in my handbag but just then i notice the no smoking signs everywhere around the restaurant ok i can manage without a cigarette yes of course i can i can ill just have to drink more wine thats all i continue to watch tania over the top of my menu and see her take a lipstick from her bag very carefully she paints her lips bright red and i wonder if brad will be kissing those lips later on brad if tanias here then brad will probably be arriving any minute and suddenly i remember him asking me to telephone to reserve a table for him at this restaurant how could i have forgotten i hated doing it i thought i told you to get an early night alex says a familiar voice at my shoulder and there he is looking more handsome than ever in a smart grey suit i know i say my mouth suddenly dry with nervousness but i couldnt hes looking at me in that way i told di about earlier on his dark eyes staring straight into mine as if im the only person in the restaurant you couldnt he repeats i see someone came round to your house and forced you to come out perhaps they had a gun did they or was it a knife hes joking of course the trouble is when he makes jokes like this i can never think of anything clever or funny to say back to him anyway tanias calling to him from across the restaurant brad im over here brad he looks up and waves at her well he says to me if youre still sitting here at ten oclock im going to get a gun out myself and force you to go home ok he walks away before i can answer and the next moment hes ruining tanias lipstick with a kiss i dont want to look but somehow i cant help it who is that darling tania asks in a loud voice and when brad looks my way my face goes red shes my temporary assistant he tells tania emphasising the word temporary you met her a few weeks ago oh tania says sounding bored i dont remember what a horrible dress shes wearing you ought to pay her more money brad i sit there unhappily listening to tania laugh its all very confusing i dont understand how brad can look at me the way he does and then let tania be so horrible about me and suddenly i wish barry would get here boring but nice barry who thinks i look good whatever im wearing but suddenly i realise barrys never going to come here because this isnt the restaurant we arranged to meet in oh no i push back my chair and get up so quickly i manage to drop my handbag my purse falls out and coins roll everywhere under tables under handbags under feet oh no i start to pick the money up apologising to people as i reach under their tables collecting change for the bus alex says a familiar voice causing me to bang my head on a table careful brad advises holding out a twentypence piece that has rolled right across the room standing up and rubbing my head i look at him knowing tania is still laughing at me i take the coin from his fingers er thank you im just trying to think of something anything more interesting to say something to make him realise that im the woman of his dreams not tania when the restaurant door opens and a bunch of kiss flowers walks in alex says barrys voice from behind the flowers ive been searching for you in every restaurant in town happy birthday chapter four talking isnt always easy its still my thirtieth birthday yes doesnt time pass slowly when youre having fun barry has suggested we stay in this restaurant now so here we are sitting at a table for two with romantic music playing in the background brad and tania the terrible are still here i can see them looking into each others eyes at their own table for two at the other end of the room this is how im feeling old fat foolish jealous youll probably be thinking that things cant get any worse if you are then youre quite wrong barrys looking at me with a pleased kind of expression on his face what is it i ask feeling immediately suspicious but just as i do i notice that the entire restaurant staff are walking towards me smiling in just the same way barrys smiling they stop a metre or so away from our table all except one girl whos holding a large bunch of balloons happy birthday alex she says and ties the balloons to the back of my chair then she steps back to join the rest of the staff and they all start to sing very loudly happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear alex happy birthday to you the balloons surround my face green blue yellow and red i want to die then just when i think the nightmares over one of the waiters gives a cough before making an announcement ladies and gentlemen he shouts so loudly mum and dad can probably hear him in rottingdean today is alex fayes thirtieth birthday thirty today three cheers for alex then everybody in the restaurant joins in hooray they cheer hooray hooray i try to speak im only able to whisper very very quietly thank you i say thank you very much over on the other side of the restaurant i can see brad and tania laughing and now i can add something else to my list of how im feeling embarrassed i now feel old fat foolish jealous and embarrassed thank you barry thank you life thank you very much on the other side of the table i notice that barrys still looking pleased with himself he has no idea how i feel at all he thinks he actually thinks hes done something special for me barry has been my boyfriend for two years two years and he has no idea at all that this is the worst day of my entire life good news he says spreading butter on some bread my company heard today from the council about that work for the motorway bridges we got it good i say automatically watching him eat his bread i dont feel at all hungry at the moment myself in fact right now i dont feel as if i shall ever want to eat anything again this is funny in a way because barry and i actually met because of a plate of food i was at a friends wedding party and there was lots of delicious food i was very hungry so i had piled my plate with food and im sure youve already guessed it i dropped the plate some of the food landed on my new dress but most of it went on barry the messiest food went on barry amazingly he didnt shout at me you see even then he was too nice we just found a kitchen and cleaned our clothes up a little and then we sat and chatted barry was really interested in everything i had to say i liked that it does mean ill be working away from home for a while though hes saying to me now we wont see so much of each other for a few weeks this is my chance to tell him i lick my lips feeling suddenly nervous then when im just about to speak i suddenly notice something happening at brad and tanias table something that makes me feel very happy indeed brad and tania are having an argument alex barry says didnt you hear what i said i said ill miss you yes yes i say impatiently trying to hear brad and tanias conversation its not my fault tania i can hear him saying i had no idea no idea at all believe me but what will people think tania cries everyone will be talking about it its horrible horrible what what will everyone be talking about whats horrible what alex hmm i realise barrys speaking to me i asked you if you would miss me too yes yes of course i will i answer without thinking looking at the couple on the far side of the room as i watch tania gets to her feet picking up her handbag she walks quickly away from the table brad gets up more slowly putting some money down on the table before he starts to follow her good im only faintly conscious of barry saying to me as tania walks past us because i really care about you alex i really do what im not listening to barry because brads walking towards me now and hes looking at me even in the middle of a crisis hes staring at me in that special way it must mean something it must he stops briefly at our table happy birthday alex he says in his attractive deep voice remember dont stay up too late then he leaves the restaurant who was that barry asks my boss oh barry looks thoughtful for a while then smiles they dont seem very happy do they he says not like us we never argue do we i wake up the next morning feeling terrible not because i drank too much wine last night this time but just because i dont like myself very much barry has gone away to build bridges for motorways with no idea that i dont want to be his girlfriend any longer if i ever do write my adventure book it will be impossible to base the character of the girl on myself im too frightened even to talk to my boyfriend still ive woken up early enough to walk to work for once so after checking that my shoes are the same colour i leave my flat and walk down the street to the seafront even feeling as miserable as i do i notice the sea looks almost as blue as it does in the summer its a beautiful day cold but sunny with only a gentle wind it isnt a day to feel miserable for long and by the time i reach the grand hotel the sunshine has cheered me up i wonder if kittens still staying at the hotel and whether she has forgiven puppy yet and then i remember brad and tanias argument and smile i still have no idea what it was about but it really did sound serious perhaps they have broken up perhaps brads now a free man feeling suddenly keen to arrive at work i begin to walk faster if brad and tania have broken up hell probably be a little sad for a while i suppose hell need someone to talk to as i hurry along i imagine him talking to me about it perhaps well go to the sea view cafe again or maybe well just sit in the gallery anyway it will just be me and him ill listen to him ill be understanding though not too understanding hell look into my eyes as he talks and suddenly hell realise he doesnt care about breaking up with tania after all by the time i reach ship street im so anxious to arrive at work im practically running i rush around the corner and bang straight into someone brad for goodness sake alex brad is standing in the middle of the pavement and he has to reach out to stop me from falling over cant you look where youre going sorry i say breathlessly i didnt see you obviously not he lets go of my arms but doesnt start walking instead he turns to look up the road in the direction of the gallery and i suddenly get the feeling that somethings wrong what is it i ask and when he points i notice a small crowd of people standing outside the gallery they all seem to be holding cameras who are they i ask feeling puzzled and brad frowns journalists he says come on well get into the gallery round the back and the next moment he has turned down a narrow path between two buildings brad i say following him whats going on shh he hurries along keeping close to the wall as if hes a private detective in a film either that or a criminal on the run from the police brad are you in some sort of trouble i ask but he doesnt answer and just keeps on hurrying along the narrow pathway i can smell food fish and realise were now behind the fish restaurant the path is taking us behind the shops and restaurants in ship street yes theres the back of the art gallery i wish youd tell me whats happening i say shh he says as he looks around and i realise hes checking to see if there are any journalists about by now im almost dying of curiosity yesterday was strange enough with the gallery being closed but this is a real mystery and suddenly i remember tanias words in the restaurant last night what will people think she said and everyone will be talking about it there must be some connection between these journalists and what she was talking about but what chapter five the wrong pictures ill open the door brad whispers you go in first ill lock the door behind us but stay in the back office dont let them see you feeling more and more as if im acting in a film i do as he says and soon were both in the small office at the back of the art gallery with the door locked ill close the curtains he says still whispering and soon the rooms in darkness i realise that the only sound i can hear is brads breathing were quite alone together just me and brad in the darkness and i know exactly what advice my mother would give me if she were here move as close to him as you can she would say and he might kiss you so i do move a bit closer but brad doesnt seem to notice i expect you want to know what all this is about he says er what its difficult to concentrate my heads so filled with pictures of him kissing me in the darkness i hear brad sigh i said i expect you want to know what all this is about oh er yes yes please read this he says handing me a newspaper theres just enough light coming through the curtains for me to read the headline brighton gallery in forgery scandal what i cant believe my eyes forgery scandal what does it mean i ask again brads face looks worried those ralph blackman paintings i bought he says they turned out to be fakes fakes i repeat the word stupidly and he frowns at me yes fakes he says very slowly as if im a child you know painted by someone who isnt ralph blackman but signed with ralph blackmans name i know what a fake is i say a little crossly good he says then you also know what trouble is and police questioning something like this is terrible for business well lose our good name arthur grant wont be the only artist to leave the gallery youve been questioned by the police yes most of yesterday i told them i didnt know about the paintings im not sure they believe me though they wont send you to prison will they i say worriedly brads face looks worse than ever and i realise he hasnt thought about the possibility of going to prison why cant i think before i speak i dont know he says sounding really unhappy but you didnt know the paintings were fakes you really thought ralph blackman had painted them if anyone goes to prison it should be the person who sold them to you i say hoping to make him feel better brad bought the paintings during my first week at the gallery i remember it well because i thought they were horrible dark pictures of trees and fields in the rain i didnt say anything about not liking them at the time though well brad said ralph blackman was a famous artist you see and i didnt want him to know i had never heard of him brad was very pleased because he had bought the paintings so cheaply the very next week he sold them again for double the money to an american but now it turns out that they were fakes not real ralph blackmans at all is this what tania was so worried about i ask him but when he looks at me i wish i hadnt he looks sort of dangerous what do you mean he asks how do you know about that my face is going red again i can feel it well last night i i wasnt listening i just heard she tania wasnt exactly speaking quietly was she he looks at me for a while then sighs no i suppose youre right she wasnt and yes this is what she was so worried about tanias fathers a judge she was worried about what he would say if this was in the newspapers as he speaks he pushes one hand through his hair its something he often does when hes thinking i love the way it makes his hair all untidy i look away from him trying to concentrate i know its important to say the right thing now and i cant afford to be thinking about brads hair well i say taking a deep breath if you want to know what i think then well i think tania should know this isnt your fault she should know you wouldnt do something like this on purpose you arent a criminal there is silence in the room for a while after my little speech i wonder if ive said too much after all tania is his girlfriend or at least she was just then we both hear a noise from next door one of the journalists is shouting through the letterbox mr courtney can you tell us how many of the paintings in your gallery at the moment are fakes how dare they brad says angrily and the next moment hes opening the door to the art gallery and rushing through none of the pictures in this art gallery are fakes i hear him shout and i quickly follow him into the gallery outside i can see the journalists going crazy there are perhaps ten or twelve and theyre staring at us through the glass windows as if were animals in a zoo some are taking photographs and some are banging on the glass shouting mr courtney look this way please is it true the police arrested you yesterday mr courtney what does judge stevenson think about this mr courtney i move to stand next to brad and instantly the cameras are pointed in my direction too perhaps we should just leave brad i suggest but he wont hear of it no he says angrily not until ive killed these fools murder wouldnt be very good publicity for the gallery i say taking his arm to lead him back to the office come on lets just go but when we get into the office we find the journalists have discovered the back entrance to the gallery mr courtney they shout banging on the back door were trapped now what do we do i ask and brad runs both hands through his hair thinking i know what id like to do he replies but i suppose were just going to have to walk through them unless we want to spend the next fortyeight hours trapped in this office that is yes please i think but brad is already planning our escape ok heres what well do he says well walk straight out of the front door and well say nothing to them except no comment whatever they say to us thats all we say ok no comment no comment i say practising and he nods good then he leads the way back into the gallery as he unlocks the door the journalists are all shouting questions at him and when we go outside they crowd around us shouting and taking photographs mr courtney mr courtney miss can i ask who you are miss i look at the journalist who asked the question no comment i say no comment we start to walk down ship street but they follow us so brad takes my hand come on he says lets run we start to run so do the journalists i wish my mother could see me she would definitely like the way my life has suddenly become so exciting im really enjoying myself quickly get into my car says brad when we reach the seafront i jump in beside him and he starts the engine as we drive quickly off i look over my shoulder the journalists are standing in a disappointed group on the corner of ship street chapter six hill view house we lost them i cheer but brads still frowning for now he says for now but i refuse to be calm this is so exciting i say and this time his frown is rather cool im very glad my personal disaster is so entertaining alex he says oh dear i didnt mean that brad i tell him quickly i dont want you to be in trouble its just that well this is so much more interesting than sitting in the gallery answering the telephone and watching people walk by outside your job is to help me to sell paintings alex he reminds me not to watch tourists oh me and my big mouth brad gives a little laugh and i decide its probably best to keep quiet for a while im so busy thinking about everything thats just happened that it isnt until some time later that i realise i dont know where were going brad what where are we going i ask he stops at some traffic lights and looks at me to get some country air i need to think oh i say feeling suddenly happy lovely a day out in the countryside with brad theres no need at all for him to take me with him but he obviously wants to he wants to be with me he wants to be with me im so happy i feel like singing then i remember my shoes as i told you theyre the same colour today but unfortunately they arent flat sensible shoes suitable for walking in the countryside theyre fashion shoes and ive already done that long walk from my flat to ship street in them in short my feet hurt whats wrong brad asks nothing i say but too late brad has already seen me looking doubtfully down at my feet he smiles oh alex alex alex he says do you ever wear the right shoes then he starts to laugh but you know somehow i dont mind this time this laughters somehow different friendly warm so i laugh too not often i say i always love driving away from brighton into the countryside dont misunderstand me i love living in brighton its a lively town with lots to do and see its just that sometimes in the summer it feels a little as if the tourists have stolen the town from those of us who live there all year round they walk slowly along by the sea with their ice creams wearing silly hats and then they all travel home again at the same time in the evening blocking the roads and filling the trains when the tourists stop coming in the autumn it feels as if we get the town back again this is when its fun to cycle along the seafront past the no cycling signs or to walk to rottingdean past the marina and along the path next to the sea when the seas rough the waves hit the wall by the side of the path and shoot right up into the air if you dont run fast enough you get very wet running from the waves is a game i really enjoy when brads my boyfriend ill suggest we play the running from the waves game its like being a child again but it can also be quite romantic because you can scream and hold onto each other once when i played the game with barry we both got really wet but i dont want to think about barry or ill start to feel guilty again was that your boyfriend you were with last night brad asks just then and i look at him wondering if he can read my thoughts i hope not er that was barry hes just a friend i lie although it isnt a complete lie you see i do like barry id be very sad if i thought id never see him again id really like us to stay friends and it was your thirtieth birthday how did you guess that i joke remembering the balloons and the singing alex brad says thirty isnt old youre just a baby and he leans forward to switch on some music thanks i say happily wondering how old he is i dont ask him though im too afraid to but id guess maybe thirtyseven or thirtyeight definitely not older than that just the right age for me we drive past lewes a pretty little market town with a ruined castle and then the road heads into the green hills these hills are called the south downs and they always remind me of the backbone of some ancient large animal theyre beautiful at all times of the year the weather over the downs can sometimes be different from the weather in brighton even though the town isnt very far away its like that today in brighton it was sunny but here its grey and the downs look very dark against the sky to tell you the truth the scene looks a bit like a ralph blackman painting and i think brad thinks so too anyway hes frowning again and suddenly he reaches forward to switch off the cheerful music its damn well going to rain he says yes i have to agree it does look like it i hope brad will change his mind about going for a walk if it does rain its true that i dont mind getting wet by the sea thats fun but walking through mud in unsuitable shoes isnt fun no fun at all through the car window i can see firle beacon the highest point along this part of the downs the clouds so low by now its hiding the hilltop completely we pass a farm shop by the side of the road there are christmas trees for sale outside i look at them with a sense of surprise wondering if it will ever feel like christmas this year suddenly brad slows the car down and my heart sinks i try to tell myself it wont be so bad that rain mud and cold will be fun if im with brad but somehow i cant quite believe it the car turns right travelling up a narrow rough road in the direction of firle beacon and when we go round a corner i can see a house ahead the house is darklooking but then everything looks dark by now it looks as if its about to rain very heavily indeed the road stops at the house and to my great surprise so does the car where are we i ask but brads already getting out i should hurry up if you dont want to get wet he says and then to my amazement he takes a key from his pocket and walks up to the house i follow him slowly theres a sign outside hill view house do you live here i ask joining him in the hall sometimes he says this place belonged to my grandmother she was a friend of the bloomsbury group he looks at me you have heard of the bloomsbury group havent you yes of course i really have actually most people who live in this area have the bloomsbury group was a group of artists who lived and worked together in the s they had a house called charleston which is near here barry and i visited it once i think he thought it was a bit crazy but i thought it was beautiful the whole house is decorated with paintings the doors the walls even the furniture brad looks at me doubtfully hmm he says well anyway my grandmother bought this house intending to turn it into another charleston but unfortunately she was no artist she was happy here though this is where my mother was born i came here for holidays as a boy i immediately have a picture of him as a little boy in my mind wearing short trousers his black hair untidy its a lovely house i say and brad nods yes i think so not everyone wants to live in the countryside though i cant imagine tania living here at all its much too far away from fashion shops and smart cafe bars i could live here i tell him without thinking and he looks at me what he says next takes me totally by surprise well he says thats interesting because i was going to ask you if you would at least not live here but stay here for tonight anyway i dont want to go back to brighton today of course if you dont want to stay i could drive you to lewes and you could catch a train back to brighton wow wow wow me and brad alone in this wonderful place i cant believe my luck no i say quickly no that would be fine i mean id like to stay i always want to paint when the rest of my life is in a mess he says taking off his coat and hanging it up this is where i have my studio youre an artist i ask amazed yes im an artist he holds out his hand for my coat whys that so surprising i dont know i mean it isnt im embarrassed again but brads smiling its all right alex you werent to know he hangs up my coat and goes into the kitchen to put the kettle on when i follow him i see that the kitchens painted a warm yellow with a redbrown floor very mediterranean looking nice come on brad says ill show you my paintings while we wait for the water to boil as i follow him up the stairs i feel really excited im finding so much out about brad today so much has happened and its still only eleven oclock this is the studio he says leading the way into a big square room with very large windows oh what a fantastic view i say crossing to the window to look out outside the skies are still dark but it hasnt started to rain yet but even in this poor light the view of firle beacon is wonderful the room is perfect for an artist brad doesnt seem interested in the view i can hear him moving things around in the room behind me and when i turn round i notice several paintings leaning against the wall theyre all facing the wrong way but because of the view from the window i guess they will be landscapes im so sure about it that when brad turns two round the right way i cant help but gasp with surprise what is it he asks frowning at me dont you like them for a moment i cant think of anything to say the paintings arent landscapes at all to be honest ive no idea what they are one of them seems to be completely black except for a small green spot in one corner and the other seems to be all white all white it doesnt even have any spots yes i cry quickly of course i like them theyre but i have to stop because i cant think how to continue the sentence panicking a little i start another one is is that one a snow scene i ask my question is followed by a long silence its as quiet as it was in the gallery office i can hear his breathing again brads frowning i realise ive made a big mistake no alex he says at last its not a snow scene its not a scene at all im not a landscape painter oh i say swallowing nervously sorry i i dont know much about modern art so it would seem brad returns his paintings to their place against the wall as if im no longer allowed to see them and yet if i remember correctly when you came to the job interview you told me you knew a lot about art its true i did say that ok i lied but you see as soon as i saw brad i knew i had to get the job i was a desperate girl and i took desperate action i well i do know about art i say well a bit anyway just just not modern art ok whos your favourite artist he demands to know by now im panicking so much that for a moment the only artists name i can remember is ralph blackmans luckily i realise it wouldnt be a good idea to say his name though and i think for a little while longer van gogh i shout at last and he looks at me doubtfully ok he says name three paintings by van gogh um i say thinking hard two paintings um come on alex one painting suddenly i remember one and shout out its name excitedly sunflowers brad doesnt seem to be impressed he shakes his head alex every person in the world has heard of sunflowers he says well i havent got a very good memory for names i say weakly thats why i cant think of any more titles hmm he says im not sure i entirely believe you alex but never mind go and make the coffee while i get my paints ready would you by the time i return with the coffee brads staring hard at his white painting in fact he hardly notices im there he just takes his coffee and keeps right on staring i stare at the painting too trying to see more in it than just white eventually i notice that its painted in three or four different types of white bluewhite greywhite green white and plain white the more i look the more i see some of the paints thick and some of the paints thin the different whites look a bit like rocks covered by snow brad might not think he has painted a snow scene but i still think he has not that i intend to say that to him though go for a walk or something wont you alex brad says to me over his shoulder i prefer to be alone when im painting i look out of the window it is now raining very hard indeed firle beacon has almost disappeared from view or if you dont want to do that he continues why dont you find yourself a book to read there are plenty in the sittingroom ill be about two or three hours here so i wander downstairs trying not to feel fed up if tania were here instead of me would it be different would he send her downstairs to read a book while he painted a picture somehow i cant imagine it chapter seven alone with brad in the sittingroom the books on the shelves look boring besides i dont feel like reading ive got too much on my mind being alone overnight here with brad is my big chance to make something happen between us i cant waste it alex i tell myself you need a plan then suddenly i have a brilliant idea ill cook a really special meal a meal so delicious that when brad tastes it hell see that can be creative too i hurry to the kitchen to check the fridge chicken carrots mushrooms potatoes excellent i can make a chicken casserole singing happily to myself i set to work preparing the vegetables and chopping up the chicken casseroles are perfect for a cold wet winters day they warm you up also they are very easy to make as youll know if youve ever made one all you have to do is throw the ingredients into a dish add a little water put the dish into the oven and leave it to cook for a few hours its impossible for anything to go wrong in fact the casserole is so easy to prepare that after twenty minutes i have nothing to do again outside its still raining heavily so i go back into the sittingroom to give brads books a second chance i take down an art book but soon put it back on the shelf it contains pictures of paintings that look a lot like brads actually i really hate to admit it but im very disappointed by brads paintings i like brad so much i want to like his paintings too and well i dont i dont even think mum would like them actually she likes a lot of modern art but i think even she would say brads pictures were boring but i dont want to think about it because the words boring and brad just dont go together in my mind i choose a detective story and take it over to the sofa but im afraid that by the time i finish reading a few pages of the dull detectives dull inquiries im asleep so deeply asleep i dont wake up until i hear brad calling my name and by then the rooms dark alex brad calls down the stairs im sure i can smell something burning the casserole i jump up and run wildly from the room whats wrong brad asks me from the landing but i dont stop nothing nothing i say running down the hall brad doesnt seem to believe me he hurries downstairs and arrives in the smokefilled kitchen shortly after i do bloody hell he swears what have you been doing alex as i open the oven door even more smoke fills the room just a bit of cooking i say cooking and sleeping im sure i dont need to tell you that the evening doesnt turn out the way id planned it at all the only food left in the house is two frozen lasagnes which brad heats up in the microwave i offer to do it but he wont allow me to no he says youd probably blow the microwave up and by now i feel such a failure i almost think hes right i had intended to serve my wonderful meal in the dining room with soft lights and nice music a romantic background for what i hoped would be a romantic evening instead we eat our heatedup lasagnes in the sitting room watching a quiz show on television i hate quiz shows well thats not quite true what i hate about quiz shows is not knowing the answers to any of the questions if i knew as many answers as brad obviously does then perhaps i would like quiz shows as much as he seems to like them here we are alone in the countryside sitting next to each other on the sofa and yet the situation is definitely not romantic michael faraday shouts brad in answer to the question who first thought of the electric light bulb and champselysees to the question on what famous street does the tour de france cycle race end its only too obvious hes completely forgotten that im sitting next to him at all perhaps you ought to write to the television company to ask if you can appear on the quiz show i suggest brad watches as a woman on the television wins ten thousand pounds ill probably have to do just that with the trouble the gallerys in at the moment he sighs ive got to pay the customer who bought those fake ralph blackman paintings a lot of money soon and im not certain i can afford it he looks at me actually alex he says im not sure i can afford you any longer to be honest as from tomorrow im going to have to manage without an assistant what i stare at him you mean you dont want me to work for you any more the job was only temporary he reminds me im just ending it sooner than i thought i would i know its almost christmas but im afraid i have no choice i sit there with my dirty lasagne plate on my knees feeling totally shocked its a pity really brad says of course you were about as useful to me in the gallery as you seem to be in a kitchen but you are pleasant to look at june isnt oh junes very wellorganised but she isnt pretty my mind is finding it difficult to manage its trying to deal with two very different shocks at the same time one nasty shock and one fantastic shock you you really think im pretty i ask at last preferring to think about the fantastic shock rather than the nasty shock well he says looking at me perhaps not quite so pretty as usual with your mouth open the way it is at the moment i quickly close my mouth but usually yes i think you are pretty of course you have your faults i mean your hairs often messy and some of your clothes are dont spoil it i say quickly and he smiles anyway im afraid the fact that youre pretty doesnt help me to pay that customer the money i owe him so im sorry but i have to go i finish his sentence for him yes right im not doing very well at achieving the things on my list am i im not married to brad im not engaged to brad im not even his girlfriend and as from tomorrow im not even going to be employed by him you arent going to cry are you he asks sounding worried im not very good with women who cry and suddenly i feel as if i might be very close to tears no i say my voice shaking a little im not going to cry but then i am crying i cant help it brad groans hell he says and takes the dirty plate from my knees and puts it on the floor come here you silly thing he says and he looks deep into my red eyes it really isnt anything to cry about he says softly but its no use i cant stop crying in fact it seems worse with him being so nice to me oh alex please dont cry he says and then he puts his arm around me im so surprised i stop crying almost immediately ever since i first met brad ive wanted him to hold me in his arms and now at last its happened its not the same as when i ran into him and he held me to stop me from falling over its the real thing and any moment now hell kiss me chapter eight christopher comes to stay i sit very still waiting for brad to kiss me but it doesnt happen i wait a little longer brad i whisper softly then i look at him and i realise hes fallen asleep and that im afraid to have to tell you is as romantic as the evening gets i sit there until im forced to move because my shoulder hurts brads arm is very heavy when i do move brad makes a very unromantic noise through his nose and wakes up what he says whats the matter oh was i asleep he takes his arm away from my shoulder and yawns sorry its been a really tiring day dont you think im going to go to bed the guest bedroom is on the right at the top of the stairs when youre ready theres a clean towel in the bathroom and a spare toothbrush see you in the morning good night i reply as he leaves the room i sit there miserably listening to him go up the stairs and then finally i take the dirty plates to the kitchen and go upstairs myself i dont expect to sleep very well im far too unhappy nothing i try to do turns out right nothing im useless old fat foolish jealous and now useless too i sigh lying there in the darkness knowing that brad is asleep in the next room at least he said i was pretty he didnt have to say that and he does look at me in that special way perhaps i just havent been obvious enough perhaps he isnt sure about how i feel maybe i just need to simply tell him how i feel about him instead of trying to show him by cooking meals especially if the meal is going to be such a disaster yes it would be much simpler to just tell brad how i feel ok thats what ill do ill tell him tomorrow when i wake up next morning im not sure where i am at first i lie there for a while looking around me and then i remember hill view house brad oh no today im going to tell him how i feel about him suddenly feeling nervous i lie back against the pillows trying to imagine it perhaps hell be painting in the studio and ill walk in behind him and tell him no thats not a good idea hell get annoyed if hes in the middle of painting well then perhaps well go for a walk together if its stopped raining yes thats a much better idea except that from today i no longer work for brad perhaps hell be taking me straight back to brighton well if he does that ill just have to tell him in the car although if i tell him im in love with him as were driving along we might have an accident suddenly i hear voices downstairs in the hall brad is already up and by the sound of it hes got a visitor you cant do this to me i hear him say i wont be able to manage brad pleased the woman speaking to him sounds upset and i quickly get out of bed and move closer to the door to listen i wouldnt ask you if this wasnt a crisis says the woman dont you see how serious this could be who is she definitely not tania thank goodness after a long pause i hear brad groan oh all right he agrees at last but only for three nights ok now the woman sounds happy oh thank you brad she says thank you bye darling ill be back for you in a few days be good and dont forget it will soon be christmas a door opens and closes and seconds later i hear a car driving away desperate now to know whats happening i quickly get dressed as soon as im ready i leave the bedroom and look down the stairs there is brad standing in the hall and standing beside him is a little boy they both look up at me i look down at them for a moment nobody says anything to be honest im a little shocked you see the boy who looks about six years old is clearly brads son even from here i can tell he has the same black hair and dark eyes as brad not only that but the shape of their faces looks almost the same is brad divorced i go slowly downstairs and as i get nearer i can see the boy looks unhappy in fact he looks as if he might be about to cry hello i say trying to be cheerful im alex who are you christopher he says very quietly hes my sisters son brad tells me and then he sees my face alex you surely didnt think goodness no brads voice is filled with horror at the thought of christopher being his son no hes my nephew my sisters marriage is in trouble so she wants to leave the boy with me for a few days i told her it wasnt a good time but shh i say quickly looking at the boy he can hear you and sure enough tears are beginning to roll down the little boys face im sorry brad says crossly but it isnt a good time theres this forgery business and the newspapers i dont even know what im going to do about arthur grants cancelled exhibition the gallery the gallery the gallery sometimes i think thats all brad thinks about some things are more important than cancelled exhibitions i say firmly taking the childs cold little hand in mine and leading him towards the kitchen come on christopher lets make you a cup of hot chocolate women shouts brad after me youre all impossible i want to shout something back at him but i dont because of christopher honestly how can brad be so insensitive im really surprised at him the poor child must be feeling really frightened and alone daddy shouts too christopher says as i bend down to take his coat off and his little face is so sad i almost feel like crying myself people get cross sometimes i say it makes them say things they dont really mean christopher takes the tissue i offer him uses it then hands it back to me thats better i say now would you like a cup of hot chocolate yes please yes please says brad appearing through the doorway you can make your own drink i tell him but i can already feel my anger leaving me hes looking at me again look he sighs im sorry ok im sorry christopher youre very welcome here of course ive just got a few things im worried about at the moment thats all i didnt mean to shout he smiles at both of us and christopher smiles back i dont want that smile to work on me i still feel angry with brad unfortunately i dont seem to be able to do anything about it when brad smiles like that i just melt he has such an attractive smile you see it has as much effect as his stare i cant imagine why some film director hasnt discovered him and made him into a movie star why dont i make us all a cup of hot chocolate he suggests you and christopher can go into the living room its nice and warm in there its impossible for me to stay angry with brad for long i smile back all right i say come on christopher the little boy holds my hand can uncle brad make nice hot chocolate he asks doubtfully as we leave the kitchen and i smile im not sure christopher i say but brad shouts after us excuse me but i make the best hot chocolate in the south of england christopher and i look at each other and start to laugh but actually when it arrives the hot chocolate is good you see brad says and i smile at him ok i agree youre a hot chocolate expert can you cook pizza christopher asks and brad frowns not without a little help from a supermarket speaking of which what well for reasons i wont mention there isnt any food in the house so someone needs to go shopping oh i say but christopher seems to have stronger opinions about it i dont want to go shopping he objects i dont want to go shopping brad sighs christopher he says please be a good boy ill stay here with him while you go to the supermarket if you like i offer we can play some games cant we christopher you do seem good with children brad says as christopher nods enthusiastically so good in fact that i wonder brad coughs a little he seems almost embarrassed what well brad sighs i agreed to have the boy to stay for three nights i know i said last night that your job finished from today but i wonder if youd work for another couple of days to help me to look after him please alex please alex please christopher is so excited he starts to jump up and down unfortunately hes stall holding his cup of hot chocolate very soon the pale green carpet is decorated with an interesting brown pattern brad covers his face with his hands sorry uncle brad christopher says very quietly looking at the mess on the floor youd better buy something to clean the carpet with while youre in lewes i say yes brad groans and then he looks at me please say youll stay alex he says sounding a lot like his nephew for a moment i consider asking brad why he doesnt ask tania to look after christopher but i have to admit that it does feel good to have him begging me for something anyway i already like the little boy and it will give me more time to tell brad how i feel about him as well as two more nights alone with him after christopher has gone to bed there cant be quiz shows on television every night surely so i nod my head ok i agree ill stay and this time when christopher starts to jump up and down i almost expect brad to join in he looks so happy excellent he says standing up ill go and get that pizza then five minutes after brad has left it starts to rain again christopher and i go upstairs to look out of the studio window firle beacon has disappeared once more the rain is like rain in a jungle poor brad i imagine him driving along the narrow country roads through the rain in a bad mood and i very much doubt whether hes got an umbrella with him i notice christopher is very quiet are you ok i ask him wondering if hes afraid or whether hes thinking about his mother and father he nods will there be a storm he asks and i shake my head no i dont think so look its already getting brighter theres some blue sky over there we sit close together looking out at the view and suddenly i realise im feeling really happy brads right i am good with children i understand them perhaps its because im always making mistakes and getting into trouble myself mummy says auntie tania isnt very nice christopher says suddenly and instantly i smile i like this little boy more and more by the minute does she christopher nods auntie tania told me a story once he says it was stupid and boring can you tell good stories can i tell good stories of course i can tell good stories im about to write a bestselling book what would you like a story about you choose ok then give me a minute to think of one but it takes me less than a minute within seconds im telling christopher a story about a girl and a boy who have very strange parents parents who give them earth names willow and moon yes i know it sounds familiar well ive done a lot of reading about writing stories even if i havent written any yet the advice is always to start by writing about something you know about thats all im doing well at first but i make the next bit up in the story im telling christopher the children become their earth names when they go to sleep at night the girl becomes a willow tree and the boy becomes the moon anyway christopher seems to like it hes listening with so much attention he doesnt even notice when the blue sky disappears and the skies grow dark again before my story about the childrens adventures is finished a storm has begun and i can hear thunder in the distance i want to have an earth name christopher announces i know ill be forest thats a nice name i smile and christopher smiles back at me your stories are much better than auntie tanias he says are you uncle brads girlfriend now just at that moment brad appears at the studio door with very wet hair he looks at me across the room my face goes red oh hello i say we didnt hear you come back obviously not he says arent you going to answer christophers question yes of course i am no christopher i just work for your uncle brad at least i do for the next two days christopher forest seems to have no idea at all that he is embarrassing me well he says i wish you were his girlfriend then you could tell me stories all the time brad laughs now theres a thought he says chapter nine wishes dont always come true the thunderstorm soon passes but it carries on raining all day by evening we have played all the games we can think of and watched childrens television brad has been up in his studio for hours only coming downstairs to cook and eat pizza im still not allowed to do anything in the kitchen more complicated than making coffee after ive put christopher to bed i try to make myself look nice for the evening but its difficult ive got nothing to change into for a start and ive just noticed my skirt has patterns of hot chocolate and burnt casserole on it clothes arent the only thing i dont have with me its now ages since i had a cigarette i think im going to give up smoking by accident anyway i brush my hair and put on some of the lipstick ive found at the bottom of my handbag ok so the lipstick colour is called sweet pink not terrible tania red but its the only lipstick i have with me it will have to do i hear brad finally leave his studio and go downstairs i take one final look at myself in the mirror i think i look ok of course i would like to look better than ok but ok is all i am closing my eyes i make a wish well actually i make ten wishes but theyre all about the same subject what i want to happen tonight here are my wishes as i walk into the room brad will look up at me and smile hell pour me a glass of wine and invite me to sit next to him on the sofa romantic music will be playing on the stereo the light from the fire will make me look truly beautiful brad will find my conversation interesting and delightful well look into each others eyes with growing attraction after a while hell pull me into his arms he wont fall asleep well listen to the music like this until eventually he pulls me even closer and we kiss but none of my wishes will come true unless i actually leave my bedroom and go downstairs in the hall i take a deep breath and smile with my sweet pink lips then i open the door and go in brad is sitting in an armchair reading a book he doesnt look up so he doesnt see either my smile or my lipstick i stand in the middle of the room it its a nice fire isnt it i say nervously but brad doesnt look up well its certainly hot the room is very quiet theres no music playing at all romantic or otherwise how how did your painting go fine thanks is christopher ok i sit down on the sofa trying not to feel disappointed that because brads in the armchair i cant sit next to him instead i imagine what it will be like when brad and i have our own children perhaps well take it in turns to put them to bed or maybe well do it together brad getting them washed and me telling hem a story alex brad says i asked you if christopher was ok oh yes yes i think so i say a bit worried about his mother and father perhaps oh theyll be all right brad says impatiently they always are i frown do you mean they argue often yes he says all the time im getting tired of it to tell you the truth my sister always panics and thinks its the end of their marriage but it never is she and her husband always get back together again of course she never thinks i might have problems of my own he puts down his book and stares into the fire are you still worried about the gallery yes of course i am i sigh quietly none of my wishes are coming true yet you just made a mistake with those paintings thats all nobodys perfect hmm says brad the problem is the public expects you to be perfect making mistakes is just not professional im sure it will all sort itself out i dont see how he says moodily sometimes i wish id never opened the gallery at all its nothing but trouble perhaps i need a change of career the problem is the only thing ive ever really wanted to be is an artist and its very difficult to earn enough money from painting pictures i want to write a book i say after a while and to my surprise he laughs youll never do it i feel really hurt why do you say that because for one thing everybody thinks they could write a book and hardly anyone does and for another thing dont forget ive seen you working at the gallery you arent an organised type of person writers have to be organised he laughs again no youll never write a book im so disappointed i just sit there quietly and eventually brad realises hes upset me its nothing personal alex im sure you have other strengths but hes just trying to be nice and the thing is i know hes right about me being disorganised im always losing things and forgetting things not to mention burning things cheer up brad says and i try to smile it isnt a very successful smile but he doesnt see it anyway because hes reading his book again christopher liked the story i told him today i tell him and he looks up briefly thats hardly the same as writing a book though is it isnt it no brad sighs look can we just leave this conversation all right i sit there feeling miserable while brad reads his book the only sound in the room comes from my stomach the pizza was quite small and we ate it hours ago do you want something else to eat i ask at last but brad shakes his head no not for me thanks ive got to go out in a minute i cant believe it youre going out he looks at me yes that isnt a problem is it you arent frightened of being here on your own or anything silly like that i can feel my face growing hot again no of course im not my parents practically live in the countryside i was born in the countryside im not scared of it at all i like being close to nature and good brad says getting to his feet i wouldnt go if i didnt have something really important to do in brighton feel free to use the telephone i wont be back too late and alex thank you for agreeing to look after christopher i really am grateful he stands in the doorway and gives me a look and a smile then to finish it off he pushes his hand through his hair bye now he says softly bye he allows the smile and the look to last for just a little while longer and then he leaves the room seconds later the front door closes after him and i hear his car start up and then im alone with a small child in a strange house in wild stormy weather and none of my wishes have come true not one chapter ten alone without brad i phone my mother quickly to tell her where i am and then i phone diana that mans just using you she says after ive told her what im doing no he isnt i deny crossly hes just worried about things at the moment if you met him i know if i met him id understand ive lost count of how many times youve said that to me its true i say hotly friends can be very annoying sometimes especially when they refuse to believe anything you say anyway brad said he had something really important to do in brighton he wouldnt have left me all alone here otherwise i know he wouldnt hes probably gone round to see tania while you look after his nephew for him diana suggests cruelly brad and tania have broken up do you really know that alex well no but you saw one argument thats all it doesnt mean theyve broken up look you wont like me saying this alex but i think you ought to be doing something a bit more useful with your life than chasing after mr brad courtney lets face it you havent really been happy since you met him have you and now hes got himself into this stupid trouble with those fake pictures how do you know about that i ask amazed its in tonights newspaper she says theres a picture of you too is there yes actually you look really guilty about something it says when our reporter asked the unknown woman who she was she refused to comment how exciting hmm says diana shall i tell you what i think would be much more exciting if you wrote down the story you made up for christopher if he liked it so much other children will you could be a childrens writer no i couldnt i say surprised but then i think about the idea a childrens writer it does sound good i have to admit i wouldnt know where to start well first you get some paper and a pen and then you take the top off the pen and move it over the paper easy ha ha very funny anyway if its so easy why havent you done it because i havent got your imagination oh by the way barry phoned me he wondered if you were at my house as he couldnt reach you at yours hes only been gone one day i complain does he expect me to wait in every night by the telephone he hasnt gone anywhere actually diana says his works been put back for a few days because of the bad weather oh ok well perhaps ill give him a call but actually after i say goodbye to diana it is quite nice to speak to barry i dont have to feel nervous with him i can just talk i tell him everything well almost everything i leave out most of the things about brad so diana suggested i should write down the story i told christopher you know make it into a book what do you think fantastic idea he says really fantastic hmm when i put the phone down i feel sort of well confused its really nice that diana and barry obviously believe i could be a writer the thing is brad definitely doesnt believe it and at the moment im more likely to agree with him however ive got nothing to lose by giving it a try have i ill never know whos right unless i do i make myself a jug of coffee and then i find some paper and a pen and sit down to begin for a while i just chew the end of the pen and drink the coffee in my mind i can still hear brads laughter and disbelief the thought of him coming home to find me still chewing the end of my pen is what i need to make me begin writing im going to show him hes wrong by the time he gets back my story will be finished carefully i write a title at the top of the page earth children yes i really like that and it hardly took me any time to think of it perhaps this writing business is going to be easy after all feeling more confident i start my story when i reach the bottom of the page i stop to read what ive written its terrible the title is the only good thing i tear the page up and throw it away then i begin again but unfortunately that attempt is just as bad i feel just the same as i did at school when i had to take an exam my mind is filled with ideas but the words i actually write down arent the same as the ideas after a third attempt i give up and look at the clock its almost eleven oclock ive used up lots of time writing rubbish and brad still isnt home now im not writing im conscious of all the noises outside the weather still sounds wild and the wind is really strong in the trees i start to worry about brad what if hes had an accident what if a trees blown down across the road or onto his car i open the front door and look outside it is completely dark ive never seen darkness like it no moon no stars no street lamps not even any distant street lamps certainly no car headlights suddenly something flies right in front of my face surprised i give a little scream ok i know i told brad i wasnt afraid of the countryside im not really well at least only a bit im ok if someone else is with me but nobody is with me at least nobody except christopher and hes only six years old and you know as well as i do that my parents house isnt in the countryside well not the proper countryside like this anyway christopher probably isnt used to the countryside either he could be frightened if he wakes up on his own perhaps it would be a good idea to sleep with him and ill leave the lights on outside the bedroom door in case he gets up in the night when i go into his room i find him deeply asleep theres just enough room in the narrow bed for me as well as i climb in next to him he moves a little but doesnt wake up then i hear him whisper something softly in his sleep something that sounds like forest i smile making myself as comfortable as i can in the small space i have what id really like is to just go to sleep now quickly and easily while i still feel nice being next to christopher what i dont want to do is start thinking because i know that if i start doing too much thinking ill feel like a failure but its no use the thoughts are already coming im frightened of the countryside at night im hopelessly in love with someone who prefers to spend his time with his horrible girlfriend instead of me because by now even i know that diana must be right brad hasnt had an accident a tree hasnt blown down he is with terrible tania i havent bought any christmas presents yet and there are now only six shopping days to go until christmas im not going to become a famous childrens writer and its not fair i lie there for ages and then just as im finally about to fall asleep the telephone rings downstairs careful not to wake christopher i run down to answer it hello well says a familiar voice if it isnt little miss mystery woman tania little miss no comment she continues i realise two things at once tania is drunk and brad cant be with her if shes ringing hill view house how can i help you tania i ask politely well now she says let me see you could disappear yes that would be good you could remove your untidy annoying self from brads house brads gallery and brads life i wait a moment to see if shes finished she hasnt in fact she continues i dont trust you one tiny little bit want to know what i think i think it was you who was responsible for the forgeries i bet youve got the real ralph blackman paintings hidden away somewhere now wait a minute i start to say but she isnt in the mood to listen to me i want to speak to brad she says get me brad now i enjoy telling her the truth oh i really do enjoy it im sorry tania i say sweetly but brad isnt here he went into brighton several hours ago im surprised he hasnt been in touch with you must go now bye tania starts to scream something at me but i put the phone down on her i feel good for about ten seconds and then im back to feeling worried again where is brad chapter eleven alex faye childrens writer alex suddenly i realise that christopher is standing next to me hi i say doing my best to smile despite feeling worried about brad what are you doing up the telephone woke me up it was your auntie tania i tell him and he pulls a face typical he says and i make a guess that hes heard his mother say something similar about his auntie tania before anyway he continues she isnt my real auntie brad and her arent married yet i hope they dont get married so do i oh so do i come on i say lets get you back to bed its very late can i have a drink of milk first he asks and i smile of course you can wait in the sittingroom where its warm and ill bring it to you when i go into the sittingroom hes looking at the only piece of paper i didnt tear up when i was writing my terrible story whats this alex i take the paper from him its the story i was telling you i say at least it was supposed to be the story i was telling you i didnt do it very well will you read it to me he asks drinking his milk oh no christopher its no good pleased i sigh oh all right then so i read it to him exactly as ive written it on the page afterwards he looks at me thats a different story he says no i say frowning its the same one honestly it is well he says its got the same people in it but it sounds funny does it christopher nods finishing off his milk and after ive taken him back up to bed i come downstairs and read the story again and hes right suddenly i know just what he means it sounds too formal and its certainly very different to the way i told it to christopher and that makes my story sound cold and distant and even a bit boring oh thank you thank you christopher thank you im so delighted i do a little dance around the room holding the piece of paper but not for long i havent got time ive got a story to write so i start again from the beginning and this time i try to write it down exactly as i told it to christopher im so involved in it i dont notice the sounds from outside any more i dont even think about brad amazing by the time i write the end at the bottom of the last sheet of paper dawn is breaking outside i feel stiff from sitting for so long and i stand up and stretch yawning you can imagine how tired i feel yet somehow i dont feel like going to bed its too late to go to bed really christopher will be up soon and brad still isnt back but as i open the front door to look at the sky suddenly there he is driving up in his expensive black car did you wait up for me he asks tiredly as he gets out and im about to answer when i notice theres something wrong with his face his left eyes all bruised and black he looks as if hes been in a fight what happened i ask running forward and reaching out to touch his face ow he says careful it hurts sorry but what happened tell me brads face is moody yes all right just let me get into the house would you i need a drink ill get you a drink i say running inside what do you want a cup of tea no he says i do not want a cup of tea i want whisky a very large glass of whisky and when ive finished that one i might just have another one ok yes i say of course why dont you sit down and ill get it for you stop fussing alex he tells me but in the sittingroom he sits down in an armchair just as i suggested when i bring him his drink his eyes are closed thanks he drinks the whisky in one go and holds the glass out to me i fill it up again and he drinks half of it then lies back in the chair closing his eyes his face looks very pale next to the dark bruise on his eye but hes still handsome if i had a black eye and i drank that much whisky at once i would not be looking desirable also id be unconscious on the floor not sitting in a chair tell me whats happened brad i say before he can fall asleep and he sighs and looks at me ive made a complete fool of myself thats whats happened i look at him surprised it just doesnt seem like brad to admit to feeling foolish how i ask he drinks some more of the whisky before he continues i went for a drink you know that new pub on the seafront i thought some of my friends would be in there but they werent so i sat and waited in case they came in later and suddenly i saw him him yes him the monster who sold me those fake ralph blackmans goodness i say staring at him so you went over and hit him brad doesnt answer for a while just looks down into his glass at whats left of his whisky not exactly no i well i sat and looked at him you looked at him please stop repeating everything i say alex its very annoying sorry im just trying to understand thats all and at the moment i dont understand how did you get a black eye from looking at someone he noticed me looking brad says at last but he says it so quietly i cant hear him what i said he noticed me looking he shouts he saw me looking and he came over and asked me why i was staring at him he said i dont like the way youre staring at me and then well then he hit me just for looking at him yes the next thing i know the police are there but hes gone left with his friends and i have to spend the rest of the night at the police station looking at photographs to try to identify him how exciting i say without thinking and brad frowns at me alex sitting in a cold police station with a black eye in the middle of the night looking at photographs of ugly people is not exciting believe me you should try it some time no i say i dont suppose it is sorry anyway did you find his photograph no i did not ive got to go back later to look at another five hundred photographs if you think its so exciting perhaps youd like to come with me of course i dont have to tell you i definitely would like to go with him but actually in the end things dont turn out like that because at that moment christopher comes downstairs in his nightclothes brad takes one look at him and seems to become even more tired than ever im going to bed he says and off he goes christopher seems fed up uncle brad doesnt like me he says of course he does christopher i tell him but he shakes his head no he doesnt he wouldnt even look at me i remember brads black eye ah well i think thats because hes hurt his face a bit i dont think he wanted you to see it christophers eyes light up with interest really is he all covered in blood he asks does he look really horrible boys no of course not hell be better soon he just needs to rest now i need to rest too after my night of story writing but obviously im not going to get the chance christophers looking miserable again its boring here he says it doesnt even feel like its nearly christmas hes right it doesnt feel as if its nearly christmas ok then i say lets make it feel like christmas lets buy a christmas tree and make some decorations for it yes christopher is happy once more running straight upstairs to get dressed and within half an hour were walking up the lane in the direction of the farm shop christophers running on ahead singing to himself something that sounds like a carol a christmas song and suddenly i feel happy i also feel strange because im so tired its almost as if my feet arent quite touching the ground but i do feel happy diana was right i do feel better now ive started to write if earth children still seems all right when i read it again ill type it up on dads computer and post it off to a publisher im a writer suddenly i see a car coming towards us careful christopher i warn him move to the side of the road ok alex he says happily doing as i asked straight away im smiling at him thinking what a good boy he is when suddenly i recognise the car coming down the lane towards us its barrys car what are you doing here barry i ask him when he stops he lifts his eyebrows pretending to feel hurt thats not a very nice way to welcome me when ive taken a day off work specially to see you he smiles and i can feel my face going red which is amazing actually because in all the time ive known barry i dont think i can remember that happening to me before mind you im not sure hes ever looked at me in quite the way hes looking at me now anyone would think wed been away from each other for weeks not for just thirty hours or so i didnt mean it like that i say its good to see you of course it is i was just surprised thats all i wanted to surprise you he smiles at me and then christopher joins us so barry smiles at christopher too now you must be christopher he says who are you asks christopher im barry alexs boyfriend barry says confidently well why wouldnt he be confident about it i havent told him he isnt my boyfriend yet good christopher says i didnt really want uncle brad to be her boyfriend were going to buy a christmas tree you can come with us and put it in your car chapter twelve the two bs barry and brad barry looks at me my face is red again a christmas tree he says thoughtfully thats exciting of course we can put it in my car and he opens the car door for us without asking anything at all about uncle brad still somehow its a happy thing to do buying the tree christophers so excited that we end up feeling excited too and theres christmas music playing in the shop and coloured lights and decorations as well as the christmas tree we buy a very large cake and a bottle of wine im not sure ill have any of the wine because im so tired i already feel a bit drunk and unsteady on my feet but i definitely want some of the cake mmm delicious i only start worrying about barry and brad meeting each other when were driving back towards the house still hopefully brad will still be asleep i open the front door very very quietly uncle brad shouts christopher at the top of his voice uncle brad come and look at the christmas tree christopher i whisper loudly be quiet shh i can feel barry looking at me brad that is your uncle brad was awake all night hes very tired but its daytime now says christopher and i want him to see the tree barrys still looking at me you seem very tired yourself alex he says very tired suddenly i realise what hes thinking he thinks brad and i are both tired because we were awake all night making love to each other i was writing i tell him quickly the story i was telling you about i wrote it down i didnt finish until a few hours barry smiles thats great he says id love to read it later now christopher where do you want this tree as i stand and watch the two of them set the tree up in the big entrance hall i start to yawn barry looks at me why dont you have a sleep he says well be all right for an hour or so wont we christopher of course says his new young friend and i smile gratefully ok i think i will upstairs lying on my bed i start to wonder why i wanted to make it clear to barry that nothing had happened between me and brad but before i can come up with an answer ive fallen asleep im asleep for ages when i finally wake its almost lunchtime oh dear id better find out how barry and christopher are getting on im about halfway down the stairs when i hear a woman laughing it seems to be coming from the kitchen i freeze on the middle step listening surely it isnt tania the unknown woman laughs again no i doubt if tania ever laughs like that except perhaps at her own jokes then i hear barry laughing too whoever the unknown visitor is shes certainly got a sense of humour perhaps its christophers mother come to collect him perhaps shes managed to make it up with her husband so now shes feeling happy i hurry on down the stairs and then suddenly i see the tree and stop again gasping with delight it looks beautiful with pretty lights proper decorations and even a star on top isnt it great says christopher coming out of the sittingroom and seeing me barry had all the decorations in his car he was going to put them on his tree at home but he said i could have them instead i stand there looking at the tree and for some reason i feel like crying for the first time it really does seem as if its almost christmas its lovely and your friends here christopher announces come and see i follow him into the kitchen and there sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee with barry is diana di hi alex she smiles at me i was doing a delivery this way so i thought id pop in for a visit im owed some time off anyway barry tells me youve written your story thats fantastic well done well i say it still needs some work of course but the important thing is youve made a start barry pours me a coffee and i sit down with them at the table i feel a little confused to be honest i mean for barry and di to be laughing together like that i suppose di must like barry im not sure theyve been alone together before theyve met of course but always as part of a group and barry can be a bit shy in a large group and was i right she asks me do you feel good now yes i say exhausted but good barrys smiling at me and i remember the christmas tree thanks for being so nice to christopher the tree looks really but i dont manage to finish my sentence because suddenly somebody starts shouting out in the hall when we leave our coffee and run out to see whats wrong we find brad at the bottom of the stairs staring at the christmas tree what the hells that thing doing here we all stand there looking at him but before we can answer a car pulls up outside bloody hell swears brad what now and he goes to open the door goodness me says a very familiar voice you must be brad may i say what a wonderful place your house is in that view is beautiful and what a delightful christmas tree my mother walks uninvited into the hall as her taxi drives off you see alex she says unlike you some people are as enthusiastic about christmas as i am brad watches as mum takes off her green coat shes wearing her short yellow dress he turns to me alex he asks who is this person i open my mouth to reply but mum gets in first she steps forward to shake his hand and as she does so we all notice her shoes at the same time the left shoe is green and the right shoe is yellow how silly of me she says im alexs mother willow christopher breaks the silence that follows this announcement is that your earth name he asks mines forest i dont think ill ever really understand how it happens but somehow within half an hour mum has found brad some pills for his headache and successfully persuaded him we should have a before christmas party your mothers amazing barry tells me as christopher leads him upstairs to show him something in his bedroom really amazing i try to smile but i cant quite manage it mums got brad blowing up balloons in the sittingroom and i can hear her telling him all about me as a little girl incredibly embarrassing things about me as a little girl brad seems really interested hes staring at my mother with complete attention either that or his face has frozen with shock i cant quite be sure are you ok alex diana asks as she passes on her way to the kitchen no i say im having a bad dream a very bad dream she laughs its not so bad she says come and help me sort out some party food im not sure how she does it but somehow diana manages to create a tray of delicious snacks not only that but she also makes me feel as if i am a fairly useful helper and nothing gets burnt when we take the food into the sittingroom brad is impressed mmm he says to di helping himself from the tray im really hungry youre a very clever woman and he stands there eating and staring at di he only notices im there at all when i drop the biscuit im eating on the floor why is it you never learnt to cook like that yourself alex he says is it because you were too busy pushing toys up your nose still laughing he goes over to di to get another snack i sit down miserably in one of the armchairs look i hear brad saying to di im sorry i reacted like that about the christmas tree i wouldnt want you to get the idea i was mean thats not what id like you to think of me at all mums noticed the way brads standing close to di looking into her eyes or at least the way hes trying to look into dis eyes because dis just carrying on putting the snacks onto plates from the tray as if she doesnt know hes there i thought brad was going to be your boyfriend mum says to me while the others arent listening whys he looking at diana like that perhaps i say tiredly he isnt attracted to people who used to push their toys up their nose but darling she objects that was sweet even the man at the hospital thought so i was just trying to give brad a complete picture of you hmm i say actually i dont think your embarrassing stories about my childhood have got anything to do with it i think he just looks at all women like that as if he wants to eat them you see suddenly i know its true i thought that way he had of staring into my eyes was special to me but now hes doing just the same thing to di he was even doing it to my mother its just something he does automatically whenever he looks at a woman i expect he even looks at june weatherby like that chapter thirteen coloured white mum squeezes my shoulder never mind dear she says anyway i dont think dianas interested in him do you over the sound of the music we hear brad asking diana if she wants to look at his paintings no thank you she says im not really interested in art i prefer stories im looking forward to reading alexs story shes a childrens writer did you know good old di my mother goes over to them id like to see your paintings brad she says very much indeed but brad doesnt look very happy with this idea oh would you mrs er willow he says well do please go and look the studios at the top of the stairs on the left and off mum goes looking a little annoyed that brad doesnt want to show his pictures to her himself a loud song is playing on the stereo and i cant hear what brad and di are saying any longer im just about to get up and go for a walk or do anything that takes me away from brad when barry comes in has the party got going yet he asks sitting on the arm of my chair it has for some people i say looking at di and brad barry looks at them too then he looks at me your mums keeping christopher happy upstairs he says do you feel like going for a short walk with me but at that moment diana breaks away from brad come on you two she says this is supposed to be a party lets have some dancing i must tell you ive never felt less like dancing in all my life yet somehow there i am with the rest of them moving my body to the music brad doesnt look as if he wants to dance either actually he isnt very good at it its quite surprising actually the way he looks so well unnatural is as good a way of describing it as any he doesnt seem to have a sense of rhythm at all whereas barrys always been a really good dancer much better than i am do you mind if i borrow barry for a salsa diana asks me when a south american song starts playing and i shake my head of course not brad and i stand and watch if youve ever seen a couple salsa dancing youll know how close the man and womans bodies get to each other they touch almost all the time in fact sometimes salsa dancing can look a lot like making love im not sure you should have agreed to that brad tells me i think your friends trying to steal your boyfriend of course she isnt i say but suddenly watching di and barry together i feel really well strange and somehow i cant help remembering how they were laughing together in the kitchen earlier on perhaps we should make them jealous brad suggests and next thing i know hes taken me into his arms and hes bending his head and hes kissing me after that everything happens at once barry and diana stop dancing somebody rings on the doorbell i push brad away from me so hard he almost falls over mum comes into the room she appears to be wearing some sort of strange paper hat it looks as if it might be made from one of brads drawings from the studio then christopher rushes in hes holding something a picture look he says ive painted a picture of the christmas tree the doorbell rings again but the sound is drowned by brads cry my painting he screams my white painting christopher what have you done oh says my mother i gave him that to paint on sorry did i do something wrong it didnt look as if there was anything on it there is a long silence broken only by the ringing of the doorbell then suddenly i hear someone laughing i dont realise at first that its me m sorry oh im so sorry brad i say but its no good i cant help it you see the white picture looks so much better with a little bit of colour on it bright christmassy colour brad looks at me as if he hates me alex he says as of this moment you are no longer an employee of the courtney art gallery i suggest you leave at once and you can take your family and friends with you and suddenly everyones laughing everyone me barry di mum and even christopher in fact the only person not laughing is brad come on says barry through his laughter i think wed better go the doorbells still ringing when we open the door we find three people waiting outside a man a woman and tania mummy shouts christopher daddy and the man pushes past tania to pick up his son and lift him high into the air hello son he says wow look at that christmas tree its almost as big as the one weve got at home waiting for you to decorate when christopher comes back down to earth we all crowd round him in a big happy group somehow tania manages to push her way past us brad she says who are all these horrible people we all leave soon after that christopher goes home with his parents diana gives my mother a lift back to rottingdean and i well i go with barry at first were rather quiet with each other i think we both feel a little shy either that or we both know that whatever we say to each other in the next hour or so is really important finally barry looks at me do you feel like going for a walk he asks and i nod yes id like that we could go up firle beacon if youre wearing the right shoes for it we both look down at my unsuitable shoes these are fine i say there might be mud barry says doubtfully its ok i say the fact is i just want to be with barry in rain in mud anywhere i know you might find that difficult to believe after all ive said about him but its true you see when i saw barry and di dancing like that it did feel really strange oh i know it was only a dance to them but it did make me think for the first time i thought about what it would be like if i didnt see barry any more what it would be like if he got a new girlfriend it wasnt a pleasant thought at all and suddenly i knew why id never managed to tell barry it was over between us i hadnt really wanted it to be over for a moment there i thought you were attracted to brad barry says as we walk along a path through the mud no i say taking his hand and strange as it sounds it isnt a lie honestly i know ive wanted brad to kiss me for weeks i know i said i wanted to marry him and have his babies but the fact is when he kissed me nothing happened i didnt feel anything not one thing diana was right i had a crush on brad i was attracted to him because of his good looks and i thought that meant i was in love with him but the truth is i didnt know him at all these last few days ive had the chance to get to know him much better and well i now realise ive never seen him properly in my mind i made brad into the type of person i wanted him to be but that brad never really existed brads never been interested in me hes not even very interested in his nephew brad is only interested in brad in fact hes really rather shallow oh alex barry says suddenly look at your legs i look down at myself im covered in mud it isnt only on my legs but all over my clothes too it doesnt matter i say barry laughs putting his arm around me no he says it doesnt does it chapter fourteen happy christmas well its christmas day im at my parents house as usual weve just eaten a huge christmas dinner roast turkey carrots and potatoes as usual weve sung some christmas carols together also as usual the one very unusual thing is that barrys here with us hes sitting between mum and me on the sofa he arrived about ten oclock this morning with a huge bag of presents and spent the morning helping mum with the dinner i could tell mum was a bit doubtful at first but that was because shes used to my dad and my brother being so hopeless in the kitchen barrys actually quite good anyway me and dad could hear mum and barry chatting away in the kitchen as they worked so maybe she doesnt think hes boring any more besides i think shes missing my brother a little this year hes fallen in love with a girl in scotland called sky so he isnt with us this year sky remember i told you he lives on the isle of skye very appropriate any moment now well start opening our christmas presents but before that let me tell you whats been happening over the past few days apart from me rushing about doing my lastminute christmas shopping i read in the newspaper that the man who gave brad that black eye has been arrested so presumably brad returned to the police station to look at some more photographs i dont know if tania went with him but i do know that she and brad are engaged to be married in the circumstances because tania is a difficult b unpleasant and c impossible to please i dont think i can say that brads story has a happy ending as for christophers story his parents were so grateful to me for looking after him they sent di round with some kiss flowers my third bunch in less than a week and me well barry took me to a salsa dance the other night i couldnt do the dance properly but it was very nice to be held as closely as that were going to go to lessons together in the new year also youll be very glad to know that as well as the shopping and the salsa dancing i have found the time to read through my story again and i still like it straight after christmas im going to start typing it up time for presents mum says now here you are barry dear a very happy christmas to you thank you willow he says and opens the package she hands to him inside is the brightest shirt that has ever been made anywhere in the world ever no chance of anyone accusing barry of being boring in that i give barry a painting a painting of a bridge well he does like bridges did you get this from the courtney art gallery he asks me smiling no definitely not i laugh brad would hate this painting it looks like a bridge you see well i think its beautiful barry says thank you alex thank you very much then its time for me to open my present from him whatever it is its in an excitingly large box carefully i open it and put my hand inside i touch something that feels like a shoe ski boots barry tells me smiling i thought you could use some to go with this he hands me an envelope inside there are two plane tickets to austria i thought you might like to go on a skiing holiday he says and then im screaming and kissing him both at the same time by the way thats another thing ive changed my mind about barry can be as nice to me as he wants to be later on me and barry leave my mum and dad playing a game of cards and go for a walk along the seafront in the dark together barry i say to him when my fortieth birthday comes round do you mind if we just stay in together and watch television he looks surprised no of course not no balloons no songs he laughs was it that terrible i nod sorry i just wanted you to be in no doubt about how crazy i am about you but i promise when youre forty we can do whatever you like when i look up at barry he bends to kiss me im kissing him back enthusiastically when suddenly i hear a crashing sound behind me look out barry warns me but too late sea water falls from the sky and lands on both our heads we forgot to play the running from the waves game i cry rubbing the water from my eyes and barry grabs my hand well lets play it now then he says just as another wave bangs against the wall and shoots up into the air yeeess i scream and we run madly along in the darkness racing the wave and after that one we do it with the next one and the next and yes im very wet and very cold and yes its a crazy kind of thing to do on christmas day im certain my parents have done it many times oh and of course im not wearing the right shoes for such an activity you didnt really think i would be did you the end
