afterward afterward by edith wharton i oh there is one of course but youll never know it the assertion laughingly flung out six months earlier in a bright june garden came back to mary boyne with a sharp perception of its latent significance as she stood in the december dusk waiting for the lamps to be brought into the library the words had been spoken by their friend alida stair as they sat at tea on her lawn at pangbourne in reference to the very house of which the library in question was the central the pivotal feature mary boyne and her husband in quest of a country place in one of the southern or southwestern counties had on their arrival in england carried their problem straight to alida stair who had successfully solved it in her own case but it was not until they had rejected almost capriciously several practical and judicious suggestions that she threw it out well theres lyng in dorsetshire it belongs to hugos cousins and you can get it for a song the reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms its remoteness from a station its lack of electric light hotwater pipes and other vulgar necessities were exactly those pleading in its favor with two romantic americans perversely in search of the economic drawbacks which were associated in their tradition with unusual architectural felicities i should never believe i was living in an old house unless i was thoroughly uncomfortable ned boyne the more extravagant of the two had jocosely insisted the least hint of convenience would make me think it had been bought out of an exhibition with the pieces numbered and set up again and they had proceeded to enumerate with humorous precision their various suspicions and exactions refusing to believe that the house their cousin recommended was really tudor till they learned it had no heating system or that the village church was literally in the grounds till she assured them of the deplorable uncertainty of the water supply its too uncomfortable to be true edward boyne had continued to exult as the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her but he had cut short his rhapsody to ask with a sudden relapse to distrust and the ghost youve been concealing from us the fact that there is no ghost mary at the moment had laughed with him yet almost with her laugh being possessed of several sets of independent perceptions had noted a sudden flatness of tone in alidas answering hilarity oh dorsetshires full of ghosts you know yes yes but that wont do i dont want to have to drive ten miles to see somebody elses ghost i want one of my own on the premises is there a ghost at lyng his rejoinder had made alida laugh again and it was then that she had flung back tantalizingly oh there is one of course but youll never know it never know it boyne pulled her up but what in the world constitutes a ghost except the fact of its being known for one i cant say but thats the story that theres a ghost but that nobody knows its a ghost well not till afterward at any rate till afterward not till long long afterward but if its once been identified as an unearthly visitant why hasnt its signalement been handed down in the family how has it managed to preserve its incognito alida could only shake her head dont ask me but it has and then suddenly mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of divination suddenly long afterward one says to ones self that was it she was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question fell on the banter of the other two and she saw the shadow of the same surprise flit across alidas clear pupils i suppose so one just has to wait oh hang waiting ned broke in lifes too short for a ghost who can only be enjoyed in retrospect cant we do better than that mary but it turned out that in the event they were not destined to for within three months of their conversation with mrs stair they were established at lyng and the life they had yearned for to the point of planning it out in all its daily details had actually begun for them it was to sit in the thick december dusk by just such a widehooded fireplace under just such black oak rafters with the sense that beyond the mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude it was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that mary boyne had endured for nearly fourteen years the souldeadening ugliness of the middle west and that boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering till with a suddenness that still made her blink the prodigious windfall of the blue star mine had put them at a stroke in possession of life and the leisure to taste it they had never for a moment meant their new state to be one of idleness but they meant to give themselves only to harmonious activities she had her vision of painting and gardening against a background of gray walls he dreamed of the production of his longplanned book on the economic basis of culture and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too sequestered they could not get far enough from the world or plunge deep enough into the past dorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of remoteness out of all proportion to its geographical position but to the boynes it was one of the everrecurring wonders of the whole incredibly compressed island a nest of counties as they put it that for the production of its effects so little of a given quality went so far that so few miles made a distance and so short a distance a difference its that ned had once enthusiastically explained that gives such depth to their effects such relief to their least contrasts theyve been able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful the butter had certainly been laid on thick at lyng the old gray house hidden under a shoulder of the downs had almost all the finer marks of commerce with a protracted past the mere fact that it was neither large nor exceptional made it to the boynes abound the more richly in its special sense the sense of having been for centuries a deep dim reservoir of life the life had probably not been of the most vivid order for long periods no doubt it had fallen as noiselessly into the past as the quiet drizzle of autumn fell hour after hour into the green fishpond between the yews but these backwaters of existence sometimes breed in their sluggish depths strange acuities of emotion and mary boyne had felt from the first the occasional brush of an intenser memory the feeling had never been stronger than on the december afternoon when waiting in the library for the belated lamps she rose from her seat and stood among the shadows of the hearth her husband had gone off after luncheon for one of his long tramps on the downs she had noticed of late that he preferred to be unaccompanied on these occasions and in the tried security of their personal relations had been driven to conclude that his book was bothering him and that he needed the afternoons to turn over in solitude the problems left from the mornings work certainly the book was not going as smoothly as she had imagined it would and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been there in his engineering days then he had often looked fagged to the verge of illness but the native demon of worry had never branded his brow yet the few pages he had so far read to her the introduction and a synopsis of the opening chapter gave evidences of a firm possession of his subject and a deepening confidence in his powers the fact threw her into deeper perplexity since now that he had done with business and its disturbing contingencies the one other possible element of anxiety was eliminated unless it were his health then but physically he had gained since they had come to dorsetshire grown robuster ruddier and freshereyed it was only within a week that she had felt in him the undefinable change that made her restless in his absence and as tonguetied in his presence as though it were she who had a secret to keep from him the thought that there was a secret somewhere between them struck her with a sudden smart rap of wonder and she looked about her down the dim long room can it be the house she mused the room itself might have been full of secrets they seemed to be piling themselves up as evening fell like the layers and layers of velvet shadow dropping from the low ceiling the dusky walls of books the smokeblurred sculpture of the hooded hearth why of course the house is haunted she reflected the ghost alidas imperceptible ghost after figuring largely in the banter of their first month or two at lyng had been gradually discarded as too ineffectual for imaginative use mary had indeed as became the tenant of a haunted house made the customary inquiries among her few rural neighbors but beyond a vague they du say so maam the villagers had nothing to impart the elusive specter had apparently never had sufficient identity for a legend to crystallize about it and after a time the boynes had laughingly set the matter down to their profitandloss account agreeing that lyng was one of the few houses good enough in itself to dispense with supernatural enhancements and i suppose poor ineffectual demon thats why it beats its beautiful wings in vain in the void mary had laughingly concluded or rather ned answered in the same strain why amid so much thats ghostly it can never affirm its separate existence as the ghost and thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out of their references which were numerous enough to make them promptly unaware of the loss now as she stood on the hearth the subject of their earlier curiosity revived in her with a new sense of its meaning a sense gradually acquired through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking mystery it was the house itself of course that possessed the ghostseeing faculty that communed visually but secretly with its own past and if one could only get into close enough communion with the house one might surprise its secret and acquire the ghostsight on ones own account perhaps in his long solitary hours in this very room where she never trespassed till the afternoon her husband had acquired it already and was silently carrying the dread weight of whatever it had revealed to him mary was too wellversed in the code of the spectral world not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts one saw to do so was almost as great a breach of goodbreeding as to name a lady in a club but this explanation did not really satisfy her what after all except for the fun of the frisson she reflected would he really care for any of their old ghosts and thence she was thrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma the fact that ones greater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had no particular bearing on the case since when one did see a ghost at lyng one did not know it not till long afterward alida stair had said well supposing ned had seen one when they first came and had known only within the last week what had happened to him more and more under the spell of the hour she threw back her searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy but at first only to recall a gay confusion of unpacking settling arranging of books and calling to each other from remote corners of the house as treasure after treasure of their habitation revealed itself to them it was in this particular connection that she presently recalled a certain soft afternoon of the previous october when passing from the first rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed inspection of the old house she had pressed like a novel heroine a panel that opened at her touch on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an unsuspected flat ledge of the roof the roof which from below seemed to slope away on all sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scale the view from this hidden coign was enchanting and she had flown down to snatch ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery she remembered still how standing on the narrow ledge he had passed his arm about her while their gaze flew to the long tossed horizonline of the downs and then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque of yew hedges about the fishpond and the shadow of the cedar on the lawn and now the other way he had said gently turning her about within his arm and closely pressed to him she had absorbed like some long satisfying draft the picture of the graywalled court the squat lions on the gates and the limeavenue reaching up to the highroad under the downs it was just then while they gazed and held each other that she had felt his arm relax and heard a sharp hullo that made her turn to glance at him distinctly yes she now recalled she had seen as she glanced a shadow of anxiety of perplexity rather fall across his face and following his eyes had beheld the figure of a man a man in loose grayish clothes as it appeared to her who was sauntering down the limeavenue to the court with the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way her shortsighted eyes had given her but a blurred impression of slightness and grayness with something foreign or at least unlocal in the cut of the figure or its garb but her husband had apparently seen more seen enough to make him push past her with a sharp wait and dash down the twisting stairs without pausing to give her a hand for the descent a slight tendency to dizziness obliged her after a provisional clutch at the chimney against which they had been leaning to follow him down more cautiously and when she had reached the attic landing she paused again for a less definite reason leaning over the oak banister to strain her eyes through the silence of the brown sunflecked depths below she lingered there till somewhere in those depths she heard the closing of a door then mechanically impelled she went down the shallow flights of steps till she reached the lower hall the front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court and hall and court were empty the library door was open too and after listening in vain for any sound of voices within she quickly crossed the threshold and found her husband alone vaguely fingering the papers on his desk he looked up as if surprised at her precipitate entrance but the shadow of anxiety had passed from his face leaving it even as she fancied a little brighter and clearer than usual what was it who was it she asked who he repeated with the surprise still all on his side the man we saw coming toward the house he seemed honestly to reflect the man why i thought i saw peters i dashed after him to say a word about the stabledrains but he had disappeared before i could get down disappeared why he seemed to be walking so slowly when we saw him boyne shrugged his shoulders so i thought but he must have got up steam in the interval what do you say to our trying a scramble up meldon steep before sunset that was all at the time the occurrence had been less than nothing had indeed been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first vision from meldon steep a height which they had dreamed of climbing ever since they had first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the low roof of lyng doubtless it was the mere fact of the other incidents having occurred on the very day of their ascent to meldon that had kept it stored away in the unconscious fold of association from which it now emerged for in itself it had no mark of the portentous at the moment there could have been nothing more natural than that ned should dash himself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen it was the period when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the specialists employed about the place always lying in wait for them and dashing out at them with questions reproaches or reminders and certainly in the distance the gray figure had looked like peters yet now as she reviewed the rapid scene she felt her husbands explanation of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his face why had the familiar appearance of peters made him anxious why above all if it was of such prime necessity to confer with that authority on the subject of the stabledrains had the failure to find him produced such a look of relief mary could not say that any one of these considerations had occurred to her at the time yet from the promptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her summons she had a sudden sense that they must all along have been there waiting their hour ii weary with her thoughts she moved toward the window the library was now completely dark and she was surprised to see how much faint light the outer world still held as she peered out into it across the court a figure shaped itself in the tapering perspective of bare lines it looked a mere blot of deeper gray in the grayness and for an instant as it moved toward her her heart thumped to the thought its the ghost she had time in that long instant to feel suddenly that the man of whom two months earlier she had a brief distant vision from the roof was now at his predestined hour about to reveal himself as not having been peters and her spirit sank under the impending fear of the disclosure but almost with the next tick of the clock the ambiguous figure gaining substance and character showed itself even to her weak sight as her husbands and she turned away to meet him as he entered with the confession of her folly its really too absurd she laughed out from the threshold but i never can remember remember what boyne questioned as they drew together that when one sees the lyng ghost one never knows it her hand was on his sleeve and he kept it there but with no response in his gesture or in the lines of his fagged preoccupied face did you think youd seen it he asked after an appreciable interval why i actually took you for it my dear in my mad determination to spot it me just now his arm dropped away and he turned from her with a faint echo of her laugh really dearest youd better give it up if thats the best you can do yes i give it up i give it up have you she asked turning round on him abruptly the parlormaid had entered with letters and a lamp and the light struck up into boynes face as he bent above the tray she presented have you mary perversely insisted when the servant had disappeared on her errand of illumination have i what he rejoined absently the light bringing out the sharp stamp of worry between his brows as he turned over the letters given up trying to see the ghost her heart beat a little at the experiment she was making her husband laying his letters aside moved away into the shadow of the hearth i never tried he said tearing open the wrapper of a newspaper well of course mary persisted the exasperating thing is that theres no use trying since one cant be sure till so long afterward he was unfolding the paper as if he had hardly heard her but after a pause during which the sheets rustled spasmodically between his hands he lifted his head to say abruptly have you any idea how long mary had sunk into a low chair beside the fireplace from her seat she looked up startled at her husbands profile which was darkly projected against the circle of lamplight no none have you she retorted repeating her former phrase with an added keenness of intention boyne crumpled the paper into a bunch and then inconsequently turned back with it toward the lamp lord no i only meant he explained with a faint tinge of impatience is there any legend any tradition as to that not that i know of she answered but the impulse to add what makes you ask was checked by the reappearance of the parlormaid with tea and a second lamp with the dispersal of shadows and the repetition of the daily domestic office mary boyne felt herself less oppressed by that sense of something mutely imminent which had darkened her solitary afternoon for a few moments she gave herself silently to the details of her task and when she looked up from it she was struck to the point of bewilderment by the change in her husbands face he had seated himself near the farther lamp and was absorbed in the perusal of his letters but was it something he had found in them or merely the shifting of her own point of view that had restored his features to their normal aspect the longer she looked the more definitely the change affirmed itself the lines of painful tension had vanished and such traces of fatigue as lingered were of the kind easily attributable to steady mental effort he glanced up as if drawn by her gaze and met her eyes with a smile im dying for my tea you know and heres a letter for you he said she took the letter he held out in exchange for the cup she proffered him and returning to her seat broke the seal with the languid gesture of the reader whose interests are all inclosed in the circle of one cherished presence her next conscious motion was that of starting to her feet the letter falling to them as she rose while she held out to her husband a long newspaper clipping ned whats this what does it mean he had risen at the same instant almost as if hearing her cry before she uttered it and for a perceptible space of time he and she studied each other like adversaries watching for an advantage across the space between her chair and his desk whats what you fairly made me jump boyne said at length moving toward her with a sudden halfexasperated laugh the shadow of apprehension was on his face again not now a look of fixed foreboding but a shifting vigilance of lips and eyes that gave her the sense of his feeling himself invisibly surrounded her hand shook so that she could hardly give him the clipping this article from the waukesha sentinel that a man named elwell has brought suit against you that there was something wrong about the blue star mine i cant understand more than half they continued to face each other as she spoke and to her astonishment she saw that her words had the almost immediate effect of dissipating the strained watchfulness of his look oh that he glanced down the printed slip and then folded it with the gesture of one who handles something harmless and familiar whats the matter with you this afternoon mary i thought youd got bad news she stood before him with her undefinable terror subsiding slowly under the reassuring touch of his composure you knew about this then its all right certainly i knew about it and its all right but what is it i dont understand what does this man accuse you of oh pretty nearly every crime in the calendar boyne had tossed the clipping down and thrown himself comfortably into an armchair near the fire do you want to hear the story its not particularly interesting just a squabble over interests in the blue star but who is this elwell i dont know the name oh hes a fellow i put into it gave him a hand up i told you all about him at the time i daresay i must have forgotten vainly she strained back among her memories but if you helped him why does he make this return oh probably some shyster lawyer got hold of him and talked him over its all rather technical and complicated i thought that kind of thing bored you his wife felt a sting of compunction theoretically she deprecated the american wifes detachment from her husbands professional interests but in practice she had always found it difficult to fix her attention on boynes report of the transactions in which his varied interests involved him besides she had felt from the first that in a community where the amenities of living could be obtained only at the cost of efforts as arduous as her husbands professional labors such brief leisure as they could command should be used as an escape from immediate preoccupations a flight to the life they always dreamed of living once or twice now that this new life had actually drawn its magic circle about them she had asked herself if she had done right but hitherto such conjectures had been no more than the retrospective excursions of an active fancy now for the first time it startled her a little to find how little she knew of the material foundation on which her happiness was built she glanced again at her husband and was reassured by the composure of his face yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her reassurance but doesnt this suit worry you why have you never spoken to me about it he answered both questions at once i didnt speak of it at first because it did worry me annoyed me rather but its all ancient history now your correspondent must have got hold of a back number of the sentinel she felt a quick thrill of relief you mean its over hes lost his case there was a just perceptible delay in boynes reply the suits been withdrawn thats all but she persisted as if to exonerate herself from the inward charge of being too easily put off withdrawn because he saw he had no chance oh he had no chance boyne answered she was still struggling with a dimly felt perplexity at the back of her thoughts how long ago was it withdrawn he paused as if with a slight return of his former uncertainty ive just had the news now but ive been expecting it just now in one of your letters yes in one of my letters she made no answer and was aware only after a short interval of waiting that he had risen and strolling across the room had placed himself on the sofa at her side she felt him as he did so pass an arm about her she felt his hand seek hers and clasp it and turning slowly drawn by the warmth of his cheek she met the smiling clearness of his eyes its all right its all right she questioned through the flood of her dissolving doubts and i give you my word it never was righter he laughed back at her holding her close iii one of the strangest things she was afterward to recall out of all the next days incredible strangeness was the sudden and complete recovery of her sense of security it was in the air when she woke in her lowceilinged dusky room it accompanied her downstairs to the breakfasttable flashed out at her from the fire and reduplicated itself brightly from the flanks of the urn and the sturdy flutings of the georgian teapot it was as if in some roundabout way all her diffused apprehensions of the previous day with their moment of sharp concentration about the newspaper article as if this dim questioning of the future and startled return upon the pasthad between them liquidated the arrears of some haunting moral obligation if she had indeed been careless of her husbands affairs it was her new state seemed to prove because her faith in him instinctively justified such carelessness and his right to her faith had overwhelmingly affirmed itself in the very face of menace and suspicion she had never seen him more untroubled more naturally and unconsciously in possession of himself than after the crossexamination to which she had subjected him it was almost as if he had been aware of her lurking doubts and had wanted the air cleared as much as she did it was as clear thank heaven as the bright outer light that surprised her almost with a touch of summer when she issued from the house for her daily round of the gardens she had left boyne at his desk indulging herself as she passed the library door by a last peep at his quiet face where he bent pipe in his mouth above his papers and now she had her own mornings task to perform the task involved on such charmed winter days almost as much delighted loitering about the different quarters of her demesne as if spring were already at work on shrubs and borders there were such inexhaustible possibilities still before her such opportunities to bring out the latent graces of the old place without a single irreverent touch of alteration that the winter months were all too short to plan what spring and autumn executed and her recovered sense of safety gave on this particular morning a peculiar zest to her progress through the sweet still place she went first to the kitchengarden where the espalier peartrees drew complicated patterns on the walls and pigeons were fluttering and preening about the silveryslated roof of their cot there was something wrong about the piping of the hothouse and she was expecting an authority from dorchester who was to drive out between trains and make a diagnosis of the boiler but when she dipped into the damp heat of the greenhouses among the spiced scents and waxy pinks and reds of oldfashioned exotics even the flora of lyng was in the noteshe learned that the great man had not arrived and the day being too rare to waste in an artificial atmosphere she came out again and paced slowly along the springy turf of the bowlinggreen to the gardens behind the house at their farther end rose a grass terrace commanding over the fishpond and the yew hedges a view of the long housefront with its twisted chimneystacks and the blue shadows of its roof angles all drenched in the pale gold moisture of the air seen thus across the level tracery of the yews under the suffused mild light it sent her from its open windows and hospitably smoking chimneys the look of some warm human presence of a mind slowly ripened on a sunny wall of experience she had never before had so deep a sense of her intimacy with it such a conviction that its secrets were all beneficent kept as they said to children for ones good so complete a trust in its power to gather up her life and neds into the harmonious pattern of the long long story it sat there weaving in the sun she heard steps behind her and turned expecting to see the gardener accompanied by the engineer from dorchester but only one figure was in sight that of a youngish slightly built man who for reasons she could not on the spot have specified did not remotely resemble her preconceived notion of an authority on hothouse boilers the newcomer on seeing her lifted his hat and paused with the air of a gentleman perhaps a travelerdesirous of having it immediately known that his intrusion is involuntary the local fame of lyng occasionally attracted the more intelligent sightseer and mary halfexpected to see the stranger dissemble a camera or justify his presence by producing it but he made no gesture of any sort and after a moment she asked in a tone responding to the courteous deprecation of his attitude is there any one you wish to see i came to see mr boyne he replied his intonation rather than his accent was faintly american and mary at the familiar note looked at him more closely the brim of his soft felt hat cast a shade on his face which thus obscured wore to her shortsighted gaze a look of seriousness as of a person arriving on business and civilly but firmly aware of his rights past experience had made mary equally sensible to such claims but she was jealous of her husbands morning hours and doubtful of his having given any one the right to intrude on them have you an appointment with mr boyne she asked he hesitated as if unprepared for the question not exactly an appointment he replied then im afraid this being his workingtime that he cant receive you now will you give me a message or come back later the visitor again lifting his hat briefly replied that he would come back later and walked away as if to regain the front of the house as his figure receded down the walk between the yew hedges mary saw him pause and look up an instant at the peaceful housefront bathed in faint winter sunshine and it struck her with a tardy touch of compunction that it would have been more humane to ask if he had come from a distance and to offer in that case to inquire if her husband could receive him but as the thought occurred to her he passed out of sight behind a pyramidal yew and at the same moment her attention was distracted by the approach of the gardener attended by the bearded pepperandsalt figure of the boilermaker from dorchester the encounter with this authority led to such farreaching issues that they resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train and beguiled mary into spending the remainder of the morning in absorbed confabulation among the greenhouses she was startled to find when the colloquy ended that it was nearly luncheontime and she half expected as she hurried back to the house to see her husband coming out to meet her but she found no one in the court but an undergardener raking the gravel and the hall when she entered it was so silent that she guessed boyne to be still at work behind the closed door of the library not wishing to disturb him she turned into the drawingroom and there at her writingtable lost herself in renewed calculations of the outlay to which the mornings conference had committed her the knowledge that she could permit herself such follies had not yet lost its novelty and somehow in contrast to the vague apprehensions of the previous days it now seemed an element of her recovered security of the sense that as ned had said things in general had never been righter she was still luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the parlormaid from the threshold roused her with a dubiously worded inquiry as to the expediency of serving luncheon it was one of their jokes that trimmle announced luncheon as if she were divulging a state secret and mary intent upon her papers merely murmured an absentminded assent she felt trimmle wavering expressively on the threshold as if in rebuke of such offhand acquiescence then her retreating steps sounded down the passage and mary pushing away her papers crossed the hall and went to the library door it was still closed and she wavered in her turn disliking to disturb her husband yet anxious that he should not exceed his normal measure of work as she stood there balancing her impulses the esoteric trimmle returned with the announcement of luncheon and mary thus impelled opened the door and went into the library boyne was not at his desk and she peered about her expecting to discover him at the bookshelves somewhere down the length of the room but her call brought no response and gradually it became clear to her that he was not in the library she turned back to the parlormaid mr boyne must be upstairs please tell him that luncheon is ready the parlormaid appeared to hesitate between the obvious duty of obeying orders and an equally obvious conviction of the foolishness of the injunction laid upon her the struggle resulted in her saying doubtfully if you please madam mr boynes not upstairs not in his room are you sure im sure madam mary consulted the clock where is he then hes gone out trimmle announced with the superior air of one who has respectfully waited for the question that a wellordered mind would have first propounded marys previous conjecture had been right then boyne must have gone to the gardens to meet her and since she had missed him it was clear that he had taken the shorter way by the south door instead of going round to the court she crossed the hall to the glass portal opening directly on the yew garden but the parlor maid after another moment of inner conflict decided to bring out recklessly please madam mr boyne didnt go that way mary turned back where did he go and when he went out of the front door up the drive madam it was a matter of principle with trimmle never to answer more than one question at a time up the drive at this hour mary went to the door herself and glanced across the court through the long tunnel of bare limes but its perspective was as empty as when she had scanned it on entering the house did mr boyne leave no message she asked trimmle seemed to surrender herself to a last struggle with the forces of chaos no madam he just went out with the gentleman the gentleman what gentleman mary wheeled about as if to front this new factor the gentleman who called madam said trimmle resignedly when did a gentleman call do explain yourself trimmle only the fact that mary was very hungry and that she wanted to consult her husband about the greenhouses would have caused her to lay so unusual an injunction on her attendant and even now she was detached enough to note in trimmles eye the dawning defiance of the respectful subordinate who has been pressed too hard i couldnt exactly say the hour madam because i didnt let the gentleman in she replied with the air of magnanimously ignoring the irregularity of her mistresss course you didnt let him in no madam when the bell rang i was dressing and agnes go and ask agnes then mary interjected trimmle still wore her look of patient magnanimity agnes would not know madam for she had unfortunately burnt her hand in trying the wick of the new lamp from town trimmle as mary was aware had always been opposed to the new lamp and so mrs dockett sent the kitchenmaid instead mary looked again at the clock its after two go and ask the kitchenmaid if mr boyne left any word she went into luncheon without waiting and trimmle presently brought her there the kitchenmaids statement that the gentleman had called about one oclock that mr boyne had gone out with him without leaving any message the kitchenmaid did not even know the callers name for he had written it on a slip of paper which he had folded and handed to her with the injunction to deliver it at once to mr boyne mary finished her luncheon still wondering and when it was over and trimmle had brought the coffee to the drawingroom her wonder had deepened to a first faint tinge of disquietude it was unlike boyne to absent himself without explanation at so unwonted an hour and the difficulty of identifying the visitor whose summons he had apparently obeyed made his disappearance the more unaccountable mary boynes experience as the wife of a busy engineer subject to sudden calls and compelled to keep irregular hours had trained her to the philosophic acceptance of surprises but since boynes withdrawal from business he had adopted a benedictine regularity of life as if to make up for the dispersed and agitated years with their standup lunches and dinners rattled down to the joltings of the diningcar he cultivated the last refinements of punctuality and monotony discouraging his wifes fancy for the unexpected and declaring that to a delicate taste there were infinite gradations of pleasure in the fixed recurrences of habit still since no life can completely defend itself from the unforeseen it was evident that all boynes precautions would sooner or later prove unavailable and mary concluded that he had cut short a tiresome visit by walking with his caller to the station or at least accompanying him for part of the way this conclusion relieved her from farther preoccupation and she went out herself to take up her conference with the gardener thence she walked to the village postoffice a mile or so away and when she turned toward home the early twilight was setting in she had taken a footpath across the downs and as boyne meanwhile had probably returned from the station by the highroad there was little likelihood of their meeting on the way she felt sure however of his having reached the house before her so sure that when she entered it herself without even pausing to inquire of trimmle she made directly for the library but the library was still empty and with an unwonted precision of visual memory she immediately observed that the papers on her husbands desk lay precisely as they had lain when she had gone in to call him to luncheon then of a sudden she was seized by a vague dread of the unknown she had closed the door behind her on entering and as she stood alone in the long silent shadowy room her dread seemed to take shape and sound to be there audibly breathing and lurking among the shadows her shortsighted eyes strained through them half discerning an actual presence something aloof that watched and knew and in the recoil from that intangible propinquity she threw herself suddenly on the bellrope and gave it a desperate pull the long quavering summons brought trimmle in precipitately with a lamp and mary breathed again at this sobering reappearance of the usual you may bring tea if mr boyne is in she said to justify her ring very well madam but mr boyne is not in said trimmle putting down the lamp not in you mean hes come back and gone out again no madam hes never been back the dread stirred again and mary knew that now it had her fast not since he went out with the gentleman not since he went out with the gentleman but who was the gentleman mary gasped out with the sharp note of some one trying to be heard through a confusion of meaningless noises that i couldnt say madam trimmle standing there by the lamp seemed suddenly to grow less round and rosy as though eclipsed by the same creeping shade of apprehension but the kitchenmaid knows wasnt it the kitchenmaid who let him in she doesnt know either madam for he wrote his name on a folded paper mary through her agitation was aware that they were both designating the unknown visitor by a vague pronoun instead of the conventional formula which till then had kept their allusions within the bounds of custom and at the same moment her mind caught at the suggestion of the folded paper but he must have a name where is the paper she moved to the desk and began to turn over the scattered documents that littered it the first that caught her eye was an unfinished letter in her husbands hand with his pen lying across it as though dropped there at a sudden summons my dear parvis who was parvis i have just received your letter announcing elwells death and while i suppose there is now no farther risk of trouble it might be safer she tossed the sheet aside and continued her search but no folded paper was discoverable among the letters and pages of manuscript which had been swept together in a promiscuous heap as if by a hurried or a startled gesture but the kitchenmaid saw him send her here she commanded wondering at her dullness in not thinking sooner of so simple a solution trimmle at the behest vanished in a flash as if thankful to be out of the room and when she reappeared conducting the agitated underling mary had regained her selfpossession and had her questions pat the gentleman was a stranger yes that she understood but what had he said and above all what had he looked like the first question was easily enough answered for the disconcerting reason that he had said so little had merely asked for mr boyne and scribbling something on a bit of paper had requested that it should at once be carried in to him then you dont know what he wrote youre not sure it was his name the kitchenmaid was not sure but supposed it was since he had written it in answer to her inquiry as to whom she should announce and when you carried the paper in to mr boyne what did he say the kitchenmaid did not think that mr boyne had said anything but she could not be sure for just as she had handed him the paper and he was opening it she had become aware that the visitor had followed her into the library and she had slipped out leaving the two gentlemen together but then if you left them in the library how do you know that they went out of the house this question plunged the witness into momentary inarticulateness from which she was rescued by trimmle who by means of ingenious circumlocutions elicited the statement that before she could cross the hall to the back passage she had heard the gentlemen behind her and had seen them go out of the front door together then if you saw the gentleman twice you must be able to tell me what he looked like but with this final challenge to her powers of expression it became clear that the limit of the kitchenmaids endurance had been reached the obligation of going to the front door to show in a visitor was in itself so subversive of the fundamental order of things that it had thrown her faculties into hopeless disarray and she could only stammer out after various panting efforts at evocation his hat mum was differentlike as you might say different how different mary flashed out at her her own mind in the same instant leaping back to an image left on it that morning but temporarily lost under layers of subsequent impressions his hat had a wide brim you mean and his face was pale a youngish face mary pressed her with a whitelipped intensity of interrogation but if the kitchenmaid found any adequate answer to this challenge it was swept away for her listener down the rushing current of her own convictions the stranger the stranger in the garden why had mary not thought of him before she needed no one now to tell her that it was he who had called for her husband and gone away with him but who was he and why had boyne obeyed his call iv it leaped out at her suddenly like a grin out of the dark that they had often called england so little such a confoundedly hard place to get lost in a confoundedly hard place to get lost in that had been her husbands phrase and now with the whole machinery of official investigation sweeping its flashlights from shore to shore and across the dividing straits now with boynes name blazing from the walls of every town and village his portrait how that wrung her hawked up and down the country like the image of a hunted criminal now the little compact populous island so policed surveyed and administered revealed itself as a sphinxlike guardian of abysmal mysteries staring back into his wifes anguished eyes as if with the malicious joy of knowing something they would never know in the fortnight since boynes disappearance there had been no word of him no trace of his movements even the usual misleading reports that raise expectancy in tortured bosoms had been few and fleeting no one but the bewildered kitchenmaid had seen him leave the house and no one else had seen the gentleman who accompanied him all inquiries in the neighborhood failed to elicit the memory of a strangers presence that day in the neighborhood of lyng and no one had met edward boyne either alone or in company in any of the neighboring villages or on the road across the downs or at either of the local railwaystations the sunny english noon had swallowed him as completely as if he had gone out into cimmerian night mary while every external means of investigation was working at its highest pressure had ransacked her husbands papers for any trace of antecedent complications of entanglements or obligations unknown to her that might throw a faint ray into the darkness but if any such had existed in the background of boynes life they had disappeared as completely as the slip of paper on which the visitor had written his name there remained no possible thread of guidance except if it were indeed an exception the letter which boyne had apparently been in the act of writing when he received his mysterious summons that letter read and reread by his wife and submitted by her to the police yielded little enough for conjecture to feed on i have just heard of elwells death and while i suppose there is now no farther risk of trouble it might be safer that was all the risk of trouble was easily explained by the newspaper clipping which had apprised mary of the suit brought against her husband by one of his associates in the blue star enterprise the only new information conveyed in the letter was the fact of its showing boyne when he wrote it to be still apprehensive of the results of the suit though he had assured his wife that it had been withdrawn and though the letter itself declared that the plaintiff was dead it took several weeks of exhaustive cabling to fix the identity of the parvis to whom the fragmentary communication was addressed but even after these inquiries had shown him to be a waukesha lawyer no new facts concerning the elwell suit were elicited he appeared to have had no direct concern in it but to have been conversant with the facts merely as an acquaintance and possible intermediary and he declared himself unable to divine with what object boyne intended to seek his assistance this negative information sole fruit of the first fortnights feverish search was not increased by a jot during the slow weeks that followed mary knew that the investigations were still being carried on but she had a vague sense of their gradually slackening as the actual march of time seemed to slacken it was as though the days flying horrorstruck from the shrouded image of the one inscrutable day gained assurance as the distance lengthened till at last they fell back into their normal gait and so with the human imaginations at work on the dark event no doubt it occupied them still but week by week and hour by hour it grew less absorbing took up less space was slowly but inevitably crowded out of the foreground of consciousness by the new problems perpetually bubbling up from the vaporous caldron of human experience even mary boynes consciousness gradually felt the same lowering of velocity it still swayed with the incessant oscillations of conjecture but they were slower more rhythmical in their beat there were moments of overwhelming lassitude when like the victim of some poison which leaves the brain clear but holds the body motionless she saw herself domesticated with the horror accepting its perpetual presence as one of the fixed conditions of life these moments lengthened into hours and days till she passed into a phase of stolid acquiescence she watched the familiar routine of life with the incurious eye of a savage on whom the meaningless processes of civilization make but the faintest impression she had come to regard herself as part of the routine a spoke of the wheel revolving with its motion she felt almost like the furniture of the room in which she sat an insensate object to be dusted and pushed about with the chairs and tables and this deepening apathy held her fast at lyng in spite of the urgent entreaties of friends and the usual medical recommendation of change her friends supposed that her refusal to move was inspired by the belief that her husband would one day return to the spot from which he had vanished and a beautiful legend grew up about this imaginary state of waiting but in reality she had no such belief the depths of anguish inclosing her were no longer lighted by flashes of hope she was sure that boyne would never come back that he had gone out of her sight as completely as if death itself had waited that day on the threshold she had even renounced one by one the various theories as to his disappearance which had been advanced by the press the police and her own agonized imagination in sheer lassitude her mind turned from these alternatives of horror and sank back into the blank fact that he was gone no she would never know what had become of him no one would ever know but the house knew the library in which she spent her long lonely evenings knew for it was here that the last scene had been enacted here that the stranger had come and spoken the word which had caused boyne to rise and follow him the floor she trod had felt his tread the books on the shelves had seen his face and there were moments when the intense consciousness of the old dusky walls seemed about to break out into some audible revelation of their secret but the revelation never came and she knew it would never come lyng was not one of the garrulous old houses that betray the secrets intrusted to them its very legend proved that it had always been the mute accomplice the incorruptible custodian of the mysteries it had surprised and mary boyne sitting face to face with its portentous silence felt the futility of seeking to break it by any human means v i dont say it wasnt straight yet dont say it was straight it was business mary at the words lifted her head with a start and looked intently at the speaker when half an hour before a card with mr parvis on it had been brought up to her she had been immediately aware that the name had been a part of her consciousness ever since she had read it at the head of boynes unfinished letter in the library she had found awaiting her a small neutraltinted man with a bald head and gold eyeglasses and it sent a strange tremor through her to know that this was the person to whom her husbands last known thought had been directed parvis civilly but without vain preamble in the manner of a man who has his watch in his hand had set forth the object of his visit he had run over to england on business and finding himself in the neighborhood of dorchester had not wished to leave it without paying his respects to mrs boyne without asking her if the occasion offered what she meant to do about bob elwells family the words touched the spring of some obscure dread in marys bosom did her visitor after all know what boyne had meant by his unfinished phrase she asked for an elucidation of his question and noticed at once that he seemed surprised at her continued ignorance of the subject was it possible that she really knew as little as she said i know nothing you must tell me she faltered out and her visitor thereupon proceeded to unfold his story it threw even to her confused perceptions and imperfectly initiated vision a lurid glare on the whole hazy episode of the blue star mine her husband had made his money in that brilliant speculation at the cost of getting ahead of some one less alert to seize the chance the victim of his ingenuity was young robert elwell who had put him on to the blue star scheme parvis at marys first startled cry had thrown her a sobering glance through his impartial glasses bob elwell wasnt smart enough thats all if he had been he might have turned round and served boyne the same way its the kind of thing that happens every day in business i guess its what the scientists call the survival of the fittest said mr parvis evidently pleased with the aptness of his analogy mary felt a physical shrinking from the next question she tried to frame it was as though the words on her lips had a taste that nauseated her but then you accuse my husband of doing something dishonorable mr parvis surveyed the question dispassionately oh no i dont i dont even say it wasnt straight he glanced up and down the long lines of books as if one of them might have supplied him with the definition he sought i dont say it wasnt straight and yet i dont say it was straight it was business after all no definition in his category could be more comprehensive than that mary sat staring at him with a look of terror he seemed to her like the indifferent implacable emissary of some dark formless power but mr elwells lawyers apparently did not take your view since i suppose the suit was withdrawn by their advice oh yes they knew he hadnt a leg to stand on technically it was when they advised him to withdraw the suit that he got desperate you see hed borrowed most of the money he lost in the blue star and he was up a tree thats why he shot himself when they told him he had no show the horror was sweeping over mary in great deafening waves he shot himself he killed himself because of that well he didnt kill himself exactly he dragged on two months before he died parvis emitted the statement as unemotionally as a gramophone grinding out its record you mean that he tried to kill himself and failed and tried again oh he didnt have to try again said parvis grimly they sat opposite each other in silence he swinging his eyeglass thoughtfully about his finger she motionless her arms stretched along her knees in an attitude of rigid tension but if you knew all this she began at length hardly able to force her voice above a whisper how is it that when i wrote you at the time of my husbands disappearance you said you didnt understand his letter parvis received this without perceptible discomfiture why i didnt understand it strictly speaking and it wasnt the time to talk about it if i had the elwell business was settled when the suit was withdrawn nothing i could have told you would have helped you to find your husband mary continued to scrutinize him then why are you telling me now still parvis did not hesitate well to begin with i supposed you knew more than you appear to i mean about the circumstances of elwells death and then people are talking of it now the whole matters been raked up again and i thought if you didnt know you ought to she remained silent and he continued you see its only come out lately what a bad state elwells affairs were in his wifes a proud woman and she fought on as long as she could going out to work and taking sewing at home when she got too sicksomething with the heart i believe but she had his bedridden mother to look after and the children and she broke down under it and finally had to ask for help that attracted attention to the case and the papers took it up and a subscription was started everybody out there liked bob elwell and most of the prominent names in the place are down on the list and people began to wonder why parvis broke off to fumble in an inner pocket here he continued heres an account of the whole thing from the sentinel a little sensational of course but i guess youd better look it over he held out a newspaper to mary who unfolded it slowly remembering as she did so the evening when in that same room the perusal of a clipping from the sentinel had first shaken the depths of her security as she opened the paper her eyes shrinking from the glaring headlines widow of boynes victim forced to appeal for aid ran down the column of text to two portraits inserted in it the first was her husbands taken from a photograph made the year they had come to england it was the picture of him that she liked best the one that stood on the writingtable upstairs in her bedroom as the eyes in the photograph met hers she felt it would be impossible to read what was said of him and closed her lids with the sharpness of the pain i thought if you felt disposed to put your name down she heard parvis continue she opened her eyes with an effort and they fell on the other portrait it was that of a youngish man slightly built in rough clothes with features somewhat blurred by the shadow of a projecting hatbrim where had she seen that outline before she stared at it confusedly her heart hammering in her throat and ears then she gave a cry this is the man the man who came for my husband she heard parvis start to his feet and was dimly aware that she had slipped backward into the corner of the sofa and that he was bending above her in alarm with an intense effort she straightened herself and reached out for the paper which she had dropped its the man i should know him anywhere she cried in a voice that sounded in her own ears like a scream parviss voice seemed to come to her from far off down endless fogmuffled windings mrs boyne youre not very well shall i call somebody shall i get a glass of water no no no she threw herself toward him her hand frantically clenching the newspaper i tell you its the man i know him he spoke to me in the garden parvis took the journal from her directing his glasses to the portrait it cant be mrs boyne its robert elwell robert elwell her white stare seemed to travel into space then it was robert elwell who came for him came for boyne the day he went away parviss voice dropped as hers rose he bent over laying a fraternal hand on her as if to coax her gently back into her seat why elwell was dead dont you remember mary sat with her eyes fixed on the picture unconscious of what he was saying dont you remember boynes unfinished letter to me the one you found on his desk that day it was written just after hed heard of elwells death she noticed an odd shake in parviss unemotional voice surely you remember that he urged her yes she remembered that was the profoundest horror of it elwell had died the day before her husbands disappearance and this was elwells portrait and it was the portrait of the man who had spoken to her in the garden she lifted her head and looked slowly about the library the library could have borne witness that it was also the portrait of the man who had come in that day to call boyne from his unfinished letter through the misty surgings of her brain she heard the faint boom of halfforgotten words words spoken by alida stair on the lawn at pangbourne before boyne and his wife had ever seen the house at lyng or had imagined that they might one day live there this was the man who spoke to me she repeated she looked again at parvis he was trying to conceal his disturbance under what he imagined to be an expression of indulgent commiseration but the edges of his lips were blue he thinks me mad but im not mad she reflected and suddenly there flashed upon her a way of justifying her strange affirmation she sat quiet controlling the quiver of her lips and waiting till she could trust her voice to keep its habitual level then she said looking straight at parvis will you answer me one question please when was it that robert elwell tried to kill himself when when parvis stammered yes the date please try to remember she saw that he was growing still more afraid of her i have a reason she insisted gently yes yes only i cant remember about two months before i should say i want the date she repeated parvis picked up the newspaper we might see here he said still humoring her he ran his eyes down the page here it is last october the she caught the words from him the th wasnt it with a sharp look at her he verified yes the th then you did know i know now her white stare continued to travel past him sunday the th that was the day he came first parviss voice was almost inaudible came here first yes you saw him twice then yes twice she breathed it at him with dilated eyes he came first on the th of october i remember the date because it was the day we went up meldon steep for the first time she felt a faint gasp of inward laughter at the thought that but for that she might have forgotten parvis continued to scrutinize her as if trying to intercept her gaze we saw him from the roof she went on he came down the lime avenue toward the house he was dressed just as he is in that picture my husband saw him first he was frightened and ran down ahead of me but there was no one there he had vanished elwell had vanished parvis faltered yes their two whispers seemed to grope for each other i couldnt think what had happened i see now he tried to come then but he wasnt dead enough he couldnt reach us he had to wait for two months and then he came back again and ned went with him she nodded at parvis with the look of triumph of a child who has successfully worked out a difficult puzzle but suddenly she lifted her hands with a desperate gesture pressing them to her bursting temples oh my god i sent him to ned i told him where to go i sent him to this room she screamed out she felt the walls of the room rush toward her like inward falling ruins and she heard parvis a long way off as if through the ruins crying to her and struggling to get at her but she was numb to his touch she did not know what he was saying through the tumult she heard but one clear note the voice of alida stair speaking on the lawn at pangbourne you wont know till afterward it said you wont know till long long afterward
