jeffery deaver the sleeping doll the first book in the kathryn dance series for the g man after changes upon changes we are more or less the same after changes we are more or less the same paul simon the boxer september son of manson found guilty in croyton family murders salinas california daniel raymond pell was convicted today on four counts of firstdegree murder and one count of manslaughter by a monterey county jury after only five hours of deliberations justice has been done lead prosecutor james j reynolds told reporters after the verdict was announced this is an extremely dangerous man who committed horrendous crimes pell became known as the son of manson because of the parallels between his life and that of convicted murderer charles manson who in was responsible for the ritualistic slayings of the actress sharon tate and several other individuals in southern california police found many books and articles about manson in pells house following his arrest the murder convictions were for the may deaths of william croyton his wife and two of their three children in carmel calif miles south of san francisco the manslaughter charge arose from the death of james newberg who lived with pell and accompanied him to the croyton house the night of the murders the prosecutor asserted that newberg initially intended to assist in the murders but was then killed by pell after he changed his mind croyton was a wealthy electrical engineer and computer innovator his cupertino calif company in the heart of silicon valley produces stateoftheart programs that are found in much of the worlds most popular personal computer software because of pells interest in manson there was speculation that the killings had ideological overtones as did the murders for which manson was convicted but robbery was the most likely reason for the breakin reynolds said pell has dozens of prior convictions for shoplifting burglary and robbery dating back to his teens one child survived the attack a daughter theresa pell overlooked the girl who was in her bed asleep and hidden by her toys because of this she became known as the sleeping doll like charles manson the criminal he admired pell exuded a dark charisma and attracted a group of devoted and fanatical followers whom he called his familya term borrowed from the manson clanand over whom he exercised absolute control at the time of the croyton murders this group included newberg and three women all living together in a shabby house in seaside north of monterey calif they are rebecca sheffield linda whitfield and samantha mccoy whitfield is the daughter of lyman whitfield president and ceo of santa clara bank and trust headquartered in cupertino the fourth largest banking chain in the state the women were not charged in the deaths of the croytons or newberg but were convicted of multiple counts of larceny trespass fraud and receiving stolen property whitfield was also convicted of hampering an investigation perjury and destroying evidence as part of a plea bargain sheffield and mccoy were sentenced to three years in prison whitfield to four and a half pells behavior at trial also echoed charles mansons he would sit motionless at the defense table and stare at jurors and witnesses in apparent attempts to intimidate them there were reports that he believed he had psychic powers the defendant was removed once from the courtroom after a witness broke down under his gaze the jury begins sentencing deliberations tomorrow pell could get the death penalty monday chapter the interrogation began like any other kathryn dance entered the interview room and found the fortythreeyearold man sitting at a metal table shackled looking up at her closely subjects always did this of course though never with such astonishing eyes their color was a blue unlike sky or ocean or famous gems good morning she said sitting down across from him and to you replied daniel pell the man who eight years ago had knifed to death four members of a family for reasons hed never shared his voice was soft a slight smile on his bearded face the small sinewy man sat back relaxed his head covered with long grayblack hair was cocked to the side while most jailhouse interrogations were accompanied by a jingling soundtrack of handcuff chains as subjects tried to prove their innocence with broad predictable gestures daniel pell sat perfectly still to dance a specialist in interrogation and kinesicsbody languagepells demeanor and posture suggested caution but also confidence and curiously amusement he wore an orange jumpsuit stenciled with capitola correctional facility on the chest and inmate unnecessarily decorating the back at the moment though pell and dance were not in capitola but rather a secure interview room at the county courthouse in salinas forty miles away pell continued his examination first he took in dances own eyesa green complementary to his blue and framed by square blackrimmed glasses he then regarded her frenchbraided dark blond hair the black jacket and beneath it the thick unrevealing white blouse he noted too the empty holster on her hip he was meticulous and in no hurry interviewers and interviewees share mutual curiosity she told the students in her interrogation seminars theyre studying you as hard as youre studying themusually even harder since they have more to lose dance fished in her blue coach purse for her id card not reacting as she saw a tiny toy bat from last years halloween that either twelveyearold wes his younger sister maggie or possibly both conspirators had slipped into the bag that morning as a practical joke she thought hows this for a contrasting life an hour ago she was having breakfast with her children in the kitchen of their homey victorian house in idyllic pacific grove two exuberant dogs at their feet begging for bacon and now here she sat across a very different table from a convicted murderer she found the id and displayed it he stared for a long moment easing forward dance interesting name wonder where it comes from and the california bureauwhat is that bureau of investigation like an fbi for the state now mr pell you understand that this conversation is being recorded he glanced at the mirror behind which a video camera was humming away you folks think we really believe thats there so we can fix up our hair mirrors werent placed in interrogation rooms to hide cameras and witnessesthere are far better hightech ways to do sobut because people are less inclined to lie when they can see themselves dance gave a faint smile and you understand that you can withdraw from this interview anytime you want and that you have a right to an attorney i know more criminal procedure than the entire graduating class of hastings law rolled up together which is a pretty funny image when you think about it more articulate than dance expected more clever too the previous week daniel raymond pell serving a life sentence for the murders of william croyton his wife and two of their children had approached a fellow prisoner due to be released from capitola and tried to bribe him to run an errand after he was free pell told him about some evidence hed disposed of in a salinas well years ago and explained that he was worried the items would implicate him in the unsolved murder of a wealthy farm owner hed read recently that salinas was revamping its water system this had jogged his memory and hed grown concerned that the evidence would be discovered he wanted the prisoner to find and dispose of it pell picked the wrong man to enlist though the shorttimer spilled to the warden who called the monterey county sheriffs office investigators wondered if pell was talking about the unsolved murder of farm owner robert herron beaten to death a decade ago the murder weapon probably a claw hammer was never found the sheriffs office sent a team to search all the wells in that part of town sure enough they found a tattered tshirt a claw hammer and an empty wallet with the initials rh stamped on it two fingerprints on the hammer were daniel pells the monterey county prosecutor decided to present the case to the grand jury in salinas and asked cbi agent kathryn dance to interview him in hopes of a confession dance now began the interrogation asking how long did you live in the monterey area he seemed surprised that she didnt immediately begin to browbeat a few years where seaside a town of about thirty thousand north of monterey on highway populated mostly by young working families and retirees you got more for your hardearned money there he explained more than in your fancy carmel his eyes alighted on her face his grammar and syntax were good she noted ignoring his fishing expedition for information about her residence dance continued to ask about his life in seaside and in prison observing him the whole while how he behaved when she asked the questions and how he behaved when he answered she wasnt doing this to get informationshed done her homework and knew the answers to everything she askedbut was instead establishing his behavioral baseline in spotting lies interrogators consider three factors nonverbal behavior body language or kinesics verbal quality pitch of voice or pauses before answering and verbal content what the suspect says the first two are far more reliable indications of deception since its much easier to control what we say than how we say it and our bodys natural reaction when we do the baseline is a catalog of those behaviors exhibited when the subject is telling the truth this is the standard the interrogator will compare later with the subjects behavior when he might have a reason to lie any differences between the two suggest deception finally dance had a good profile of the truthful daniel pell and moved to the crux of her mission in this modern sterile courthouse on a foggy morning in june id like to ask you a few questions about robert herron eyes sweeping her now refining their examination the abalone shell necklace which her mother had made at her throat then dances short pinkpolished nails the gray pearl ring on the weddingband finger got two glances how did you meet herron youre assuming i did but no never met him in my life i swear the last sentence was a deception flag though his body language wasnt giving off signals that suggested he was lying but you told the prisoner in capitola that you wanted him to go to the well and find the hammer and wallet no thats what he told the warden pell offered another amused smile why dont you talk to him about it youve got sharp eyes officer dance ive seen them looking me over deciding if im being straight with you ill bet you could tell in a flash that that boy was lying she gave no reaction but reflected that it was very rare for a suspect to realize he was being analyzed kinesically but then how did he know about the evidence in the well oh ive got that figured out somebody stole a hammer of mine killed herron with it and planted it to blame me they wore gloves those rubber ones everybody wears on csi still relaxed the body language wasnt any different from his baseline he was showing only emblemscommon gestures that tended to substitute for words like shrugs and finger pointing there were no adaptors which signal tension or affect displayssigns that he was experiencing emotion but if he wanted to do that dance pointed out wouldnt the killer just call the police then and tell them where the hammer was why wait more than ten years being smart id guess better to bide his time then spring the trap but why would the real killer call the prisoner in capitola why not just call the police directly a hesitation then a laugh his blue eyes shone with excitement which seemed genuine because theyre involved too the police surethe cops realize the herron case hasnt been solved and they want to blame somebody why not me theyve already got me in jail ill bet the cops planted the hammer themselves lets work with this a little therere two different things youre saying first somebody stole your hammer before herron was killed murdered him with it and now all this time later dimes you out but your second version is that the police got your hammer after herron was killed by someone else altogether and planted it in the well to blame you thosere contradictory its either one or the other which do you think hm pell thought for a few seconds okay ill go with number two the police its a setup im sure thats what happened she looked him in the eyes green on blue nodding agreeably lets consider that first where would the police have gotten the hammer he thought when they arrested me for that carmel thing the croyton murders in ninetynine right all the evidence they took from my house in seaside dances brows furrowed i doubt that evidence is accounted for too closely no id go for a more credible scenario that the hammer was stolen recently where else could somebody find a hammer of yours do you have any property in the state no any relatives or friends who couldve had some tools of yours not really which wasnt an answer to a yesorno question it was even slipperier than i dont recall dance noticed too that pell had put his hands tipped with long clean nails on the table at the word relatives this was a deviation from baseline behavior it didnt mean lying but he was feeling stress the questions were upsetting him daniel do you have any relations living in california he hesitated must have assessed that she was the sort to check out every commentwhich she wasand said the only one lefts my aunt down in bakersfield is her name pell another pause yepthats good thinking officer dance ill bet the deputies who dropped the ball on the herron case stole that hammer from her house and planted it theyre the ones behind this whole thing why dont you talk to them all right now lets think about the wallet where could thatve come fromheres a thought what if its not robert herrons wallet at all what if this rogue cop were talking about just bought a wallet had rh stamped in the leather then hid that and the hammer in the well it couldve been last month or even last week what do you think about that daniel pell lowered his headshe couldnt see his eyesand said nothing it was unfolding just as shed planned dance had forced him to pick the more credible of two explanations for his innocenceand proceeded to prove it wasnt credible at all no sane jury would believe that the police had fabricated evidence and stolen tools from a house hundreds of miles away from the crime scene pell was now realizing the mistake hed made the trap was about to close on him checkmate her heart thumped a bit and she was thinking that the next words out of his mouth might be about a plea bargain she was wrong his eyes snapped open and bored into hers with pure malevolence he lunged forward as far as he could only the chains hooked to the metal chair grounded with bolts to the tile floor stopped him from sinking his teeth into her she jerked back gasping you goddamn bitch oh i get it now sure youre part of it too yeah yeah blame daniel its always my fault im the easy target and you come in here sounding like a friend asking me a few questions jesus youre just like the rest of them her heart was pounding furiously now and she was afraid but she noted quickly that the restraints were secure and he couldnt reach her she turned to the mirror behind which the officer manning the video camera was surely rising to his feet right now to help her but she shook her head his way it was important to see where this was going then suddenly pells fury was replaced with a cold calm he sat back caught his breath and looked her over again youre in your thirties officer dance youre somewhat pretty you seem straight to me so i guarantee theres a man in your life or has been a third glance at the pearl ring if you dont like my theory daniel lets come up with another one about what really happened to robert herron as if she hadnt even spoken and youve got children right sure you do i can see that tell me all about them tell me about the little ones close in age and not too old ill bet this unnerved her and she thought instantly of maggie and wes but she struggled not to react he doesnt know i have children of course he cant but he acts as if hes certain was there something about my behavior he noted something that suggested to him that im a mother theyre studying you as hard as youre studying them listen to me daniel she said smoothly an outburst isnt going to help anything ive got friends on the outside you know they owe me theyd love to come visit you or hang with your husband and children yeah its a tough life being a cop the little ones spend a lot of time alone dont they theyd probably love some friends to play with dance returned his gaze never flinching she asked could you tell me about your relationship with that prisoner in capitola yes i could but i wont his emotionless words mocked her suggesting that for a professional interrogator shed phrased her question carelessly in a soft voice he added i think its time to go back to my cell chapter alonzo sandy sandoval the monterey county prosecutor was a handsome round man with a thick head of black hair and an ample mustache he sat in his office two flights above the lockup behind a desk littered with files hi kathryn so our boydid he beat his breast and cry mea culpa not exactly dance sat down peered into the coffee cup shed left on the desk fortyfive minutes ago nondairy creamer scummed the surface i rate it as oh one of the least successful interrogations of all time you look shook boss said a short wiry young man with freckles and curly red hair wearing jeans a tshirt and a plaid sports coat tjs outfit was unconventional for an investigative agent with the cbithe most conservative lawenforcement agency in the great bear statebut so was pretty much everything else about him around thirty and single tj scanlon lived in the hills of carmel valley his house a ramshackle place that could have been a diorama in a counterculture museum depicting california life in the s tj tended to work solo much of the time surveillance and undercover rather than pairing up with another cbi agent which was the bureaus standard procedure but dances regular partner was in mexico on an extradition and tj had jumped at the chance to help out and see the son of manson not shook just curious she explained how the interview had been going fine when suddenly pell turned on her under tjs skeptical gaze she conceded okay im a little shook ive been threatened before but his were the worst kinds of threats worst asked juan millar a tall darkcomplexioned young detective with the investigations division of the mcsothe monterey county sheriffs office which was headquartered not far from the courthouse calm threats dance said tj filled in cheerful threats you know youre in trouble when they stop screaming and start whispering the little ones spend a lot of time alone what happened sandoval asked seemingly more concerned about the state of his case than threats against dance when he denied knowing herron there was no stress reaction at all it was only when i had him talking about police conspiracy that he started to exhibit aversion and negation some extremity movement too deviating from his baseline kathryn dance was often called a human lie detector but that wasnt accurate in reality she like all successful kinesic analysts and interrogators was a stress detector this was the key to deception once she spotted stress shed probe the topic that gave rise to it and dig until the subject broke kinesics experts identify several different types of stress individuals experience the stress that arises primarily when someone isnt telling the whole truth is called deception stress but people also experience general stress which occurs when they are merely uneasy or nervous and has nothing to do with lying its what someone feels when say hes late for work has to give a speech in public or is afraid of physical harm dance had found that different kinesic behaviors signal the two kinds of stress she explained this and added my sense was that hed lost control of the interview and couldnt get it back so he went ballistic even though what you were saying supported his defense lanky juan millar absently scratched his left hand in the fleshy y between the index finger and thumb was a scar the remnant of a removed gang tat exactly then dances mind made one of its curious jumps a to b to x she couldnt explain how they happened but she always paid attention where was robert herron murdered she walked to a map of monterey county on sandovals wall here the prosecutor touched an area in the yellow trapezoid and the well where they found the hammer and wallet about here make it it was a quarter mile from the crime scene in a residential area dance was staring at the map she felt tjs eyes on her whats wrong boss you have a picture of the well she asked sandoval dug in the file juans forensic people shot a lot of pics crime scene boys love their toys millar said the rhyme sounding odd from the mouth of such a boy scout he gave a shy smile i heard that somewhere the prosecutor produced a stack of color photographs riffled through them until he found the ones he sought gazing at them dance asked tj we ran a case there six eight months ago remember the arson sure in that new housing development tapping the map the spot where the well was located dance continued the development is still under construction and thatshe nodded at a photographis a hardrock well everybody in the area knew that water was at such a premium in this part of california that hardrock wells with their low output and unreliable supply were never used for agricultural irrigation only for private homes shit sandoval closed his eyes briefly ten years ago when herron was killed that was all farmland the well wouldntve been there then it wasnt there one year ago dance muttered thats why pell was so stressed i was getting close to the truthsomebody did get the hammer from his aunts in bakersfield and had a fake wallet made up then planted them there recently only it wasnt to frame him oh no tj whispered what millar asked looking from one agent to the other pell set the whole thing up himself she said why sandoval asked because he couldnt escape from capitola that facility like pelican bay in the north of the state was a hightech superprison but he could from here kathryn dance lunged for the phone chapter in a special holding cellsegregated from the other prisonersdaniel pell studied his cage and the corridor beyond leading to the courthouse to all appearances he was calm but his heart was in turmoil the woman cop interviewing him had spooked him badly with her calm green eyes behind those blackframed glasses her unwavering voice he hadnt expected somebody to get inside his mind so deeply or so fast it was like she could read his thoughts kathryn dance pell turned back to baxter the guard outside the cage he was a decent hack not like pells escort from capitola who was a burly man black and hard as ebony now sitting silently at the far door watching everything what i was saying pell now continued his conversation with baxter jesus helped me i was up to three packs a day and he took time outta his busy schedule to help me i quit pretty much cold could use some of that help the hack confided ill tell you pell confided smoking was harder to say goodbye to than the booze tried the patch thing you put on your arm wasnt so good maybe ill pray for help tomorrow the wife and i pray every morning pell wasnt surprised hed seen his lapel pin it was in the shape of a fish good for you i lost my car keys last week and we prayed for an hour jesus told me where they were now daniel heres a thought youll be down here on trial days you want we could pray together preciate that baxters phone rang an instant later an alarm brayed painful to the ears the hells going on the capitola escort leapt to his feet just as a huge ball of fire filled the parking lot the window in the back of the cell was barred but open and a wad of flame shot through it black greasy smoke streamed into the room pell dropped to the floor he curled up into a ball my dear lord baxter was frozen staring at the boiling flames engulfing the entire lot behind the courthouse he grabbed the phone but the line mustve been dead he lifted his walkietalkie and reported the fire daniel pell lowered his head and began to mutter the lords prayer yo pell the con opened his eyes the massive capitola escort stood nearby holding a taser he tossed leg shackles to pell put em on were going down that corridor out the front door and into the van youre more flames streamed into the cell the three men cringed another cars gas tank had exploded youre going to stay right beside me you understand yeah sure lets go please he ratcheted on the shackles good and tight sweating his voice cracking baxter said whatta you think it is terrorists the capitola escort ignored the panicked hack eyes on pell if you dont do xactly what i say youll get fifty thousand volts up your ass he pointed the taser toward the prisoner and if it aint convenient to carry you i will leave you to burn to death understand yessir lets go please i dont want you or mr baxter getting hurt causa me ill do whatever you want open it the escort barked to baxter who hit a button with a buzz the door eased outward the three men started down the corridor through another security door and then along a dim corridor filling with smoke the alarm was braying but wait pell thought it was a second alarmthe first had sounded before the explosions outside had someone figured out what he was going to do kathryn dance just as they passed a fire door pell glanced back thick smoke was filling the corridor around them he cried to baxter no its too late the whole buildings going to go lets get out of here hes right baxter reached toward the alarm bar of the exit the capitola escort perfectly calm said firmly no out the front door to the prison van youre crazy pell snapped for the love of god well die he shoved the fire door open the men were hit with a blast of fierce heat smoke and sparks outside a wall of fire consumed cars and shrubbery and trash cans pell dropped to his knees covering his face he screamed my eyesit hurts pell goddamn it the escort stepped forward lifting the taser put that down hes not going anywhere baxter said angrily hes hurt i cant see pell moaned somebody help me baxter turned toward him bent down dont the escort shouted then the county hack staggered backward a bewildered expression on his face as pell repeatedly shoved a filleting knife into his belly and chest bleeding in cascades baxter fell to his knees trying for the pepper spray pell grabbed his shoulders and spun him around as the huge escort fired the taser it discharged but the probes went wide pell shoved baxter aside and leapt at the escort the useless taser falling to the floor the big man froze staring at the knife pells blue eyes studied his sweaty black face dont do it daniel pell moved in the escorts massive fists balled up no point in talking those who were in control didnt need to humiliate or threaten or quip pell charged forward dodging the mans blows and struck him hard a dozen times the knife edge facing out and extending downward from the bottom of his clenched right hand punching was the most effective way to use a knife against a strong opponent willing to fight back his face contorting the escort fell to his side kicking he gripped his chest and throat a moment later he stopped moving pell grabbed the keys and undid the restraints baxter was crawling away still trying to get his mace out of his holster with bloodslicked fingers his eyes grew wide as pell approached please dont do anything to me i was just doing my job were both good christians i treated you kind i pell grabbed him by the hair he was tempted to say you wasted gods time praying for your car keys but you never humiliated or threatened or quipped pell bent down and efficiently cut his throat when baxter was dead pell stepped to the door again he covered his eyes and grabbed the metallic fireproof bag where hed gotten the knife just outside the door he was reaching inside again when he felt the gun muzzle at his neck dont move pell froze drop the knife a moments debate the gun was steady pell sensed that whoever held it was ready to pull the trigger his hissed a sigh the knife clattered to the floor he glanced at the man a young latino plainclothes officer eyes on pell holding a radio thiss juan millar kathryn you there go ahead the womans voice clattered kathryn im elevenninenine immediate assistance at the fire door ground floor just outside the lockup ive got two guards down hurt bad ninefourfive requesting ambulance repeat im elevennine at that moment the gas tank of the car nearest the door exploded a flare of orange flame shot through the doorway the officer ducked pell didnt his beard flared flames licked his cheek but he stood his ground hold fast chapter kathryn dance was calling on a motorola juan wheres pell juan respond whats going on down there no answer an elevenninenine was a highway patrol codethough one that all california law enforcers knew it meant an officer needed immediate assistance and yet no response after his transmission the courthouse security chief a grizzled crewcut retired cop stuck his head into the office whos running the search whos in charge sandoval glanced at dance youre senior dance had never encountered a situation like thisa firebomb and an escape by a killer like daniel pellbut then she didnt know of anybody on the peninsula who had she could coordinate efforts until somebody from mcso or the highway patrol took over it was vital to move fast and decisively okay she said and instructed the security chief to get other guards downstairs immediately and to the doors where people were exiting screams outside people running in the corridor radio messages flying back and forth look tj said nodding toward the window where black smoke obscured the view completely oh man despite the fire which might be raging inside now kathryn dance decided to remain in alonzo sandovals office she wouldnt waste time by relocating or evacuating if the building was engulfed they could jump out of the windows to the roofs of cars parked in the front lot ten feet below she tried juan millar againthere was no answer on his phone or radiothen said to the security chief we need a roombyroom search of the building yes maam he trotted off and in case he gets out i want roadblocks dance said to tj she pulled off her jacket tossed it over a chair sweat stains were blossoming under the arms here here here her short nails tapped loudly on the laminated map of salinas gazing at the places she was indicating tj made calls to the highway patrolcalifornias state policeand the mcso sandoval the prosecutorgrim and dazedstared at the smoky parking lot too flashing lights reflected in the window he said nothing more reports came in no sign of pell in the building or outside none of juan millar either the courthouse security chief returned a few minutes later his face smudged he was coughing hard fires under control limited pretty much to outside he added shakily but sandyive gotta tell you jim baxters dead sos the capitola guard stabbed pell got a knife somehow looks like no sandoval whispered oh no and millar dance asked we cant find him might be a hostage we found a radio assume its his but we cant figure out where pell went somebody opened the back fire door but there were flames everywhere until just a few minutes ago he couldntve gotten out that way the only other choice is through the building and hed be spotted in a minute in his prison overalls unless hes dressed in millars suit dance said tj looked at her uneasily they both knew the implications of that scenario get word to everybody that he might be in a dark suit white shirt millar was much taller than pell she added the pants cuffsd be rolled up the chief hit transmit on his radio and sent out the message looking up from his phone tj called montereys getting cars in place he gestured toward the map chps scrambled a half dozen cruisers and cycles they should have the main highways sealed in fifteen minutes it worked to their advantage that salinas wasnt a huge townonly about and was an agricultural center its nickname was the nations salad bowl lettuce berry brussels sprout spinach and artichoke fields covered most of the surrounding area which meant that there were limited highways and roads by which he could escape and on foot pell would be very visible in the fields of low crops dance ordered tj to have pells mug shots sent to the officers manning the roadblocks what else should she be doing she gripped her braid which ended in the red elastic tie that energetic maggie had twisted around her hair that morning it was a motherdaughter tradition every morning the child picked the color of the rubber band or scrunchie for the day now the agent recalled her daughters sparkling brown eyes behind the wirerimmed glasses as she told her mother about music camp that day and what kind of snacks they should have for dances fathers birthday party tomorrow she realized that it was probably at that moment that wes had planted the stuffed bat in her purse she recalled too looking forward to interrogating a legendary criminal the son of manson the security chiefs radio crackled a voice called urgently weve got an injury real bad that monterey county detective looks like pell pushed him right into the fire the ems crew called for medevac theres a chopper on its way no noshe and tj shared a glance his otherwise irrepressibly mischievous face registered dismay dance knew that millar would be in terrible pain but she needed to know if he had any clues as to where pell had gone she nodded at the radio the chief handed it to her thiss agent dance is detective millar conscious no maam itsits pretty bad a pause is he wearing clothes is hesay again did pell take millars clothes oh thats negative over what about his weapon no weapon shit tell everybody that pells armed roger that dance had another thought i want an officer at the medevac chopper from the minute it lands pell might be planning to hitch a ride roger she handed the radio back pulled out her phone hit speed dial four cardiac care edie dances low placid voice said mom me whats the matter katie the kids dance pictured the stocky woman with short gray hair and large grayframed round glasses concern on her ageless face shed be leaning forwardher automatic response to tension no were fine but one of michaels detectives is burned bad there was an arson at the courthouse part of an escape youll hear about it on the news we lost two guards oh im sorry edie murmured the detectivejuan millars his name youve met him a couple of times i dont remember hes on his way here will be soon medevac that bad you have a burn unit a small one part of icu for long term wed get him to alta bates ucdavis or santa clara as soon as we could maybe down to grossman could you check in on him from time to time let me know how hes doing of course katie and if theres any way i want to talk to him whatever he saw it could be helpful sure ill be tied up for the day even if we catch him right away could you have dad pick up the kids stuart dance a retired marine biologist worked occasionally at the famous monterey aquarium but was always available to chauffeur the children whenever needed ill call right now thanks mom dance disconnected and glanced up to see prosecutor alonzo sandoval staring numbly at the map who was helping him he muttered and where the fuck is pell variations of these two questions were also spinning through kathryn dances mind along with another what could i have done to read him better what could i have done to avoid this tragedy altogether chapter the helicopter in the parking lot directed swirls of smoke outward in elegant patterns as the blades groaned and the aircraft lifted off bearing juan millar to the hospital vaya con dios dance got a call glanced at the phone screen she was surprised it had taken so long for the man to get back to her charles she said to her boss the agent in charge of the westcentral regional office of the cbi im on my way to the courthouse whatve we got kathryn she brought him up to date including the deaths and millars condition sorry to hear that any leads anything we can tell them tell who the press i dont know charles we dont have much information he could be anywhere ive ordered roadblocks and were doing a roombyroom search nothing specific not even a direction no overby sighed okay by the way youre running the operation what i want you in charge of the manhunt me she was surprised cbi certainly had jurisdiction it was the highestranking lawenforcement agency in the state and kathryn dance was a senior agent she was as competent as anyone to supervise the case still the cbi was an investigative operation and didnt have a large staff the california highway patrol and the sheriffs office would have to provide the manpower for the search why not somebody from chp or mcso i think we need central coordination on this one absolutely makes sense besides its a done deal ive cleared it with everybody already she wondered if that was why he hadnt returned her call right awayhe was roping down cbis control of a big media case well his decision was fine with her she had a personal stake in capturing pell seeing his bared teeth hearing his eerie words yeah its a tough life being a cop the little ones spend a lot of time alone dont they theyd probably love some friends to play with okay charles ill take it but i want michael on board too michael oneil was the mcso detective dance worked with most often she and the softspoken officer a lifelong resident of monterey had worked together for years in fact hed been a mentor when shed joined the cbi thats fine with me good dance thought because shed already called him ill be there soon i want another briefing before the press conference overby disconnected dance was heading toward the back of the courthouse when flashing lights caught her eye she recognized one of the cbis tauruses the grille pulsing red and blue rey carraneo the most recent addition to the office pulled up nearby and joined her the slim man with black eyes sunk beneath thick brows had only two months on the job he wasnt quite as unseasoned as he looked though and had been a cop in reno for three yearsa tough venuebefore moving to the peninsula so he and his wife could take care of his ill mother there were rough edges to be worn off and experience to be tucked under his extremely narrow belt but he was a tireless reliable law enforcer and that counted for a lot carraneo was only six or seven years younger than dance but those were important years in the life of a cop and he couldnt bring himself to call her kathryn as she frequently offered his usual greeting was a nod he gave her a respectful one now come with me recalling the herron evidence and the gas bomb she added hes probably got an accomplice and we know hes got a weapon so eyes open they continued to the back of the courthouse where arson investigators and monterey county crime scene officers from the enforcement operations bureau were looking over the carnage it was like a scene from a war zone four cars had burned to the frames the two others were halfgutted the back of the building was black with soot trash cans melted a haze of bluegray smoke hung over the area the place stank of burning rubberand an odor that was far more repulsive she studied the parking lot then her eyes slipped to the open back door no way he got out there carraneo said echoing dances thought from the destroyed cars and the scorch marks on the pavement it was clear that the fire had surrounded the door the flames were meant to be a diversion but where had he gone these cars all accounted for she asked a fireman yeah theyre all employees hey kathryn we have the device a man in a uniform said to her he was the countys chief fire marshal she nodded a greeting what was it wheelie suitcase big one filled with plastic milk containers of gasoline the doer planted it under that saab there slowburning fuse a pro probably not we found the fuse residue you can make em out of clothesline and chemicals got instructions from the internet id say the sort of things kids make to blow stuff up with including themselves a lot of times can you trace anything maybe well have it sent to the mcso lab and then well see you know when it was left he nodded toward the car the bomb had been planted under the driver got here about nine fifteen so itd be after that any hope for prints doubt it dance stood with her hands on her hips surveying the battleground something felt wrong the dim corridor blood on the concrete the open door turning slowly studying the area dance noticed behind the building something in a nearby pine and cypress grove a tree from which dangled an orange ribbonthe sort used to mark shrubs and trees scheduled for cutting walking closer she noticed that the mound of pine needles at the base was larger than those beneath the others dance dropped to her knees and dug into it she unearthed a large scorched bag made of metallic cloth rey need some gloves she coughed from the smoke the young agent got a pair from an mcso crime scene deputy and brought them to her inside the bag were pells orange prison uniform and a set of gray hooded overalls which turned out to be some kind of fire suit a label said the garment was made of pbi fibers and kevlar and had an sfi rating of a dance had no idea what this meantexcept that it was obviously protective enough to get daniel pell safely through the conflagration behind the courthouse her shoulders slumped in disgust a fire suit whatre we up against here i dont get it rey carraneo said she explained that pells partner had probably set the bomb and left the fireproof bag outside the door it had contained the fire suit and a knife maybe a universal cuff or shackle key too after hed disarmed juan millar pell had donned the garment and run through the flames to the tree marked with the orange tag where the partner had hidden some civilian clothes hed changed and sprinted off she lifted the motorola and reported what shed found then gestured an mcso crime scene officer over and gave him the evidence carraneo called her to a patch of earth not far away footprints several impressions about four feet apartleft by someone running they were clearly pells hed left distinctive prints outside the fire door of the courthouse the two cbi agents started jogging in the direction they led pells footsteps ended at a nearby street san benito way along which were vacant lots a liquor store a dingy taqueria a quickcopy and shipping franchise a pawnshop and a bar so heres where the partner picked him up carraneo said looking up and down san benito but theres another street on the other side of the courthouse its two hundred feet closer why here more traffic there could be dance squinted as she scanned the area coughing again finally she caught her breath and her eyes focused across the street come on lets move the man in his late twenties wearing shorts and a worldwide express uniform shirt drove his green panel truck through the streets of downtown salinas he was intensely aware of the gun barrel resting on his shoulder and he was crying look mister i dont know what this is about really but we dont carry cash ive got about fifty on me personal money and youre welcome give me your wallet the hijacker wore shorts a windbreaker and an oakland as cap his face was streaked with soot and part of his beard was burned off he was middleaged but thin and strong he had weird light blue eyes whatever you want mister just dont hurt me ive got a family wallet it took stocky billy a few moments to pry the billfold out of his tight shorts here the man flipped through it now william gilmore of threefourthreefive rio grande avenue marina california father of these two fine children if the photo gallerys up to date dread unraveled inside him and husband of this lovely wife look at those curls natural ill bet any money hey keep your eyes on the road swerved a bit there and keep going where i told you then the hijacker said hand me your cell phone his voice was calm calm is good

williamyou go by bill billy mostly sir so billy heres the situation i escaped from that jail back there yessir thats fine with me the man laughed well thank you now you heard me on the phone you know

everybody knows my name and what i look like im daniel pell and my picturell be all over the noon news so i dont have any reason to hurt you long as you do what i say now summon up some calm youve got

anything billy i know you were listening to me i dont need you to do anything i need you to do what i asked thats all what could be simpler chapter kathryn dance and carraneo were in the you mail it franchise on san benito way where theyd just learned that a package delivery company worldwide express had made its daily morning dropoff moments after the escape a to b to x dance realized that pell could commandeer the truck to get past the roadblocks and called the worldwide express salinas operations director who confirmed that the driver on that route had missed all remaining scheduled deliveries dance got the tag number of his truck and relayed it to the mcso they returned to sandy sandovals office coordinating the efforts to find the vehicle unfortunately there were twentyfive worldwide trucks in the area so dance told the director to order the other drivers to pull over immediately at the nearest gas station the truck that kept moving would contain daniel pell this was taking some time though the director had to call them on their cell phones since a radio broadcast would alert pell that they knew about his means of escape a figure walked slowly through the doorway dance turned to see michael oneil the senior mcso chief deputy shed called earlier she nodded at him with a smile greatly relieved he was here there was no better law enforcer in the world with whom to share this tough burden oneil had been with the mcso for years hed started as a rookie deputy and worked his way up becoming a solid methodical investigator with a stunning arrestand more important convictionrecord he was now a chief deputy and detective with the enforcement operations bureau of the mcsos investigations division hed resisted offers to go into lucrative corporate security or to join bigger lawenforcement ops like the cbi or fbi he wouldnt take a job that required relocation or extensive travel oneils home was the monterey peninsula and he had no desire to be anywhere else his parents still lived therein the oceanview house he and his siblings had grown up in his father was suffering from senility his mother was considering selling the house and moving the man into a nursing facility oneil had a plan to buy the homestead just to keep it in the family with his love of the bay fishing and his boat michael oneil could be the unwavering unobtrusive hero in a john steinbeck novel like doc in cannery row in fact the detective an avid book collector owned first editions of everything steinbeck had written his favorite was travels with charley a nonfiction account of the writers trip around america with his standard poodle and oneil intended to duplicate the journey at some point in his life last friday dance and oneil had jointly collared a thirtyyearold known as ese head of a particularly unpleasant chicano gang operating out of salinas theyd marked the occasion by sharing a bottle of piper sonoma sparkling wine on the deck of a touristinfested fishermans wharf restaurant now it seemed as if the celebration had occurred decades ago if at all the mcso uniform was typical khaki but oneil often dressed soft and today he was in a navy suit with a tieless dark shirt charcoal gray matching about half the hair on his head the brown eyes beneath low lids moved slowly as they examined the map of the area his physique was columnar and his arms thick from genes and from playing tug of war with muscular seafood in monterey bay when time and the weather allowed him to get out his boat oneil nodded a greeting to tj and sandoval any word on juan dance asked hanging in there he and millar worked together frequently and went fishing once a month or so dance knew that on the drive here hed been in constant touch with the doctors and millars family the california bureau of investigation has no central dispatch unit to contact radio patrol cars emergency vehicles or boats so oneil arranged for the sheriffs office central communications operation to relay the information about the missing worldwide express truck to its own deputies and the highway patrol he told them that within a few minutes the escapees truck would be the only one not stopped at a gas station oneil took a call and nodded walking to the map he tucked the phone between ear and shoulder picked up a pack of selfadhesive notes featuring butterflies and began sticking them up more roadblocks dance realized he hung up theyre on sixtyeight oneeightythree the oneohone weve got the back roads to hollister covered and soledad and greenfield but if he gets into the pastures of heaven itll be tough to spot a truck even with a chopperand right now fogs a problem the pastures of heaven was the name given by john steinbeck in a book of the same title to a rich orchardfilled valley off highway much of the area around salinas was flat low farmland but you didnt have to go far to get into trees and nearby too was the rugged castle rock area whose cliffs bluffs and trees would be excellent hiding places sandoval said if pells partner didnt drive the getaway wheels where is he tj offered rendezvous point somewhere or staying around dance said nodding out the window what the prosecutor asked whyd he do that to find out how were running the case what we know what we dont know that sounds a littleelaborate dont you think tj laughed pointing toward the smoldering cars id say thats a pretty good word for this whole shebang oneil suggested or maybe he wants to slow us up dance said that makes sense too pell and his partner dont know were on to the truck for all they know we still think hes in the area the partner could make it look like pells nearby maybe take a shot at somebody up the street maybe even set off another device shit another firebomb sandoval grimaced dance called the security chief and told him there was a possibility the partner was still around and could be a threat but as it turned out they had no time to speculate about whether or not the partner was nearby the plan about the worldwide express trucks had paid off a radio call to oneil from mcso dispatch reported that two local police officers had found daniel pell and were presently in pursuit the dark green delivery truck kicked up a rooster tail of dust on the small road the uniformed officer who was driving the salinas police squad car a former jarhead back from the war gripped the wheel of the cruiser as if he were holding on to the rudder of a tenfoot skiff in twelvefoot seas his partnera muscular latinogripped the dashboard in one hand and the microphone in the other salinas police mobile seven were still with him he turned onto a dirt road off natividad about a mile south of old stage rogercentral to seven be advised subject is probably armed and dangerous if hes armed of course hes dangerous the driver said and lost his sunglasses when the car caught air after a runin with a massive bump the two officers could hardly see the road ahead the worldwide truck was churning up dust like a sandstorm central to seven weve got all available units en route roger that backup was a good idea the rumors were that daniel pell the crazed cult leader this eras charles manson had gunned down a dozen people at the courthouse had set fire to a bus filled with schoolchildren had slashed his way through a crowd of prospective jurors killing four or two or eight whatever the truth the officers wanted as much help as they could get the jarhead muttered wheres he going theres nothing up here the road was used mostly for farm equipment and buses transporting migrant workers to and from the fields it led to no major highways there was no picking going on today but the roads purpose and the fact it probably led to no major highways could be deduced from its decrepit condition and from the drinking water tanks and the portable toilets on trailers by the roadside but daniel pell might not know that and would assume this was a road like any other rather than one that ended as this did abruptly in the middle of an artichoke field ahead of them thirty yards or so pell braked fast in panic and the truck began to skid but there was no way to stop in time the trucks front wheels dropped hard into a shallow irrigation ditch and the rear end lifted off the ground then slammed back with a huge crash the squad car braked to a stop nearby this is seven the latino cop called in pells off the road roger is he the officers leapt out of the car with their pistols drawn hes going to bail hes going to bail but nobody exited the truck they approached it the back door had flown open in the crash and they could see nothing but dozens of packages and envelopes littering the floor there he is look pell lay stunned facedown on the floor of the vehicle maybe hes hurt who gives a shit the officers ran forward and cuffed and dragged him out of the space where he was wedged they dropped him on to his back on the ground nice try buddy but fuck its not him what asked his partner excuse me does that look like a fortythreeyearold white guy the jarhead bent down to the groggy teenager a gang teardrop tat on his cheek and snapped whore you in spanish a language that every law enforcer in and around salinas could speak the kid avoided their eyes muttering in english i no saying nothing you can go fuck youself oh man the latino cop glanced into the cab where the keys were dangling from the dash he understood pell had left the truck on a city street with the engine on knowing itd be stolenoh in about sixty secondsso the police would follow it and give pell a chance to escape in a different direction another thought not a good one he turned to jarhead you dont think when we said we had pell and they called all availables for backupi mean you dont think they pulled em off the roadblocks do you no they wouldnt do that thatd be fucking stupid the men looked at each other christ the latino officer raced to the squad car and grabbed the microphone chapter a honda civic tj reported hanging up from a call with dmv five years old red ive got the tags they knew pell was now in the worldwide express drivers personal car which was missing from the companys lot in salinas tj added ill let the roadblocks know when they get back on site dance muttered to the dismay of the agents and oneil some local dispatcher had ordered the nearby roadblocks abandoned for the pursuit of the worldwide express truck his placid face registering what for oneil was disgusta tightening of the lipshed sent the cars back on site immediately they were in a meeting room up the hall from sandovals office now that pell was clearly not near the courthouse dance wanted to return to cbi headquarters but charles overby had told them to remain at the courthouse until he arrived think he wants to make sure no press conferences escape either tj said to which dance and oneil gave sour laughs speaking of which came tjs whisper incominghit the decks a figure strode confidently through the door charles overby a fiftyfiveyearold career law enforcer without any greetings he asked dance he wasnt in the truck no local gangbanger pell left the truck running he knew somebodyd snatch it and wed focus on that he took off in the delivery drivers own car the driver no sign ouch brownhaired sunburned charles overby was athletic in a pearshaped way a tennis and golf player he was the newly appointed head of the cbis westcentral office the agent in charge he replaced stan fishburne had taken early retirement on a medical much to the cbi staffs collective dismay because of the severe heart attack on fishburnes accountand because of who had succeeded him on theirs oneil took a call and dance updated overby adding the details of pells new wheels and their concern that the partner was still nearby you think hes really planted another device unlikely but the accomplice staying around makes sense oneil hung up the roadblocksre all back in place who took them down overby asked we dont know im sure it wasnt us or you michael right overby asked uneasily an awkward silence then oneil said no charles who was it were not sure we should find that out recrimination was such a drain oneil said hed look into it dance knew hed never do anything though and with this comment to overby the finger pointing came to a close the detective continued nobodys spotted the civic but the timing was just wrong he couldve gotten through on sixtyeight or the oneohone i dont think sixtyeight though no overby agreed the smaller highway would take pell back to heavily populated monterey the wide as an interstate could get him to every major expressway in the state theyre setting up new checkpoints in gilroy and about thirty miles south oneil stuck monarch butterfly notes in the appropriate places and youve got the bus terminals and airport secure overby asked thats right dance said and san jose and oakland pdre in the loop yep and santa cruz san benito merced santa clara stanislaus and san mateo the nearby counties overby jotted a few notes good he glanced up and said oh i just talked to amy grabe thats right amy grabe was the sacthe special agent in chargeof the fbis san francisco field office dance knew the sharp focused law enforcer well the westcentral region of the cbi extended north to the bay area so shed had a number of opportunities to work with her dances late husband an agent with the fbis local resident agency had too overby continued if we dont get pell soon theyve got a specialist i want on board a what somebody in the bureau who handles situations like this it was a jailbreak dance reflected what kind of specialist she thought of tommy lee jones in the fugitive oneil too was curious a negotiator but overby said no hes a cult expert deals a lot with people like pell dance shrugged an illustrator gesturethose that reinforce verbal content in this case her doubts well im not sure how useful thatd be she had worked many joint task forces she wasnt opposed to sharing jurisdiction with the feds or anyone else but involving other agencies inevitably slowed response times besides she didnt see how a cult leader would flee for his life any differently than a murderer or bank robber but overby had already made up his mind she knew it from his tone and body language hes a brilliant profiler can really get into their minds the cult mentality is a lot different from your typical perps is it the agent in charge handed dance a slip of paper with a name and phone number on it hes in chicago finishing up some case but he can be here tonight or tomorrow morning you sure about this charles with pell we can use all the help we can get absolutely and a big gun from washington more expertise more person power more places to stash the blame dance thought cynically realizing now what had happened grabe had asked if the fbi could help out in the search for pell and overby had jumped at the offer thinking that if more innocents were injured or the escapee remained at large thered be two people on the podium at the press conference not just himself alone but she kept the smile on her face all right then i hope we get him before we need to bother anybody else oh and kathryn i just wanted you to know amy wondered how the escape happened and i told her your interrogation had nothing to do with it mywhat its not going to be a problem i told her theres nothing you did that wouldve helped pell escape she felt the heat rise to her face which undoubtedly was turning ruddy emotion does that shed spotted plenty of deception over the years because guilt and shame trigger blood flow so does anger amy grabe probably hadnt even known that dance had interrogated pell let alone suspected shed done something careless that facilitated the escape but sheand the san francisco office of the bureausure had that idea now maybe cbi headquarters in sacramento did too she said stiffly he escaped from the lockup not the interrogation room i was talking about pell maybe getting information from you that he could use to get away dance sensed oneil tense the detective had a strong streak of protectiveness when it came to those who hadnt been in the business as long as he had but he knew that kathryn dance was a woman who fought her own battles he remained silent she was furious that overby had said anything to grabe now she understood that was why he wanted cbi to run the caseif any other agency took charge it would be an admission that the bureau was in some way responsible for the escape and overby wasnt through yet now about securityim sure it was tight special precautions with pell i told amy youd made sure of that since he hadnt asked a question she simply gazed back coolly and didnt give him a crumb of reassurance he probably sensed hed gone too far and eyes ferreting away said im sure things were handled well again silence okay ive got that press conference my turn in the barrel he grimaced if you hear anything else let me know ill be on in about ten minutes the man left tj looked dance over and said in a thick southern accent damn so youre the one forgot to lock the barn door when you were through interrogating the cows thats how they got away i was wondrin oneil stifled a smile dont get me started she muttered she walked to the window and looked out at the people whod evacuated the courthouse milling in front of the building im worried about that partner where is he whats he up to whod bust somebody like daniel pell outa the joint asked tj dance recalled pells kinesic reaction in the interrogation when the subject of his aunt in bakersfield arose i think whoevers helping him got the hammer from his aunt pells her last name find her she had another thought oh and your buddy in the resident agency down in chico yup hes discreet right we bar surf and ogle when we hang out how discreet is that can he check this guy out she held up the slip of paper containing the name of the fbis cult expert hed be game ill bet he says intrigue in the bureaus better than intrigue in the barrio tj jotted the name oneil took a call and had a brief conversation he hung up and explained that was the warden at capitola i thought we should talk to the supervising guard on pells cell block see if he can tell us anything hes also bringing the contents of pells cell with him good then theres a fellow prisoner who claims to have some information about pell shell round him up and call us back dances cell phone rang a croaking frog oneil lifted an eyebrow wes or maggieve been hard at work it was a family joke like stuffed animals in the purse the children would reprogram the ringer of her phone when dance wasnt looking any tones were fair game the only rules never silent and no tunes from boy bands she hit the receive button hello its me agent dance the background noise was loud and the me ambiguous but the phrasing of her name told her the caller was rey carraneo whats up no sign of his partner or any other devices security wants to know if they can let everybody back inside the fire marshals okayed it dance debated the matter with oneil they decided to wait a little longer tj go outside and help them search i dont like it that the accomplices unaccounted for she recalled what her father had told her after hed nearly had a runin with a great white in the waters off northern australia the shark you dont see is always more dangerous than the one you do chapter the stocky bearded balding man in his hardworn fifties stood near the courthouse looking over the chaos his sharp eyes checking out everyone the police the guards the civilians hey officer how you doing you got a minute just like to ask you a few questions you mind saying a few words into the tape recorderoh sure i understand ill catch you later sure good luck morton nagle had watched the helicopter swoop in low and ease to the ground to spirit away the injured cop hed watched the men and women conducting the search their strategyand facesmaking clear that theyd never run an escape hed watched the uneasy crowds thinking accidental fire then thinking terrorists then hearing the truth and looking even more scared than if alqaeda itself were behind the explosion as well they should nagle reflected excuse me do you have a minute to talkoh sure not a problem sorry to bother you officer nagle milled through the crowds smoothing his wispy hair then tugging up saggy tan slacks he was studying the area carefully the fire trucks the squad cars the flashing lights bursting with huge aureoles through the foggy haze he lifted his digital camera and snapped some more pictures a middleaged woman looked over his shabby vesta fishermans garment with two dozen pocketsand battered camera bag she snapped you people you journalists youre like vultures why dont you let the police do their job he gave a chuckle i didnt know i wasnt youre all the same the woman turned away and continued to stare angrily at the smoky courthouse a guard came up to him and asked if hed seen anything suspicious nagle thought now thats a strange question sounds like something from an oldtime tv show just the facts maam he answered nope adding to himself nothing surprising to me but maybe im the wrong one to ask nagle caught a whiff of a terrible scentseared flesh and hairand incongruously gave another amused laugh thinking about it nowdaniel pell had put the idea in mindhe realized he chuckled at times that most people would consider inappropriate if not tasteless moments like this when looking over carnage over the years hed seen plenty of violent death images that would repel most people images that often made morton nagle laugh it was a defense mechanism probably a device to keep violencea subject he was intimately familiar withfrom eating away at his soul though he wondered if the chuckling wasnt an indicator that it already had then an officer was making an announcement people would soon be allowed back into the courthouse nagle hitched up his pants pulled his camera bag up higher on his shoulder and scanned the crowd he spotted a tall young latino in a suit clearly a plainclothes detective of some sort the man was speaking to an elderly woman wearing a juror badge they were off to the side not many people around good nagle sized up the officer just what he wanted young gullible trusting and began slowly moving toward him closing the distance the man moved on oblivious to nagle looking for more people to interview when he was ten feet away the big man slipped the camera strap around his neck unzipped the bag reached inside five feet he stepped closer yet and felt a strong hand close around his arm nagle gasped and his heart gave a jolt just keep those hands where i can see them hows that the man was a short fidgety officer with the california bureau of investigation nagle read the id dangling from his neck hey what shhhhh hissed the officer who had curly red hair and those hands remember where i want emhey rey the latino joined them he too had a cbi id card he looked nagle up and down together they led him to the side of the courthouse attracting the attention of everybody nearby look i dont know shhhhh the wiry agent offered again the latino frisked him carefully and nodded then he lifted nagles press pass off his chest and showed it to the shorter officer hm he said this is a little out of date wouldnt you say technically but sir its four years out of date the latino officer pointed out thats a big bowl of technical his partner said i mustve picked up the wrong one ive been a reporter for so if we called this paper theyd say youre a credentialed employee if they called the paper theyd get a nonworking number look i can explain the short officer frowned you know i sure would like an explanation see i was just talking to this groundskeeper who told me that a man fitting your description was here about eight thirty this morning there were no other reporters here then and why would that be because there was no escape then getting here before the story breaks thats quite awhatta they call that rey scoop yeah thats quite a scoop so fore you do any explaining turn around and put your hands behind your back in the conference room on the second floor of the courthouse tj handed dance what hed found on morton nagle no weapons no incendiary fuse no maps of the courthouse or escape routes just money wallet camera tape recorder and thick notebook along with three truecrime books his name on the cover and his picture on the back appearing much younger and hairier hes a paperback writer tj sang not doing justice to the beatles nagle was described in the author bio as a former war correspondent and police reporter who now writes books about crime a resident of scottsdale ariz he is the author of thirteen works of nonfiction he claims his other professions are gadabout nomad and raconteur this doesnt let you off the hook dance snapped whatre you doing here and why were you at the courthouse before the fire im not covering the escape i got here early to get some interviews oneil said with pell he doesnt give them no no not pell with the family of robert herron i heard they were coming to testify to the grand jury what about the fake press pass okay its been four years since ive been credentialed with a magazine or newspaper ive been writing books fulltime but without a press pass you cant get anywhere nobody ever looks at the date almost never tj corrected with a smile dance flipped through one of the books it was about the peterson murder case in california a few years ago it seemed well written tj looked up from his laptop hes clean boss at least no priors dmv pic checks out too im writing a book its all legit you can check he gave them the name of his editor in manhattan dance called the large publishing company and spoke to the woman whose attitude was oh hell whats morton got himself into now but she confirmed that hed signed a contract for a new book about pell dance said to tj uncuff him oneil turned to the author and asked whats the book about it isnt like any true crime youve read before its not about the murders thats been done its about the victims of daniel pell what their lives were like before the murders and the ones who survived what theyre like now see most nonfiction crime on tv or in books focuses only on the murderer himself and the crimethe gore the gruesome aspects the cheap stuff i hate that my books about theresa croytonthe girl who survivedand the familys relatives and friends the titles going to be the sleeping doll thats what they called theresa im also going to include the women who were in pells quote family the ones he brainwashed and all the other victims of pells too there are really hundreds of them when you think about it i see violent crime like dropping a stone into a pond the ripples of consequence can spread almost forever there was passion in his voice he sounded like a preacher theres so much violence in the world were inundated with it and we get numb my god the war in iraq gaza afghanistan how many pictures of blownup cars how many scenes of wailing mothers did you see before you lost interest when i was a war correspondent covering the middle east and africa and bosnia i got numb and you dont have to be there in person for that to happen its the same thing in your own living room when you just see the news bites or watch gruesome movieswhere therere no real consequences for the violence but if we want peace if we want to stop violence and fighting thats what people need to experience the consequences you dont do that by gawking at bloody bodies you focus on lives changed forever by evil originally it was only going to be about the croyton case but then i find out that pell killed someone elsethis robert herron i want to include everyone affected by his death too friends family and now i understand two guardsre dead the smile was still there but it was a sad smile and kathryn dance realized that his cause was one with which she as a mother and major crimes agent whod worked plenty of rape assault and homicide cases could empathize thiss added another wrinkle he gestured around him its much harder to track down victims and family members in a cold case herron was killed about ten years ago i was thinking nagles voice faded and he was frowning though inexplicably a sparkle returned to his eyes wait waitoh my god pell didnt have anything to do with the herron death did he he confessed to get out of capitola so he could escape from here we dont know about that dance said judiciously were still investigating nagle didnt believe her did he fake evidence or get somebody to come forward and lie ill bet he did in a low even tone michael oneil said we wouldnt want there to be any rumors that might interfere with the investigation when the chief deputy made suggestions in this voice people always heeded the advice fine i wont say anything appreciate that dance said then asked mr nagle do you have any information that could help us where daniel pell might be going what he might be up to whos helping him with his potbelly wispy hair and genial laugh nagle seemed like a middleaged elf he hitched up his pants no idea im sorry i really just got started on the project a month or so ago ive been doing the background research you mentioned you plan to write about the women in pells family too have you contacted them two of them i asked if theyd be willing to let me interview them oneil asked theyre out of jail oh yes they werent involved in the croyton murders they got short terms mostly for larcenyrelated offenses oneil completed dances thought could one of them or both i guess be his accomplice nagle considered this i cant see it they think pells the worst thing that ever happened to them who are they oneil asked rebecca sheffield she lives in san diego and linda whitfield is in portland have they kept out of trouble think so no police records i could find linda lives with her brother and his wife she works for a church rebecca runs a consulting service for small businesses my impression is theyve put the past behind them you have their numbers the writer flipped through a notebook of fat pages his handwriting was sloppy and largeand the notes voluminous there was a third woman in the family dance said recalling the research shed done for the interview samantha mccoy she disappeared years ago rebecca said she changed her name and moved away was sick of being known as one of daniels girls ive done a little searching but i havent been able to find her yet any leads west coast somewhere is all that rebecca heard dance said to tj find her samantha mccoy the curlyhaired agent bounded off to the corner of the room he looked like an elf too she reflected nagle found the numbers of the two women and dance wrote them down she placed a call to rebecca sheffield in san diego womens initiatives the receptionist said in a voice with a faint chicana accent may i help you a moment later dance found herself speaking to the head of the company a nononsense woman with a low raspy voice the agent explained about pells escape rebecca sheffield was shocked angry too i thought he was in some kind of superprison he didnt escape from there it was the county courthouse lockup dance asked if the woman had any thoughts on where pell might be going who his accomplice could be other friends he might contact rebecca couldnt though she said that shed met pell just a few months before the croyton murdersand she was just getting to know him and the others when they were arrested but she added that shed gotten a call from someone about a month earlier supposedly a writer i assumed he was legit but he mightve had something to do with the escape murry or morton was the first name i think ive got his number somewhere its all right hes here with us weve checked him out rebecca could offer nothing more about samantha mccoys whereabouts or new identity then uneasy she said back then eight years ago i didnt turn him in but i did cooperate with the police do you think im in danger i couldnt say but until we reapprehend him you might want to contact san diego police dance gave the woman her numbers at cbi and her mobile and rebecca told her shed try to think of anyone who might help pell or know where hed go the agent pushed down the button on the phone cradle and let it spring back up again then she dialed the second number which turned out to be the church of the holy brethren in portland she was connected to linda whitfield who hadnt heard the news either her reaction was completely different silence broken by a nearly inaudible muttering all dance caught was dear jesus praying it seemed not an exclamation the voice faded or she was cut off hello dance asked yes im here linda said dance asked the same questions shed put to rebecca sheffield linda hadnt heard from pell in yearsthough theyd stayed in touch for about eighteen months after the croyton murders finally shed stopped writing and had heard nothing from him since nor did she have any information about samantha mccoys whereabouts though she too told dance about a call from morton nagle last month the agent reassured her they were aware of him and convinced he wasnt working with pell linda could offer no leads as to where pell would go she had no idea of who his accomplice might be we dont know what he has in mind dance told the woman we have no reason to believe youre in danger but oh daniel wouldnt hurt me she said quickly still you might want to tell your local police well ill think about it then she added is there a hotline i can call and find out whats going on we dont have anything set up like that but the presss covering it closely you can get the details on the news as fast as we know them well my brother doesnt have a television no tv well if there are any significant developments ill let you know and if you can think of anything else please call dance gave her the phone numbers and hung up a few moments later cbi chief charles overby strode into the room press conference went well i think they asked some prickly questions they always do but i fielded them okay i have to say stayed one step ahead you see it he nodded at the tv in the corner no one had bothered to turn up the volume to hear his performance missed it charles been on the phone whos he overby asked hed been staring at nagle as if he should know him dance introduced them then the writer instantly disappeared from the agent in charges radar screen any progress at all a glance at the maps no reports anywhere dance told him then explained that shed contacted two of the women whod been in pells family ones from san diego ones from portland and were looking for the other right now at least we know the first two arent the accomplice because you believe them overby asked you could tell that from the tone of their voices none of the officers in the room said anything so it was up to dance to let her boss know hed missed the obvious i dont think they couldve set the gas bombs and gotten back home by now a brief pause overby said oh you called them where they live you didnt say that kathryn dance former reporter and jury consultant had played in the real world for a long time she avoided tjs glance and said youre right charles i didnt sorry the cbi head turned to oneil thiss a tough one michael lots of angles sure glad youre available to help us out glad to do what i can this was charles overby at his best using the words help us to make clear who was running the show while also tacitly explaining that oneil and the mcso were on the line too stash the blame overby announced he was headed back to the cbi office and left the conference room dance now turned to morton nagle do you have any research about pell i could look at well i suppose but why maybe help us get some idea of where hes going oneil said copies the writer said not the originals thats fine dance told him one of usll come by later and pick them up wheres your office nagle worked out of a house he was renting in monterey he gave dance the address and phone number then began packing up his camera bag dance glanced down at it hold on nagle noticed her eyes on the contents he smiled id be happy to im sorry he picked up a copy of one of his truecrime books blind trust and with a flourish autographed it for her thanks she set it down and pointed at what shed actually been looking at your camera did you take any pictures this morning before the fire oh he smiled wryly at the misunderstanding yes i did its digital thats right can we see them nagle picked up the canon and began to push buttons she and oneil hunched close over the tiny screen on the back dance detected a new aftershave she felt comfort in his proximity the writer scrolled through the pictures most of them were of people walking into the courthouse a few artistic shots of the front of the building in the fog then the detective and the agent simultaneously said wait the image they were looking at depicted the driveway that led to where the fire had occurred they could make out someone behind a car just the back visible wearing a blue jacket a baseball cap and sunglasses look at the arm dance nodded it seemed the persons arm trailed behind as if wheeling a suitcase is that time stamped nagle called up the readout nine twentytwo thatd work out just right dance said recalling the fire marshals estimate of the time the gas bomb had been planted can you blow up the image not in the camera tj said he could on his computer though no problem nagle gave the memory card to him and dance sent tj back to cbi headquarters reminding him and samantha mccoy track her down the aunt too bakersfield you bet boss rey carraneo was still outside canvassing for witnesses but dance believed that the accomplice had fled too now that pell had probably eluded the roadblocks there was no reason for the partner to stay around she sent him back to headquarters as well nagle said ill get started on the copies oh dont forget he handed her the autographed paperback i know youll like it when he was gone dance held it up in all my free time and gave it to oneil for his collection chapter at lunch hour a woman in her midtwenties was sitting on a patio outside the whole foods grocery store in montereys del monte center a disk of sun was slowly emerging as the blanket of fog melted she heard a siren in the distance a dove cooing a horn a child crying then a child laughing jennie marston thought angel songs the scent of pine filled the cool air no breeze dull light a typical california day on the coast but everything about it was intensified which is what happens when youre in love and about to meet your boyfriend anticipation some old pop song jennie thought her mother sang it from time to time her smokers voice harsh and offkey often slurred blond authentic california blond jennie sipped her coffee it was expensive but good this wasnt her kind of store the twentyfouryearold parttime caterer was an albertsons girl a safeway girl but whole foods was a good meeting place she was wearing closefitting jeans a light pink blouse and underneath a red victorias secret bra and panties like the coffee the lingerie was a luxury she couldnt afford but some things you had to splurge on besides jennie reflected the garments were really a gift in a way for her boyfriend which made her think of other indulgences rubbing her nose flick flick on the bump stop it she told herself but she didnt another two flicks angel songs why couldnt she have met him a year later shedve had the cosmetic work done by then and be beautiful at least she could do something about the nose and boobs she only wished she could fix the toothpick shoulders and boyish hips but fixing those was beyond the talents of talented dr ginsberg skinny skinny skinnyand the way you eat twice what i do and look at me god gave me a daughter like you to test me watching the unsmiling women wheeling their grocery carts to their mommy vans jennie wondered do they love their husbands they couldnt possibly be as much in love as she was with her boyfriend she felt sorry for them jennie finished her coffee and returned to the store looking at massive pineapples and bins of grain and heads of funnyshaped lettuce and perfectly lined up steaks and chops mostly she studied the pastriesthe way one painter examines anothers canvas good not so good she didnt want to buy anythingit was way expensive she was just too squirrelly to stay in one place thats what i shouldve named you stay still jennie for fucks sake girl sit down looking at the produce looking at the rows of meat looking at the women with boring husbands she wondered if the intensity she felt for her boyfriend was simply because it was all so new would it fade after a while but one thing in their favor was that they were older this wasnt that stupid passion of your teenage years they were mature people and most important was their souls connection which comes along so rarely each knew exactly how the other felt your favorite colors green hed shared with her the first time theyd spoken ill bet you sleep under a green comforter it soothes you at night oh my god he was so right it was a blanket not a comforter but it was green as grass what kind of man had that intuition suddenly she paused aware of a conversation nearby two of the bored housewives werent so bored at the moment somebodys dead in salinas it just happened salinas jennie thought oh the escape from that prison or whatever yeah i just heard about it david pell no daniel thats it isnt he like charles mansons kid or something i dont know but i heard some people got killed hes not mansons kid no he just called himself that whos charles manson are you kidding me remember sharon tate who like when were you born jennie approached the women excuse me whats that youre talking about an escape or something yeah from this jail in salinas didnt you hear one of the shorthaired housewives asked glancing at jennies nose she didnt care somebody was killed you said some guards and then somebody was kidnapped and killed i think they didnt seem to know anything more her palms damp heart uneasy jennie turned and walked away she checked her phone her boyfriend had called a while ago but nothing since then no messages she tried the number he didnt answer jennie returned to the turquoise thunderbird she put the radio on the news then twisted the rearview mirror toward her she pulled her makeup and brush from her purse some people got killed dont worry about it she told herself working on her face concentrating the way her mother had taught her it was one of the nice things the woman had done for her put the light here the dark hereweve got to do something with that nose of yours smooth it inblend it good though her mother often took away the nice as fast as shattering a glass well it looked fine until you messed it up honestly whats wrong with you do it again you look like a whore daniel pell was strolling down the sidewalk from the small covered garage connected to an office building in monterey hed had to abandon billys honda civic earlier than hed planned hed heard on the news that the police had found the worldwide express truck which meant they would probably assume he was in the civic hed apparently evaded the roadblocks just in time how bout that kathryn now he continued along the sidewalk with his head down he wasnt concerned about being out in public not yet nobody would expect him here besides he looked different in addition to the civilian clothes he was smoothshaven after dumping billys car hed slipped into the back parking lot of a motel where hed gone through the trash hed found a discarded razor and a tiny bottle of the motels giveaway body lotion crouching by the dumpster hed used them to shave off the beard he now felt the breeze on his face smelled something in the air ocean and seaweed first time in years he loved the scent in capitola prison the air you smelled was the air they decided to send to you through the air conditioner or heating system and it didnt smell like anything a squad car went past hold fast pell was careful to maintain his pace not looking around not deviating from his route changing your behavior draws attention and that puts you at a disadvantage gives people information about you they can figure out why you changed then use it against you thats what had happened at the courthouse kathryn pell had had the interrogation all planned out if he could do so without arousing suspicion he was going to get information from whoever was interviewing him learn how many guards were in the courthouse and where they were for instance but then to his astonishment shed learned exactly what he was doing where else could somebody find a hammer of yoursnow lets think about the wallet where could thatve come from so hed been forced to change his plans and fast hed done the best he could but the braying alarm told him shed anticipated him if shed done that just five minutes earlier he wouldve been back in the capitola prison van the escape plan wouldve turned to dust kathryn dance another squad car drove quickly past still no glances his way and pell kept on course but he knew it was time to get out of monterey he slipped into the crowded openair shopping center he noted the stores macys mervyns and the smaller ones selling mrs sees candy books pell loved and devoured themthe more you knew the more control you had video games sports equipment cheap clothes and cheaper jewelry the place was packed it was june many schools were out of session one girl college age came out of a store a bag over her shoulder beneath her jacket was a tight red tank top one glance at it and the swelling began inside him the bubble expanding the last time hed intimidated a con and bribed a guard to swing a conjugal visit with the cons wife in capitola was a year ago a long long year he stared at her following only a few feet behind enjoying the sight of the hair and her tight jeans trying to smell her trying to get close enough to brush against her as he walked past which is an assault just as surely as being dragged into an alley and stripped at knifepoint rape is in the eye of the beholder ah but then she turned into another store and vanished from his life my loss dear he thought but not yours of course in the parking lot pell saw a turquoise ford thunderbird inside he could just make out a woman brushing her long blond hair ah walking closer her nose was bumpy and she was a skinny little thing not much in the chest department but that didnt stop the balloon within him growing ten times a hundred it was going to burst soon daniel pell looked around nobody else nearby he walked forward through the rows of cars closing the distance jennie marston finished with her hair this particular aspect of her body she loved it was shiny and thick and when she spun her head it flowed like a shampoo models in a slomo tv commercial she twisted the thunderbirds rearview mirror back into position shut the radio off touched her nose the bump stop it as she was reaching for the door handle she gave a gasp it was opening on its own jennie froze staring up at the wiry man who was leaning down neither of them moved for a moment then he pulled the door open youre the picture of delight jennie marston he said prettier than i imagined oh daniel overwhelmed with emotionfear relief guilt a big burning sun of feelingjennie marston could think of nothing else to say breathless she slipped out of the car and flew into her boyfriends arms shivering and holding him so tightly that she squeezed a soft steady hiss from his narrow chest chapter they got into the tbird and she pressed her head against his neck as daniel carefully surveyed the parking lot and the road nearby jennie was thinking how difficult the past month had been forging a relationship through email rare phone calls and fantasy never seeing her lover in person still she knew that it was so much better to build love this wayfrom a distance it was like the women on the home front during a war the way her mother would talk about her father in vietnam that was all a lie of course shed later learned but it didnt take away the larger truth that love should be first about two souls and only later about sex what she felt for daniel pell was unlike anything shed ever experienced exhilarating frightening too she felt the tears start no no stop it dont cry he wont like it if you cry men get mad when that happens but he asked gently whats the matter lovely im just so happy come on tell me well he didnt sound mad she debated then said well i was wondering there were some women at the grocery store then i put the news on i heardsomebody got burned real bad a policeman and then two people were killed stabbed daniel had said he just wanted the knife to threaten the guards he wasnt going to hurt anybody what he snapped his blue eyes grew hard no no whatre you doing jennie asked herself you made him mad why did you ask him that now youve fucked everything up her heart fluttered they did it again they always do it when i left nobody was hurt i was so careful i got out the fire door just like wed planned and slammed it shut then he nodded i knowsure there were other prisoners in a cell near mine they wanted me to let them out too but i wouldnt ill bet they started to riot and when the guards went to stop them thats when those two got killed some of them had shivs ill bet you know what that is a knife right homemade knife thats what happened and if somebody got burned it was because he was careless i looked carefullythere was no one else out there when i got through the fire and how could i attack three people all by myself ridiculous but the police and the newsre blaming me for it like they always do his lean face was red im the easy target just like that family eight years ago she said timidly trying to calm him nothing takes away the danger faster than agreeing with a man daniel had told her how he and his friend had gone to the croytons house to pitch a business idea to the computer genius but when they got there his friend it seemed had a whole different ideahe was going to rob the couple he knocked daniel out and started killing the family daniel had come to and tried to stop him finally hed had to kill his friend in selfdefense they blamed me for thatbecause you know how we hate it when the killer dies somebody goes into a school and shoots students and kills himself we want the bad guy alive we need somebody to blame its human nature he was right jennie reflected she was relieved but also terrified that shed upset him im sorry honey i shouldntve mentioned anything she expected him to tell her to shut up maybe even get out of the car and walk away but to her shock he smiled and stroked her hair you can ask me anything she hugged him again felt more tears on her cheek and touched them away the makeup had clotted she backed away staring at her fingers oh no look at this she wanted to be pretty for him the fears coming back digging away oh jennie youre going to be wearing your hair like that you sure you want toyou dont want bangs theyd cover up that high forehead of yours what if she didnt live up to his expectations daniel pell took her face in his strong hands lovely youre the most beautiful woman on the face of the earth you dont even need makeup like he could see right into her thoughts crying again ive been worried you wouldnt like me wouldnt like you baby i love you what i emailed you remember jennie remembered every word hed written she looked into his eyes oh youre such a beautiful person she pressed her lips against his though they made love in her imagination at least once a day this was their first kiss she felt his teeth against her lips his tongue they stayed locked together in this fierce embrace for what seemed like forever though it could have been a mere second jennie had no sense of time she wanted him inside her pressing hard his chest pulsing against hers souls are where love should start but youve got to get the bodies involved pretty damn soon she slipped her hand along his bare muscular leg he gave a laugh tell you what lovely maybe wed better get out of here sure whatever you want he asked you have the phone i called you on daniel had told her to buy three prepaid cell phones with cash she handed him the one shed answered when hed called just after hed escaped he took it apart and pulled the battery and sim card out he threw them into a trash can and returned to the car the others she produced them he handed her one and put the other in his pocket he said we ought to a siren sounded nearbyclose they froze angel songs jennie thought then recited this goodluck mantra a dozen times the sirens faded into the distance she turned back they might come back nodding after the sirens daniel smiled im not worried about that i just want to be alone with you jennie felt a shiver of happiness down her spine it almost hurt the westcentral regional headquarters of the california bureau of investigation home to dozens of agents was a twostory modern structure near highway indistinguishable from the other buildings around itfunctional rectangles of glass and stone housing doctors and lawyers offices architectural firms computer companies and the like the landscaping was meticulous and boring the parking lots always halfempty the countryside rose and fell in gentle hills which were at the moment bright green thanks to recent rains often the ground was as brown as colorado during a dry spell a united express regional jet banked sharply and low then leveled off vanishing over the trees for the touchdown at nearby monterey peninsula airport kathryn dance and michael oneil were in the cbis groundfloor conference room directly beneath her office they stood side by side staring at a large map on which the roadblocks were indicatedthis time with pushpins not entomological postit notes there had been no sightings of the worldwide express drivers honda and the net had been pushed farther back now eighty miles away kathryn dance glanced at oneils square face and read in it a complicated amalgam of determination and concern she knew him well theyd met years ago when she was a jury consultant studying the demeanor and responses of prospective jurors during voir dire and advising lawyers which to choose and which to reject shed been hired by federal prosecutors to help them select jurors in a rico trial in which oneil was a chief witness curiously shed met her late husband under parallel circumstances when she was a reporter covering a trial in salinas and he was a prosecution witness dance and oneil had become friends and stayed close over the years when shed decided to go into law enforcement and got a job with the regional office of the cbi she found herself working frequently with him stan fishburne then the agent in charge was one mentor oneil the other he taught her more about the art of investigation in six months than shed learned during her entire formal training they complemented each other well the quiet deliberate man preferred traditional police techniques like forensics undercover work surveillance and running confidential informants while dances specialty was canvassing interrogation and interviewing she knew she wouldnt be the agent she was today without oneils help or his humor and patience and other vital talents like offering her dramamine before she went out on his boat though their approach to their job and their talents differed their instincts were identical and they were closely attuned to each other she was amused to see that while hed been staring at the map in fact hed been sensing signals from her too what is it he asked how do you mean somethings bothering you more than just finding yourself in the drivers seat here yep she thought for a minute that was one thing about oneil he often forced her to put her tangled ideas in order before speaking she explained bad feeling about pell i got this idea that the guards deaths meant nothing to him juan too and that worldwide express driver hes dead you know i know you think pell wants to kill no not wants to or doesnt what he wants is whatever serves his interest however small in a way that seems scarier and makes it harder to anticipate him but lets hope im wrong youre never wrong boss tj appeared carrying a laptop he set it up on the battered conference table under a sign most wanted statewide below it were the ten winners of that contest reflecting the demographics of the state latino anglo asian and africanamerican in that order you find the mccoy woman or pells aunt not yet my troopsre on the case but check this out he adjusted the computer screen they hovered around the screen on which was a highresolution image of the photograph from morton nagles camera now larger and clearer it revealed a figure in a denim jacket on the driveway that led to the back of the building where the fire had started the shadow had morphed into a large black suitcase woman oneil asked they could judge the persons height by comparing it to the automobile nearby about dances height fivesix slimmer though she noted the cap and sunglasses obscured the head and face but through the vehicles window you could see hips slightly broader than a mans would be for that height and theres a glint see that tj tapped the screen earring dance glanced at the hole in his lobe where a diamond or metal stud occasionally resided statistically speaking tj said in defense of his observation okay i agree a blond woman about fivesix or so oneil summarized dance said weight oneten give or take she had a thought she called rey carraneo in his office upstairs asked him to join them he appeared a moment later agent dance go back to salinas talk to the manager of the you mail it store the accomplice had probably recently checked out the worldwide express delivery schedule at the franchise see if anyone there remembers a woman fitting her general description if so get a picture on efis the electronic facial identification system is a computerbased version of the old identikit used by investigators to recreate suspects likenesses from the recollections of witnesses sure agent dance tj hit some buttons and the jpeg zipped wirelessly to the color printer in his office carraneo would pick it up there tjs phone rang yo he jotted notes during a brief conversation which ended with i love you darling he hung up vital statistics clerk in sacramento britnee love that name shes very sweet way too sweet for me not to say it couldnt work out between us dance lifted an eyebrow the kinesic interpretation of which was get to the point i put her on the case of the missing family member capital f five years ago samantha mccoy changed her name to sarah monroe so she wouldnt have to throw out her monogrammed underwear id guess then three years ago somebody of that name marries ronald starkey there goes the monogram ploy anyway they live in san jose sure its the same mccoy the real mccoy you mean ive been waiting to say that yep good old social security with a parole board backup dance called directory assistance and got ronald and sarah starkeys address and phone number san jose oneil said thats close enough unlike the other two women in the family to whom dance had already spoken samantha could have planted the gas bomb this morning and been home in an hour and a half does she work dance asked i didnt check that out i will though you want we want oneil said tj didnt report to him and in the wellestablished hierarchy of law enforcement the cbi trumped mcso but a request from chief deputy michael oneil was the same as a request from dance or even higher a few minutes later tj returned to say that the tax department revealed that sarah starkey was employed by a small educational publisher in san jose dance got the number lets see if she was in this morning oneil asked howre you going to do that we cant let her know we suspect anything oh ill lie dance said breezily she called the publisher from a caller idblocked line when a woman answered dance said hi this is the el camino boutique we have an order for sarah starkey but the driver said she wasnt there this morning do you know what time shell be getting in sarah im afraid theres some mistake shes been here since eight thirty really well ill talk to the driver again might be better to deliver it to her house if you could not mention anything to mrs starkey id appreciate it its a surprise dance hung up she was there all morning tj applauded and the oscar for the best performance by a law enforcer deceiving the public goes to oneil frowned dont approve of my subversive techniques dance asked with his typical wry delivery oneil said no its just that youre going to have to send her something now the receptionists going to dime you out tell her shes got a secret admirer i know boss get her one of those balloon bouquets congratulations on not being a suspect dances administrative assistant short nononsense maryellen kresbach walked into the room with coffee for all dance never asked maryellen always brought the mother of three wore clattery high heels and favored complicated coiffed hair and impressive fingernails the crew in the conference room thanked her dance sipped the excellent coffee wished maryellen had brought some of the cookies sitting on her desk she envied the womans ability to be both a domestic powerhouse and the best assistant dance had ever had the agent noticed that maryellen wasnt leaving after delivering the caffeine didnt know if i should bother you but brian called he did he said you might not have gotten his message on friday you gave it to me i know i did i didnt tell him i did and i didnt tell him i didnt so feeling oneils eyes on her dance said okay thanks you want his number i have it okay her assistant continued to stand resolutely in front of her boss nodding slowly well this is a rather spiny moment dance didnt want to talk about brian gunderson the trill of the conferenceroom phone saved her she answered listened for a moment and said have somebody bring him to my office right away chapter the large man in a california department of corrections and rehabilitation uniform sat in front of her desk a workaday slab of governmentissue furniture on which lay random pens some awards a lamp and photos of the two children of dance with a handsome silverhaired man of her mother and father and of two dogs each paired with one of the youngsters a dozen files also rested on the cheap laminate they were facedown this is terrible said tony waters a senior guard from capitola correctional facility i cant tell you dance detected traces of a southeastern accent in the distraught voice the monterey peninsula drew people from all over the world dance and waters were alone at the moment michael oneil was checking on the forensics from the scene of the escape you were in charge of the wing where pell was incarcerated dance asked thats right bulky and with stooped shoulders waters sat forward in the chair he was in his midfifties she estimated did pell say anything to youabout where hes headed no maam ive been racking my brain since it happened that was the first thing i did when i heard i sat down and went through everything hed said in the past week or more but no nothing for one thing daniel didnt talk a lot not to us the hacks did he spend time in the library huge amount read all the time can i find out what its not logged and the cons cant check anything out how about visitors nobody in the last year and telephone calls are they logged yes maam but not recorded he thought back he didnt have many aside from reporters wanting to interview him but he never called back i think maybe he talked to his aunt once or twice no others i remember what about computers email not for the prisoners we do for ourselves of course theyre in a special areaa control zone were very strict about that you know i was thinking about it and if he communicated with anybody on the outside which he had to do dance pointed out right it had to be through a con being released you might want to check there i thought of that ive talked to your warden she tells me that there were only two releases in the past month and their parole officers had them accounted for this morning they couldve gotten messages to someone though the officersre checking that out waters shed noted had arrived emptyhanded and dance now asked did you get our request for the contents of his cell the guards mood darkened he was shaking his head looking down yes maam but it was empty nothing inside at all had been empty for a couple of days actually he looked up his lips tight as he seemed to be debating then his eyes dipped as he said i didnt catch it catch what the thing is ive worked the q and soledad and lompoc half dozen others we learn to look for certain things see if something bigs going down the cons cells change thingsll disappearsometimes its evidence that theyre going to make a run or evidence of shit a cons done that he doesnt want us to know about or what hes going to do because he knows well look over the cell with a microscope after but with pell you didnt think about him throwing everything out we never had an escape from capitola it cant happen and theyre watched so close its almost impossible for a con to move on another onekill him i mean the mans face was flushed i shouldve thought better if itd been lompoc idve known right away something was going down he rubbed his eyes i screwed up thatd be a tough leap to make dance reassured him from housekeeping to escaping he shrugged and examined his nails he wore no jewelry but dance could see the indentation of a wedding band it occurred to her that for once this was no badge of infidelity but a concession to the job probably circulating among dangerous prisoners it was better not to wear anything they might steal sounds like youve been in this business for a while long time after the army i got into corrections been there ever since he brushed his crewcut grinning sometimes seems like forever sometimes seems like just yesterday two years till i retire in a funny way ill miss it he was at ease now realizing he wouldnt be horsewhipped for not foreseeing the escape she asked about where he lived his family he was married and held up his left hand laughing her deduction about the ring proved correct he and his wife had two children both bound for college he said proudly but while they chatted a silent alarm was pulsing within dance she had a situation on her hands tony waters was lying many falsehoods go undetected simply because the person being deceived doesnt expect to be lied to dance had asked waters here only to get information about daniel pell so she wasnt in interrogation mode if waters had been a suspect or a hostile witness shed have been looking for stress signs when he gave certain answers then kept probing those topics until he admitted lying and eventually told the truth this process only works though if you determine the subjects nondeceptive baseline behavior before you start asking the sensitive questions which dance of course had had no reason to do because shed assumed hed be truthful even without a baseline comparison though a perceptive kinesic interrogator can sometimes spot deception two clues signal lying with some consistency one is a very slight increase in the pitch of the voice because lying triggers an emotional response within most people and emotion causes vocal cords to tighten the other signal is pausing before and during answering since lying is mentally challenging one whos lying has to think constantly about what he and other people have said previously about the topic then craft a fictitious response thats consistent with those prior statements and what he believes the interrogator knows in her conversation with the guard dance had become aware that at several points his voice had risen in pitch and hed paused when there was no reason for him to once she caught on to this she looked back to other behaviors and saw that they suggested deception offering more information than necessary digressing engaging in negation movementtouching his head nose and eyes particularlyand aversion turning away from her as soon as theres evidence of deception an interview turns into an interrogation and the officers approach changes it was at that point in their conversation that shed broken off the questions about pell and had begun talking about topics hed have no reason to lie abouthis personal life the peninsula and so on this was to establish his baseline behavior as she was doing this dance performed her standard fourpart analysis of the subject himself to give her an idea of how tactically to plan the interrogation first she asked what was his role in the incident she concluded that tony waters was at best an uncooperative witness at worst an accomplice of pells second did he have a motive to lie of course waters didnt want to be arrested or lose his job because intentionally or through negligence hed helped daniel pell escape he might also have a personal or financial interest in aiding the killer third what was his personality type interrogators need this information to adjust their own demeanor when questioning the subjectshould they be aggressive or conciliatory some officers simply determine if the subject is an introvert or extrovert which gives a pretty good idea of how assertive to be dance though preferred a more comprehensive approach trying to assign code letters from the myersbriggs personality type indicator which includes three other attributes in addition to introvert or extrovert thinking or feeling sensing or intuitive judging or perceiving dance concluded that waters was a thinkingsensingjudgingextrovert which meant that she could be more blunt with him than with a more emotional internalized subject and could use various rewardpunishment techniques to break down the lies finally she asked what kind of liars personality does waters have there are several types manipulators or high machiavellians after the ruthless italian prince lie with impunity seeing nothing wrong with it using deceit as a tool to achieve their goals in love business politicsor crime other types include social liars who lie to entertain and adaptors insecure people who lie to make positive impressions she decided that given his career as a lifelong prison guard and the ease with which hed tried to take charge of the conversation and lead her away from the truth waters was in yet another category he was an actor someone for whom control was an important issue they dont lie regularly only when necessary and are less skilled than high machs but theyre good deceivers dance now took off her glasseschic ones with dark red framesand on the pretense of cleaning them set them aside and put on narrower lenses encased in black steel the predator specs shed worn when interrogating pell she rose walked around the desk and sat in the chair beside him interrogators refer to the immediate space around a human being as the proxemic zone ranging from intimate six to eighteen inches to public ten feet away and beyond dances preferred space for interrogation was within the intermediate personal zone about two feet away waters noted the move with curiosity but he said nothing about it nor did she now tony id just like to go over a few things one more time sure whatever he lifted his ankle to his kneea move that seemed relaxed but in fact was a glaring defense maneuver she returned to a topic that she now knew had raised significant stress indicators in waters tell me again about the computers at capitola computers responding with a question was a classic indicator of deception the subject is trying to buy time to decide where the interrogator is going and how to frame a response yes what kind do you have oh im not a tech guy i dont know his foot tapped dells i think laptops or desktops we have both mostly theyre desktops not that therere like hundreds of them you know he offered a conspiratorial smile state budgets and everything he told a story about recent financial cuts at the department of corrections which dance found interesting only because it was such a bald attempt at distracting her she steered him back now access to computers in capitola tell me about it again like i said cons arent allowed to use them technically this was a true statement but he hadnt said that cons dont use them deception includes evasive answers as well as outright lies could they have access to them not really sort of pregnant kind of dead how do you mean that tony i shouldve said no they cant but you said guards and office workers have access right now why couldnt a con use a computer waters had originally said that this was because they were in a control zone she recalled an aversion behavior and a slight change in pitch when hed used the phrase he now paused for just a second as she supposed he was trying to recall what hed said theyre in an area of limited access only nonviolent cons are allowed there some of them help out in the office supervised of course administrative duty but they cant use the computers and pell couldnt get in there hes classified as one a dance noticed the nonresponsive answer and the blocking gesturea scratch of his eyelidwhen he gave it and that meant he wasnt allowed in anywhat were those areas again la locations limited access he now remembered what hed said earlier or control zones controlled or control a pause control zone controlledwith an ed on the endwould make more sense youre sure thats not it he grew flustered well i dont know what difference does it make we use em both and you use that term for other areas too like the wardens office and the guards locker roomwould they be control zones sure i mean some people use that phrase more than others i picked it up at another facility which one would that be a pause oh i dont remember look i made it sound like its an official name or something its just a thing we say everybody inside uses shorthand i mean prisons everywhere guardsre hacks prisoners are cons its not official or anything you do the same at cbi dont you everybody does this was a double play deceptive subjects often try to establish camaraderie with their interrogators you do the same and use generalizations and abstractions everybody everywhere dance asked in a low steady voice whether authorized or not in whatever zone have daniel pell and a computer ever been in the same room at the same time at capitola ive never seen him on a computer i swear honestly the stress that people experience when lying pushes them into one of four emotional states theyre angry theyre depressed theyre in denial or they want to bargain their way out of trouble the words that waters had just usedi swear and honestlywere expressions that along with his agitated body language very different from his baseline told dance that the guard was in the denial stage of deception he just couldnt accept the truth of whatever hed done at the prison and was dodging responsibility for it its important to determine which stress state the subject is in because that allows the interrogator to decide on a tactic for questioning when the subject is in the anger phase for instance you encourage him to vent until he exhausts himself in the case of denial you attack on the facts which was what she now did you have access to the office where the computers are kept right yeah i do but so what all the hacks do hey what is this im on your side a typical deniers deflection which dance ignored and you said its possible some prisoners would be in that office has pell ever been in there nonviolent felons are the only ones allowed in has pell ever been in there i swear to god i never saw him dance noted adaptorsgestures meant to relieve tension fingerflexing foottappinghis shoulder aimed toward her like a football players defensive posture and more frequent glances at the door liars actually glance at routes by which they can escape the stress of the interrogation thats about the fourth time you havent answered my question tony now was pell ever in any room in capitola with a computer the guard grimaced im sorry i didnt mean to be you know difficult i just was kind of flustered i guess i mean like i felt you were accusing me of something okay i never saw him on a computer really i wasnt lying ive been pretty upset by this whole thing you can imagine that his shoulders drooped his head lowered a half inch sure i can tony maybe daniel couldve been her attack had made waters realize that it was more painful to endure the battering of the interrogation than to own up to what he was lying about like turning a light switch waters was suddenly in the bargaining phase of deception this meant he was getting close to dropping the deception but was still holding back the full truth in an effort to escape punishment dance knew that she had to abandon the frontal assault now and offer him some way to save face in an interrogation the enemy isnt the liar but the lie so she said in a friendly voice sitting back out of his personal zone its possible that at some point pell couldve gotten access to a computer i guess it couldve happened but i dont know for sure he was on one his head drooped even more his voice was soft its justits hard doing what we do people dont understand being a hack what its like im sure they dont dance agreed we have to be teachers and cops everything andhis voice lowered conspiratoriallyadmins always looking over our shoulders telling us to do this do that keep the peace let them know when somethings going down probably like being a parent youre always watching your children yeah exactly its like having children wide eyesan affect display revealing his emotion dance nodded emphatically obviously tony you care about the cons and about doing a good job people in the bargaining phase want to be reassured and forgiven it was nothing really what happened go ahead i made a decision its a tough job you have you must have to make hard decisions every day ha every hour so what did you have to decide okay see daniel was different dance noted the use of the first name pell had gotten waters to believe they were buddies and exploited the faux friendship how do you mean hes got thisi dont know power or something over people the aryans the ogs the latshe goes where he wants to and nobody touches him never seen anybody like him inside before people do things for him whatever he wants people tell him things and so he gave you information is that it good information stuff nobody couldntve got otherwise like there was a guard selling meth a con odd on it theres no way we couldve found out who was the source but pell let me know saved lives ill bet oh yes maam and say somebody was going to move on somebody else gut em with a shank whatever danield tell me dance shrugged so you cut him some slack you let him into the office yeah the tv in the office had cable and sometimes he wanted to watch games nobody else was interested in thats all that happened there was no danger or anything the offices a maximumsecurity lockdown area theres no way he couldve gotten out i went on rounds and he watched games how often three four times so he couldve been online maybe when most recently yesterday okay tony now tell me about the telephones dance recalled seeing a stress reaction when hed told her pell had made no calls other than to his aunt waters had touched his lips a blocking gesture if a subject confesses to one crime its often easier to get him to confess to another waters said the other thing about pell everybodyll tell you he was into sex way into sex he wanted to make some phonesex calls and i let him but dance immediately noticed deviation from the baseline and concluded that although he was confessing it was to a small crime which usually means that theres a bigger one lurking did he now she asked bluntly leaning close once again and how did he pay for it credit card ninehundred number a pause waters hadnt thought out the lie hed forgotten you had to pay for phone sex i dont mean like youd call up one of those numbers in the backs of newspapers i guess it sounded like thats what i meant daniel called some woman he knew i think it was somebody whod written him he got a lot of mail a weak smile fans imagine that a man like him dance leaned a bit closer but when you listened there wasnt any sex was there no i he mustve realized he hadnt said anything about listening in but by then it was too late no they were just talking you heard both of them yeah i was on a third line when was it about a month ago the first time then a couple more times yesterday when he was in the office are calls there logged no not local ones if it was long distance it would be eyes on the floor waters was miserable what tony i got him a phone card you call an eight hundred number and punch in a code then the number you want dance knew them untraceable really you have to believe me i wouldntve done it except the information he gave meit was good it saved what were they talking about she asked in a friendly voice youre never rough with a confessing subject theyre your new best friend just stuff you know money i remember what about it pell asked how much shed put together and she said ninetytwo hundred bucks and he said thats all pretty expensive phone sex dance reflected wryly then she asked about visiting hours and he said it wouldnt be a good idea so he didnt want her to visit no record of them together any idea of where she was he mentioned bakersfield he said specifically to bakersfield telling her to go to his aunts place and pick up the hammer to plant in the well and okay its coming back to me now she was telling him about wrens and hummingbirds in the backyard and then mexican food mexican is comfort food thats what she said did her voice have an ethnic or regional accent not that i could tell was it low or high her voice low i guess kind of sexy did she sound smart or stupid jeez i couldnt tell he sounded exhausted is there anything else thats helpful tony come on we really need to get this guy not that i can think of im sorry she looked him over and believed that no he didnt know anything more okay i think thatll do it for the time being he started out at the door he paused and looked back sorry i was kind of confused its been a tough day not a good day at all she agreed he remained motionless in the doorway a dejected pet when he didnt get the reassurance he sought he slumped away dance called carraneo currently en route to the you mail it store and gave him the information shed pried from the guard that his partner didnt seem to have any accent and that she had a low voice that might help the manager remember the woman more clearly she then called the warden of capitola and told her what happened the woman was silent for a moment then offered a soft oh dance asked if the prison had a computer specialist it did and shed have him search the computers in the administrative office for online activity and emails yesterday it should be easy since the staff didnt work on sunday and pell presumably had been the only one onlineif he had been im sorry dance said yeah thanks the agent was referring not so much to pells escape but to yet another consequence of it dance didnt know the warden but supposed that to run a superprison she was talented at her job and the work was important to her it was a shame that her career in corrections like tony waterss would probably soon be over chapter shed done well his little lovely followed the instructions perfectly getting the hammer from his aunts garage in bakersfield how had kathryn dance figured that one out embossing the wallet with robert herrons initials then planting them in the well in salinas making the fuse for the gas bomb shed said it was as easy as following a recipe for a cake planting the bag containing the fire suit and knife hiding clothes under the pine tree pell though hadnt been sure of her ability to look people in the eye and lie to them so he hadnt used her as a getaway driver from the courthouse in fact hed made sure that she wasnt anywhere near the place when he escaped he didnt want her stopped at a roadblock and giving everything away because she stammered and flushed with guilt now shoes off as she drove he found that kinky a happy smile on her face jennie marston was chattering away in her sultry voice pell had wondered if shed believe the story about his innocence in the deaths at the courthouse but one thing that had astonished daniel pell in all his years of getting people to do what he wanted was how often they unwittingly leapt at the chance to be victims how often they flung logic and caution to the wind and believed what they wanted tothat is what he wanted them to still that didnt mean jennie would buy everything he told her and in light of what he had planned for the next few days hed have to monitor her closely see where shed support him and where shed balk they drove through a complicated route of surface streets avoiding the highways with their potential roadblocks im glad youre here she said voice tentative as she rested a hand on his knee with ambivalent desperation he knew what she was feeling torn between pouring out her love for him and scaring him off the gushing would win out always did with women like her oh daniel pell knew all about the jennie marstons of the world the women breathlessly seduced by bad boys hed learned about them years ago being a habitual con youre in a bar and you drop the news that youve done time most womenll blink and never come back from their next restroom visit but therere some wholl get wet when you whisper about the crime youd done and the time youd served theyd smile in a certain way lean close and want to hear more that included murderdepending on how you couched it and daniel pell knew how to couch things yes jennie was your classic badboy lover you wouldnt guess it to look at her the skinny caterer with straight blond hair a pretty face marred by a bumpy nose dressing like a suburban mom at a mary chapin carpenter concert hardly the sort to write to lifers in places like capitola dear daniel pell you dont know me but i saw a special about you it was on a amp e and i dont think it told the whole truth i have also bought all the books i could find on you and read them and you are a fascinating man and even if you did what they say im sure there were extreme circumstances about it i could see it in your eyes you were looking at the camera but it was like you were looking right at me i have a background that is similar to yours i mean your childhood or absence of childhood and i can understand where you are coming from i mean totally if you would like to you can write me very sincerely jennie marston she wasnt the only one of course daniel pell got a lot of mail some praising him for killing a capitalist some condemning him for killing a family some offering advice some seeking it plenty of romantic overtures too most of the ladies and men would tend to lose steam after a few weeks as reason set in but jennie had persisted her letters growing more and more passionate my dearest daniel today i was driving in the desert out near palomar observatory where they have the big telescope the sky was so big it was dusk and there were stars just coming out i couldnt stop thinking about you about how you said no one understands you and blames you for bad things you didnt do how hard thats got to be they dont see into you they dont see the truth not like i do you would never say it because your modest but they dont see what a perfect human being you are i stopped the car i couldnt help myself i was touching myself all over you know doing what ill bet you do you dirty boy we made love there you and me watching the stars i say we because you were there with me in spirit id do anything for you daniel it was such lettersreflecting her total lack of selfcontrol and extraordinary gullibilitythat had made pell decide on her for the escape he now asked you were careful about everything werent you nobody can trace the tbird no i stole it from a restaurant there was this guy i went out with a couple years ago i mean we didnt sleep together or anything she added this too fast and he supposed theyd spent plenty of time humping like clueless little bunnies not that he cared she continued he worked there and when id hang out i saw that nobody paid any attention to the valetparking key box so friday i took the bus over there and waited across the street when the valets were busy i got the keys i picked the thunderbird because this couple had just went inside so theyd be there for a while i was on the oneohone in like ten minutes you drive straight through no i spent the night in san luis obispobut i paid cash like you said and you burned all the emails right before you left uhhuh good you have the maps yep i do she patted her purse he looked over her body the small swell of her chest the thin legs and butt her long blond hair women let you know right up front the kind of license you have and pell knew he could touch her whenever and wherever he wanted he put his hand on the nape of her neck how thin fragile she made a sound that was actually purring the swelling within him continued to grow the purring too he waited as long as he could but the bubble won pull over there baby he pointed toward a road under a grove of oak trees it seemed to be a driveway to an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of an overgrown field she hit the brakes and turned down the road pell looked around not a soul he could see here thiss good his hand slid from her neck down the front of her pink blouse it looked new shed bought it just for him he understood pell lifted her face and pressed his lips against hers softly not opening his mouth he kissed her lightly then backed away making her come to him she grew more and more frantic the more he teased i want you in me she whispered reaching into the back where he heard the crinkle of a bag a trojan appeared in her hand we dont have much time baby theyre looking for us she got the message however innocent they look girls who love bad boys know what theyre doing and jennie marston didnt look all that innocent she unbuttoned her blouse and leaned over to the passenger seat rubbing the padded bra against his crotch lie back sweetie close your eyes no she hesitated i want to watch you he whispered never give them more power than you have to more purring she unzipped his shorts and bent down only a few minutes later he was finished she was as talented as hed expectedjennie didnt have many resources but she exploited the ones she hadand the event was fine though when they got into the privacy of a motel room hed up the ante considerably but for now this would do and as for her pell knew his explosive voluminous completion was satisfaction enough he turned his eyes to hers youre wonderful lovely that was so special she was so drunk on emotion that even this trite pornmovie dialogue would have sounded to her like a declaration of love out of an oldtime novel oh daniel he sat back and reassembled his clothes jennie buttoned the blouse pell looked at the pink cloth the embroidery the metal tips on the collar she noticed him you like its nice he glanced out the window and studied the fields around them not worried about police more intent on her aware she was studying the blouse hesitantly jennie said its awfully pink maybe too much i just saw it and thought id get it no its fine its interesting as she fastened the buttons she glanced at the pearl dots then the embroidery the cuffs shed probably had to work a whole week to afford it ill change later if you want no if you like it thats fine he said getting his tone just right like a singer hitting a difficult note he glanced at the garment once more then he leaned forward and kissed herthe forehead not the mouth of course he scanned the field again we should get back on the road sure she wanted him to tell her more about the blouse what was wrong with it did he hate pink did an exgirlfriend have a shirt like it did it make her boobs look small but of course he said nothing jennie smiled when he touched her leg and she put the car in gear she returned to the road glancing down one last time at the blouse which pell knew she would never wear again his goal had been for her to throw it out he had a pretty good idea that she would and the irony was that the blouse looked really good on her and he liked it quite a bit but offering his subtle disapproval and watching her reaction gave him a nice picture of exactly where she was how controllable how loyal a good teacher always knows the exact state of his students progress michael oneil sat in a chair in dances office rocking back and forth on its rear legs his shoes on her battered coffee table it was his favorite way to sit kinesically dance put the habit down to nervous energyand a few other issues which because she was so close to him she chose not to analyze in more depth he tj scanlon and dance were gazing at her phone from whose speaker a computer tech from capitola prison was explaining pell did get online yesterday but apparently he didnt send any emailsat least not then i couldnt tell about earlier yesterday he only browsed the web he erased the sites he visited but he forgot about erasing search requests i found what he was looking up go ahead he did a google search for alison and nimue he searched those together as limiting terms dance asked for spellings then he did another helter skelter oneil and dance shared a troubled glance the phrase was the title of a beatles song which charles manson was obsessed with he had used the term to refer to an impending race war in america it was also the title of the awardwinning book about the cult leader and the murders by the man who prosecuted him then he went to visualearth dot com like google earth you can see satellite pictures of practically everywhere on the planet great dance thought though it turned out not to be there was no way to narrow down what hed looked for it couldve been highways in california it couldve been paris or key west or moscow and whats nimue no idea does it mean anything in capitola no any employees there named alison the disembodied voice of the techie said nope but i was going to say i might be able to find out what sites he logged onto it depends on whether he just erased or shredded them if theyre shredded forget it but if theyre just dumped i might be able to find them floating around in the free space somewhere on the hard drive anything you can do would be appreciated dance said ill get right on it she thanked him and they disconnected tj check out nimue his fingers flew over the keyboard the results came up and he scrolled through them after a few minutes he said hundreds of thousands of hits looks like a lot of people use it as a screen name oneil said somebody he knew online or a nickname or somebodys real last name staring at the screen tj continued trademarks too cosmetics electronic equipmenthm sex productsnever seen one of those before tj dance snapped sorry he scrolled again interesting most references are to king arthur as in camelot i guess he continued to read nimue was the lady of the lake this wizard merlin fell in love with herhe was like a hundred or something and she was sixteen now thatll guarantee you twenty minutes on dr phil he read some more merlin taught her how to be a sorceress oh and she gave king arthur this magic sword excalibur oneil said what tj asked the sword excalibur havent you heard any of this before the detective asked naw i didnt take boring madeup stuff in college i like the idea that its somebody he was trying to find crosscheck nimue with pell alison california carmel croytonanything else oneil suggested the women sheffield mccoy whitfield good after several minutes of frantic typing the agent looked over at dance sorry boss zip check the search terms out with vicap ncic and the other main criminal databases will do dance stared at the words shed written what did they mean why had he risked going online to check them out helter skelter nimue alison and what had he been looking at on visualearth a place he intended to flee to a place he intended to burglarize she asked oneil what about the forensics at the courthouse the detective consulted his notes no red flags almost everything was burned or melted the gas was in plastic milk jugs inside a cheap roller suitcase sold in a dozen placeswalmart target stores like that the fireproof bag and fire suit were made by protection equipment inc new jersey available all over the world but most are sold in southern california brushfires movies for stuntmen a dozen outlets not much to follow up on though therere no serial numbers they couldnt lift any prints off the bag or the suit now the additives in the gas mean it was bp but we cant narrow it down to a particular station the fuse was homemade rope soaked in slowburning chemicals none of themre traceable either tj whats the word on the aunt zip so far im expecting a breakthrough any moment her phone rang it was another call from capitola the warden was with the prisoner who claimed he had some information about daniel pell did dance want to talk to him now sure she hit the speakerphone button this is agent dance im here with detective oneil hey im eddie chang eddie the warden added is doing a fivetoeight for bank robbery hes in capitola because he can be a bitslippery how well did you know daniel pell dance asked not really good nobody did but i was somebody who you know wasnt no threat to him so he kind of opened up to me and youve got some information on him yes maam whyre you helping us oneil asked up for parole in six months i help you itll go good for me provided you catch him of course if you dont i think ill stay in the big c here until you do now that im rolling over on him oneil asked did pell talk about girlfriends or anyone on the outside particularly a woman he bragged about the women hed had hed give us these great stories it was like watching a porn film oh man we loved those stories you remember any names someone named alison he never mentioned anybody after what tony waters had told her dance suspected that pell was making up the sex storiesusing them as incentives to get the cons to do things for him she asked so what do you want to tell us i have this idea where he might be headed dance and oneil shared a glance outside of acapulco theres a town there santa rosario in the mountains why there okay what it was maybe a week ago we were sitting around bullshitting and there was a new con felipe rivera doing a backtoback cause he got triggerhappy during a gta we were talking and pell finds out he was from mexico so pells asking him about this santa rosario riverad never heard of it but pells pretty anxious to find out more so he describes it like trying to jog his memory its got a hot spring and its not near any big highways and theres this steep mountain nearby but rivera couldnt remember anything then pell shut up about it and changed the subject so i was figuring thats what he mightve had in mind dance asked before that had he ever mentioned mexico maybe cant say as i recall think back eddie say six months a year did pell ever talk about someplace else hed like to go another pause no sorry i mean no place he thought was man ive gotta go there because its kickass or whatever how about somewhere he was just interested in or curious about oh hey a couple times he mentioned that mormon place salt lake city no the state utah what he liked was that you could have a lot of wives the family he said in utah the police dont give you any shit because its the mormons who run the state and they dont like the fbi or the state police snooping around you can do whatever you want in utah when did he tell you that i dont know a while ago last year then maybe a month ago dance glanced at oneil and he nodded let me call you back can you wait there for a minute a laugh from chang and where would i go she disconnected then called linda whitfield and after her rebecca sheffield neither woman knew of any interest pell had ever expressed in either mexico or utah as for the attraction of mormon polygamy linda said hed never mentioned it rebecca laughed pell liked sleeping with several women thats different from being married to several women real different dance and oneil walked upstairs to charles overbys office and briefed him about the possible destinations as well as the three references theyd found in the google search and the crimescene results acapulco no it was a plant im sure he asked about it just last week and in front of other cons its too obvious utahs more likely but ive got to find out more well front burner it kathryn overby said i just got a call from the new york times his phone rang its sacramento on two charles his assistant said he sighed and grabbed the handset dance and oneil left and just as they got into the hallway his phone rang too as they walked she glanced at him several times michael oneils affect displayssignals of emotionwere virtually invisible most of the time but they were obvious to her she deduced the call was about juan millar she could see clearly how upset he was about his fellow officers injury she didnt know the last time hed been so troubled oneil hung up and gave her a summary of the detectives condition it was the same as earlier but hed been awake once or twice go see him dance said you sure ill follow up here dance returned to her office pausing to pour another coffee from the pot near maryellen kresbach who said nothing more about phone messages though dance sensed she wanted to brian called this time she grabbed the chocolate chip cookie shed been fantasizing about at her desk she called chang and the warden back eddie i want to keep going i want you to tell me more about pell anything about him you can remember things he said things he did what made him laugh what made him mad a pause i dont know what to tell you really he sounded confused hey hows this for an idea pretend somebody was going to set me up on a date with pell what would you tell me about him before we went out a date with daniel pell whoa thats one fucking scary thought do your best cupid chapter back in her office dance heard the frog croak again and she picked up her cell phone the caller was rey carraneo reporting that the manager of the you mail it franchise on san benito way in salinas did remember a woman in the store about a week ago only she didnt mail anything agent dance she just asked about when the different delivery services stopped there worldwide express was the most regular he told her like clockwork he wouldntve thought anything about it except that he saw her outside a few days later sitting on a park bench across the street id guess she was checking the times herself unfortunately carraneo couldnt do an efis image because shed worn the baseball cap and dark sunglasses then too nor had the manager seen her car they disconnected and she wondered again when the worldwide express drivers body would be found more violence more death another family altered the ripples of consequence can spread almost forever it was just as that recollection of morton nagles words was passing through her mind that michael oneil called coincidentally his message was about that very drivers fate dance was in the front seat of her taurus from the cd player the original fairfield four gospel singers did their best to distract her from the carnage of the morning im standing in the safety zone music was kathryn dances salvation policework for her wasnt test tubes and computer screens it was people her job required her to blend her mind and heart and emotions with theirs and stay close to them so that she could discern the truths they knew but hesitated to share the interrogations were usually difficult and sometimes wrenching and the memories of what the subjects had said and done often horrendous crimes never left her completely if alan stivells celtic harp melodies or natty bo and beny billys irrepressible ska cubano tunes or lightnin hopkinss raw zinging chords were churning in her ears and thoughts she tended not to hear the shocking replays of her interviews with rapists and murderers and terrorists dance now lost herself in the scratchy tones of the music from a halfcentury ago roll jordan roll five minutes later she pulled into an office park on the north side of monterey just off munras avenue and climbed out she walked into the groundfloor garage where the worldwide express drivers red honda civic sat trunk open blood smeared on the sheet metal oneil and a town cop were standing beside it someone else was with them billy gilmore the driver dance had been sure was pells next victim to her shock hed been found very much alive the heavyset man had some bruises and a large bandage on his foreheadcovering the cut that was apparently the source of the bloodbut it turned out the injuries werent from being beaten by pell hed cut himself shifting around in the trunk to get comfortable i wasnt trying to get out i was afraid to but somebody heard me i guess and called the police i was supposed to stay in there for three hours pell told me if i didnt he said hed kill my wife and kids theyre okay oneil explained to dance weve got them in protection he related billys story about pells hijacking the truck then the car the driver had confirmed that pell was armed what was he wearing shorts a dark windbreaker baseball cap i think i dont know i was really freaked out oneil had called in the new description to the roadblocks and search parties pell had given billy no idea where he was ultimately going but was very clear about directions to this garage he knew just where it was and that itd be deserted the woman accomplice had checked this out too of course shed met him here and theyd headed for utah presumably do you remember anything else dance asked just after hed slammed the trunk lid billy said hed heard the mans voice again somebody was with him no it was just him i think he was making a call he had my phone your phone dance asked surprised a glance at oneil who immediately called the sheriffs office technicalsupport people and had the techs get in touch with the drivers cell phone service provider to set up a trace dance asked if billy had heard anything that pell said no it was just mumbling to me oneils mobile rang and he listened for a few minutes and said to dance nope its either destroyed or the batterys out they cant find a signal dance looked around the garage hes dumped it somewhere lets hope nearby we should have somebody check the trash cansand the drains in the street bushes too oneil said and sent two of his deputies off on the task tj joined them he did come this way call me crazy boss but this isnt on the route i myself would take to utah whether or not pell was headed for utah his coming to downtown monterey was surprising it was a small town and hed easily be spotted and there were far fewer escape routes than if hed gone east north or south a risky place to meet his accomplice but a brilliant move this was the last place theyd expect him one other question nagged billy i need to ask you something why are you still alive iwell i begged him not to hurt me practically got on my hands and knees it was embarrassing it was also a lie dance didnt even need a baseline to see the stress flood through the mans body he looked away and his face flushed i need to know the truth it could be important she said really i was crying like a baby i think he felt sorry for me daniel pell has never felt sorry for a human being in his life oneil said go on dance said softly well okay he swallowed and his face turned bright red we made a deal he was going to kill me im sure he was i said if hed let me live tears filled his eyes it was hard to watch the misery but dance needed to understand pell and why this man was still alive when two others had been killed under similar circumstances go on she said softly i said if he let me live id do anything for him i meant give him money or something but he said he wanted me tosee he saw my wifes picture and he liked how she looked so he asked me to tell him about the things we did together you know intimate things he stared at the concrete floor of the garage like he wanted all the details i mean everything what else dance prompted naw that was it it was so embarrassing billy please tell me his eyes filled with tears his jaw was trembling what a deep breath he got my home phone number and he said hed call me at night sometime maybe next month maybe six months id never know and when he called my wife and me were supposed to go in the bedroom and you know the words caught in his throat i was supposed to leave the phone off the hook so he could listen to us pam had to say some things he told me dance glanced at oneil who exhaled softly well catch him before anything like that happens the man wiped his face i almost told him no you fucker go ahead and kill me but i couldnt why dont you go be with your family get out of town for a while i almost told him that i really did a medical tech led him back to the ambulance oneil whispered what the hellre we up against here echoing dances exact thought detective ive got a phone an mcso deputy called as he joined them was up the street in a trash can the battery was in another can across the street good catch oneil told the man dance took a pair of latex gloves from tj pulled them on then took the phone and replaced the battery she turned it on and scrolled through recent calls none had been received but five had been made since the escape she called them out to oneil who was on the phone with his tech people again they did a reverse lookup the first wasnt a working number it wasnt even a real exchange prefixwhich meant that the call to the accomplice about billys family had never occurred it was simply to frighten him into cooperating the second and third calls were to another number which turned out to be a prepaid mobile phone it was presently off probably destroyed there was no signal to triangulate on the last two numbers were more helpful the first was a call directory assistance the area code was utah the last numberthe one pell had presumably gotten from the operatorwas an rv campsite outside salt lake city bingo tj said dance called the number and identified herself she asked if theyd received a call forty minutes ago the clerk said that she had a man from missouri driving west who was curious how much it cost to park a small winnebago there by the week any other calls around that time my mother and two of the guests here complaining about something or other that was all did the man say when hed be arriving no dance thanked the woman and told her to call them immediately if he contacted them again she explained to oneil and tj what the rv camp manager had said and then phoned the utah state policeshe was friends with a captain in salt lake cityand told him the situation the usp would immediately send a surveillance team to the campsite dances eyes slipped to the miserable driver staring at the ground again the man would live for the rest of his life with the horror hed experienced todayperhaps less the kidnapping itself than the degradation of pells deal she thought again of morton nagle billy had escaped with his life but was yet another victim of daniel pell should i tell overby about utah tj asked hell want to get word out she was interrupted though by a phone call hold on she told the young agent she answered it was the computer specialist from capitola prison excited the young man said that hed managed to find one site that pell had visited it had to do with the helter skelter search it was pretty smart the man said i dont think he had any interest in the term itself he used it to find a bulletin board where people post messages about crime and murder its called manslaughter therere different categories depending on the type of crimes ones the bundy effect about serial killers you know after ted bundy helter skelter is devoted to cult murders i found a message that had been posted on saturday and i think it was meant for him dance said and he didnt type the url to manslaughter dot com directly in case we checked the computer and would find the website right he used the search engine instead clever can you find out who posted it it was anonymous no way to trace it and what did it say he read her the short message only a few lines long there was no doubt it was intended for pell it gave the lastminute details of the escape the poster of the message added something else at the end but as dance listened she shook her head it made no sense im sorry could you repeat that he did okay dance said appreciate it forward me a copy of that she gave her email address anything else i can do let me know dance disconnected and stood silently for a moment trying to fathom the message oneil noticed her troubled face but didnt disturb her with questions she debated and then came to a decision she called charles overby and told him about the camper park in utah her boss was delighted at the news then thinking about the conversation with eddie chang about her imaginary date with pell she called rey carraneo back and sent him on another assignment as the young agent digested her request he said uncertainly well sure agent dance i guess she didnt blame him the task was unorthodox to say the least still she said pull out all the stops um she deduced he hadnt heard the expression move fast chapter were getting sand dabs okay jennie agreed whats that these little fish like anchovies but theyre not salty well get sandwiches im having two you want two just one honey put vinegar on them they have that at the tables jennie and pell were in moss landing north of monterey on the land side was the massive duke power plant its steam stacks soaring high into the air across the highway was a small spit of land an island really accessible only by bridge on this strip of sandy soil were marine service companies docks and the rambling massive structure where pell and jennie now sat jacks seafood it had been in business for threequarters of a century john steinbeck joseph campbell and henry milleras well as montereys most famous madam flora woodswould sit around the stained scarred tables arguing laughing and drinking till the place closed and sometimes until much later now jacks was a commercial fishery seafood market and cavernous restaurant all rolled into one the atmosphere was much less bohemian and volatile than in the forties and fifties but in compensation the place had been featured on the food channel pell remembered it from the days when the family lived not far from here in seaside the family didnt go out to eat much but hed send jimmy or linda to buy sand dab sandwiches and fries and coleslaw he just loved the food and he was real happy the restaurant hadnt closed up he had some business to take care of on the peninsula but thered be a little delay before he could proceed with that besides he was starving and figured he could take a chance being out in public the police wouldnt be looking for a happy tourist coupleespecially here since they believed he was halfway to utah by now according to the news story hed heard on the radio some pompous ass named charles overby making the announcement jacks had an outdoor patio with a view of the fishing boats and the bay but pell wanted to stay inside and keep an eye on the door carefully avoiding the urge to adjust the uncomfortable automatic pistol in his back waistband pell sat down at the table jennie beside him she pressed her knee against his pell sipped his iced tea he glanced at her and saw her watching a revolving carousel with tall cakes in it you want dessert after the sand dabs no honey they dont look very good they dont they didnt to him pell didnt have a sweet tooth but they were some pretty damn big hunks of cake inside in capitola you could bargain one piece for a whole carton of cigarettes theyre just sugar and white flour and flavorings corn syrup and cheap chocolate they look good and theyre sweet but they dont taste like anything for your catering jobs you wouldnt make those no no id never do that her voice was lively as she nodded toward the merrygoround of pastry people eat a lot of that stuff because its not satisfying and they want more i make a chocolate cake without any flour at all its chocolate sugar ground nuts vanilla and egg yolks then i pour a little raspberry glaze on the top you just need a few bites of that and youre happy sounds pretty good he thought it was repulsive but she was telling him about herself and you always encouraged people to do that get em drunk let em ramble knowledge was a better weapon than a knife is that what you do mostly work for bakeries well i like baking best cause i have more control i make everything myself on the other food lines you have people prepping part of the dishes control he reflected interesting he filed that fact away then sometimes i serve you get tips when you serve ill bet you get good ones i can yeah depends and you like itwhatre you laughing at justi dont know the last time anybodyi mean a boyfriendasked me if i like my job anyway sure servings fun sometimes i pretend im not just serving i pretend its my party with my friends and family outside the window a hungry seagull hovered over a piling then landed clumsily looking for scraps pell had forgotten how big they were jennie continued its like when i bake a cake say a wedding cake sometimes i just think its the little happinesses thatre all we can count on you bake the best cake you can and people enjoy it oh not forever but what on earth makes you happy forever good point ill never eat anybodys cake but yours she gave a laugh oh sure you will sweetie but im happy you said that thank you these few words had made her sound mature which meant in control pell felt defensive he didnt like it he changed the subject well i hope you like your sand dabs i love them you want another iced tea no im fine for now just sit close to me thats what i want lets look over the maps she opened her bag and took them out she unfolded one and pell examined it noticing how the layout of the peninsula had changed in the past eight years then he paused aware of a curious feeling within him he couldnt quite figure out the sensation except that it was real nice then he realized he was free his confinement eight years of being under someone elses control was over and he could now start his life over again after finishing up his missions here hed leave for good and start another family pell glanced around him at the other patrons in the restaurant noting several of them in particular the teenage girl two tables away her silent parents hunched over their food as if actually having a conversation would be torture the girl a bit plump could be easily seduced away from home when she was alone in an arcade or starbucks it would take him two days tops to convince her it was safe to get into the van with him and at the counter the young man of about twenty hed been denied a beer when hed forgotten his id he was inkedsilly tattoos which he probably regrettedand wore shabby clothes which along with his meal of soup suggested money problems his eyes zipped around the restaurant settling on every female older than sixteen or so pell knew exactly what it would take to sign the boy up in a matter of hours pell noted too the young mother single if the naked ring finger told the truth she sat slouching in a funkman problems of course she was hardly aware of her baby in a stroller by her side she never once looked down at the child and good luck if it started crying shed lose patience fast there was a story behind her defeated posture and resentful eyes though pell didnt care what it might be the only message of interest to him was that her connection to the child was fragile pell knew that if he could lure the woman to join them it wouldnt take much work to separate mother and child and pell would become an instant father he thought of the story his aunt barbara had read him when hed stayed with her in bakersfield the pied piper of hamelin the man who spirited away the children of a medieval german town dancing as they followed when the citizens refused to pay him for eliminating a rat infestation the story had made a huge impression on pell and stayed with him as an adult he read more about the incident the real facts were different from the brothers grimm and popular versions there were probably no rats involved no unpaid bills a number of children simply disappeared from hamelin and were never found again the disappearanceand the parents reportedly apathetic responseremained a mystery one explanation was that the children infected with plague or a disease that induced dancelike spasms were led out of town to die because the adults feared contagion another was that the pied piper organized a religious pilgrimage for children who died on the road in some natural disaster or when they were caught in a military conflict there was another theory though which pell preferred that the children left their parents willingly and followed the pied piper to eastern europe then being colonized where they created settlements of their own with him as their absolute leader pell loved the idea that someone had the talent to lure away dozens ofsome said more than a hundredyoungsters from their families and become their substitute parent what sorts of skills had the piper been born with or perfected he was lulled from his daydreams by the waitress who brought their food his eyes strayed to her breasts then down to the food looks scrumptious sweetie jennie said staring at her plate pell handed her a bottle heres the malt vinegar you put that on them just sprinkle it on okay he took one more look around the restaurant the sullen girl the edgy boy the distant motherhe wouldnt pursue any of them now of course he was simply ecstatic to see that so many opportunities beckoned after life was settled in a month or so hed begin hunting againthe arcades the starbucks the parks the schoolyards and campuses mcdonalds the pied piper of california daniel pells attention turned to his lunch and he began to eat the cars sped north on highway michael oneil was behind the wheel of his unmarked mcso ford dance beside him tj was in a cbi pool taurus right behind them and two monterey police cruisers were tailing them the highway patrol was sending several cars to the party too and the nearest town watsonville was sending a squad car south oneil was doing close to eighty they couldve gone faster but traffic was heavy portions of the road were only two lanes and they used only lights no sirens they were presently en route to where they believed daniel pell and his blond accomplice were against all odds eating a leisurely lunch kathryn dance had had her doubts about pells destination of utah her intuition told her that like mexico utah was probably a false lead especially after learning that rebecca and linda had never heard pell mention the state and after finding the mobile phone conveniently discarded near the worldwide express drivers car and most important hed left the driver alive to report to the police about the phone and that hed heard pell making a call the sexual game hed played with billy was one excuse for keeping him alive but it struck dance that however kinky no escapee would waste time on a porn encounter like that but then shed heard from the computer tech at capitola whod read to her the message that the accomplice had posted on the manslaughter bulletin board in the helter skelter category package will be there about wwe delivery truck at san benito at orange ribbon on pine tree will meet in front of grocery store we mentioned this was the first part of the message a final confirmation of the escape plan what had been so surprising to dance though was the final sentence room all set and checking on those locations around monterey you wantedyour lovely which suggested to everyones astonishment that pell might be staying nearby dance and oneil could deduce no reason for this it was madness but if he was staying dance decided to make him feel confident enough to show himself and so shed done what she never would have otherwise shed used charles overby she knew that once she told him about utah hed run to the press immediately and announce that the search was now focused on the routes east this would she hoped give pell a false sense of security and make him more likely to appear in public but where might that be she hoped the answer to that question might be found in her conversation with eddie chang getting a sense of what daniel pell had hinted appealed to him his interests and urges sex figured prominently chang told her which meant he might head for massage parlors brothels or escort agencies but there were few on the peninsula besides he had his female partner who presumably would be satisfying him in that department what else shed asked chang oh hey i remember one thing food daniel pell it seemed had a particular love of seafood especially a tiny fish known as the sand dab he had mentioned on several occasions that there were only four or five restaurants in the central coast area that knew how to cook them right and he was opinionated about how they should be prepared dance got the names of the restaurants chang could remember three had closed in the years since pell had gone into prison but one at fishermans wharf in monterey and one in moss landing were still open that was the unorthodox assignment dance had given rey carraneo calling those two restaurantsand any others up and down the central coast with similar menusand telling them about the escaped prisoner who might be in the company of a slight woman with blond hair it was a long shot and dance didnt have much hope that the idea would pay off but carraneo had just heard back from the manager of jacks the landmark restaurant at moss landing a couple was in there at the moment and he thought they were acting suspicioussitting inside where they could see the front door which the boyfriend kept looking at when most patrons were outside the man was cleanshaven and wearing sunglasses and a cap so they couldnt really tell if he was pell the woman appeared to be blond though she too had a cap and shades on but the ages of the couple were right dance had called the manager of the restaurant directly and asked if someone there could find out which car the couple had come in the manager didnt have any idea but the lot wasnt crowded and one of the busboys had gone outside and in spanish given dance the tag numbers of all the cars parked in the small lot a fast dmv check revealed that one a turquoise thunderbird had been stolen just last fridaythough curiously not in the area but in los angeles maybe it was a false alarm but dance decided to move on the place if nothing else theyd collar a car thief shed alerted oneil and then told the manager well be there as soon as we can dont do anything just ignore him and act normally act normal the man said with a shaking voice yeah right kathryn dance was now anticipating her next interrogation session with pell when he was back in custody the number one question she was eager to learn the answer to why was he staying in the area cruising through sand city a commercial strip along highway the traffic grew lighter and oneil punched the accelerator hard theyd be at the restaurant in ten minutes chapter are those the best thing you ever tasted oh honey theyre good sandy dabs sand dabs pell corrected he was thinking of having a third sandwich so that was my ex she continued i never see him or hear from him thank god shed just given him the details of the husbandan accountant and businessman and a wimpy little guy believe it or notwhod put her in the hospital twice with internal injuries once with a broken arm he screamed at her when she forgot to iron the sheets when she didnt get pregnant after only one month of trying when the lakers lost he told her that her tits were like a boys which is why he couldnt get it up he told her in front of his friends that shed look okay if she got her nose fixed a petty man pell thought one controlled by everything except himself then he heard the further installments of the soap opera the boyfriends after the divorce they seemed like him bad boys but pell lite he thought one was a petty thief who lived in laguna between la and san diego he worked lowstakes scams one sold drugs one was a biker one was just a shit pell had been through his share of therapy most of it was pointless but sometimes a shrink came up with some good insights which pell filed away not for his own mental health of course but because they were such helpful weapons to use against people so why did jennie go for bad boys obvious to pell they were like her mother subconsciously she kept flinging herself at them in hopes theyd change their ways and love not ignore or use her this was helpful for pell to know but he could have told her by the way lovely dont bother we dont change we never ever change write that down and keep it close to your heart of course though he kept these wise words to himself she stopped eating honey um can i ask you a question sure lovely you never said anything about those you know girls you were living with when they arrested you the family guess i didnt did you stay in touch with them or anything what were their names he recited samantha rebecca and linda jimmy too the one who tried to kill me her eyes flicked toward him would you rather i didnt ask about them no its okay you can ask me anything never tell someone not to talk about a subject keep a smile on your face and suck out every bit of information you can even if it hurts did they turn you in the women not exactly they didnt even know we were going to the croytons jimmy and me but they didnt back me up after i got arrested linda she burnt some evidence and lied to the police but even her she finally caved and helped them a sour laugh and look at what i did for them i gave them a home their own parents didnt give a shit about them i gave them a family are you upset i dont want to upset you no pell smiled its okay lovely do you think about them much ah so thats it pell had worked hard all his life to spot the subtext beneath peoples comments he now realized that jennie was jealous it was a petty emotion one that was easy to put down but it was also a central force in the universe nope i havent heard from them for years i wrote for a while linda was the only one who answered but then she said her lawyer told her itd look bad for her parole and she stopped felt bad about that i have to say im sorry honey for all i know theyre dead or maybe married and happy i was mad at first but then i understood that i made a mistake with them i picked wrong not like you youre good for me they werent she lifted his hand to her mouth and kissed his knuckles one at a time pell was studying the map again he loved maps when you were lost you were helpless out of control he remembered how mapswell the lack of a mapplayed a role in the history of this area of california where they sat right now in fact monterey bay in the family years ago linda had read aloud after dinner all of them sitting in a circle pell had often picked works by local authors and books that were set here and he remembered one a history of monterey the bay had been discovered by the spanish in the early s the bahia de monte rey named after a rich patron of the expedition was considered a real plumfertile land a perfect port strategic locationand the governor wanted to build a major colony there unfortunately after the explorers sailed away they managed to lose the bay entirely a number of expeditions tried unsuccessfully to locate it again with every passing year monterey bay took on mythical proportions one of the largest contingents of explorers departed from san diego and headed north on land determined to find the bahia constantly at risk from the elements and the grizzly bears the conquistadors covered every inch of the state up to san franciscoand still managed to miss the huge bay altogether simply because they had no accurate map when hed managed to get online in capitola hed been thrilled with a website called visualearth where you could click on a map and an actual satellite photo of the place you wanted to see came up on screen he was astonished at this there were some important things to look at so he hadnt had a chance to browse pell looked forward to the time when his life was more settled and he could spend hours on the site now jennie was pointing out some locations on the map open in front of them and pell was taking in the information but as always he was also listening to everything around him hes a good puppy just needs more training its a long drive but if we take our time itll be a blast you know i ordered ten minutes ago could you see whats taking so long at this last comment pell glanced toward the counter sorry explained a middleaged man at the cash register to a customer just a little short staffed today the man the owner or manager was uneasy and looked everywhere except at pell and jennie smart people can figure out why you changed then use it against you when pell had ordered their food there were three or four waitresses shuttling back and forth between the kitchen and the tables now this man was the only one working hed sent all his employees into hiding pell leapt up knocking over the table jennie dropped her fork and jumped to her feet the manager stared at them in alarm you son of a bitch pell muttered and pulled the pistol from his waistband jennie screamed no noi the manager debated for a second and fled into the kitchen abandoning his customers who screamed and spilled onto the floor for cover what is it honey jennies voice was panicked lets go the car he grabbed the map and they fled outside in the distance south he could see tiny flashing lights jennie froze panicked whispering angel songs angel songs come on they leapt in he slammed the car into reverse then shifted gears and gunned the engine heading for highway over the narrow bridge jennie nearly slipped out of her seat as they hit the uneven pavement on the other side of the structure on the highway pell turned north got about a hundred yards then skidded to a stop coming the other way was another police car pell glanced to his right and floored the accelerator heading directly for the front gate of the power plant a massive ugly structure something that belonged not here on this picturepostcard seashore but in the refineries of gary indiana dance and oneil were no more than five minutes from moss landing her fingers tapped the grip of the glock high on her right hip shed never fired her gun in the line of duty and wasnt much of a shotweaponry didnt come naturally to her also with children in the house she was uneasy carrying the weapon at home she kept it in a solid lockbox beside her bed and only she knew the combination michael oneil on the other hand was a fine marksman as was tj she was glad she was with them but would it come to a fight she wondered dance couldnt say of course but she knew shed do whatever was necessary to stop the killer the ford now squealed around the corner and then up a hill as they crested it oneil muttered oh hell he jammed the brake pedal hold on dance gasped and grabbed the dashboard as they went into a fierce skid the car came to a stop halfway on the shoulder only five feet from a semi stopped in the middle of the road the highway was completely blocked all the way to moss landing the opposite lanes were moving but slowly several miles ahead dance could see flashing lights and realized officers were turning back the traffic a roadblock oneil called monterey county central dispatch on his motorola its oneil go ahead sir over were on one northbound just short of moss landing traffics stopped whats the story be advised therestheyre evacuating duke power fire or something its pretty bad theyve got multiple injuries two fatalities oh no dance thought exhaling a sigh not more deaths fire oneil asked just what pell did at the courthouse dance squinted she could see a column of black smoke emergency planners took seriously any risk of a conflagration around here several years ago a huge fire had raged through an abandoned oil tank at the power facility the plant was now gasnot oiloperated and the odds of a serious fire were much lower still security would have frozen highway in both directions and started to evacuate anyone nearby oneil snapped tell chp or monterey fire or whoevers running the scene to clear a path weve got to get through were in pursuit of that escapee over roger detectivehold on silence for a minute then be advised just heard from watsonville fire i dont know okay the plants not burning the fires just a car in front of the main gate i dont know who called in the elevenfortyone no injuries that anybody can tell that was a false report and weve got some calls from jacks the suspect pulled a gun and fled hell he made us oneil muttered dance took the microphone roger are any police on the scene stand by affirmative one watsonville officer the rest are fire and rescue one officer dance said scowling shaking her head tell him that daniel pells there somewhere and he will target innocents and officers roger ill relay that dance wondered how the sole officer would fare moss landings worst crimes were duis and the thefts of cars and boats you get all that tj fuck was the reply from the speaker tj didnt bother much with radio codes oneil slammed the microphone into the cradle in frustration their plea to move the traffic along wasnt having any effect dance told him lets try to get up there anyway i dont care if we need bodywork oneil nodded he hit the siren and started along the shoulder which was sandy in parts rocky in others and in several places barely passable but slowly the motorcade made its way forward chapter when they arrived at moss landing pell and his girlfriend were nowhere to be seen dance and oneil parked a moment later tj too pulled up beside the burned thunderbird still smoldering pells car she pointed out the one stolen from la on friday dance told tj to find the manager of jacks the watsonville cop oneil and the other officers spread out to search for witnesses many of them had left probably scared off by the flames from the tbird and the piercing siren from the power plantmaybe even thinking it was a nuclear reactor that was melting down dance interviewed several people near the power plant they reported that a wiry man and a blonde driving the thunderbirdit had been turquoise before the firehad sped over the bridge from jacks seafood then stopped abruptly in front of the power plant theyd gotten out and a moment later the car had erupted in flames the couple had run across the road to the shore side one person reported but nobody saw what became of them after that apparently pell had called himself to report that the plant was burning and there were injuries and two deaths dance looked around her theyd need another car you couldnt escape from here on foot but then her eyes focused on the bay with the traffic jam it would make more sense to steal a boat she corralled several local officers trotted across the highway and they spent fifteen frantic minutes talking to the people on the shoreline to see if pell had stolen a vessel nobody reported seeing the couple nor were any boats missing a waste of time returning to the highway dance noticed a store across from the power plant a shack selling souvenirs and candy there was a closed sign on the door but inside dance believed she could see a womans face looking out was pell inside with her dance gestured to a deputy told him of her concern and together they stepped to the door she rapped on it no response another knock and slowly the door opened a round woman with short curly hair glanced in alarm at their hands resting on their guns and asked breathlessly yes eyes on the dim interior behind her dance asked could you please step outside um sure is anyone else in there no what the deputy pushed past her and flicked the lights on dance joined him a fast search revealed that the tiny place was unoccupied dance returned to the woman sorry for the disturbance no thats okay thiss scary where did they go weve still searching did you see what happened no i was inside when i looked out there was the car burning i kept thinking about the oil tank fire a few years ago that was a bad one were you here for that i was i could see it from carmel we knew it was empty the tank or pretty much empty but we were all freaked out and those wires electricity can be pretty spooky so youre closed yeah i was going to leave early anyway didnt know how long the highway would be closed not many touristsd be interested in saltwater taffy with a power plant on fire across the highway imagine not id like to ask why you wondered where they went oh a dangerous man like that id hope hed get arrested as fast as possible but you said they how did you know there were several people a pause i dance gazed at her with a smile and but unwavering eyes you said you didnt see anything you looked out only after you heard the siren i think i talked to somebody about it outside i think a denial flag expression subconsciously the woman would feel she was giving an opinion not a deceptive statement who told you dance persisted i didnt know them a man or a woman another hesitation a girl a woman from out of state her head was turned away and she was rubbing her nosean aversionnegation cluster wheres your car dance asked my eyes play an ambiguous role in kinesic analysis theres the belief among some officers that if a suspect looks to his left under your gaze its a sign of lying dance knew that was just an old cops tale averting eyesunlike turning the body or face away from the interrogatorhas no correlation to deception direction of eye gaze is too easily controlled but eyes are still very revealing as dance was talking to the woman shed noticed her looking at a particular place in the parking lot every time she did she displayed general stress indicators shifting her weight pressing her fingers together dance understood pell had stolen her car and said that he or the infamous partner would kill her family if she said anything just as with the worldwide express driver dance sighed upset if the woman had come forward when theyd first arrived they might have pell by now or if i hadnt blindly believed the closed sign and knocked on the door sooner she added to herself bitterly i the woman started to cry i understand well make sure youre safe what kind of car its a dark blue ford focus three years old theres a bumper sticker about global warming on it and a dent in the where did they go north dance got the tag number and called oneil who would in turn relay a message to mcso dispatch for an announcement to all units about the car as the clerk made arrangements to stay with a friend until pells recapture dance stared at the lingering cloud of smoke around the thunderbird angry shed made a sharp deduction from eddie changs information and theyd come up with a solid plan for the collar but it had been a waste tj joined her with the manager of jacks seafood he gave his story of the events clearly omitting a few facts probably that hed inadvertently tipped off pell about the police dance couldnt blame him she remembered pell from the interviewhow sharp and wary he was the manager described the woman who was skinny and pretty in a mousy way and had looked at the man adoringly throughout most of the meal hed thought they were honeymooners she couldnt keep her hands off him he put her age at midtwenties the manager added that they pored over a map for a good portion of the meal what was it of here monterey county michael oneil joined her flipping closed his phone no reports of the focus he said but with the evacuation it mustve gotten lost in the traffic hell he couldve turned south and driven right past us dance called carraneo over the young man looked tired hed had a busy day but it wasnt over yet find out everything you can about the tbird and start calling motels and boardinghouses from watsonville down to big sur see if any blond women checked in by themselves and listed a thunderbird as their car on the registration form or if anybody saw a tbird if the car was stolen on friday shedve checked in friday saturday or sunday sure agent dance she and oneil both stared west over the water which was calm the sun was a wide flat disk low over the pacific the fierce beams muted the fog hadnt arrived yet but the lateafternoon sky was hazy grainy monterey bay looked like a flat blue desert he said pells taking a huge risk staying around here hes got something important to do it was just then that she got a call from someone who she realized might have some thoughts about what the killer might have in mind chapter there are probably ten thousand streets named mission in california and james reynolds the retired prosecutor who eight years earlier had won the conviction of daniel pell lived on one of the nicer ones he had a carmel zip code though this street wasnt in the cute part of townthe gingerbread area flooded on weekends with tourists whom the locals simultaneously love and hate reynolds was in working carmel but it was not exactly the wrong side of the tracks he had a precious threequarters of an acre of secluded property not far from the barnyard the landscaped multilevel shopping center where you could buy jewelry and art and complicated kitchen gadgets gifts and souvenirs dance now pulled into the long driveway reflecting that people with so much property were either the elite of recent moneyneurosurgeons or geeks who survived the silicon valley shakeoutor longtime residents reynolds whod made his living as a prosecutor had to be the latter the tanned balding man in his midsixties met her at the door ushered her inside my wifes at work well at volunteer im cooking dinner come on into the kitchen as she followed him along the corridor of the brightly lit house dance could read the mans history in the many frames on the wall the east coast schools stanford law his wedding the raising of two sons and a daughter their graduations the most recent photos had yet to be framed she nodded at a stack of pictures on the top of which was one of a young woman blond and beautiful in her elaborate white dress surrounded by her maids of honor your daughter congratulations the last to fly the nest he gave her a thumbsup and a grin how bout you weddingsre a while off ive got middle school next on the agenda she also noticed a number of framed newspaper pages big convictions hed won and she was amused to see trials hed lost he noticed her looking at one and chuckled the wins are for ego the lossesre for humility id take the high ground and say that i learned something from the notguilties but the fact is sometimes juriesre just out to lunch she knew this very well from her previous job as jury consultant like with our boy pell the jury shouldve recommended the death penalty but they didnt why not extenuating circumstances yep if thats what you call fear they were scared the family would come after them for revenge but they didnt have a problem convicting him oh no the case was solid and i ran the prosecution hard i picked up on the son of manson themei was the one who called him that in the first place i pointed out all the parallels manson claimed he had the power to control people a history of petty crimes a cult of subservient women he was behind the deaths of a rich family in his house crime scene found dozens of books about manson underlined and annotated pell actually helped get himself convicted reynolds added with a smile he played the part hed sit in court and stare at the jurors trying to intimidate scare them he tried it with me too i laughed at him and said i didnt think psychic powers had any effect on lawyers the jury laughed too it broke the spell he shook his head not enough to get him the needle but i was happy with consecutive life sentences you also prosecuted the three women in the family i pled them out it was pretty much minor stuff they didnt have anything to do with the croyton thing im positive of that before they ran into pell none of themd ever been picked up for anything worse than drinking in public or a little pot i think pell brainwashed them jimmy newberg was different he had a history of violencesome aggravateds and felony drug charges in the spacious kitchen decorated entirely in yellow and beige reynolds put on an apron hed apparently slipped it off to answer the door i took up cooking after i retired interesting contrast nobody likes a prosecutor buthe nodded at a large orange skillet filled with cooking seafoodmy cioppinoeverybody loves that so dance said looking around with an exaggerated frown this is what a kitchen looks like ah a takeout queen like me when i was a working bachelor my poor kids the good news is that theyre learning defensive cooking for last mothers day they made me strawberry crepes and all you had to do was clean up here try a bowl she couldnt resist okay just a sample he dished up a portion it needs red wine to accompany that ill pass on she tried the stew excellent reynolds had been in touch with sandoval and the monterey county sheriff and learned the latest details of the manhunt including the information that pell was staying in the area dance noted that regarding the cbi hed called her and not charles overby ill do whatever i can to help you nail this bastard the former prosecutor meticulously sliced a tomato just name it ive already called the county storage company theyre bringing me all my notes from the case probably ninetynine percent of them wont be helpful but there could be a nugget or two and ill go through every damn page if i have to dance glanced at his eyes which were dark coals of determination very different from say morton nagles sparkle she had never worked any cases with reynolds but knew hed be a fierce and uncompromising prosecutor thatd be very helpful james appreciate it dance finished the stew and rinsed the bowl placing it in i didnt even know you were in the area id heard you retired to santa barbara we have a little place there but were here most of the year well when you called i got in touch with mcso id like to have a deputy stationed outside reynolds dismissed the idea ive got a good alarm system im virtually untraceable when i became lead prosecutor i started getting threatsthose salinas gang prosecutions i had my phone unlisted and transferred title to the house to a trust theres no way he could find me and ive got a carry permit for my sixgun dance wasnt going to take no for an answer hes already killed several times today a shrug sure what the hell ill take a babysitter cant hurtmy younger sons here visiting why take chances dance scooted onto a stool she rested her maroon wedge aldos on the supports the straps on the shoes were inlaid with bright daisies even tenyearold maggie had more conservative taste than she did when it came to shoes which were one of dances passions for now could you tell me something about the murders eight years ago it might give me an idea of what hes up to reynolds sat on an adjoining stool sipping wine he ran through the facts of the case how pell and jimmy newberg had broken into the house of william croyton in carmel killed the businessman his wife and two of their three children they were all stabbed to death newberg too my theory was that he balked about killing the kids and got into a fight with pell who killed him any history between pell and croyton not that we could establish but silicon valley was at its peak then and croyton was one of the big boys he was in the press all the timehe not only designed most of the programs himself he was the chief of sales too largerthanlife kind of guy work hard play hard big loud tanned not the most sympathetic victim in the world pretty ruthless businessman rumors of affairs disgruntled employees but if murder was a crime only against saints we prosecutorsd be out of a job his company had been burglarized a couple of times in the year before the killing the perps got away with computers and software but santa clara county could never come up with a suspect no indication that pell had anything to do with it but i always wondered if it couldve been him what happened to the company after he died it was acquired by somebody else microsoft or apple or one of the game companies i dont know and his estate most of it went in trust to his daughter and i think some to his wifes sister the aunt who took custody of the girl croytond been in computers ever since he was a kid he had probably ten twenty million dollars worth of old hardware and programs that he left to cal statemonterey bay the computer museum theres really impressive and techies come from all over the world to do research in the archives still apparently so croyton was way ahead of his time and rich way rich that was the actual motive for the killings well we never knew for sure on the facts it was a plainvanilla burglary i think pell read about croyton and thought itd be a cakewalk to pick up some big bucks but his take was pretty skimpy i read a thousand and some jewelry wouldve been a small case except for five dead bodies of course almost sixgood thing that little girl was upstairs whats her story poor kid you know what they called her the sleeping doll right she didnt testify even if shed seen something i wouldntve subjected her to the stand not with that prick in the courtroom i had enough evidence anyway she didnt remember anything nothing helpful she went to bed early that night where is she now no idea she was adopted by the aunt and uncle and they moved away what was pells defense theyd gone there with some business idea newberg snapped and killed everybody pell tried to stop him they fought and pell quote had to kill him but there was no evidence croyton had a meeting plannedthe family was in the middle of dinner when they showed up besides the forensics were clear time of death fingerprints trace blood spatter everything pell was the doer in prison pell got access to a computer unsupervised thats not good she nodded we found some things he searched for do they mean anything to you one was alison it wasnt one of the girls in the family i dont remember anybody else connected to him with that name another word he searched was nimue a character out of mythology king arthur legend but im thinking its a name or screen name of somebody pell wanted to get in touch with sorry nothing any other ideas about what he might have in mind reynolds shook his head sorry it was a big casefor me and for the county but the fact is it wasnt remarkable he was caught redhanded the forensics were waterproof and he was a recidivist with a history of criminal activity going back to his early teens i mean this guy and the family were on watch lists in beach communities from big sur to marin idve had to screw up pretty bad to lose all right james i should get going she said appreciate the help if you find something in the files let me know he gave her a solemn nod no longer a dabbling retiree or kindly fatherofthebride she could see in reynoldss eyes the fierce determination that had undoubtedly characterized his approach in court ill do anything i can to help get that son of a bitch back where he belongs or into a body bag theyd separated and now several hundred yards apart they made their way on foot to a motel in quaint pacific grove right in the heart of the peninsula pell walked leisurely and wideeyed like a dumbfounded tourist whod never seen surf outside baywatch they were in a change of clothing which theyd bought at a goodwill store in a poor part of seaside where hed enjoyed watching jennie hesitate then discard her beloved pink blouse pell was now in a light gray windbreaker cords and cheap running shoes a baseball cap on backward he also carried a disposable camera he would occasionally pause to take pictures of the sunset on the theory that one thing escaped killers rarely do is stop to record panoramic seascapes however impressive he and jennie had driven east from moss landing in the stolen ford focus taking none of the major roads and even cutting through a brussels sprout field aromatic with the scent of human gas eventually theyd headed back toward pacific grove but when the area became more populous pell knew it was time to ditch the wheels the police would learn about the focus soon he hid it in tall grass in the middle of a large field off highway marked with a for sale commercial zoned sign he decided they should separate on the hike to the motel jennie didnt like it not being with him but they stayed in touch via their prepaid mobiles she called every five minutes until he told her it was probably better not to because the police might be listening in which they werent of course but he was tired of the honeybunny chatter and wanted to think daniel pell was worried how had the police tracked them to jacks he ran through the possibilities maybe the cap sunglasses and shaved face hadnt fooled the manager at the restaurant though whod believe that a murderous escapee would sit down like a daytripper from san francisco to devour a plate of tasty sand dabs fifteen miles from the detention center hed just redecorated with fire and blood finding that the tbird was stolen was another possibility but why would somebody run the tag of a car stolen four hundred miles away and even if it was boosted why call out the airborne just for a set of stolen wheelsunless they knew it had some connection to pell and the cops were supposed to believe he was headed to that camper park outside of salt lake city hed called kathryn he had a feeling she hadnt bought into the utah idea even after the trick with billys phone and leaving the driver alive on purpose pell wondered if shed put out the announcement about utah to the press intentionally to flush him into the open which had in fact worked he reflected angrily wherever he went he had a feeling shed be supervising the manhunt for him pell wondered where she lived he thought again about his assessment of her in the interviewher children her husbandrecalled when she gave her faint reactions when she didnt kids yes husband probably not a divorce didnt seem likely he sensed good judgment and loyalty within her pell paused and took a snap of the sun easing into the pacific ocean it was really quite a sight kathryn as a widow interesting idea he felt the swelling within him again somehow he managed to tuck it away for the time being he bought a few things at a store a little bodega which he picked because he knew his picture wouldnt be looping on the news every five minutes he was right the tiny set showed only a spanishlanguage soap opera pell met up with jennie in asilomar the beautiful park which featured a crescent of beach for diehard surfers and closer toward monterey an increasingly rugged shoreline of rocks and crashing spray everything all right she asked cautiously fine lovely were doing fine she led him through the quiet streets of pacific grove a former methodist retreat filled with colorful victorian and tudor bungalows in five minutes she announced here we are she nodded at the sea view motel the building was brown with small lead windows a wood shingle roof and plaques of butterflies above the doors the villages claim to fame other than being the last dry town in california was the monarchstens of thousands of the insects would cluster here from fall to spring its cute isnt it pell guessed cute didnt mean anything to him what mattered was that the room faced away from the road and there were driveways off the back parking lot that would be perfect escape routes shed gotten exactly the kind of place she was supposed to its perfect lovely just like you another smile on her smooth face though halfhearted she was still shaken by the incident at jacks restaurant pell didnt care the bubble within him had started expanding once more he wasnt sure whether kathryn was driving it or jennie which ones ours she pointed come on honey i have a surprise for you hm pell didnt like surprises she unlocked the door he nodded toward it after you lovely and reached into his waistband gripping the pistol he tensed ready to push her forward as a sacrificial shield and start shooting at the sound of a cops voice but it wasnt a setup the place was empty he looked around it was even nicer than the outside suggested ritzy expensive furniture drapes towels even bathrobes some nice paintings too seashores the lonesome pine and more goddamn butterflies and candles lots of them everywhere you could put a candle there was a candle oh that was the surprise they werent thank god lit thats all hed needcome back from an escape to find his hideaway on fire you have the keys she handed them to him keys pell loved them whether for a car a motel room a safe deposit box or a house whoever possesses the keys is in control whats in there she asked glancing at the bag shed been curious earlier when they met on the beach not long ago he knew purposely he hadnt told her just some things we needed and some food jennie blinked in surprise you bought food what was this the first time her man had bought her groceries i couldve done that she said quickly then nodding at the kitchenette she added a perfunctory so ill cook you a meal odd phrase shes been taught to think that by her ex or one of the abusive boyfriends tim the biker shut up and go cook me a meal thats okay lovely ill do it you sure pell knew men who insisted that the wife feed them they thought they were kings of the household to be waited on it gave them some sense of power but they didnt understand that when you depended on someone for anything you were weakened also how stupid can you be you know how easy it is to mix rat poison into soup pell was no chef but even years ago when linda was the family cook he liked to hang out in the kitchen help her keep an eye on things oh and you got mexican she laughed as she pulled out the ground beef tortillas tomatoes canned peppers and sauces you said you liked it comfort food hey lovely he kissed her head you were real steady today at the restaurant turning away from the groceries she looked down i got kind of freaked you know i was scared i didnt mean to scream no no you held fast you know what that means not really its an old expression sailors used to say theyd tattoo it on their fingers so when you made fists youd see it spelled out hold fast it means not running away she laughed i wouldnt run away from you he touched his lips to her head smelled sweat and discount perfume she rubbed her nose were a team lovely which got her to stop rubbing pell noted that he went into the bathroom peed long and then washed up when he stepped outside he found a second surprise jennied stripped down she was wearing only a bra and panties holding a cigarette lighter working on the candles she glanced up you said you liked red pell grinned walked to her ran his hand down her bony spine or would you rather eat he kissed her well eat later oh i want you baby she whispered it was clearly a line shed used often in the past but that didnt mean it wasnt true now he took the lighter well do atmosphere later he kissed her pulled her hips against him she smileda genuine one nowand pressed harder against his crotch i think you want me too a purr i do want you lovely i like it when you call me that you have any stockings he asked she nodded black ones ill go put them on no thats not what i want them for he whispered chapter one more errand before this hard day was over kathryn dance pulled up to a modest house in the netherworld between carmel and monterey when the huge military base fort ord was the industry in the area mediumrank officers would live and often retire here before that in the fishing and cannery days foremen and managers lived here dance parked in front of a modest bungalow and walked through the picketfence gate and along the stony path to the front door a minute later a freckled cheerful woman in her late thirties greeted her dance identified herself im here to see morton come on in joan nagle said smiling the lack of surpriseand concernin her face telling dance that her husband had given her some of the details of his role in the events of today though perhaps not all the agent stepped into the small living room the halffull boxes of clothes and booksmostly the lattersuggested theyd just moved in the walls were covered with the cheap prints of a seasonal rental again the smells of cooking assaulted herbut this time the scent was of hamburger and onions not italian herbs a cute round girl in pigtails wearing wirerimmed glasses was holding a drawing pad she looked up and smiled dance waved to her she was about wess age on the couch a boy in his midteens was lost in the chaos of a video game pushing buttons as if civilization depended on him morton nagle appeared in the doorway tugging at his waistband hello hello hello agent dance kathryn please kathryn youve met my wife joan a smile andhey eric put thateric he called in a loud laughing voice put that away the boy saved the gamedance knew how vital that wasand set the controller down he bounded to his feet thiss eric say hello to agent dance agent like fbi like that sweet dance shook the hand of the teenager as he stared at her hip looking at the gun the girl still clutching her sketchbook came up shyly well introduce yourself her mother urged hi whats your name dance asked sonja sonjas weight is a problem dance noted her parents better address it pretty soon though given their physiques she doubted they understood the problems she was already facing the agents kinesics expertise gave her many insights into peoples psychological and emotional difficulties but she continually had to remind herself that her job was law enforcer not therapist nagle said ive been following the news you almost caught him minutes away she said grimacing can i get you anything his wife asked no thanks dance said i can only stay a minute come on into my office nagle said they walked into a small bedroom which smelled of cat pee a desk and two chairs were the only pieces of furniture a laptop the letters worn off the a h and n keys sat beside a desk lamp that had been taped together there were stacks of paper everywhere and probably two or three hundred books in boxes and littering the shelves covering the radiator and piled on the floor i like my books around me a nod toward the living room they do too even mr wizard on the video game there we pick a book and then every night i read from it out loud thats nice dance and her children did something similar though it usually involved music wes and mags devoured books but they preferred to read on their own of course we still find time for true culture survivor and nagles eyes just wouldnt stop sparkling he gave another of his chuckles when he saw her note the volume of material he had for her dont worry that ones yours the small one he gestured toward a box of videotapes and photocopied sheets sure i cant get you anything joan asked from the doorway nothing thanks you can stay for dinner if you like sorry no she smiled and left nagle nodded after her shes a physicist and added nothing more dance told nagle the latest details in the case and explained that she was pretty sure pell was staying in the area thatd be crazy everybody on the peninsulas looking for him youd think she explained about his search at capitola but nagle could contribute no insights about alison or nimue nor did he have any clue why the killer had been browsing a satellite photo site she glanced at the box hed prepared for her is there a bio in there something brief brief no not really but if you want a synopsis i could do it sure three four pages thatd be great itll take me forever to pull it together from all of that all of that chuckling thats nothing by the time im ready to write the book ill have fifty times more notes and sources but sure ill gin up something hi a youthful voice said dance smiled at sonja in the doorway an envious glance at the agents figure then her braid i saw you looking at my drawings when you came in honey agent dance is busy no its okay do you want to see them dance sank to her knees to look at the sketchpad they were pictures of butterflies surprisingly well done sonja these are beautiful they could be in a gallery on ocean in carmel you think definitely she flipped back a page this ones my favorite its a swallowtail the picture was of a dark blue butterfly the color was iridescent its sitting on a mexican sunflower they get nectar from that when im at home we go out into the desert and i draw lizards and cactuses dance remembered that the writers fulltime residence was scottsdale the girl continued here my mommy and i go out in the woods and we take pictures then i draw them he said shes the james audubon of butterflies joan appeared in the doorway and ushered the child out think thatll do any good nagle asked gesturing at the box i dont know but i sure hope so we need some help dance said good night turned down another dinner invitation and returned to the car she set the box on the seat next to her the photocopies beckoned and she was tempted to turn on the dome light and have a look now but the material would have to wait kathryn dance was a good investigator just as shed been a good reporter and a good jury consultant but she was also a mother and a widow and the unique confluence of those roles required her to know when to pull back from her other job it was now time to be home chapter this was known as the deck an expanse of gray pressuretreated wood twenty by thirty feet extending from the kitchen of dances house into the backyard and filled with mismatched lawn chairs loungers and tables tiny electric christmas lights some amber globes a sink and a large refrigerator were the main decorations along with a few anemic plants in terracotta bowls a narrow stairway led down to the backyard hardly landscaped though it was filled with plenty of natural flora scrub oak and maple trees monkey flowers asters lupine potato vines clover and renegade grass a stockade fence provided separation from the neighbors two birdbaths and a feeder for hummingbirds hung from a branch near the stairs two wind chimes lay on the ground where dance in her pajamas had dumped them at am one particularly stormy night a month ago the classic victorian housedark green with gray weathered banisters shutters and trimwas in the northwestern part of pacific grove if you were willing to risk a precarious lean you could catch a glimpse of ocean about a halfmile away dance spent plenty of time on the deck it was often too cold or misty for an early breakfast but on lazy weekends after the sun had melted the fog she and the children might come here after a walk on the beach with the dogs and have bagels and cream cheese coffee and hot chocolate hundreds of dinner parties large and small had been hosted on the uneven planks the deck was where her husband bill had told his parents firmly that yes he was marrying kathryn dance and by corollary not the napa socialite his mother had championed for several yearsan act braver for him than much of what hed done with the fbi the deck was where theyd had his memorial service it was also a gatheringplace for friends both inside and outside the law enforcement community on the peninsula kathryn dance enjoyed her friendships but after bills death shed chosen to spend her free time with her children not wanting to take them to bars or restaurants with her adult friends she brought the friends into their world there was beer and soda in the outdoor fridge and usually a bottle or two of basic central coast chardonnay or pinot grigio and cabernet a stained rusty but functional barbecue grill sat here as well and there was a bathroom downstairs accessible from the backyard it wasnt unusual for dance to come home and find her mother or father friends or colleagues from the cbi or mcso enjoying a beer or coffee all were welcome to stop by whether she was home or away whether the visitors announced their intentions or not though even if she was home she might not join them a tacit but wellunderstood rule held that while people were always welcome anytime outside the house itself was off limits except for planned parties privacy sleep and homework were sacred dance now climbed the steep stairs from her side yard and walked onto the deck carrying the box of photocopies and tapes on top of which was perched a prepared chicken dinner shed bought at albertsons the dogs greeted her a black flatcoated retriever and a blackandtan german shepherd she rubbed ears and flung a few mangy stuffed toys then continued on to two men sitting in plastic chairs hi honey stuart dance looked younger than his seventy years he was tall with broad shoulders and a full head of unruly white hair his hours at sea and on the shore had taken a toll on his skin a few scars from the dermatologists scalpel and laser were evident too technically he was retired but he still worked at the aquarium several days a week and nothing in the universe could keep him from the rocky shoals of the coast he and his daughter brushed cheeks hnnn from albert stemple another major crimes agent with the cbi the massive man with a shaved head wore boots jeans a black tshirt there were scars on his face as well and others hed alluded toin places that didnt see much sunlight though a dermatologist had nothing to do with them he was drinking a beer feet sticking out in front of him the cbi was not known for its cowboys but albert stemple was your basic makemyownrules wild bill hickok he had more collars than any other agent as well as more official complaints he was most proud of the latter thanks for keeping an eye on things al sorry its later than id planned thinking of pells threats during the interrogationand of his remaining in the areadance had asked stemple to babysit until she returned home oneil too had arranged for local officers to keep an eye on her house as long as the escapee was at large stemple grunted not a problem overbyll buy me dinner charles said that naw but hell buy me dinner quiet here i walked around a couple times nothin strange you want a soda for the road sure the big man helped himself to two anchor steams from the fridge dont worry ill finish em fore i get in the car so long stu he clomped along the deck which creaked under his weight he disappeared and she heard the crown victoria start up fifteen seconds later and peel away the open beers undoubtedly resting between his massive thighs dance glanced through the streaked windows into the living room her eyes settled on a book sitting on the coffee table in the living room it jogged her memory hey did brian call oh your friend the one who came to dinner right what was his last name gunderson the investment banker thats the one did he call not that i know you want to ask the kids no thats okay thanks again dad no worries an expression from his days in new zealand he turned away rapping on the window bye grandpa wait maggie ran outside her chestnut braid flapping behind her she was clutching a book hi mom she said enthusiastically whend you get home just now you didnt say anything exclaimed the tenyearold poking her glasses up on her nose wheres your brother i dont know his room whens dinner five minutes whatre we having youll see maggie held the book up to her grandfather and pointed out a small graypurple nautiluslike seashell look you were right maggie didnt try to pronounce the words a columbian amphissa he said and pulled out the pen and notebook he was never without jotted three decades older than his daughter and he needed no glasses most of her genetic proclivities derived from her mother dance had learned a tidedrift shell he said to dance very rare here but maggie found one it was just there the girl said okay im headed home to the staff sergeant shes fixing dinner and my presence is required night all bye grandpa her father climbed down the stairs and dance thanked fate or god or whatever might be as she often did for a good dependable male figure in the life of a widow with children on her way to the kitchen her phone rang rey carraneo reported that the thunderbird at moss landing had been stolen from the valet parking lot of an upscale restaurant on sunset boulevard in los angeles the previous friday there were no suspects they were expecting the report from lapd but like most car thefts there were no forensics also hed had no luck finding the hotel motel or boardinghouse the woman mightve checked into therere a lot of them he confessed welcome to the monterey peninsula weve got to stash the tourists somewhere rey keep at it and say hi to your wife dance began unpacking dinner a lean boy with sandy hair wandered into the sunroom beside the kitchen he was on the phone though only twelve wes was nearly as tall as his mother she wiggled a finger at him and he wandered over to her she kissed him on the forehead and he didnt cringe which was the same as i love you very much mother dear off the phone she said dinnertime like gotta go dont say like the boy hung up whatre we having chicken maggie said dubiously you like albertsons what about bird flu wes snickered dont you know anything you get it from live chickens it was alive once the girl countered from the corner where his sister had backed him wes said well its not an asian chicken hello they migrate and how you die is you throw up to death mags not at dinnertime dance said well you do oh like chickens migrate yeah right and they dont have bird flu here or we wouldve heard sibling banter but there was a little more to it dance believed her son remained deeply shaken by his fathers death this made him more sensitive to mortality and violence than most boys his age dance steered him away from those topicsa tough job for a woman who tracked down felons for a living she now announced as long as the chickens cooked its fine though she wasnt sure that this was right and wondered if maggie would dispute her but her daughter was lost in her seashell book the boy said oh mashed potatoes too you rock mom maggie and wes set the table and laid the food out while dance washed up when she returned from the bathroom wes asked mom arent you going to change he was looking at her black suit im starving i cant wait not sharing that the real reason shed kept the outfit on was as an excuse to wear her weapon usually the first thing she did upon coming home was to put on jeans and a tshirt and slip the gun into the lockbox beside her bed yeah its a tough life being a cop the little ones spend a lot of time alone dont they theyd probably love some friends to play with wes glanced once more at her suit as if he knew exactly what shed been thinking but then they turned to the food eating and talking about their daythe childrens at least dance of course said nothing about hers wes was in a tennis camp in monterey maggie at a music camp in carmel each seemed to be enjoying the experience thank goodness neither of them asked about daniel pell when dinner was over the trio cleared the table and did the dishesher children always had a share of the housework when they were through wes and maggie headed into the living room to read or play video games dance logged onto her computer and checked email nothing about the case though she had several about her other job she and her best friend martine christensen ran a website called american tunes after the famous paul simon song from the s kathryn dance was not a bad musician but a brief attempt at a fulltime career as a singer and guitarist had left her dissatisfied which she was afraid was how shed left her audiences she decided that her real talent was listening to music and encouraging other people to as well on her infrequent vacations or on long weekends shed head off in search of homemade music often with the children and dogs in tow a folklorist was the name of the avocation or more popularly song catcher alan lomax was perhaps the most famous collecting music from louisiana to the appalachians for the library of congress throughout the midtwentieth century while his taste ran to black blues and mountain music dances scavenger hunt took her farther afield to places reflecting the changing sociology of north america music grounded in latino caribbean nova scotian canadian urban africanamerican and native american cultures she and martine helped the musicians copyright their original material posted the taped songs and distributed to them the money that listeners paid for downloads when the day came when dance was no longer willing or able to track down criminals she knew music would be a good way to spend retirement her phone rang she looked at the caller id number well hello hey there michael oneil asked howd it go with reynolds nothing particularly helpful but hes checking his old files from the croyton case she added that shed picked up morton nagles material too but hadnt had a chance to look through it yet oneil told her that the focus stolen from moss landing hadnt been located and theyd discovered nothing else helpful at jacks seafood the techs had lifted fingerprints from the tbird and the utensils pells and others that were common to both locations presumably the womans a search through state and federal databases revealed she had no record we did find one thing were a little troubled about peter bennington your crime lab guy right he said there was acid on the floorboard of the tbird drivers seat side the part that didnt burn it was recent peter said it was a corrosive acidpretty diluted but watsonville fire soaked the car to cool it so it couldve been pretty strong when pell left it there you know me and evidence michael okay the bottom line is that it was mixed with the same substance found in apples grapes and candy you think pell waswhat poisoning something food was the raison detre of central california there were thousands of acres of fields and orchards a dozen big wineries and other food processors all within a halfhour drive its a possibility or maybe hes hiding out in an orchard or vineyard we scared him at moss landing and he gave up on staying in a motel or boardinghouse think about the pastures we ought to get some people searching have you got anybody available she asked i can shift some troops get chp too hate to pull them off the search downtown and along one but i dont think we have any choice dance agreed she relayed to him carraneos information about the tbird not racing forward at the speed of light are we nup she agreed whatre you up to schoolwork i thought the kids were out for the summer my schoolwork on the manhunt im headed your way right now want some help sharpening your pencils and cleaning the blackboard bring an apple for the teacher and youre on chapter hi michael wes said slapping him five hey there they talked about the boys tennis camponeil played tooand about restringing rackets her lean muscular son was skillful at most sports he tried though he was now concentrating on tennis and soccer he wanted to try karate or aikido but dance deflected him from martial arts sometimes the boy boiled over with angerits source his fathers deathand she didnt like encouraging fighting as a sport oneil had undertaken a mission to keep the boys mind occupied with healthy diversions hed introduced him to two activities that were polar opposites collecting books and spending time on oneils favorite spot on earth monterey bay dance sometimes thought the detective had been born in the wrong era and could easily picture him as the captain of an oldtime sailing ship or a fishing vessel in the s sometimes while dance had a motherdaughter outing with maggie wes would spend the afternoon on oneils boat fishing or whale watching dance was violently seasick unless she popped dramamine but wes had been born with sea legs they talked now about a fishing trip in a few weeks then wes said good night and wandered off to his room dance poured some wine he was a red wine drinker and preferred cabernet she had a pinot grigio they walked into the living room sat on the couch oneil happened to be on the cushion that was directly beneath dances wedding picture the detective and bill swenson had been good friends and had worked together a number of times there had been a brief window before his death during which dance her husband and oneil were all active law enforcers theyd even worked on a case together bill federal dance state oneil county with a loud snap the detective opened the plastic box of takeout sushi hed brought the crackle was a modernday pavlovian bell and the two dogs leapt up and bounded toward him dylan the german shepherd named for the singersongwriter of course and patsy the flatcoated retriever dubbed in honor of ms cline dances favorite c ampw singer can i give them not unless you want to brush their teeth sorry guys oneil said he held the tray open for her forgot the apple teach hows tuna she laughed and declined his offer he started to eat not bothering to open the soy sauce or wasabi he looked very tired maybe it was just too much trouble to wrestle with the packets one thing i wanted to ask dance said is the sheriff okay with cbi running the manhunt oneil set down the chopsticks and ran his hand through his saltandpepper hair well ill tell you when my father was in nam his platoon sometimes had to take out vietcong tunnels sometimes theyd find booby traps sometimes theyd find vc it was the most dangerous job in the war dad developed this fear that stayed with him all his life claustrophobia no volunteerphobia he cleared one tunnel then never raised his hand again nobody can quite figure out why exactly you stepped forward on this one she laughed youre assuming i did she told him about overbys gambit to seize control of the case before chp and oneils own office wondered about that just for the record we miss the fish as much as you do stanley fishburne the former head of cbi no not as much as we do dance said definitively okay probably not but in answer to your question everybodys delighted youre on point here god bless and more power to you dance moved aside piles of magazines and books then spread morton nagles material out in front of them maybe the sheets represented only a small percentage of the books clippings and notes filling nagles study but it was still a daunting quantity she found an inventory of the evidence and other items removed from pells house in seaside after the croyton murders there were a dozen books about charles manson several large files and a note from the crimescene officer item no found in the box where the manson books were kept trilby novel by george du maurier book had been read numerous times many notes in margins nothing relevant to case you ever heard of it she asked oneil read a huge amount and his large collection filling his den contained just about every genre of book that existed but this was one he hadnt heard of dance got her laptop went online and looked it up this is interesting george du maurier was daphne du mauriers grandfather she read several synopses and reviews of the book seems like trilby was a huge best seller a da vinci code of the time svengali know the namea mesmerizerbut nothing else interesting the storys about a failed musician svengali who meets a young and beautiful singerher first names trilby but she wasnt very successful svengali falls in love with her but she wont have anything to do with him so he hypnotizes her her careers successful but she becomes his mental slave in the end svengali dies andbecause du maurier believed a robot cant survive without its mastershe dies too guess there was no sequel oneil flipped through a stack of notes nagle have any thoughts about what hes up to not really hes writing us a bio maybe therell be something in it for the next hour they sifted through the photocopies looking for references to any place or person in the area that pell mightve had an interest in some reason for him to stay on the peninsula there was no reference to alison or nimue from the killers google search nothing most of the videotapes were feature tv magazine reports about pell the croyton murders or about croyton himself the flamboyant largerthanlife silicon valley entrepreneur sensationalist crap oneil announced superficial sensationalist crap exactly what morton nagle objected to in the coverage of crime and conflict but there were two others police interview tapes that dance found more illuminating one was for a burglary bust thirteen years ago who are your next of kin daniel i dont have any no family your parents gone long gone im an orphan you could say when did they die when i was seventeen but my dadd left before that you and your father get along my fatherthats a hard story pell gave the officer an account of his abusive father who had forced young daniel to pay rent from the age of thirteen hed beat the boy if he didnt come up with the moneyand beat the mother as well if she defended her son this he explained was why hed taken to stealing finally the father had abandoned them coincidentally his separated parents had died the same yearhis mother of cancer his father in a drunkdriving accident at seventeen pell was on his own and no siblings hm no siri always thought that if i had somebody to share that burden with i wouldve turned out differently and i dont have any children myself either thats a regret i must say but im a young man ive got time right oh if you get your act together daniel theres no reason in the world you couldnt have a family of your own thank you for saying that officer i mean that thank you and what about you officer you a family man i see youre wearing a wedding ring the second police tape was from a small town in the central valley twelve years ago where hed been arrested for petty larceny daniel listen here im gonna be askin you a few questions dont go and lie to us now okay thatll go bad for you no sir sheriff im here to be honest tell gods truth you do that and you and mell get along just fine now how come was it you was found with jake peabodys tv set and vcr in the back of your car i bought em sheriff i swear to you on the street this mexican fellow we was talking and he said he needed some money him and his wife had a sick kid he told me see what hes doing dance asked oneil shook his head the first interviewers intelligent he speaks well uses proper grammar syntax pell responded exactly the same way the second officer not as well educated as the first makes grammatical mistakes pell picks up on that and echoes him we was talking him and his wife its a trick high machiavellians use a nod at the set pell is in total control of both interrogations i dont know id give him a bminus for the sob stories oneil judged didnt buy any sympathy from me lets see dance found the disposition reports that nagle had included with the copies of the tapes sorry professor they gave him as reduced the first charge from burglary one to a receiving stolen suspended the second he was released i stand corrected they looked through the material for another halfhour nothing else was useful oneil looked at his watch got to go wearily he rose and she walked him outside he scratched the dogs heads hope you can make it to dads party tomorrow lets hope itll be over with by then he climbed into his volvo and headed down the misty street her phone croaked lo hey boss she could hardly hear loud music crashed in the background could you turn that down id have to ask the band anything new about juan no change ill go see him tomorrow listen im trying ha first pells aunt her names barbara pell but shes brainfried bakersfield pd say shes got alzheimers or something doesnt know the time of day but theres a work shed or garage behind the house with some tools in it and some other things of pells anybody couldve just strolled in and walked out with the hammer neighbors didnt see anything surprise surprise surprise was that andy griffith same show gomer pyle bakersfields going to keep an eye on the womans house thats affirmative now boss i got the skinny for you on winston who winston kellogg the fbi guy the one overbys bringing in to babysit you babysit could you pick a different word to oversee you to ride herd subjugate tj okay heres the scoop hes fortyfour lives in washington now but comes from the west coast former military army just like her late husband she thought the military part as well as the age detective with seattle pd then joined the bureau hes with a division that investigates cults and related crimes they track down the leaders handle hostage negotiations and hook up cult members with deprogrammers it was formed after waco the standoff in texas between law officers and the cult run by david koresh the assault to rescue the members ended up tragically the compound burned and most of the people inside died including a number of children hes got a good rep in the bureau hes a bit of a straight arrow but hes not afraid to get his hands dirty thats a direct quote from my buddy and i have no clue what it means oh one other thing boss the nimue search no vicap or other law enforcement reports and ive only checked out a few hundred screen names online half of themre expired the ones that are still active seem to belong to sixteenyearold geeks the real surnames are mostly european and i cant find anyone whos got a connection out here but i did find a variation thats interesting really what its an online roleplaying game you know those for a computer right one of those big boxes with wires in it touché boss its set in the middle ages and what you do is kill trolls and dragons and nasty things and rescue damsels kind of what we do for a living when you think about it anyway the reason it didnt show up at first is that its spelled differentlynixmue the logo is the word nimue with a big red x in the middle it its one of the hottest games online nowadays hundreds of millions in sales ah whatever happened to ms pacman my personal favorite i dont think pells the sort whos into computer games but he is the sort who killed a man who wrote software good point look into that but im still leaning toward it being a name or screen name dont worry boss i can check em both out thanks to all the leisure time you give me enjoying the band double touché dance let dylan and patsy out for their bedtime business then made a fast search of the property no unrecognized cars were parked nearby she got the animals back inside normally theyd sleep in the kitchen but tonight she let them have the run of the house they made a huge racket when strangers came around she also armed the window and door alarms dance went into maggies room and listened to her play a brief mozart piece on the keyboard then kissed her goodnight and shut out the light she sat for a few minutes with wes while he told her about a new kid at the camp whod moved to town with his parents a few months ago theyd enjoyed playing some practice matches today you want to ask him and his folks over tomorrow to grandpas birthday naw i dont think so after his fathers death wes had also grown more shy and reclusive you sure maybe later i dont know mom yes dearest son an exasperated sigh yes how come youve still got your gun childrennothing whatsoever gets by them forgot all about it its going in the safe right now can i read for a while sure ten minutes whats the book lord of the rings he opened then closed it mom yes but nothing more was forthcoming dance thought she knew what was on his mind shed talk if he wanted to but she hoped he didnt itd been a really long day then he said nothing in a tone she understood to mean there is something but i dont want to talk about it yet he returned to middle earth she asked where are the hobbits a nod at the book in the shire the horsemen are looking for them fifteen minutes night mom dance slipped the glock into the safe she reset the lock to a simple threedigit code which she could open in the dark she tried it now with her eyes closed it took no more than two seconds she showered donned sweats and slipped under the thick comforter the sorrows of the day wafting around her like the scent of lavender from the potpourri dish nearby where are you she thought to daniel pell whos your partner what are you doing at this moment sleeping driving through neighborhoods looking for someone or something are you planning to kill again how can i figure out what you have in mind staying close drifting off to sleep she heard in her mind lines from the tape she and michael oneil had just listened to and i dont have any children myself either thats a regret i must say but im a young man ive got time right oh if you get your act together daniel theres no reason in the world you couldnt have a family of your own dances eyes opened she lay in bed for a few minutes staring at a configuration of shadows on the ceiling then pulling on slippers she made her way into the living room go back to sleep she said to the two dogs who nonetheless continued to watch her attentively for the next hour or so as she prowled once again through the box that morton nagle had prepared for her tuesday chapter kathryn dance tj beside her was in charles overbys corner office earlymorning rain pelting the windows tourists thought the climate in monterey bay tended toward frequent overcasts threatening showers in fact the area was usually desperate for rain the gray overhead was nothing more than standardissue west coast fog today however the precipitation was the real thing i need something charles whats that an okay for some expenses for what were not making any headway therere no leads from capitola the forensics arent giving us any answers no sightings of himand most important i dont know why hes staying in the area what do you mean expenses charles overby was a man of focus i want the three women who were in the family arrest them i thought they were in the clear no i want to interview them they lived with him theyve got to know him pretty well oh if you get your act together daniel theres no reason in the world you couldnt have a family of your own it was this line from the police interview tape that had inspired the idea a to b to x we want to hold a family reunion said cheerful tj she knew hed been partying late but his round face under the curly red hair was as fresh as if hed walked out of a spa overby ignored him but why would they want to help us theyd be sympathetic to him wouldnt they no ive talked to two of them and they have no sympathy for pell the third changed her identity to put that whole life behind her why bring them here why not interview them where they live i want them together its a gestalt interviewing approach their memories would trigger each others i was up till two reading about them rebecca wasnt with the family very longjust a few monthsbut linda lived with pell for over a year and samantha for two have you already talked to them the question was coy as if he suspected her of pulling an end run no dance said i wanted to ask you first he seemed satisfied that he wasnt being outmaneuvered still he shook his head airfare guards transportationred tape i really doubt i could get it through sacramento its too out of the box he noticed a frayed thread on his cuff and plucked it out im afraid i have to say no utah im sure thats where hes headed now after the scare at moss landing itd be crazy for him to stay around is the usp surveillance team up and running yep tj told him utahd be good real good meaning dance understood they nail him and cbi gets the credit with no more loss of life in california usp misses him its their flub charles im sure utahs a false lead hes not going to point us there and unless her boss said triumphantly its a double twist think about it i did and its not pells profile i really want to go forward with my idea im not sure a voice from behind her can i ask what that idea is dance turned to see a man in a dark suit powder blue shirt and striped blueandblack tie not classically handsomehe had a bit of a belly prominent ears and if he were to look down a double chin would blossom but he had unwavering amused brown eyes and a flop of hair identical brown that hung over his forehead his posture and appearance suggested an easygoing nature he had a faint smile on narrow lips overby asked can i help you stepping closer the man offered an fbi identification card special agent winston kellogg the babysitter is in the building tj said sotto voce his hand over his mouth she ignored him charles overby thanks for coming agent kellogg please call me win im with the bureaus mvcc thats multiple victims coercive crimes division thats the new term for cults dance asked we used to call it cult unit actually but that wasnt pcp tj frowned drugs not a politically correct phrase she laughed im kathryn dance tj scanlon thomas jefferson tj gave a cryptic smile even dance didnt know his full name it might even have been just tj addressing all of the cbi agents kellogg offered i want to say something up front yeah im the fed but i dont want to ruffle feathers im here as a consultantto give you whatever insights i can about how pell thinks and acts im happy to take the backseat even if he didnt mean it percent dance gave him credit for the reassurance it was unusual in the world of law enforcement egos to hear one of the washington folk say something like this appreciate that overby said kellogg turned to the cbi chief have to say that was a good call of yours yesterday checking out the restaurants i never wouldve thought of that one overby hesitated then said actually i think i told amy grabe that kathryn here came up with that idea tj softly cleared his throat and dance didnt dare look his way well whoever it was a good idea he turned to dance and what were you suggesting just now dance reiterated it the fbi agent nodded getting the family back together good very good theyve gone through a process of deprogramming by now even if they havent seen therapists the passage of time alone would take care of any remnants of stockholm syndrome i really doubt theyd have any loyalty to him i think we should pursue it there was silence for a moment dance wasnt going to bail out overby who finally said it is a good idea absolutely the only problem is our budget see recently we well pay kellogg said then he shut up and simply stared at overby dance wanted to laugh you ill get a bureau jet to fly them here if we need one sound okay to you the cbi chief robbed of the only argument he could think of on such short notice said how can we refuse a christmas present from uncle sam thanks amigo dance kellogg and tj were in her office when michael oneil stepped inside he shook the fbi agents hand and they introduced themselves no more hits on the forensics from moss landing he said but were hopeful about the pastures of heaven and vineyards weve got health department people sampling products too in case hes adulterated them with acid he explained to kellogg about the trace found in the thunderbird during pells escape any reason why hed do that diversion or maybe he just wants to hurt people physical evidence isnt my expertise but sounds like a good lead dance noted that the fbi agent had been looking aside as oneil gave him the details concentrating hard as he memorized them then kellogg said it might be helpful to give you some insights into the cult mentality at mvcc weve put together a general profile and im sure some or all of it applies to pell i hope itll help you formulate a strategy good oneil said i dont think weve ever seen anybody quite like this guy dances initial skepticism about a cult experts usefulness had faded now that it was clear pell had an agenda they couldnt identify she wasnt sure that the killer was in fact like any other perp shed come across kellogg leaned against her desk first like the name of my unit suggests we consider the members of a cult victims which they certainly are but we have to remember that they can be just as dangerous as the leader charles manson wasnt even present at the tatela bianca killings it was the members who committed the murders now in speaking of the leader ill tend to say he but women can be just as effective and as ruthless as men and often theyre more devious so heres the basic profile a cult leader isnt accountable to any authority except his own hes always in charge one hundred percent he dictates how the subjects spend every minute of their time hell assign work and keep them occupied even if its just busywork they should never have any free time to think independently a cult leader creates his own moralitywhich is defined solely as whats good for him and what will perpetuate the cult external laws are irrelevant hell make the subjects believe its morally right to do what he tells themor what he suggests cult leaders are masters at getting their message across in very subtle ways so that even if theyre caught on a wiretap their comments wont incriminate them specifically but the subjects understand the shorthand hell polarize issues and create conflicts based on them versus us black and white the cult is right and anyone whos not in the cult is wrong and wants to destroy them he wont allow any dissent hell take extreme views outrageous views and wait for a subject to question himto test loyalty subjects are expected to give everything to himtheir time their money dance recalled the prison conversation the she said sounds like the woman is financing pells whole escape kellogg nodded theyre also expected to make their bodies available and hand over their children sometimes hell exercise absolute control over the subjects they have to give up their pasts hell give them new names something he chooses hell tend to pick vulnerable people and play on their insecurities he looks for loners and makes them abandon their friends and family they come to see him as a source of support and nurture hell threaten to withhold himself from themand thats his most powerful weapon okay i could go on for hours but that gives you a rough idea of daniel pells thought processes kellogg lifted his hands he seemed like a professor what does all this mean for us for one thing it says something about his vulnerabilities its tiring to be a cult leader you have to monitor your members constantly look for dissension eradicate it as soon as you find it so when external influences existlike out on the streettheyre particularly wary in their own environments though theyre more relaxed and therefore more careless and vulnerable look at what happened at that restaurant he was constantly monitoring because he was in public if hed been in his own house you probably wouldve gotten him the other implication is this the accomplice that woman will believe pell is morally right and that hes justified in killing that means two things we wont get any help from her and shes as dangerous as he is yes shes a victim but that doesnt mean she wont kill you if she has a chance well those are some general thoughts dance glanced at oneil she knew he had the same reaction as hers impressed with kelloggs knowledge of his specialty maybe for once charles overby had made a good decision even if his motive was to cover his ass still though thinking of what hed told them about pell she was dismayed at what they were up against she had firsthand knowledge of the killers intelligence but if kelloggs profile was even partially correct the man seemed a particularly dangerous threat dance thanked kellogg and the meeting broke uponeil headed for the hospital to check on juan millar tj to find a temporary office for the fbi agent dance pulled out her mobile and found linda whitfields phone number in the recentcalls log she hit redial oh agent dance have you heard anything new no im afraid not weve been listening to the radio i heard you almost caught him yesterday thats right more muttering prayer again dance assumed ms whitfield im here im going to ask you something and id like you to think about it before you answer go on wed like you to come here and help us what she whispered daniel pell is a mystery to us were pretty sure hes staying on the peninsula but we cant figure out why nobody knows him better than you samantha and rebecca were hoping you can help us figure it out are they coming youre the first one ive called a pause but what could i possibly do i want to talk to you about him see if you can think of anything that suggests what his plans might be where he might be going but i havent heard from him in seven or eight years there could be something he said or did back then thatll give us a clue hes taking a big risk staying here im sure he has a reason well dance was familiar with how mental defense processes work she could imagine the womans brain frantically looking forand rejecting or holding on toreasons why she couldnt do what the agent asked she wasnt surprised when she heard the problem is im helping my brother and sisterinlaw with their foster children i cant just up and leave dance remembered that she lived with the couple she asked if they could handle the children for a day or two it wont be any longer than that i dont think they could no the verb think has great significance to interrogators its a denial flag expressionlike i dont remember or probably not its meaning im hedging but not flatly saying no the message to dance was that the couple could easily handle the children i know its a lot to ask but we need your help after a pause the woman offered excuse two and even if i could get away i dont have any money to travel well fly you in a private jet private an fbi jet oh my dance dealt with excuse three before it was raised and youll be under very tight security no one will know youre here and youll be guarded twentyfour hours a day please will you help us more silence ill have to ask your brother your supervisor at work i can give them a call and no no not them i mean jesus ohwell okay after a pause dance asked could you check with him pretty soon ill call you back agent dance they hung up dance called winston kellogg and let him know they were awaiting divine intervention regarding whitfield he seemed amused thats one longdistance call dance decided she definitely wouldnt let charles overby know whose permission was required was this whole thing such a great idea after all she then called womens initiatives in san diego when rebecca sheffield answered she said hi its kathryn dance again in monterey i was rebecca interrupted ive been watching the news for the past twentyfour hours what happened you almost had him and he got away im afraid so rebecca gave a harsh sigh well are you catching on now catching on the fire at the courthouse the fire at the power plant twice arson see the pattern he found something that worked and he did it again exactly what dance had thought she didnt defend herself though but merely said hes not quite like any escapee weve ever seen well yeah ms sheffield theres something hold on first theres one thing i want to say go ahead dance said uneasily forgive me but you people dont have a clue what youre up against you need to do what i tell people in my seminars theyre about empowerment in business a lot of women think they can get together with their friends for drinks and dump on their idiotic bosses or their exes or their abusive boyfriends and presto theyre cured well it doesnt work like that you cant stumble around you cant wing it well i appreciate first you identify the problem an example youre not comfortable dating second identify the facts that are the source of the problem you were dateraped once three structure a solution you dont dive into dating and ignore your fears you dont curl up in a ball and forget men you make a plan start out slowly see men at lunchtime meet them in public places only go out with men who arent physically imposing and who dont invade your personal space who dont drink et cetera you get the picture then slowly you expand who you see after two three months or six or a year youve solved the problem structure a plan and stick to it see what im saying i do yes dance thought two things first the womans seminars probably drew sellout crowds second wouldnt want to hang out with rebecca sheffield socially she wondered if the woman was finished she wasnt okay now i have a seminar today i cant cancel but if you havent caught him by tomorrow morning i want to come up there maybe there are some things i can remember from eight years ago thatll help or is that against some policy or something no not at all its a good idea all right look i have to go what were you going to ask me nothing important lets hope everything works out before then but if not ill call and make arrangements to get you here sounds like a plan the woman said briskly and hung up chapter in the sea view motel daniel pell looked up from jennies computer where hed been online and saw the woman easing toward him seductively jennie offered a purr and whispered come on back to bed baby fuck me pell switched screens so she wouldnt see what he was searching for and slipped his arm around her narrow waist men and women exercise power over each other every day men have a harder time at first they have to work their way inside a womans defenses build subtle connections find her likes and dislikes and fears all of which she tries to keep hidden it could take weeks or months to get the leash on but once you had her you were in charge for as long as you wanted oh were like you know soul mates a woman on the other hand had tits and a pussy and all she had to do was get them close to a manand sometimes not evenand she could get him to do virtually anything the womans problem came later when the sex was over her control dropped off the radar screen jennie marston had been in charge a few times since the escape no question about it in the front seat of the tbird in bed with her trussed up by the stockings andmore leisurely and much betteron the floor with some accessories that greatly appealed to daniel pell jennie of course didnt care for that particular brand of sex but her reluctant acquiescence was a lot more exciting than if shed really been turned on the spell shed woven was now subdued though but a teacher never lets his student know hes inattentive pell grinned and looked over her body as if he were sorely tempted he sighed i wish i could lovely but you tired me out anyway i need you to run an errand for me me yep now that they know im here i need you to do it by yourself the news stories were reporting that he was probably still in the vicinity he had to be much more careful oh all right but id rather fuck you a little pout she was probably one of those women who thought the expression worked with men it didnt and hed teach her so at some point but there were more important lessons to be learned at the moment he said now go cut your hair my hair yeah and dye it the people at the restaurant saw you i bought some brown dye for you at the mexican store he pulled a box out of the bag oh i thought that was for you she smiled awkwardly gripping a dozen strands fingers twining them daniel pell had no agenda with the haircut other than making it more difficult to recognize her he understood though that there was something more another issue jennies hair was like the precious pink blouse and he was instantly intrigued he remembered her sitting in the tbird when hed first seen her in the whole foods parking lot proudly brushing away ah the information we give away she didnt want to cut it in fact she really didnt want to long hair meant something to her he supposed shed let it grow at some point as protection from her vicious selfimage some emblem of pathetic triumph over her flat chest and bumpy nose jennie remained on the bed after a moment she said sweetheart i mean ill cut it sure whatever you want another pause of course i was thinking wouldnt it be better if we left now after what happened at the restaurant i couldnt stand it if anything happened to you lets just get another car and go to anaheim well have a nice life i promise ill make you happy ill support us you can stay home until they forget about you that sounds wonderful lovely but we cant leave yet oh she wanted an explanation pell said only now go cut it he added in a whisper cut it short real short he handed her scissors her hands trembled as she took them okay jennie walked into the small bathroom clicked on all the lights from her training at the hair cuttery she used to work in or because she was stalling she spent some moments pinning the strands up before cutting them she stared into the mirror fondling the scissors uneasily she closed the door partway pell moved to a spot on the bed where he could see her clearly despite his protests earlier he found his face growing flushed and the bubble starting to build inside him go ahead lovely do it tears streaking down her cheeks she lifted a clump of hair and began to cut breathing deeply then cutting she wiped her face then cut again pell was leaning forward staring he tugged his pants down then his underwear he gripped himself hard and every time a handful of blond hair cascaded to the floor he stroked jennie wasnt proceeding very quickly she was trying to get it right and she had to pause often to catch her breath from the crying and wipe the tears pell was wholly focused on her his breathing came faster and faster cut it lovely cut it once or twice he came close to finishing but he managed to slow down just in time he was after all the king of control monterey bay hospital is a beautiful place located off a winding stretch of highway a multiplepersonality route that piggybacks on expressways and commercial roads and even village streets from pacific grove through monterey and on to salinas the road is one of the main arteries of john steinbeck country kathryn dance knew the hospital well shed delivered her son and daughter here shed held her fathers hand after the bypass surgery in the cardiac ward and shed sat beside a fellow cbi agent as he struggled to survive three gunshot wounds in the chest shed identified her husbands body in the mbh morgue the facility was in the piney hills approaching pacific grove the low rambling buildings were landscaped with gardens and a forest surrounded the grounds patients might awaken from surgery to find outside their windows hummingbirds hovering or deer gazing at them in narroweyed curiosity the portion of the critical care unit where juan millar was presently being tended to however had no view nor was there any patientpleasing decor just matteroffact posters of phone numbers and procedures incomprehensible to lay people and stacks of functional medical equipment he was in a small glasswalled room sealed off to minimize the risk of infection dance now joined michael oneil outside the room her shoulder brushed his she felt an urge to take his arm didnt she stared at the injured detective recalling his shy smile in sandy sandovals office crime scene boys love their toys i heard that somewhere he say anything since youve been here she asked no been out the whole time looking at the injuries the bandages dance decided out was better much better they returned to the ccu waiting area where some of millars family sathis parents and an aunt and two uncles if shed gotten the introductions right she doled out her heartfelt sympathy to the grimfaced family katie dance turned to see a solid woman with short gray hair and large glasses she wore a colorful overblouse from which dangled one badge identifying her as e dance rn and another indicating that she was attached to the cardiac care unit hey mom oneil and edie dance smiled at each other no change dance asked not really has he said anything nothing intelligible did you see our burn specialist dr olson no her daughter replied just got here whats the word hes been awake a few more times he moved a little which surprised us but hes on a morphine drip so doped up he didnt make any sense when the nurse asked him some questions her eyes strayed to the patient in the glassenclosed room i havent seen an official prognosis but theres hardly any skin under those bandages ive never seen a burn case like that its that bad im afraid so whats the situation with pell not many leads hes in the area we dont know why you still want to have dads party tonight edie asked sure the kidsre looking forward to it i might have to do a hitandrun depending but i still want to have it youll be there michael plan to depending i understand hope it works out though edie dances pager beeped she glanced at it ive got to get to cardiac if i see dr olson ill ask him to stop by and brief you her mother left dance glanced at oneil who nodded he showed a badge to the critical care nurse and she helped them both into gowns and masks the two officers stepped inside oneil stood while dance pulled up a chair and scooted forward juan its kathryn can you hear me michaels here too hey partner juan though the right eye the uncovered one didnt open it seemed to dance that the lid fluttered slightly can you hear me another flutter oneil said in a low comforting voice juan i know youre hurting were going to make sure you have the best treatment in the country dance said we want this guy we want him bad hes in the area hes still here the mans head moved we need to know if you saw or heard anything thatll help us we dont know what hes up to another gesture of the head it was subtle but dance saw the swaddled chin move slightly did you see something nod if you saw or heard something now no motion juan she began did you hey a male voice shouted from the doorway what the fuck do you think youre doing her first thought was that the man was a doctor and that her mother would be in trouble for letting dance into the room unsupervised but the speaker was a young sturdy latino man in a business suit juans brother julio oneil said the nurse ran up no no please close the door you cant be inside without a mask he waved a stiff arm at her and continued speaking to dance hes in that condition and youre questioning him im kathryn dance with the cbi your brother might know something helpful about the man who caused this well hes not going to be very fucking helpful if you kill him ill call security if you dont close the door this minute the nurse snapped julio held his ground dance and oneil stepped out of the room and into the hallway closing the door behind them they took off the gowns and masks in the corridor the brother got right into her face i cant believe it you have no respect julio millars father said stepping toward his son his stocky wife her jet black hair disheveled joined him julio ignored everyone but dance thats all you care about right he tells you what you want to know and then he can die she remained calm recognizing a young man out of control she didnt take his anger personally were very anxious to catch the man who did this to him son please youre embarrassing us his mother touched his arm embarrassing you he mocked then turned to dance again i asked around i talked to some people oh i know what happened you sent him down into the fire im sorry you sent him downstairs at the courthouse to the fire she felt oneil stiffening but he restrained himself he knew dance wouldnt let other people fight her battles she leaned closer to julio youre upset were all upset why dont we you picked him not mikey here not one of your cbi people the one chicano copand you sent him julio his father said sternly dont say that you want to know something about my brother hm do you know he wanted to get into cbi but they didnt let him in because of who he was this was absurd there was a high percentage of latinos in all california law enforcement agencies including the cbi her best friend in the bureau major crimes agent connie ramirez had more decorations than any agent in the history of the westcentral office but his anger wasnt about ethnic representation in state government of course it was about fear for his brothers life dance had a lot of experience with anger like denial and depression it was one of the stress response states exhibited by deceitful subjects when somebodys throwing a tantrum the best approach is simply to let him tire himself out intense rage can be sustained only for a short period he wasnt good enough to get a job with you but he was good enough to send to get burned up julio please his mother implored hes just upset dont listen to him dont do that mama you let them get away with shit every time you say things like that tears slipped down the womans powdered cheeks leaving fleshy trails the young man turned back to dance it was latino boy you sent it was the chulo thats enough his father barked taking his sons arm the young man pulled away im calling the papers im going to call khsp theyll get a reporter here and theyll find out what you did itll be on all the news julio oneil began no you be quiet you judas you two worked together and you let her sacrifice him he pulled out his mobile phone im calling them now youre going to be so fucked dance said can i talk to you for a moment just us oh now youre scared the agent stepped aside ready for battle julio faced her holding the phone like a knife and leaned into dances personal proxemic zone fine with her she didnt move an inch looked into his eyes im very sorry for your brother and i know how upsetting this is to you but i wont be threatened the man gave a bitter laugh youre just like listen to me she said calmly we dont know for sure what happened but we do know that a prisoner disarmed your brother he had the suspect at gunpoint then he lost control of his weapon and of the situation youre saying it was his fault julio asked eyes wide yes thats exactly what im saying not my fault not michaels fault your brothers it didnt make him a bad cop but he was at fault and if you turn this into a public issue that fact is going to come out in the press you threatening me im telling you that i wont have this investigation jeopardized oh you dont know what youre doing lady he turned and stormed down the corridor dance watched him trying to calm down she breathed deeply then joined the others im so sorry about that mr millar said his arm around his wifes shoulders hes upset dance said please dont listen to him he says things first and regrets them later dance didnt think that the young man would be regretting a single word but she also knew he wasnt going to be calling reporters anytime soon the mother said to oneil and juans always saying such nice things about you he doesnt blame you or anybody i know he doesnt julio loves his brother oneil reassured them hes just concerned about him dr olson arrived the slight placid man briefed the officers and the millars the news was pretty much the same they were still trying to stabilize the patient as soon as the dangers from shock and sepsis were under control hed be sent to a major burn and rehab center it was very serious the doctor admitted he couldnt say one way or the other if hed survive but they were doing everything they could has he said anything about the attack oneil asked the doctor looked over the monitor with still eyes hes said a few words but nothing coherent the parents continued their effusive apologies for their younger sons behavior dance spent a few minutes reassuring them then she and oneil said goodbye and headed outside the detective was jiggling his car keys a kinesics expert knows that its impossible to keep strong feelings hidden charles darwin wrote repressed emotion almost always comes to the surface in some form of body motion usually its revealed as hand or finger gestures or tapping feetwe may easily control our words glances and facial expressions but we exercise far less conscious mastery over our extremities michael oneil was wholly unaware that he was playing with his keys she said hes got the best doctors in the area here and momll keep an eye on him you know her shell manhandle the chief of the department into his room if she thinks he needs special attention a stoic smile michael oneil was good at that they can do pretty miraculous things she said not having any idea what doctors could or couldnt do she and oneil had had a number of occasions on which to reassure each other over the past few years mostly professionally sometimes personally like her husbands death or oneils fathers deteriorating mental state neither of them did a very good job expressing sympathy or comfort platitudes seemed to diminish the relationship usually the others simple presence worked much better lets hope as they approached the exit she took a call from fbi agent winston kellogg in his temporary quarters at cbi dance paused and oneil continued on into the lot she told kellogg about millar and she learned from him that a canvass by the fbi in bakersfield had located no witnesses whod seen anybody break into pells aunts toolshed or garage to steal the hammer as for the wallet bearing the initials rh found in the well with the hammer the federal forensic experts were unable to trace it to a recent buyer and kathryn ive got the jet tanked up in oakland if linda whitfield gets the okay from on high one other thing that third woman samantha mccoy right have you called her at that moment dance happened to look across the parking lot she saw michael oneil pausing as a tall attractive blonde approached him the woman smiled at oneil slipped her arms around him and kissed him he kissed her back kathryn kellogg said you there what samantha mccoy sorry dance looked away from oneil and the blonde no im driving up to san jose now if shes gone to this much trouble to keep her identity quiet i want to see her in person i think itll take more than a phone call to convince her to help us out she disconnected and walked up to oneil and the woman he was embracing kathryn anne good to see you dance said to michael oneils wife the women smiled then asked about each others children anne oneil nodded toward the hospital i came to see juan mike said hes not doing well no its pretty bad hes unconscious now but his parents are there theyd be glad for some company im sure anne had a small leica camera slung over her shoulder thanks to the landscape photographer ansel adams and the f club northern and central california made up one of the great photography meccas in the world anne ran a gallery in carmel that sold collectible photographs collectible generally defined as those taken by photographers no longer among the living adams alfred stieglitz edward weston imogen cunningham henri cartierbresson anne was also a stringer for several newspapers including big dailies in san jose and san francisco dance said michael told you about the party tonight my fathers birthday he did i think we can make it anne kissed her husband again and headed into the hospital see you later honey bye dear dance nodded goodbye and climbed into her car tossing the coach purse onto the passenger seat she stopped at shell for gas coffee and a cake doughnut and headed onto highway north getting a beautiful view of monterey bay she noted that she was driving past the campus of cal state at monterey bay on the site of the former fort ord probably the only college in the country overlooking a restricted area filled with unexploded ordnance a large banner announced what seemed to be a major computer conference this weekend the school she recalled was the recipient of much of the hardware and software in william croytons estate she reflected that if computer experts were still doing research based on the mans contributions from eight years ago he mustve been a true genius the programs that wes and maggie used seemed to be outdated in a year or two tops how many brilliant innovations had daniel pell denied the world by killing croyton dance flipped through her notebook and found the number of samantha mccoys employer called and asked to be connected ready to hang up if she answered but the receptionist said she was working at home that day dance disconnected and had tj textmessage her mapquest directions to the womans house a few minutes later the phone rang just as she hit play on the cd she glanced at the screen coincidentally the fairfield four resumed their gospel singing as dance said hello to linda whitfield who was calling from her church office amazing grace how sweet the sound agent dance call me kathryn please that saved a wretch like me i just wanted you to know ill be there in the morning to help you if you still want me yes id love for you to come somebody from my office will call about the arrangements thank you so much i once was lost but now am found a hesitation then she said in a formal voice youre welcome two out of three dance wondered if the reunion might work after all chapter sitting in front of the open window of the sea view motel daniel pell typed awkwardly on the computer keyboard hed managed some access to computers at the q and at capitola but he hadnt had time to sit down and really get to know how they worked hed been pounding away on jennies portable all morning ads news pornit was astonishing but even more seductive than the sex was his ability to get information to find things about people pell had ignored the smut and been hard at work first hed read everything he could on jennierecipes emails her bookmarked pages making sure she was essentially who she claimed to be she was then he searched for some people from his pastimportant to find thembut he didnt have much luck he then tried tax records deeds offices vital statistics but you needed a credit card for almost everything he learned and credit cards like cell phones left obvious trails then he had a brainstorm and searched through the archives of the local newspapers and tv stations that proved much more helpful he jotted information a lot of it among the names on his list was kathryn dance he enjoyed doodling a funereal frame around it the search didnt give him all the information he needed but it was a start always aware of his surroundings he noticed a black toyota camry pull into the lot and pause outside the window he gripped the gun then he smiled as the car parked exactly seven spaces away she climbed out thats my girl holding fast she walked inside you did it lovely pell glanced at the camry looks nice she kissed him fast her hands were shaking and she couldnt control her excitement it went great it really did sweetie at first he was kind of freaked and i didnt think he was going to do it he didnt like the thing about the license plates but i did everything you told me and he agreed good for you lovely jennie had used some of her cashshed withdrawn to pay for the escape and tide them over for the time beingto buy a car from a man who lived in marina it would be too risky to have it registered in her real name so shed persuaded him to leave his own plates on it shed told him that her car had broken down in modesto and shed have the plates in a day or two shed swap them and mail his back this was illegal and really stupid no man would ever do that for some other guy even one paying cash but pell had sent jennie to handle ita woman in tight jeans a halfbuttoned blouse and red bra on fine display had it been a woman selling the car pell would have dressed her down lost the makeup given her four kids a dead soldier for a husband and a pink breast cancer ribbon you can never be too obvious hed learned nice oh can i have the car keys she handed them over heres what else you wanted jennie set two shopping bags on the bed pell looked through them and nodded approvingly she got a soda from the minifridge honey can i ask you something his natural reluctance to answer questionsat least truthfullysurfaced again but he smiled you can anything last night when you were sleeping you said something you were talking about god god whatd i say i couldnt tell but it was definitely god pells head turned slowly toward her he noticed his heart rate increase he found his foot tapping which he stopped you were really freaking out i was going to wake you up but thats not good i read that somewhere readers digest or health i dont know when somebodys having a bad dream you should never wake them up and you said like fuck no i said that jennie nodded which was weird cause you never swear that was true people who used obscenities had much less power than people who didnt what was your dream about she asked i dont remember wonder why you were dreaming about god for a moment he felt a curious urge to tell her about his father then what the hellre you thinking of no clue im kinda into religion she said uncertainly a little more spiritual stuff than jesus you know well about jesus i dont think he was the son of god or anything but ill tell you i respect him he could get anybody to do whatever he wanted i mean even now you just mention the name and bang peoplell hop to in a big way thats power but all those religions the organized ones you give up too much to belong to them you cant think the way you want to they control you pell glanced at her blouse the bra the swelling began again the or something highpressure center growing in his belly he tried to ignore it and looked back at the notes hed taken from his online searches and the map jennie clearly wanted to ask what he had in mind but couldnt bring herself to shed be hoping he was looking for routes out of town roads that would lead ultimately to orange county ive got a few things to take care of baby ill need you to give me a ride sure just say when he was studying the map carefully and he looked up to see that shed stepped away jennie returned a moment later carrying a few things which shed gotten from a bag in the closet she set these on the bed in front of him then knelt on the floor it was like a dog bringing her master a ball ready to play pell hesitated but then he reminded himself that its okay to give up a little control from time to time depending on the circumstances he reached for her but she lay down and rolled over on her belly all by herself there are two routes to san jose from monterey you can take highway which winds along the coast through santa cruz then cut over on vertigoinducing highway through artsy los gatos where you can buy crafts and crystals and incense and tiedyed janis joplin dresses and okay roberto cavalli and d ampg or you can just take the highway cutoff to the and if youve got government tags burn however much gas you want to get up to the city in an hour kathryn dance chose the second gospel was gone and she was listening to latin musicthe mexican singer julieta venegas her soulful verdad was pounding from the speakers the taurus was doing ninety as she zipped through gilroy the garlic capital of the world not far away was castroville ditto artichokes and watsonville with its sweeping pelt of berry fields and mushroom farms she liked these towns and had no patience for detractors who laughed at the idea of crowning an artichoke queen or standing in line for the petting tanks at montereys own squid festival after all these chicerthanthou urbanites were the ones who paid obscene prices for olive oil and balsamic vinegar to cook those very artichokes and calamari rings in these burgs were homey and honest and filled with history and they were also her turf falling within the westcentral region of the cbi she saw a sign luring tourists to a vineyard in morgan hill and had a thought dance called michael oneil hey he said i was thinking about the acid they found in the thunderbird at moss landing any word peters techsve been working on it but they still dont have any specific leads how many bodies we have searching the orchards and vineyards about fifteen chp five of our people some salinas uniforms they havent found anything ive got an idea what is the acid exactly hold on eyes slipping between the road and the pad of paper resting on her knee she jotted the incomprehensible terms as he spelled them so kinesics isnt enough you have to master forensics too a wise woman knows her limitations ill call you in a bit dance then hit speed dial she listened to a phone ring two thousand miles away a click as it answered amelia sachs hi its kathryn howre you doing well been better can imagine weve been following the case hows that officer the one who was burned dance was surprised that lincoln rhyme the wellknown forensic scientist in new york city and amelia sachs his partner and a detective with the nypd had been following the story of pells escape not too good im afraid we were talking about pell lincoln remembers the original case in ninetynine when he killed that family are you making headway not much hes smart too smart thats what were gathering from the news so how are the kids fine were still waiting for that visit my parents too they want to meet you both sachs gave a laugh ill get him out there soon its alets say challenge lincoln rhyme didnt like to travel this wasnt owing to the problems associated with his disability he was a quadriplegic he simply didnt like to travel dance had met rhyme and sachs last year when shed been teaching a course in the new york area and had been tapped to help them on a case theyd stayed in touch she and sachs in particular had grown close women in the tough business of policing tend to do that any word on our other friend sachs asked this reference was to the perp theyd been after in new york last year the man had eluded them and vanished possibly to california dance had opened a cbi file but then the trail grew cold and it was possible that the perp was now out of the country im afraid not our office in las still following up on the leads im calling about something else is lincoln available hold on a minute hes right here there was a click and rhymes voice popped into her phone kathryn rhyme was not the sort for chitchat but he spent a few minutes conversingnothing about her personal life or the children of course his interest was the cases she was working lincoln rhyme was a scientist with very little patience for the people side of policing as he put it yet on their recent case together hed grown to understand and value kinesics though being quick to point out that it was based on scientific methodology and not he said contemptuously gut feeling he said wish you were here ive got a witness wed love for you to grill on a multiple homicide case you can use a rubber hose if you want she could picture him in his red motorized wheelchair staring at a large flat screen hooked up to a microscope or computer he loved evidence the same way she loved interrogation wish i could but ive got my hands full so i hear whos doing the lab work peter bennington oh sure i know him cut his teeth in la took a seminar of mine good man got a question about the pell situation sure go ahead weve got some evidence that might lead to what hes up tomaybe tainting foodor where hes hiding but either ones taking a lot of manpower to check out i have to know if it makes sense to keep them committed we could really use them elsewhere whats the evidence ill do the best i can with the pronunciation eyes shifting between the road and her notebook carboxylic acid ethanol and malic acid amino acid and glucose give me a minute she heard his conversation with amelia sachs who apparently went online into one of rhymes own databases she could hear the words clearly unlike most callers the criminalist was unable to hold his hand over the phone when speaking to someone else in the room okay hold on im scrolling through some things now you can call me back dance said she hadnt expected an answer immediately nojust hold on where was the substance found on the floor of pells car hm car silence for a moment then rhyme was muttering to himself finally he asked any chance that pell had just eaten in a restaurant a seafood restaurant or a british pub she laughed out loud seafood yes how on earth did you know the acids vinegarmalt vinegar specifically because the amino acids and glucose indicate caramel coloring my database tells me its common in british cooking pub food and seafood thom you remember him he helped me with that entry rhymes caregiver was also quite a cook last december hed served her a boeuf bourguignon that was the best shed ever had sorry it doesnt lead to his front door the criminalist said no no thats fine lincoln i can pull the troops off the areas we had them searching send them to where theyll be better used call anytime thats one perp i wouldnt mind a piece of they said goodbye dance disconnected called oneil and told him it was likely that the acid had come from jacks restaurant and wouldnt lead them to pell or his mission here it was probably better for the officers to search for the killer according to their original plan she hung up and continued her drive north on the familiar highway which would take her to san francisco where the eightlane highway eventually funneled into just another city street van ness now eighty miles north of monterey dance turned west and made her way into the sprawl of san jose a city that stood as the antithesis of los angeles narcissism in the old burt bacharachhal david tune do you know the way to san jose nowadays of course thanks to silicon valley san jose flexed an ego of its own mapquest led her through a maze of large developments until she came to one filled with nearly identical houses if the symmetrically planted trees had been saplings when theyd gone in dance estimated the neighborhood was about twentyfive years old modest nondescript smallstill each house would sell for well over a million dollars she found the house she sought and passed it by parking across the street a block away she walked back to the address where a red jeep and a dark blue acura sat in the driveway and a big plastic tricycle rested on the lawn dance could see lights inside the house she walked to the front porch rang the bell her cover story was prepared in case samantha mccoys husband or children answered the door it seemed unlikely that the woman had kept her past a secret from her spouse but it would be better to start out on the assumption that she had dance needed the womans cooperation and didnt want to alienate her the door opened and she found herself looking at a slim woman with a narrow pretty face resembling the actress cate blanchett she wore chic blueframed glasses and had curly brown hair she stood in the doorway head thrust forward bony hand gripping the doorjamb yes mrs starkey thats right the face was very different from that in the pictures of samantha mccoy eight years ago shed had extensive cosmetic surgery but her eyes told dance instantly that there was no doubt of her identity not their appearance but the flash of horror then dismay the agent said quietly im kathryn dance california bureau of investigation the womans glance at the id discreetly held low was so fast that she couldnt possibly have read a word on it from inside a mans voice called who is it honey samanthas eyes firmly fixed on dances she replied that woman from up the street the one i met at safeway i told you about which answered the question about how secret her past was she also thought smooth good liars are always prepared with credible answers and they know the person theyre lying to samanthas response told dance that her husband had a bad memory of casual conversation and that samantha had thought out every likely situation in which shed need to lie the woman stepped outside closed the door behind her and they walked halfway to the street without the softening filter of the screen door dance could see how haggard the woman looked her eyes were red and the crescents beneath them were dark her facial skin dry lips cracked a fingernail was torn it seemed shed gotten no sleep dance understood why she was working at home today a glance back at the house then she turned to dance and with imploring eyes whispered i had nothing to do with it i swear i heard he had somebody helping him a woman i saw that on the news but no no thats not what im here about i checked you out you work for that publisher on figueroa you were there all day yesterday alarm did you nobody knows i called about delivering a package thattoni said somebody tried to deliver something they were asking about me that was you the woman rubbed her face then crossed her arms gestures of negation she was steeped in stress that was your husband dance asked she nodded he doesnt know he doesnt even suspect amazing dance reflected does anyone know a few of the clerks at the courthouse where i changed my name my parole officer what about friends and family my mothers dead my father couldnt care less about me they didnt have anything to do with me before i met pell after the croyton murders they stopped returning my phone calls and my old friends some stayed in touch for a while but being associated with somebody like daniel pell lets just say they found excuses to disappear from my life as fast as they could everybody i know now i met after i became sarah a glance back at the house then she turned her uneasy eyes to dance what do you want a whisper im sure youre watching the news we havent found pell yet but hes staying in the monterey area and we dont know why rebecca and linda are coming to help us they are she seemed astonished and id like you to come down there too me her jaw trembled no no i couldnt oh please her voice started to break dance could see the fringes of hysteria she said quickly dont worry im not going to ruin your life im not going to say anything about you im just asking for help we cant figure him out you might know some things i dont know anything really daniel pells not like a husband or brother or friend hes a monster he used us thats all i lived with him for two years and i still couldnt begin to tell you what was going on in his mind you have to believe me i swear classic denial flags signaling not deception but the stress from a past she couldnt confront youll be completely protected if thats what no im sorry i wish i could you have to understand ive created a whole new life for myself but its taken so much workand its so fragile one look at the face the horrified eyes the trembling jaw told dance that there was no chance of her agreeing i understand im sorry i just cant do it samantha turned and walked to the house at the door she looked back and gave a big smile has she changed her mind dance was momentarily hopeful then the woman waved bye she called good seeing you again samantha mccoy and her lie walked back into the house the door closed chapter did you hear about that susan pemberton asked césar gutierrez sitting across from her in the hotel bar as she poured sugar into her latte she was gesturing toward a tv from which an anchorman was reading news above a local phone number escapee hotline wouldnt it be escaper gutierrez asked susan blinked i dont know the businessman continued i didnt mean to be light about it its terrible he killed two people i heard the handsome latino sprinkled cinnamon into his cappuccino then sipped spilling a bit of spice on his slacks oh look at that im such a klutz he laughed you cant take me anywhere he wiped at the stain which only made it worse oh well this was a business meeting susan who worked for an eventplanning company was going to put together an anniversary party for his parentsbut being currently single the thirtynineyearold woman automatically sized him up from a personal perspective noting he was only a few years older than she and wore no wedding ring theyd disposed of the details of the partycash bar chicken and fish open wine fifteen minutes to exchange new vows and then dancing to a dj and now they were chatting over coffee before she went back to the office to work up an estimate youd think they wouldve got him by now then gutierrez glanced outside frowning something wrong susan asked it sounds funny i know but just as i was getting here i saw this car pull up and somebody who looked a little like him pell got out he nodded at the tv who the killer he nodded and there was a woman driving the tv announcer had just repeated that his accomplice was a young woman where did he go i wasnt paying attention i think toward the parking garage by the bank she looked toward the place then the businessman gave a smile but thats crazy hes not going to be here he nodded past where they were looking whats that banner i saw it before oh the concert on friday part of a john steinbeck celebration you read him the businessman said oh sure east of eden the long valley you ever been to king city i love it there steinbecks grandfather had a ranch she touched her palm reverently to her chest grapes of wraththe best book ever written and theres a concert on friday you were saying what kind of music jazz you know because of the monterey jazz festival its my favorite i love it too gutierrez said i go to the festival whenever i can really susan resisted an urge to touch his arm maybe well run into each other at the next one susan said i worrywell i just wish more people would listen to music like that real music i dont think kids are interested heres to that gutierrez tapped his cup to hers my exshe lets our son listen to rap some of those lyrics disgusting and hes only twelve years old its not music susan announced thinking so he has an ex good shed vowed never to date anyone over forty who hadnt been married he hesitated and asked you think you might be there at the concert yeah i will well i dont know your situation but if you were going to go you want to hook up there oh césar thatd be fun hooking up nowadays that was as good as a formal invitation gutierrez stretched he said he wanted to get on the road then he added hed enjoyed meeting her and without hesitating gave her the holy trinity of phone numbers work home and mobile he picked up his briefcase and they started for the door together she noticed though that he was pausing his eyes through darkframed glasses examining the lobby he frowned again brushing uneasily at his moustache something wrong i think its that guy he whispered the one i saw before there you see him he was here in the hotel looking our way the lobby was filled with tropical plants she had a vague image of someone turning and walking out of the door daniel pell it couldnt be its stupid just you know the power of suggestion or something they walked to the door stopped gutierrez looked out hes gone think we should tell somebody at the desk ill give the police a call im probably wrong but what can it hurt he pulled out his cell phone and dialed he spoke for a few minutes then disconnected they said theyd send somebody to check it out didnt sound real enthusiastic of course theyre probably getting a hundred calls an hour i can walk you to your car if you want wouldnt mind that she wasnt so much worried about the escapee she just liked the idea of spending more time with gutierrez they walked along the main street in downtown alvarado now it was the home of restaurants tourist shops and coffeehousesa lot different from the wild west avenue it was a hundred years ago when soldiers and cannery row workers drank hung out in the brothels and occasionally shot it out in the middle of the street as gutierrez and susan walked along their conversation was subdued and they both looked around them she realized the streets were unusually deserted was that because of the escape now she began to feel uneasy her office was next to a construction site a block from alvarado there were piles of building materials here if pell had come this way she reflected he could easily be hiding behind them waiting she slowed thats your car gutierrez asked she nodded something wrong susan gave a grimace and an embarrassed laugh she told him she was worried about pell hiding in the building supplies he smiled even if he was here he wouldnt attack two of us together come on césar wait she said reaching into her purse she handed him a small red cylinder here whats this pepper spray just in case i think well be okay but how does it work then he laughed dont want to spray myself all you have to do is point it and push there its ready to go they continued to the car and by the time they got there susan was feeling foolish no crazed killers were lurking behind the piles of bricks she wondered if her skittishness had lost her points in the potential date department she didnt think so gutierrez seemed to enjoy the role of gallant gentleman she unlocked the doors i better give this back to you he said holding out the spray susan reached for it but gutierrez lunged fast grabbed her hair and jerked her head back fiercely he shoved the nozzle of the canister into her mouth open in a stifled scream he pushed the button agony reflected daniel pell is perhaps the fastest way to control somebody still in his apparently effective disguise as a latino businessman he was driving susan pembertons car to a deserted location near the ocean south of carmel agonyhurt them bad give them a little time to recover then threaten to hurt them again experts say torture isnt efficient thats wrong it isnt elegant it isnt tidy but it works real well the spray up susan pembertons mouth and nose had been only a second in duration but from her muffled scream and thrashing limbs he knew the pain was nearly unbearable he let her recover brandished the spray in front of her panicked watering eyes and immediately got from her exactly what he wanted he hadnt planned on the spray of course he had duct tape and a knife in the briefcase but hed decided to change his plans when the woman to his amusement handed the canister to himwell to his alter ego césar gutierrez daniel pell had things to do in public and with his picture running every halfhour on local television he had to become someone else after shed wheedled the toyota out of a gullible seller with an interest in a womans cleavage jennie marston had bought cloth dye and instanttan cream which hed mixed into a recipe for a bath that would darken his skin he dyed his hair and eyebrows black and used skinbond and hair clippings to make a realistic moustache nothing he could do about the eyes if there were contact lenses that made blue brown he didnt know where to find them but the glassescheap tinted reading glasses with dark frameswould distract from the color earlier in the day pell had called the brock company and gotten susan pemberton whod agreed to meet about planning an anniversary party he dressed in a cheap suit jennied bought in mervyns and met the events planner at the doubletree where he got to work doing what daniel pell did best oh it had been nice playing susan like a fish was a luxurious high even better than watching jennie cut her hair or discard blouses or wince when he used the coat hanger on her narrow butt he now replayed the techniques finding a common fear the escaped killer and common passions john steinbeck and jazz which he knew little about but he was a good bluffer playing the sex game her glance at his bare ring finger and stoic smile when hed mentioned children told him all about susan pembertons romantic life doing something silly and laughing about it the spilled cinnamon arousing her sympathy his bitch of an exwife ruining his son being a decent person the party for his beloved parents his chivalry in walking her to the car belying suspicion the fake call to little by little gaining trustand therefore gaining control what a total high it was to practice his art once again in the real world pell found the turnoff it led through a dense grove of trees toward the ocean jennie had spent the saturday before the escape doing some reconnaissance for him and had discovered this deserted place he continued along the sandswept road passing a sign that declared the property private he beached susans car in sand at the end of the road well out of sight of the highway climbing out he heard the surf crash over an old pier not far away the sun was low and spectacular he didnt have to wait long jennie was early he was happy to see that people who arrive early are in your control always be wary of those who make you wait she parked climbed out and walked to him honey i hope you didnt have to wait long she hungrily closed her mouth around his gripping his face in both her hands desperate pell came up for air she laughed its hard to get used to you like this i mean i knew it was you but still i did a double take you know but its like me and my short hairitll grow back and youll be white again come here he took her hand and sat on a low sand dune pulled her down next to him arent we leaving she asked not quite yet a nod at the lexus whose car is that i thought your friend was going to drop you off he said nothing they looked west at the pacific ocean the sun was a pale disk just approaching the horizon growing more fiery by the minute shed be thinking does he want to talk does he want to fuck me whats going on uncertaintypell let it run up shed be noticing that he wasnt smiling concern flowed in like high tide he felt the tension in her hand and arm finally he asked how much do you love me she didnt hesitate though pell noted something cautious in her response as big as that sun looks small from here i mean as big as the sun really is no as big as the universe she added quickly as if trying to correct a wrong answer in class pell was quiet whats the matter daniel i have a problem and i dont know what to do about it she tensed a problem sweetheart so its sweetie when shes happy sweetheart when shes troubled good to know he filed that away that meeting i had hed told her only that he was going to meet someone about a business thing uhhuh something went wrong i had all the plans made this woman was going to pay me back a lot of money id loaned her but she lied to me what happened pell was looking jennie right in the eye he reflected quickly that the only person whod ever caught him lying was kathryn dance but thinking of her was a distraction so he put her out of his mind she had her own plans it turned out she was going to use me and you too me she knows me not your name but from the news she knows were together she wanted me to leave you why so she and i could be together she wanted to go away with me this was somebody you used to know thats right oh jennie fell silent jealousy i told her no of course theres no way id even think about that an attempted purr it didnt work sweetheart and susan got mad she said she was going to the police shed turn us both in pells face contorted with pain i tried to talk her out of it but she wouldnt listen what happened he glanced at the car i brought her here i didnt have any choice she was trying to call the police alarmed jennie looked up and didnt see anybody in the car in the trunk oh god is she no pell answered slowly shes okay shes tied up thats the problem i dont know what to do now she still wants to turn you in can you believe it he asked breathlessly i begged her but shes not right in the head like your husband remember he kept hurting you even though he knew hed get arrested susans the same she cant control herself he sighed angrily i was fair to her and she cheated me she spent all the money i was going to pay you back with it for the car for everything youve done you dont have to worry about the money sweetheart i want to spend it on us no im going to pay you back never ever let a woman know you want her for her money and never ever be in another human beings debt he kissed her in a preoccupied way but whatre we going to do now jennie avoided his gaze and stared into the sun ii dont know sweetheart im not her voice ran out of steam just like her thoughts he squeezed her leg i cant let anything hurt us i love you so much faintly and i love you daniel he took the knife from his pocket stared at it i dont want to i really dont peopleve been hurt yesterday because of us us not me she caught the distinction he could sense it in the stiffening of her shoulders he continued but i didnt do that intentionally it was accidental but thisi dont know he turned the knife over and over in his hand she pressed against him staring at the blade flashing in the sunset she was shivering hard will you help me lovely i cant do it by myself jennie started to cry i dont know sweetheart i dont think i can her eyes were fixed on the rump of the car pell kissed her head we cant let anything hurt us i couldnt live without you me too she sucked in breath her jaw was quivering as much as her fingers help me please a whisper he rose helped her to her feet and they continued to the lexus he gave her the knife closed his hand around hers im not strong enough alone he confessed but togetherwe can do it together he looked at her eyes bright itll be like a pact you know like a lovers pact it means were bonded as close as two people can be like blood brothers wed be blood lovers he reached into the car and hit the trunkrelease button jennie barked a faint scream at the sound help me lovely please he led her toward the trunk then she stopped she handed him the knife sobbing pleaseim sorry im so sorry sweetheart dont be mad i cant do it i just cant pell said nothing just nodded her miserable eyes her tears reflecting red from the melting sun it was an intoxicating sight dont be mad at me daniel i couldnt stand it if you were mad pell hesitated for three heartbeats the perfect length of time to hatch uncertainty its okay im not mad am i still your lovely another pause of course you are he told her to go wait in the car i go wait for me its okay he said nothing more and jennie walked back to the toyota he continued to the trunk of the lexus and looked down at susan pembertons lifeless body hed killed her an hour before in the parking lot of her building suffocated her with duct tape pell had never intended jennie help him kill the woman hed known shed balk this whole incident was merely another lesson in the education of his pupil shed moved a step closer to where he wanted her death and violence were on the table now for at least five or ten seconds shed considered slipping the knife into a human body prepared to watch the blood flow prepared to watch a human life vanish last week shed never have been able to conceive of the thought next week shed consider it for a longer period then she might actually agree to help him kill someone and later still maybe he could get her to the point where shed commit murder by herself hed gotten the girls in the family to do things they hadnt wanted tobut only petty crimes nothing violent daniel pell though believed he had the talent to turn jennie marston into a robot who would do whatever he ordered even kill he slammed the trunk then snagging a pine branch he used it to obscure the footprints in the sand he returned to the car sweeping behind him he told jennie to drive up the road until the car was on gravel and he obliterated the tire prints as well he joined her ill drive he said im sorry daniel she said wiping her face ill make it up to you begging for reassurance but the lesson plan dictated that he give no response whatsoever chapter he was a curious man kathryn dance was thinking morton nagle tugged at his sagging pants and sat down at the coffee table in her office opening a battered briefcase he was a bit of a slob his thinning hair disheveled goatee unevenly trimmed gray shirt cuffs frayed body spongy but he seemed comfortable with his physique dance the kinesics analyst assessed his mannerisms precise and economical were stressfree his eyes with their elfin twinkle performed triage deciding instantly what was important and what wasnt when hed entered her office hed ignored the decor noted what dances face revealed probably exhaustion gave young rey carraneo a friendly but meaningless glance and fixed immediately on winston kellogg and after he learned kelloggs employer the writers eyes narrowed a bit further wondering what an fbi agent was doing here kellogg was dressed quite unfederal compared with this morningin a beige checkered sports coat dark slacks and blue dress shirt he wore no tie still his behavior was right out of the bureau as noncommittal as their agents always are he told nagle only that he was here as an observer helping out the writer offered one of his chuckles which seemed to mean ill get you to talk rebecca and linda have agreed to help us dance told him he lifted an eyebrow really the other one samantha no not her nagle extracted three sheets of paper from his briefcase he set them on the table my miniopus if thats not an oxymoron a brief history of daniel pell kellogg scooted his chair next to dances unlike with oneil she could detect no aftershave the writer repeated what hed said to dance the day before his book wasnt about pell himself but about his victims im looking into everybody affected by the croytons deaths even employees croytons company was eventually bought by a big software developer and hundreds of people were laid off maybe that wouldnt have happened if he hadnt died and what about his profession thats a victim too he was one of the most innovative computer designers in silicon valley at the time he had dozens of copyrights on programs and patents on hardware that were way ahead of their time a lot of them didnt even have any application back then they were so advanced now theyre gone maybe some were revolutionary programs for medicine or science or communications dance remembered thinking the same as shed driven past the cal state campus that was the recipient of much of croytons estate nagle continued with a nod toward what hed written its interestingpell changes his autobiography depending on whom hes talking to say he needs to form a connection with somebody whose parents died at a young age well to them pell says he was orphaned at ten or if he has to exploit somebody whose father was in the military then he was the army brat of a soldier killed in combat to hear him tell it there are about twenty different pells well heres the truth he was born in bakersfield october of nineteen sixtythree the seventh but he tells everyone that his birthday is november twentysecond that was the day lee harvey oswald shot kennedy he admired a presidential assassin kellogg asked no apparently he considered oswald a loser he thought he was too pliable and simpleminded but what he admired was the fact that one man with one act could affect so much could make so many people cry change the entire course of a countrywell the world now joseph pell his father was a salesman mother a receptionist when she could keep a job middleclass family momelizabethdrank a lot have to assume she was distant but no abuse no incarceration died of cirrhosis when daniel was in his midteens with his wife gone the father did what he could to raise the boy but daniel couldnt take anyone else being in charge didnt do well with authority figuresteachers bosses and especially his old man dance mentioned the tape she and michael oneil had watched the comments about his father charging rent beating him abandoning the family his parents dying nagle said all a lie but his father was undoubtedly a hard character for pell to deal with he was religiousvery religious very strict he was an ordained ministersome conservative presbyterian sect in bakersfieldbut he never got a church of his own he was an assistant minister but finally was released a lot of complaints that he was too intolerant too judgmental about the parishioners he tried to start his own church but the presbyterian synod wouldnt even talk to him so he ended up selling religious books and icons things like that but we can assume that he made his sons life miserable religion was not central to dances own life she wes and maggie celebrated easter and christmas though the chief icons of the faith were a rabbit and a jolly fellow in a red suit and she doled out to the children her own brand of ethicssolid incontrovertible rules common to most of the major sects still shed been in law enforcement long enough to know that religion often played a role in crime not only premeditated acts of terrorism but more mundane incidents she and michael oneil had spent nearly ten hours together in a cramped garage in the nearby town of marina negotiating with a fundamentalist minister intent on killing his wife and daughter in the name of jesus because the teenage girl was pregnant they saved the family but dance came away with an uneasy awareness of what a dangerous thing spiritual rectitude can be nagle continued pells father retired moved to phoenix and remarried his second wife died two years ago and joseph died last year heart attack pell apparently had never stayed in touch no uncles on either side and one aunt in bakersfield the one with alzheimers yes now he does have a brother not an only child as hed claimed hes older moved to london years ago he runs the sales operation of a us importerexporter doesnt give interviews all i have is a name richard pell dance said to kellogg ill have somebody track him down cousins the fbi agent asked aunt never married tapping the bio hed written now pells later teens he was constantly in and out of juvenile detentionmostly for larceny shoplifting car theft but he has no long history of violence his early record was surprisingly peaceful theres no evidence of street brawling no violent assaults no signs he ever lost his temper one officer suggested that it seemed pell would only hurt somebody if it was tactically useful and that he didnt enjoyor hateviolence it was a tool the writer looked up which you ask me is scarier dance thought of her earlier assessment killing emotionlessly whenever it was expedient now no history of drugs pell apparentlys never been a user and he doesntor didntdrink any alcohol what about education now thats interesting hes brilliant when he was in high school he tested off the charts he got as in independent study classes but never showed up when attendance was required in prison he taught himself law and handled his own appeal in the croyton case she thought of his comment during the interview about hastings law school and he took it all the way to the california supreme courtjust last year they ruled against him apparently it was a big blow he thought for sure hed get off well he may be smart but not smart enough to stay out of jail kellogg tapped a paragraph of the bio that described maybe seventyfive arrests thats a rap sheet and its the tip of the iceberg pell usually got other people to commit the crimes therere probably hundreds of other offenses he was behind that somebody else got nailed for robbery burglary shoplifting pickpocketing thats how he survived getting people around him to do the dirty work oliver kellogg said what charles dickens oliver twistyou ever read it dance said saw the movie good comparison fagin the guy who ran the gang of pickpockets that was pell please sir i want some more kellogg said in a cockney accent it was lousy dance laughed and he shrugged pell left bakersfield and moved to la then san francisco hung out with some people there was arrested for a few things nothing serious no word for a whileuntil hes picked up in northern california in a homicide investigation homicide yep the murder of charles pickering in redding pickering was a county worker he was found stabbed to death in the hills outside of town about an hour after he was seen talking to somebody who looked like pell vicious killing he was slashed dozens of times bloodbath but pell had an alibia girlfriend swore he was with her at the time of the killing and there was no physical evidence the local police held him for a week on vagrancy but finally gave him a pass the case was never solved then he gets the family together in seaside a few more years of theft shoplifting some assaults an arson or two pell was suspected in the beating of a biker who lived nearby but the man wouldnt press charges a month or so after that came the croyton murders from then onwell until yesterdayhe was in prison dance asked what does the girl have to say girl the sleeping doll theresa croyton what could she tell you she was asleep at the time of the murders that was established was it kellogg asked by who the investigators at the time i assume nagles voice was uncertain hed apparently never thought about it shed be lets see seventeen now dance calculated id like to talk to her she might know some things thatd be helpful shes living with her aunt and uncle right yes they adopted her could i have their number nagle hesitated his eyes swept the desktop theyd lost their sparkle is there a problem well i promised the aunt i wouldnt say anything to anybody about the girl shes very protective of her niece even i havent met her yet at first the woman was dead set against my talking to her i think she might agree eventually but if i gave you her number i doubt very much shed talk to you and i suspect id never hear from her again just tell us where she lives well get the name from directory assistance i wont mention you he shook his head they changed their last name moved out of the area they were afraid somebody in the family would come after them you gave kathryn the names of the women kellogg pointed out they were in the phone book and in public records you couldve gotten them yourself theresa and her aunt and uncle are very unpublic you found them dance said through some confidential sources who i guarantee want to stay even more confidential now that pells escaped but i know thiss important ill tell you what ill do ill go see the aunt in person tell her you want to talk to theresa about pell im not going to try to persuade them if they say no thats it kellogg nodded thats all were asking thanks looking over the bio dance said the more i learn about him the less i know the writer laughed the sparkle returning to his face oh you want to know the why of daniel pell he dug through his briefcase found a stack of papers and flipped to a yellow tab heres a quote from one of his prison psych interviews for once he was being candid nagle read pell you want to analyze me dont you you want to know what makes me tick you surely know the answer to that one doctor its the same for everybody family of course daddy whipped me daddy ignored me mommy didnt breastfeed me uncle joe did who knows what nature or nurture you can lay everything at your familys feet but if you think too much about em next thing you know every single relative and ancestor you ever had is in the room with you and youre paralyzed no no the only way to survive is to let em all go and remember that youre who you are and thats never going to change interviewer then who are you daniel pell laughing oh me im the one tugging the strings of your soul and making you do things you never thought you were capable of im the one playing my flute and leading you to places youre afraid to go and let me tell you doctor youd be astonished at how many people want their puppeteers and their pied pipers absolutely astonished i have to get home dance said after nagle had left her mother and the children would be anxiously awaiting her for her fathers party kellogg tossed the comma of hair off his forehead it fell back he tried again she glanced at the gesture and noticed something she hadnt seen beforea bandage protruding above the collar of his shirt you hurt a shrug got winged a takedown in chicago the other day his body language told her he didnt want to talk about it and she didnt push but then he said the perp didnt make it in a certain tone and with a certain glance it was how she told people that she was a widow im sorry you handling it okay fine then he added okay not fine but im handling it sometimes thats the best you can do on impulse she asked hey you have plans tonight brief the sac then a bath at the hotel a scotch a burger and sleep well okay two scotches have a question he lifted an eyebrow you like birthday cake after only a brief pause he said its one of my favorite food groups chapter mom look we deckorated it deck dance kissed her daughter mags thats funny she knew the girl had been bursting waiting to share the pun the deck did look nice the kids had been busy all afternoon getting ready for the party banners chinese lanterns candles everywhere theyd learned from their mom when it came to entertaining kathryn dances guests might not get gourmet food but they were treated to great atmosphere when can grandpa open his presents both wes and maggie had saved up allowance money and bought stuart dance outdoor gearwaders and a net dance knew her fatherd be happy with anything his grandchildren got him but those particular items he would definitely use presents after the cake edie dance announced and thats after dinner hi mom dance and her mother didnt always hug but tonight edie clasped her close as an excuse to whisper that she wanted to talk to her about juan millar the women walked into the living room dance saw immediately that her mother was troubled what is it hes still hanging in there hes come to a couple of times a glance around to make sure presumably that the children were nowhere nearby only for a few seconds each time he couldnt possibly give you a statement but what mom she lowered her voice further i was standing near him nobody else was in earshot i looked down and his eyes were open i mean the one thats not bandaged his lips were moving i bent down he said edie glanced around again he said kill me he said it twice then he closed his eyes is he in that much pain no hes so medicated he cant feel a thing but he could look at the bandages he could see the equipment hes not a stupid man his familys there most of the time well that brother of his round the clock he watches us like a hawk hes convinced were not giving juan good treatment because hes latino and hes made a few more comments about you dance grimaced sorry but i thought you should know im glad you told me very troubling not julio millar of course she could handle him it was the young detectives hopelessness that upset her so deeply kill me dance asked did betsey call ah your sister cant be here edie said in a breezy tone whose subtext was irritation that their younger daughter wouldnt make the fourhour drive from santa barbara for her fathers birthday party of course with the pell manhunt ongoing dance probably wouldntve driven there had the situation been reversed according to an important rule of families though hypothetical transgressions arent offenses and that dance was present even by default meant that this time betsey earned the black mark they returned to the deck and maggie asked mom can we let dylan and patsy out well see the dogs could be a little boisterous at parties and tended to get too much human food for their own good wheres your brother in his room whats he doing stuff dance locked the weapon away for the partyan mcso deputy on security detail was parked outside she showered fast and changed she found wes in the hallway no no tshirt its your grandfathers birthday mom its clean polo or your blueandwhite buttondown she knew the contents of his closet better than he did oh okay she looked closely at his downcast eyes his demeanor had nothing to do with a change of shirt whats the matter nothing come on spill spill its from my era tell me whats on your mind nothing go change ten minutes later she was setting out mounds of luscious appetizers offering a silent prayer of thanks to trader joes in a dress shirt cuffs buttoned and tails tucked wes strafed past and grabbed a handful of nuts a whiff of aftershave followed he looked good being a parent was a challenge but there was plenty to be proud of too mom he tossed a cashew into the air caught it in his mouth dont do that you could choke mom what whos coming tonight now the eyes fished away and his shoulder was turned toward her that meant another agenda lay behind the question she knew what was bothering himthe same as last night and now it was time to talk just us and a few people sunday evening thered be a bigger event with many of stuarts friends at the marine club near the aquarium in monterey today her fathers actual birthday shed invited only eight or so people for dinner she continued michael and his wife steve and martine the barbersthats about it oh and somebody whos working with us on a case hes from washington he nodded thats all nobody else thats all she pitched him a bag of pretzels which he caught with one hand set those out and make sure therere some left for the guests a muchrelieved wes headed off to start filling bowls what the boy had been worried about was the possibility that dance had invited brian gunderson the brian who was the source of the book sitting prominently nearby the brian whose phone call to dance at cbi headquarters maryellen kresbach had so diligently reported brian called the fortyyearold investment banker had been a blind date courtesy of maryellen who was as compulsive about and talented at matchmaking as she was baking brewing coffee and running the professional life of cbi agents brian was smart and easygoing and funny too on their first date the man had listened to her description of kinesics and promptly sat on his hands so you cant figure out my intentions that dinner had turned out to be quite enjoyable divorced no children though he wanted them brians investmentbanking business was hectic and with his and dances busy schedules the relationship had by necessity moved slowly which was fine with her long married recently widowed she was in no hurry after a month of dinners coffee and movies she and brian had taken a long hike and found themselves on the beach at asilomar a golden sunset a slew of sea otters playing near shorehow could you resist a kiss or two they hadnt she remembered liking that then feeling guilty for liking but liking it more than feeling guilty that part of your life you can do without for a while but not forever dance hadnt had any particular plans for the future with brian and was happy to take it easy see what developed but wes had intervened he was never rude or embarrassing but he made clear in a dozen ways a mother could clearly read that he didnt like anything about brian dance had graduated from griefcounseling but she still saw a therapist occasionally the woman told her how to introduce a possible romantic interest to the children and shed done everything right but wes had outmaneuvered her he grew sullen and passiveaggressive whenever the subject of brian came up or when she returned from seeing him thats what hed been wanting to ask about last night when he was reading lord of the rings tonight in his casual question about attendance at the party the boy really meant is brian coming and the corollary have you guys really broken up yes we have though dance wondered if brian felt differently after all hed called several times since the breakup the therapist had said his behavior was normal and dance could work it out if she remained patient and determined most important though she couldnt let her son control her but in the end she decided she wasnt patient or determined enough and so two weeks ago shed broken it off shed been tactful explaining that it was just a little too soon after her husbands death she wasnt ready brian had been upset but had taken the news well no parting shots and theyd left the matter open lets just give it some time in truth the breakup was a relief parents have to pick their battles and shed decided skirmishing over romance wasnt worth the effort just now still she was pleased about his calls and had found herself missing him carting wine outside onto the deck she found her father with maggie he was holding a book and pointing to a picture of a deepsea fish that glowed hey mags that looks tasty dance said mom gross happy birthday dad she hugged him thank you dear dance arranged platters dumped beer into the cooler then walked into the kitchen and pulled out her mobile she checked in with tj and carraneo theyd had no luck with the physical search for pell nor come across any leads to the missing ford focus anyone with the names or screen names nimue or alison or hotels motels or boardinghouses where pell and his accomplice might be staying she was tempted to call winston kellogg thinking he might be shying but she decided not to he had all the vital statistics hed either show or not dance helped her mother with more food and returning to the deck greeted the neighbors tom and sarah barber who brought with them wine a birthday present and their gangly mixedbreed dog fawlty mom please maggie called her meaning clear okay okay let em out of doggy jail maggie freed patsy and dylan from the bedroom and the three canines galloped into the backyard knocking one another down and checking out new scents a few minutes later another couple appeared on the deck fortyish steven cahill couldve been a birkenstock model complete with corduroy slacks and saltandpepper ponytail his wife martine christensen belied her surname she was sultry dark and voluptuous youd have thought the blood in her veins was spanish or mexican but her ancestors predated all the californian settlers she was part ohlone indiana loose affiliation of tribelets hunting and gathering from big sur to san francisco bay for hundreds possibly thousands of years the ohlone were the sole inhabitants of this region of the state some years ago dance had met martine at a concert at a community college in monterey a descendant of the famed monterey folk festival where bob dylan had made his west coast debut in and that a few years later morphed into the even more famous monterey pop festival which brought jimi hendrix and janis joplin to the worlds attention the concert where dance and martine had met was less culturebreaking than its predecessors but more significant on a personal level the women had hit it off instantly and had stayed out long after the last act finished talking music theyd soon become best friends it was martine whod practically broken down dances door on several occasions following bills death shed waged a persistent campaign to keep her friend from sinking into the seductive world of reclusive widowhood while some people avoided her and others her mother for instance plied her with exhausting sympathy martine embarked on a campaign that could be called ignoring sorrow she cajoled joked argued and plotted despite dances reticence she realized that damn it the tactic had worked martine was perhaps the biggest influence in getting her life back on track steves and martines children twin boys a year younger than maggie followed them up the stairs one toting his mothers guitar case the other a present for stuart after greetings maggie herded the boys into the backyard the adults gravitated to a rickety candlelit table dance saw that wes was happier than hed been in a long time he was a natural social director and was now organizing a game for the children she thought again about brian then let it go the escape are you martines melodious voice faded once she saw that dance knew what she was talking about yep im running it so the bugs hit you first her friend observed right in the teeth if i have to run off before the cake and candles thats why its funny said tom barber a local journalist and freelance writer we spend all our time lately thinking about terrorists theyre the new in villains and suddenly somebody like pell sneaks up behind you you tend to forget that its people like him who might be the worst threat to most of us barbers wife added peoplere staying home all over the peninsula theyre afraid only reason im here steven cahill said is because i knew thered be folks packing heat dance laughed michael and anne oneil arrived with their two children amanda and tyler nine and ten once again maggie clambered up the stairs she escorted the new youngsters to the backyard after stocking up on sodas and chips dance pointed out wine and beer then headed into the kitchen to help but her mother said youve got another guest she indicated the front door where dance found winston kellogg im emptyhanded he confessed ive got more than well ever eat you can take a doggy bag home if you want by the way you allergic to pollen yes dogs no kellogg had changed again the sports coat was the same but he wore a polo shirt and jeans topsiders and yellow socks he noted her glance i know for a fed i look surprisingly like a soccer dad she directed him through the kitchen and introduced him to edie then they continued on to the deck where he was inundated with more introductions she remained circumspect about his role here and kellogg said merely that he was in town from washington and was working with kathryn on a few projects then she took him to the stairs leading down to the backyard and introduced him to the children dance caught wes and tyler looking at him closely undoubtedly for armament and whispering to each other oneil joined the two agents wes waved enthusiastically to the deputy and with another glance at kellogg returned to their game which he was apparently making up on the run he was laying out the rules it seemed to involve outer space and invisible dragons the dogs were aliens the twins were royalty of some kind and a pine cone was either a magic orb or a hand grenade perhaps both did you tell michael about nagle kellogg asked she gave a brief synopsis of what theyd learned about pells history and added that the writer was going to see if theresa croyton would talk to them so you think pells here because of the murders back then oneil asked i dont know she said but i need all the information i can get the placid detective gave a smile and said to kellogg no stone left unturned thats how i describe her policing style which i learned from him dance said laughing and nodding at oneil then the detective said oh i was thinking about something remember one of pells phone conversations from capitola was about money ninetytwo hundred dollars kellogg said dance was impressed at his retention well heres what i thought we know the thunderbird was stolen in los angeles its logical to assume thats where pells girlfriends from how bout we contact banks in la county and see if any women customersve withdrawn that amount in the past say month or two dance liked the idea though it would mean a lot of work oneil said to kellogg thatd have to come from you folks fbi treasury irs or homeland security id guess its a good idea just thinking out loud though id say wed have a manpower problem he echoed dances concern were talking millions of customers i know the la bureau couldnt handle it and homelandd laugh and if she was smart shed make small withdrawals over a period of time or cash thirdparty checks and stash the money oh sure possibly but itd be great to id his girlfriend you know a second suspect logarithmically increases the chances for detection and arrest kellogg finished the quotation from an old textbook on law enforcement dance and oneil quoted it often smiling kellogg held oneils eye we feds dont have quite the resources people think we do im sure we couldnt come up with the bodies to man the phones be a huge job i wonder youd think itd be pretty easy to check databases at least with the big chain banks michael oneil could be quite tenacious dance asked would you need a warrant oneil said probably to release the name you would but if a bank wanted to cooperate they could run the numbers and tell us if there was a match we could get a warrant for the name and address in a halfhour kellogg sipped his wine the fact is theres another problem im worried if we go to the sac or homeland with something like thattoo tenuouswe might lose support wed need later for something more solid crying wolf hm oneil nodded guess you have to play more politics at that level than we do here but lets think about it ill make some calls oneil looked past dances shoulder hey happy birthday young man stuart dance wearing a badge that said birthday boy handmade by maggie and wes shook hands refilled oneils and dances wineglasses and said to kellogg youre talking shop not allowed im stealing you away from these children come play with the adults kellogg gave a shy laugh and followed the man to the candlelit table where martine had her battered gibson guitar out of the case and was organizing a singalong dance and oneil stood alone she saw wes looking up hed apparently been studying the adults he turned away back to the star wars improvisation he seems good oneil said tilting his head toward kellogg winston yes typically oneil carried no grudge about the rejection of his suggestions he was the antithesis of pettiness he take a hit recently oneil tapped his neck howd you know the bandage wasnt visible tonight he was touching it the way you touch a wound she laughed good kinesic analysis yeah just happened he was in chicago the perp got a round off first i guess and win took him out he didnt go into the details they fell silent looking over the backyard the children the dogs the lights glowing brighter in the encroaching dusk well get him will we she asked yep hell make a mistake they always do i dont know hes something different dont you feel that no hes not different hes just more michael oneilthe most widely read person she knewhad surprisingly simple philosophies of life he didnt believe in evil or good much less god or satan those were all abstractions that deflected you from your job which was to catch people who broke rules that humans had created for their own health and safety no good no bad just destructive forces that had to be stopped to michael oneil daniel pell was a tsunami an earthquake a tornado he watched the children playing then said i gather that guy youve been seeingits over with brian called you caught that hm busted by my own assistant im sorry really you know how it goes dance said noting shed spoken one of those sentences that were meaningless flotsam in a conversation sure dance turned to see how her mother was coming with dinner she saw oneils wife looking at the two of them anne smiled dance smiled back she said to oneil so lets go join the singalong do i have to sing absolutely not she said quickly he had a wonderful speaking voice low with a natural vibrato he couldnt stay on key under threat of torture after a halfhour of music gossip and laughter edie dance her daughter and granddaughter set out worcestershiremarinated flank steak salad asparagus and potatoes au gratin dance sat beside winston kellogg who was holding his own very well among strangers he even told a few jokes with a deadpan delivery that reminded her of her late husband who had shared not only kelloggs career but his easygoing natureat least once the federal id card was tucked away the conversation ambled from music to anne oneils critique of san francisco arts to politics in the middle east washington and sacramento to the far more important story of a sea otter pup born in captivity at the aquarium two days ago it was a comfortable gathering friends laughter food wine music though of course complete comfort eluded kathryn dance pervading the otherwise fine evening like the moving bass line of martines old guitar was the thought that daniel pell was still at large wednesday chapter kathryn dance was sitting in a cabin at the point lobos innthe first time shed ever been in the expensive place it was an upscale lodge of private cabins on a quiet road off highway south of carmel abutting the rugged and beautiful state park after which the inn was named the tudorstyle place was secludeda long driveway separated it from the roadand the deputy in the monterey sheriffs office car stationed in front had a perfect view of all approaches which was why shed picked it dance checked in with oneil at the moment he was following up on a missing person report in monterey calls to tj and carraneo too tj had nothing to tell her and the rookie agent said he was still having no luck finding a cheap motel or boardinghouse where pell might be staying ive tried all the way up to gilroy and cheap hotels a pause thats right agent dance i didnt bother with the expensive ones didnt think an escapeed have much money to spend on them dance recalled pells secret phone conversation in capitola the reference to pells probably thinking thats exactly what youre thinking which means she let carraneo pick up her thought that itd be smarter for him to stay in an expensive one hm okay ill get on it wait where are you right now agent dance do you think he ive already checked out everybody here she assured him she hung up looked at her watch again and wondered is this harebrained scheme really going to do any good five minutes later a knock on the door dance opened it to see massive cbi agent albert stemple towering over a woman in her late twenties stocky linda whitfield had a pretty face untouched by makeup and short red hair her clothes were a bit shabby black stretch pants with shiny knees and a red sweater dangling threads its vneck framed a pewter cross dance detected no trace of perfume and lindas nails were unpolished and cut short the women shook hands lindas grip was firm stemples brow lifted meaning is there anything else dance thanked him and the big agent set down lindas suitcase and ambled off dance locked the door and the woman walked into the living room of the twobedroom cabin she looked at the elegant place as if shed never stayed anywhere nicer than a days inn my ive got coffee going a gesture toward the small kitchen tea if theres any dance made a cup im hoping you wont have to stay long maybe not even overnight any more on daniel nothing new linda looked at the bedrooms as if choosing one would commit her to staying longer than she wanted to her serenity wavered then returned she picked a room and took her suitcase inside then returned a moment later and accepted the cup of tea poured milk in and sat i havent been on an airplane in years she said and that jetit was amazing so small but it pushed you right back in your seat when we took off there was an fbi agent on board she was very nice they sat on comfortable couches a large coffee table between them she looked around the cabin again my this is nice it sure was dance wondered what the fbi accountants would say when they saw the bill the cabin was nearly six hundred a night rebeccas on her way but maybe you and i could just get started and samantha she wouldnt come you talked to her then i went to see her where is sheno wait you cant tell me that dance smiled i heard she had plastic surgery and changed her name and everything thats true yes at the airport i bought a newspaper to see what was going on dance wondered about the absence of a tv in her brothers house was it an ethical or cultural decision or an economic one you could get a cable ready set for a few hundred bucks nowadays still dance noted that the heels of lindas shoes were virtually worn away it said there was no doubt he killed those guards she set down the tea i was surprised by that daniel wasnt violent hed only hurt someone in selfdefense though looked at from pells point of view that was exactly why hed slaughtered the guards but linda continued he did let somebody go that driver only because it served his interest how did you meet pell it was about ten years ago in golden gate park san francisco id run away from home and was sleeping there daniel samantha and jimmy were living in seaside along with a few other people theyd travel up and down the coast like gypsies theyd sell things theyd bought or made sam and jimmy were pretty talented theyd make picture frames cd holders tie racks things like that anyway id run away that weekendno big deal i did it all the timeand daniel saw me near the japanese garden he sat down and we started talking daniel has this gift he listens to you its like youre the center of the universe its really you know seductive and you never went back home no i did i always wanted to run away and just keep going my brother did he left home at eighteen and never looked back but i wasnt brave enough to my parentswe lived in san mateothey were real strict like drill instructors my father was head of santa clara bank and trust wait that whitfield yep the multimillionaire whitfield the one who financed a good portion of silicon valley and survived the crash the one who was going into politicsuntil a certain daughter of his made the press in a big way a wry smile ever met anybody whos been disowned by her parents you have now anyway when i was growing up they were very authoritarian i had to do everything the way they insisted how i made my room what i wore what i was taking in school what my grades were going to be i got spanked until i was fourteen and i think he only stopped because my mother told my father it wasnt a good idea with a girl that age they claimed it was because they loved me and so on but they were just control freaks they were trying to turn me into a little doll for them to dress up and play with so i go back home but all the time i was there i couldnt get daniel out of my head wed only talked for i dont know a few hours but it was wonderful he treated me like i was a real person he told me to trust my judgment that i was smart i was pretty a grimace oh i wasnt reallynot either of those things but when he said it i believed him one morning my mother came to my room and told me to get up and get dressed we were going to visit my aunt or somebody and i was supposed to wear a skirt i wanted to wear jeans it wasnt a formal thingwe were just going to lunch but she made a big deal out of it she screamed at me no daughter of mine you get the idea well i grabbed my backpack and just left i was afraid id never find daniel but i remembered hed told me hed be in santa cruz that week at a flea market on the boardwalk the boardwalk was a famous amusement park on the beach a lot of young people hung out there at all hours of the day dance reflected that itd make a good hunting ground if daniel pell was on the prowl for victims so i hitched a ride down highway one and there he was he looked happy to see me which i dont think my parents ever did she laughed i asked if he knew a place i could stay i was nervous about that hinting but he said you bet i do with us in seaside uhhuh we had a little bungalow there it was nice you samantha jimmy and pell right her body language told dance that she was enjoying the memory the easy position of the shoulders the crinkles beside the eyes and the illustrator hand gestures which emphasize the content of the words and suggest the intensity of the speakers reaction to what he or she is saying linda picked up her tea again and sipped it whatever the papers saidcult drug orgiesthat was wrong it was really homey and comfortable i mean no drugs at all or liquor some wine at dinner sometimes oh it was nice i loved being around people who saw you for who you were didnt try to change you respected you i ran the house i was sort of the mother i guess you could say it was so nice to be in charge for a change not getting yelled at for having my own opinion what about the crimes linda grew tense there was that some not as much as people say a little shoplifting things like that and i never liked it never a few negation gestures here but dance sensed she wasnt being deceptive the kinesic stress was due to her minimizing the severity of the crimes the family had done much worse than just shoplifting dance knew there were burglary counts and grand larceny as well as purse snatching and pickpocketingboth crimes against persons and under the penal code more serious than those against property but we didnt have any choice to be in the family you had to participate what was it like living with daniel it wasnt as bad as youd think you just had to do what he wanted and if you didnt he never hurt us not physically mostly hedwithdraw dance recalled kelloggs profile of a cult leader hell threaten to withhold himself from them and thats a very powerful weapon hed turn away from you and youd get scared you never knew if that was the end for you and youd get thrown out somebody in the church office was telling me about these reality shows big brother survivor dance nodded she was saying how popular they were i think thats why peoplere obsessed with them theres something terrifying about the idea of being kicked out of your family she shrugged and fondled the cross on her chest you got a longer sentence than the others for destroying evidence what was that story the womans lips grew tight it was stupid i panicked all i knew was that daniel called and said jimmy was dead and something had gone wrong at this house where theyd had a meeting we were supposed to pack up and get ready to leave the police might be after him soon daniel kept all these books about charles manson in the bedroom and clippings and things i burned some before the police got there i thought itd look bad if they knew he had this thing for manson which it had dance reflected recalling how the prosecutor had used the charles manson theme to help him win a conviction responding to dances questions linda mentioned more about her recent life in jail shed become devoutly religious and after her release moved to portland where shed gotten a job working for a local protestant church shed joined it because her brother was a deacon there she was seeing a nice christian man in portland and was the nanny in effect for her brother and sisterinlaws foster children she wanted to become a foster parent herselfshed had medical problems and could have no children of her ownbut that was hard with the prison conviction she added in a tone of conclusion i dont have many material things but i like my life its a rich life in the good sense of the word a knock on the door intruded dances hand strayed toward her heavy pistol its tj boss i forgot the secret password dance opened the door and the young agent entered with another woman slim and tall in her midthirties she carried a leather backpack slung over her shoulder kathryn dance rose to greet the second member of the family chapter rebecca sheffield was a few years older than her fellow family member she was athleticlooking and gorgeous though dance thought that the short crop of prematurely gray hair the brash jewelry and the absence of makeup made her look austere she wore jeans and a white silk tshirt under a brown suede jacket rebecca shook dances hand firmly but she immediately turned her attention to linda who was rising and gazing at her with a steady smile well look who it is rebecca stepped forward and hugged linda after all these years lindas voice choked my i think im going to cry and she did they dropped the embrace but rebecca continued to hold the other womans hands tightly its good to see you linda oh rebeccaive prayed for you a lot youre into that now you didnt used to know a cross from a star of david well thanks for the prayers not sure they took no no youre doing such good things really the church office has a computer i saw your website women starting their own businesses its wonderful im sure it does a lot of good rebecca seemed surprised that linda had kept up with her dance pointed out the available bedroom and rebecca carried her backpack into it and used the restroom you need me boss just holler tj left and dance locked the door behind him linda picked up her teacup fiddled with it not taking a sip how people love their props in stressful situations dance reflected shed interrogated suspects who clutched pens ashtrays food wrappers and even their shoes to dull the stress rebecca returned and dance offered her some coffee you bet dance poured her some and set out milk and sugar theres no public restaurant here but they have room service order whatever youd like sipping the coffee rebecca said ive got to say linda youre looking good a blush oh i dont know im not in the shape id like youre glamorous and thin i love your hair rebecca laughed hey nothing like a couple years in prison to turn you gray hm hey no ring youre not married nope me either youre kidding you were going to marry some hunky italian sculptor i thought for sure youd be hooked up now not easy to find mr right when men hear your boyfriend was daniel pell i read about your father in businessweek something about his bank expanding really i wouldnt know youre still not talking linda shook her head my brother doesnt talk to them either were two poor church mice but its for the best believe me you still paint some not professionally no really linda turned to dance her eyes shining oh rebecca was so good you should see her work i mean shes the best just sketch for fun now they spent a few minutes catching up dance was surprised that though they both lived on the west coast they hadnt communicated since the trial rebecca glanced at dance samantha joining our coffee klatch or whatever her name is now no just the two of you sam was always the timid one mouse remember linda said thats right thats what pell called her my mouse they refilled their cups and dance got down to work asking rebecca the same basic questions shed asked linda i was the last one to get suckered in by mr pell the thin woman said sourly it was onlywhen a glance at linda who said january just four months before the croyton situation situation not murders how did you meet pell dance asked back then i was bumming around the west coast making money doing sketches of people at street fairs and on the beach you know i had my easel set up and pell stopped by he wanted his portrait done linda gave a coy smile i seem to remember you didnt do much sketching you two ended up in the back of the van and were there for a long long time rebeccas smile was of embarrassment well daniel had that side to him sure in any case we did spend time talking too and he asked me if i wanted to hang out with them in seaside i wasnt sure at firsti mean we all knew about pells reputation and the shoplifting and things like that but i just said to myself hell im a bohemian im a rebel and artist screw my lily white suburban upbringinggo for it and i did it worked out well there were good people around me like linda and sam i didnt have to work nine to five and could paint as much as i wanted who could ask for anything more in life of course it turned out id also joined up with bonnie and clyde a band of thieves that wasnt so good dance noticed lindas placid face darken at the comment after release from jail rebecca explained she became involved in the womens movement i figured me kowtowing to pelltreating him like the king of the roostset the feminist cause back a few years and i wanted to make it up to them finally after a lot of counseling shed started a consulting service to help women open and finance small businesses shed been at it ever since she must do well for herself dance thought to judge from the jewelry clothes and italian shoes which if the agents estimate was right dance could be an expert footwear witness cost the same as her best two pairs put together another knock on the door winston kellogg arrived dance was happy to see himprofessionally and personally shed enjoyed getting to know him on the deck last night hed been surprisingly social for a hardtraveling fed dance had attended a number of functions with her husbands federal coworkers and found most of them quiet and focused reluctant to talk but win kellogg along with her parents had been the last to leave the party he now greeted the two women and in keeping with protocol showed them his id he poured himself some coffee up until now dance had been asking background information but with kellogg here it was time to get to the crux of the interview all right heres the situation pell is probably still in the area we cant figure out where or why it doesnt make any sense most escapees get as far away as they can from the site of the jail break she told them in detail of how the plan at the courthouse had unfolded and the developments to date the women listened with interestand shock or revulsionto the specifics first let me ask you about his accomplice that woman i read about linda asked who is she we dont know apparently blond and young age is roughly midtwenties so hes got a new girlfriend rebecca said thats our daniel never without one kellogg said we dont exactly know the relationship she was probably a fan of his apparently prisoners even the worst get plenty of women throwing themselves at their feet rebecca laughed and glanced at linda you get any love letters when you were inside i didnt linda gave a polite smile theres a chance dance said that she isnt a stranger shedve been very young at the time the family was together but i was wondering if she could be somebody you know linda frowned midtwenties nowshedve been a teenager then i dont remember anyone like that rebecca added when i was in the family it was only the five of us dance jotted a note now i want to talk about what your life was like then what pell said and did what interested him what his plans were im hoping something you remember will give us a clue as to what hes up to step one define the problem step two get the facts rebeccas eyes were on dance both linda and kellogg looked blank dance of course knew what she was talking about and was thankful that the woman wasnt in the mood to deliver another lecture like yesterday jump in with whatever you want if you have an idea that sounds bizarre go ahead and tell us well take whatever we can get im game linda said rebecca offered shoot dance asked about the structure of life in the family it was sort of a commune rebecca said which was weird for me growing up in capitalistic sitcom suburbia you know as they described it the arrangement was a little different though from what a communist cadre might expect the rule seemed to be from each according to what daniel pell demanded of them to each according to what daniel pell decided still the family worked pretty well at least on a practical level linda had made sure the household ran smoothly and the others contributed they ate well and kept the bungalow clean and in good repair both samantha and jimmy newberg were talented with tools and home improvement for obvious reasonsstolen property stored in a bedroompell didnt want the owner to paint or fix broken appliances so they had to be completely selfsufficient linda said that was one of daniels philosophies of life selfreliancethe essay by ralph waldo emerson i read it out loud a dozen times he loved to hear it rebecca was smiling remember reading at night linda explained that pell believed in books he loved them he made a ceremony out of throwing out the tv almost every night id read something aloud with everyone else gathered in a circle on the floor those were nice nights were there any neighbors or other friends in seaside he had a particular connection with we didnt have friends rebecca said pell wasnt like that but some people hed met would come by stay for a while then leave he was always picking up people losers like us linda stiffened slightly then said well id say people down on their luck daniel was generous gave them food money sometimes you give a hungry man food hell do what you want dance reflected recalling kelloggs profile of a cult leader and his subjects they continued reminiscing but the conversation didnt trigger any recollections of who the houseguests mightve been dance moved on there are some things he searched for online recently i was wondering if they mean anything to you one was nimue i was thinking it might be a name a nickname or computer screen name maybe no ive never heard of it what does it mean its a character out of the king arthur legend rebecca looked at the younger woman hey did you read us any of those stories linda didnt recall nor had they any recollection of an alisonthe other name pell had searched for tell me about a typical day in the family rebecca seemed at a loss for words wed get up have breakfasti dont know shrugging linda said we were just a family we talked about what families talk about the weather plans trips we were going to take money problems who was going to be working where sometimes id stand in the kitchen after breakfast doing dishes and just crybecause i was so happy i had a real family at last rebecca agreed that their life hadnt been very different from anyone elses though she clearly wasnt as sentimental as her sisterincrime the discussion meandered and they revealed nothing helpful in interviewing and interrogation its a wellknown rule that abstractions obscure memories while specifics trigger them dance now said do this for me pick a particular day tell me about it a day youd both remember neither could think of one that stood out though until dance suggested think of a holiday thanksgiving christmas linda shrugged how about that easter my first holiday there my only holiday sure that was fun linda described making an elaborate dinner with food that sam jimmy and rebecca had come up with dance spotted the euphemism instantly it meant the trio had stolen the groceries i cooked a turkey linda said i smoked it all day in the backyard my that was fun prodding dance asked so there you are you two and samanthashe was the quiet one you said the mouse and the young man who was with pell at the croytons kellogg said jimmy newberg tell us about him rebecca said right he was a funny little puppy he was a runaway too from up north i think goodlooking but he wasnt all there linda tapped her forehead a laugh from her comrade hed been a stoner but he was a genius with his hands carpentry electronics everything he was totally into computers even wrote his own programs hed tell us about them and none of us could understand what he was talking about he wanted to get some website goingremember this was before everybody had one i think he was actually pretty creative i felt bad for him daniel didnt like him that much hed lose patience with him he wanted to kick him out i think besides daniel was a ladies man he didnt do well with other men around dance steered them back to the holiday it was a pretty day linda continued the sun was out it was warm we had music going jimmyd put together a real good sound system did you say grace no even though it was easter rebecca said i suggested it but pell said no linda said thats right he got upset his father dance supposed we played some games in the yard frisbee badminton then i put dinner out rebecca said id boosted some good cabernet and we girls and jimmy had winepell didnt drink oh i got pretty wasted sam did too and we ate a lot linda gripped her belly dance continued to probe she was aware that winston kellogg had dropped out of the conversation he might be the cult expert but he was deferring to her expertise now she appreciated that linda said after dinner we just hung out and talked sam and i sang jimmy was tinkering with his computer daniel was reading something the recollections came more frequently now a chain reaction drinking talking a family holiday yeah you remember what you talked about oh just stuff you know linda fell silent then she said wait that reminds me of one thing you might want to know about she tilted her head slightly it was a recognition response though from the focus of her eyeson a nearby vase filled with artificial amaryllisthe thought was not fully formed dance said nothing you can often erase an elusive memory by asking someone about it directly the woman continued it wasnt easter it was another dinner but thinking about easter reminded me daniel and i were in the kitchen he was watching me cook and there was a big crash from next door the neighbors were fighting he said he couldnt wait to get out of seaside to his mountaintop mountaintop yeah kellogg asked his thats what he said did he own some property he never mentioned anything specific maybe he meant his in the sense that it was something he wanted to have someday rebecca knew nothing about it linda said i remember it clearly he wanted to get away from everybody just us just the family nobody else around i dont think he said anything about it before or after that but not utah you both said he never mentioned that no rebecca agreed but waityou know thinking of thati dont know if its helpful but i remember something too along those same lines we were in bed one night and he said i need to make a big score come up with enough money just to get away from everybody i remember that he said a big score what did he mean a robbery to buy some property could be linda she had to plead ignorance and seemed troubled that he hadnt shared everything with her dance asked the obvious question could the big score have been the croyton breakin i dont know rebecca said he never told us thats where he and jimmy were going that night dance speculated maybe he did steal something valuable from croytons house after all when the police were closing in he hid it she thought of the car hed driven to the breakin had it been searched thoroughly where was it now maybe destroyed maybe owned by someone else she made a note to try to find the vehicle also to check deeds registries to see if pell owned any property mountaintopcould that have been what hed been looking for online in capitola on the visualearth website dozen of sizable peaks were within an hours drive of the peninsula there were still questions but dance was pleased at their progress finally she felt she had some insights into the mind of daniel pell she was about to ask more questions when her phone rang excuse me she answered it kathryn its me she pressed the phone closer to her head tj whats up and steeled herself the fact that he hadnt called her boss meant he was about to deliver bad news chapter kathryn dance and winston kellogg walked along a road covered with a thin coat of damp sand toward tj and michael oneil who stood at the open trunk of a latemodel lexus another man was there too one of the officers from the coroners division which in monterey county is part of the mcso the balding round deputy greeted her kathryn dance introduced him to kellogg then peered into the trunk the victim a woman lay on her side her legs were bent and her hands and mouth were ducttaped her nose and face were bright red blood vessels had broken oneil said susan pemberton lived in monterey single thirty nine probable cod is suffocation the coroner officer added weve got capillary dilation and membrane inflammation and distension that residue there im sure its capsicum oleoresin he hit her with pepper spray and then ducttaped her the coroner officer nodded terrible oneil muttered dying alone in pain an ignominious trunk her coffin a burst of raw anger at daniel pell swept through dance it turned out oneil explained that susans was the disappearance hed been looking into were sure its pell its him the coroners division officer said prints match oneil added ive ordered field prints tests done for every homicide in the area any idea of the motive maybe she worked for an eventplanning company he apparently used her to get in and tell him where all the files were he stole everything crime scenes been through the office nothing conclusive so far except his prints any clue why kellogg asked nope howd he find her her boss said she left the office about five last night to meet a prospective client for drinks pell you think oneil shrugged no idea her boss didnt know who maybe pell saw them and followed next of kin nobody here doesnt look like the coroners division officer said her parentsre in denver ill make that call when i get back to the office tod last night maybe seven to nine ill know more after the autopsy pell had left little evidence behind except a few faint footsteps in the sand that seemed to lead toward the beach then were lost in the pale grass littering the dunes no other prints or tread marks were visible what was in the files hed stolen what didnt he want them to know kellogg was walking around the area getting a feel for the crime scene maybe considering it in light of his specialty cult mentality dance told oneil about rebeccas idea that pell was after a big score presumably so that he could buy an enclave somewhere mountaintop was what linda said and the big score mightve been the croyton breakin she added her idea that maybe pell had hidden something of croytons in the getaway car i think it was why he was searching visualearth to check the place out interesting theory oneil said he and dance would often brainstorm when they were working cases together theyd occasionally come up with some truly bizarre theories about the crimes they were investigating sometimes those theories actually turned out to be right dance told tj to check out the status of the vehicle pell had been driving on the night of the croyton murders and if thered been an inventory of the cars contents and see if pell owns property anywhere in the state will do boss dance looked around whyd he abandon the car here he couldve gone east into the woods and nobody wouldve found it for days its a lot more visible here michael oneil pointed at a narrow pier extending into the ocean the tbirds out of commission hes ditched the stolen ford focus by now maybe he got away by boat boat dance asked his footsteps go that way none head back to the road kellogg was nodding but slowly and the motion said i dont think so its a little rough dont you think to dock a boat there not for somebody who knows what theyre doing could you me sure depending on the wind a pause as winston kellogg looked over the scene rain started coming down steadily he didnt seem to notice my thinking is that he started that way for some reason maybe to lead us off but then he turned and headed back over the dunes to the road met his accomplice somewhere along here phrases like my thinking and im of the opinion that are what dance called verbal anesthetic their purpose is to take the sting out of a speakers critical or contrary statement the new kid on the block was reluctant to disagree with oneil but evidently felt that he was wrong about the boat why do you think that dance asked that old windmill at the turnoff where the beach road left the main highway was an abandoned gas station under a decorative twostory windmill how longs it been there forty fifty years id guess the pumps only have two windows for the pricelike no one ever believed gas would ever cost more than ninetynine cents kellogg continued pell knows the area his accomplices probably from out of town he picked this place because its deserted but also because theres a landmark you cant miss turn right at the windmill oneil wasnt swayed could be of course if that was the only reason youd wonder why he didnt pick someplace closer to town be easier to direct his accomplice to a place like that and there are plenty of deserted areas thatd work and think about it the lexus was stolen and had a body in the trunk hed definitely want to dump it as soon as possible maybe makes sense kellogg conceded he looked around squinting in the mist but im leaning toward something else i think he was drawn here not because of the pier but because its deserted and its a beach hes not a ritualistic killer but most cult leaders have a mystical bent and water often figures in that something happened here almost ceremonial id say it mightve involved that woman with him maybe sex after the kill or maybe something else what i cant say my guess is she met him here for whatever he had in mind but oneil pointed out theres no evidence of another car no evidence that he turned around and walked back to the road youd think thered be some prints kellogg said he couldve covered his tracks pointing to a portion of the sandcovered road those marks dont look natural he couldve swept over them with brush or leaves maybe even a broom id excavate that whole area oneil went on im thinking it cant hurt to check on stolen vessels and id rather crime scene ran the pier now the tennis volley continued the fbi agent offering with this wind and raini really think the road should be first you know win i think well go with the pier kellogg tipped his head meaning its your crime scene team im backing down fine with me ill search it myself if you dont mind sure go right ahead without a look at dancehe had no desire to test loyaltiesthe fbi agent returned to the area with the dubious markings dance turned and walked along a clean zone back to her car glad to leave the crime scene behind forensic evidence wasnt her expertise neither were strongwilled rams butting horns the visage of grief kathryn dance knew it well from her days as a journalist interviewing survivors of crimes and accidents and from her days as a jury consultant watching the faces of the witnesses and victims recounting injustices and personal injury mishaps from her own life too as a cop and as a widow looking in the mirror staring eyetoeye with a very different kathryn dance the lipstick hovering before easing away from the mask of a face why bother why bother now she was seeing the same look as she sat in susan pembertons office across from the dead womans boss eve brock its not real to me no it never is the crying was over but only temporarily dance sensed the stocky middleaged woman held herself in tight rein sitting forward legs tucked under the chair shoulders rigid jaw set the kinesics of grief matched the face i dont understand the computer and the files why i assume there was something he wanted to keep secret maybe he was at an event years ago and he didnt want anybody to know about it dances first question to the woman had been was the company in business before pell went to prison yes it was the crying began again one thing i want to know did he dance recognized a certain tone and answered the incomplete question there was no sexual assault she asked the woman about the client susan was going to meet but she knew no details would you excuse me for a moment eve brock was about to surrender to her tears of course eve headed for the ladies room dance looked at susan pembertons walls filled with photos of past events weddings bar and bat mitzvahs anniversary parties outings for local corporations banks and fraternal groups political fundraisers and high school and college events the company also worked with funeral homes to cater receptions after an interment she saw to her surprise the name of the mortician who had handled her husbands funeral eve brock returned her face red eyes puffy im sorry not a problem at all so she met that client after work yes would they go for drinks or coffee somewhere probably nearby usually alvarado the main street in downtown monterey or maybe del monte center fishermans wharf any favorite watering hole no wherever the client wanted to go excuse me dance found her phone and called rey carraneo agent dance he said where are you near marina still checking on stolen boats for detective oneil nothing yet and no luck on the motels either okay keep at it she disconnected and called tj where are you the emphasis tells me im the second choice but the answer is near downtown monterey good she gave him the address of eve brocks company and told him to meet her on the street in ten minutes shed give him a picture of susan pemberton and have him canvass all the bars and restaurants within walking distance as well as the shopping center and fishermans wharf cannery row too you love me best boss bars and restaurants my kind of assignment she also asked him to check with the phone company and find out about incoming calls to susans phones she didnt think the client was pell he was ballsy but he wouldnt come to downtown monterey in broad daylight but the prospective client might have valuable information about say where susan was going after their meeting dance got the numbers from eve and recited them to tj after they disconnected she asked what would be in the files that were stolen oh everything about our business clients hotels suppliers churches bakeries caterers restaurants liquor stores florists photographers corporate pr departments whod hired usjust everything the recitation seemed to exhaust her what had worried pell so much he had to destroy the files did you ever work for william croyton his family or his company foroh the man he killedno we never did maybe a subsidiary of his company or one of his suppliers i suppose we could have we do a lot of corporate functions do you have backups of the material some are in the archivestax records cancelled checks things like that probably copies of the invoices but a lot of things i dont bother with it never occurred to me that somebody would steal them the copies would be at my accountants hes in san jose could you get as many of them as possible theres so much her mind was stalled limit it to eight years ago up to may of ninetynine it was then that dances mind did another of its clicks could pell be interested in something that the woman was planning in the future all your upcoming jobs too ill do what i can sure the woman seemed crushed by the tragedy paralyzed thinking of morton nagles book the sleeping doll dance realized that she was looking at yet one more victim of daniel pell i see violent crime like dropping a stone into a pond the ripples of consequence can spread almost forever dance got a picture of susan to give to tj and walked downstairs to the street to meet him her phone rang oneils mobile on caller id hi she said glad to see the number i have to tell you something go ahead he spoke softly and dance took the news without a single affect display no revealed emotion ill be there as soon as i can its a blessing really juan millars mother told dance through her tears she was standing next to a grimfaced michael oneil in the corridor of monterey bay hospital watching the woman do her best to reassure them and deflect their own words of sympathy winston kellogg arrived and walked up to the family offered condolences then shook oneils hand fingers on the detectives biceps a gesture conveying sincerity among businessmen politicians and mourners im so sorry they were outside the burn unit of the icu through the window they could see the complicated bed and its surrounding spacecraft accoutrements wires valves gauges instrumentation in the center was a still mound covered by a green sheet the same color sheet had covered her husbands corpse dance recalled seeing it and thinking frantically but where did the life go where did it go at that moment shed come to loathe this particular shade of green dance stared at the body hearing in her memory edie dances whispered words he said kill me he said it twice then he closed his eyes millars father was inside the room itself asking the doctor questions whose answers he probably wasnt digesting still the role of parent whod survived his son required thisand would require much more in the days ahead the mother chatted away and told them again that the death was for the best there was no doubt the years of treatment the years of grafts for the best absolutely she said inadvertently offering charles overbys favorite adverbial crutch edie dance working an unplanned late shift now came down the hall looking distraught but determined a visage that her daughter recognized clearly sometimes feigned sometimes genuine the expression had served her well in the past today it would of course be a reflection of her true heart edie moved straight to millars mother she took the woman by the arm and recognizing approaching hysteria bestowed words on hera few questions about her own state of mind but mostly about her husbands and other childrens all aimed at diverting the womans focus from this impossible tragedy edie dance was a genius in the art of compassion it was why she was such a popular nurse rosa millar began to calm and then cried and dance could see the staggering horror melting into manageable grief her husband joined them and edie handed his wife over to him like a trapeze artist transferring one acrobat to another in midair mrs millar dance said id just like to then found herself flying sideways barking a scream hands not dropping to her weapon but rising to keep her head from slamming into one of the carts parked here her first thought how had daniel pell gotten into the hospital no oneil shouted or kellogg probably both dance caught herself as she went down on one knee knocking coils of yellow tubing and plastic cups to the floor the doctor too leapt forward but it was winston kellogg who got the enraged julio millar in a restraint hold arm bent backward and held him down easily by a twisted wrist the maneuver was fast and effortless no son the father shouted and the mother cried harder oneil helped dance up no injuries other than what would be bruises come morning she guessed julio tried to break away but kellogg apparently much stronger than he appeared tugged the arm up slightly take it easy dont hurt yourself just take it easy bitch you fucking bitch you killed him you killed my brother oneil said julio listen your parents are upset enough dont make it worse worse how could it be worse he tried to kick out kellogg simply sidestepped him and lifted the wrist higher the young man grimaced and groaned relax it wont hurt if you relax the fbi agent looked at the parents their hopeless eyes im sorry julio his father said you hurt her shes a policewoman theyll put you in jail they should put her in jail shes the killer millar senior shouted no stop it your mother think about your mother stop it smoothly oneil had his cuffs out he was hesitating he glanced at kellogg the men were debating julio seemed to be relaxing okay okay get off me oneil said well have to cuff you if you cant control yourself understand yeah yeah i understand kellogg let go and helped him up everyones eyes were on dance but she wasnt going to take the matter to the magistrate its all right theres no problem julio stared into dances eyes oh theres a problem theres a big problem he stormed off im sorry rosa millar said through her tears dance reassured her does he live at home no an apartment nearby have him stay with you tonight tell him you need his help for the funeral to take care of juans affairs whatever you can think of hes in as much pain as everybody he just doesnt know what to do with it the mother had moved to the gurney where her son lay she muttered something edie dance walked up to her again and whispered into her ear touching her arm an intimate gesture between women whod been complete strangers until a couple of days ago after a moment edie returned to her daughter you want the kids to spend the night thanks its probably best dance said goodbye to the millars and added is there anything we can do anything at all the father answered in a voice that seemed perplexed by the question no no then he added softly what else is there to be done chapter the town of vallejo springs in napa california has several claims to fame its the site of a museum featuring many works of eduard muybridge the nineteenthcentury photographer credited with inventing moving pictures anda lot more interesting than his arthe was a man who murdered his wifes lover admitted it in court and got off scotfree another draw is the local vineyards which produce a particularly fine strain of the merlot grapeone of the three most famous used to make red wine contrary to a bad rap generated by a movie of a few years ago merlot isnt your yugo of grapes just look at pétrus a wine from the pomerol section of bordeaux made almost entirely from merlot and perhaps the most consistently expensive wine in the world morton nagle was now crossing the town limits because of vallejo springss third attraction albeit one that was known to very few people theresa croyton the sleeping doll and her aunt and uncle lived here nagle had done his homework a month of tracking down twisty leads had turned up a reporter in sonoma whod given him the name of a lawyer whod done some legal work for the girls aunt hed been reluctant to give nagle any information but did offer the opinion that the woman was overbearing and obnoxiousand cheap shed dunned him on a bill once he was convinced that nagle was a legitimate writer he gave up the town the family lived in and their new name on a guarantee of anonymity confidential source is really just a synonym for spineless nagle had been to vallejo springs several times meeting with the sleeping dolls aunt in an attempt to get an interview with the girl the uncle didnt figure much in the equation nagle had learned she was reluctant but he believed that she would eventually agree now back in this picturesque town he parked near the spacious house waiting for the opportunity to talk to the woman alone he could call of course but nagle felt that phone callslike emailwere a very ineffective way of communicating on a telephone people youre speaking to are your equals you have much less control and power of persuasion than if you see them in person they can also just hang up he had to be careful hed noticed the police cruising past the house of the bollings the surname the family had adopted at frequent intervals this in itself meant nothingvallejo springs was a rich town and had a large wellendowed constabularybut nagle noticed that the squad cars seemed to slow when they drove by he noticed too that there were far more police cars out and about now than last week which suggested to him what he already suspected that theresa was a town sweetheart the cops would be on high alert to make sure nothing happened to her if nagle overstepped theyd escort him to the town line and dump him in the dust like an unwelcome gunslinger in some bad western he sat back eyes on the front door and thought about opening lines for his book carmelbythesea is a village of contradictions a mecca for tourists the jewel in the crown of the central coast yet beneath the pristine and the cute youll find the secretive world of the rich and ruthless from san francisco silicon valley and hollywood hm work on that nagle chuckled and then he saw the suv a white escalade pulling out of the bollings driveway the girls aunt mary was behind the wheel alone in the car good hed never get close if theresa was with her nagle started his car a buick worth the price of the suvs transmission alone and followed theresas aunt made a stop at a gas station filled the tank with premium she chatted with a woman at a nearby pump driving a red jaguar stype the aunt seemed harried her gray hair wasnt brushed and she looked tired even from the edge of the parking lot nagle could make out dark circles under her eyes pulling out of shell she drove through the quaint unmistakably californian downtown a street adorned with plants and flowers and quirky sculptures and lined with coffee shops understated restaurants a garden center an independent bookstore a yoga place and small retail operations selling wine crystals pet supplies and ll beanstyle clothing a few hundred yards along the road was the strip mall where the locals shopped anchored by an albertsons grocery and a rite aid drugstore mary bolling parked in the lot and walked inside the grocery store nagle parked near her suv he stretched longing for a cigarette though he hadnt smoked in twenty years he continued the endless debate with himself so far he hadnt transgressed hadnt broken any rules he could still head home no moral harm done but should he he wasnt sure morton nagle believed he had a purpose in life which was to expose evil it was an important mission one he felt passionate about a noble mission but the goal was to reveal evil and let people make their own judgments not to fight it himself because once you crossed the line and your purpose became seeking justice not illuminating it there were risks unlike the police he didnt have the constitution telling him what he could and couldnt do which meant there was a potential for abuse by asking theresa croyton to help find a killer he was exposing her and her familyhimself and his tooto very real dangers daniel pell obviously had no problem killing youngsters it was so much better to write about human beings and their conflicts than to make judgments about those conflicts let the readers decide what was good or bad and act accordingly on the other hand was it right for him to sit back and let pell continue his slaughter when he could do more the time for his slippery debate ended though mary bolling was walking out of albertsons wheeling a cart filled with groceries yes or no morton nagle hesitated only a few seconds then pulled open the door stepped out and hitched up his pants he strode forward excuse me hi mrs bolling its me she paused blinked and stared at him what are you doing here i i havent agreed to let you talk to theresa i know i knowthats not how dare you show up here like this youre stalking us her cell phone was in her hand please nagle said feeling a sudden desperation to sway her this is something different im here doing a favor for someone we can talk about the book later a favor i drove up from monterey to ask you something i wanted to see you in person what are you talking about you know about daniel pell of course i know she said this as if he were the village idiot theres a policewoman whod like to talk to your niece she thinks maybe theresa can help her find pell what dont worry theres no risk she no risk are you mad you couldve led him here no hes somewhere in monterey did you tell them where we are no no this policewomanll meet her wherever you like here anywhere she just wants to ask theresa no one is going to talk to her no one is going to see her the woman leaned forward there will be very serious consequences if you dont leave immediately mrs bolling daniel pell has killed i watch the fucking news tell that policewoman whoever she is that theres not a single thing theresa can tell her and you can forget about ever talking to her for your goddamn book no wait please mary bolling turned and ran back to the escalade as her abandoned shopping cart ambled in the opposite direction down the shallow incline by the time a breathless nagle had grabbed the cart just before it slammed into a mini cooper the aunts suv was spinning tires as it vanished from the lot not long ago a cbi agent now former had once called this the gals wing he was referring to that portion of the monterey headquarters that happened to be the home of two female investigative agentsdance and connie ramirezas well as maryellen kresbach and the nononsense office manager grace yuan the unfortunate utterer was a fiftyish agent one of those fixtures in offices all over the world who wake up counting the days to retirement and whove done so since their twenties hed had his share of collars at the highway patrol some years back but his move to the cbi had been a mistake he wasnt up to the challenges of the job he also apparently lacked any sense of survival and this is the gals wing hed said loud enough for everyone to hear during a lunchhour tour of hq with a young woman he was wooing dance and connie ramirez made eye contact that night they went on a pantyhosebuying mission and when the poor agent came to work the next day he found his entire office spiderwebbed in mesh fishnet and glittery synthetic leg wear some personal hygiene products also figured in the decor he ran whining to thencbi head stan fishburne who bless him could hardly keep a straight face during the inquisition what do you mean you only said gals wing bart you actually said that he threatened a complaint to sacramento but he didnt last long enough in the cbi to see the matter through ironically after the offenders departure the population of that portion of the office adopted the moniker instantly and the hallway was now known to everyone in the cbi as gw whose undecorated hallway kathryn dance was walking down at the moment maryellen hi oh kathryn im sorry to hear about juan were all going to make a donation you know where his parents would like it to go michaelll let us know your mother called shes going to stop by with the kids later if thats okay dance made sure to see her children whenever she could even during business hours if a case was taking up a lot of time and shed be working late good hows the davey situation its taken care of said the woman firmly the person in question was maryellens son wess age whod been having trouble in school because of some issues with what amounted to a preteen gang maryellen now relayed the news of the resolution with a look of happy malice which told dance that extreme measures had been used to get the offenders transferred or otherwise neutralized dance believed that maryellen kresbach would make a great cop in her office she dropped her jacket onto a chair hitched the awkward glock to the side and sat she looked through her email only one was relevant to the pell case his brother richard pell was replying from london officer dance i received your forwarded email from the us embassy here yes i heard of the escape it has made the news here i have not had any contact with my brother for years when he came to visit my wife and me in bakersfield at the same time my wifes twentythreeyearold sister was visiting us from new york one saturday we got a call from the police that shed been detained at a jewelry store downtown for shoplifting the girl had been an honors student in college and quite involved in her church shed never been in any trouble in her life before that it seemed that shed been hanging out with my brother and hed talked her into stealing a few things i searched his room and found close to worth of merchandise my sisterinlaw was given probation and my wife nearly left me as a result i never had anything to do with him again after the murders in carmel in i decided to move my family to europe if i hear from him i will certainly let you know though that is unlikely the best way to describe my relationship now is this ive contacted the london metropolitan police and they have an officer guarding my house so much for that lead her mobile rang the caller was morton nagle in an alarmed voice he asked he killed someone else i just saw the news im afraid so she gave him the details and juan millar died the officer who was burned im so sorry are there other developments not really dance told him that shed spoken with rebecca and linda theyd shared some information that might prove to be helpful but nothing was leading directly to pells doorstep nagle had come across nothing in his research about a big score or a mountaintop he had news of his own efforts though they werent successful hed talked to theresa croytons aunt but she was refusing to let him or the police see the girl she threatened me his voice was troubled and dance was sure that there would be no sparkle in his eyes at the moment where are you he didnt say anything dance filled in youre not going to tell me are you im afraid i cant she glanced at the caller id but he was on his mobile not a hotel or pay phone is she going to change her mind i really doubt it you shouldve seen her she abandoned a hundred dollars worth of groceries and just ran dance was disappointed daniel pell was a mystery and she was now obsessed with learning everything she could about him last year when shed assisted on that case in new york with lincoln rhyme shed noted the criminalists obsessive fascination with every detail of the physical evidence she was exactly the samethough with the human side of crime but therere compulsions like doublechecking every detail of a subjects story and there are compulsions like avoiding sidewalk cracks when youre walking home you have to know which are vital and which arent she decided theyd have to let the sleeping doll lead go i appreciate your help i did try really after hanging up dance talked to rey carraneo again still no luck on the motels and no reports of boats stolen from local marinas just as she hung up tj called hed heard back from the dmv the car that pell had been driving during the croyton murders hadnt been registered for years which meant itd probably been sold for scrap if he had stolen something valuable from the croytons the night of the murders it was most likely lost or melted into oblivion tj had also checked the inventory from when the car was impounded the list was short and nothing suggested that any of the items had come from the businessmans house she gave him the news about juan millar too and the young agent responded with utter silence a sign that he was truly shaken a few moments later her phone rang again it was michael oneil with his ubiquitous hey its me his voice was laden with exhaustion sorrow too millars death was weighing on him heavily whateverd been on the pier where we found the pemberton woman was goneif there was anything i just talked to rey he tells me therere no reports of any stolen craft so far maybe i was off base your friend find anything the other waytoward the road she noted the loaded term friend and replied he hasnt called i assume he didnt stumble across pells address book or a hotel key and negative on sources for the duct tape and the pepper sprays sold in ten thousand stores and mailorder outlets she told oneil that nagles attempt to contact theresa had failed she wont cooperate her aunt wont and shes first base i dont know how helpful itd be anyway oneil said i liked the idea shes the only nexus to pell and that night well have to try harder without her dance said howre you doing fine he answered stoic a few minutes after they disconnected winston kellogg arrived and dance asked him any luck at the pemberton crime scene the road nope the scene itselfwe searched for an hour no tread marks no discarded evidence maybe michael was right pell did get away by boat from that pier dance laughed to herself the chestbumping males had each just conceded the other mightve been rightthough she doubted theyd ever admit it to each other she updated him on the missing files from susan pembertons office and nagles failure to arrange an interview with theresa croyton tj she explained was looking for the client susan had met with just before pell had killed her dance glanced at her watch got an important meeting want to come is it about pell nope its about snack time chapter as they walked down the halls of cbi dance asked kellogg where he lived the districtthats washington dc to you all or that little place known as inside the beltway if you watch the pundits on sundaymorning talk tv grew up in the northwestseattlebut didnt really mind the move east im not a rainyday kind of guy the talk meandered to personal lives and he volunteered that he and his ex had no children though he himself had come from a big family his parents were still alive and lived on the east coast ive got four brothers i was the youngest i think my parents ran out of names and started on consumer products so im winston like cigarettes which is a really bad idea when your last name is cornflakes if my parents had been any more sadistic my middle named be oldsmobile dance laughed im convinced i didnt get invited to the junior prom because nobody wanted to take a dance to the dance kellogg received a degree in psych from the university of washington then went into the army cid she was thinking about her late husbands stint in the army where hed been a criminal investigations division officer no tactical planning which meant paper paper paper well computer computer computer i was fidgety i wanted to get into the field so i left and joined the seattle police department made detective and did profiling and negotiations but i found the cult mentality interesting so i thought id specialize in that i know it sounds lame but i just didnt like the idea of bullies preying on vulnerable people she didnt think it was lame at all down more corridors howd you get into this line he asked dance gave him a brief version of the story shed been a crime reporter for a few yearsshed met her husband while covering a criminal trial he gave her an exclusive interview in exchange for a date after she grew tired of reporting she went back to school and got degrees in psychology and communications improving her natural gift of observation and an ability to intuit what people were thinking and feeling she became a jury consultant but nagging dissatisfaction with that job and a sense that her talents would be more worthwhile in law enforcement had led her to the cbi and your husband was like me a feebie been doing your homework her late husband william swenson had been a dependable career special agent for the fbi but he was just like tens of thousands of others there was no reason for a specialist like kellogg to have heard of him unless hed gone to some trouble to check a bashful grin i like to know where im going on assignments and who im going to meet when i get there hope youre not offended not at all when i interview a subject i like to know everything about his terrarium not sharing with kellogg that shed had tj scope out the agent through his friend in the chico resident agency a moment passed and he asked can i ask what happened to your husband line of duty the thud in her belly generated by that question had become less pronounced over the years it was a traffic accident im sorry thank you now welcome to chez cbi dance waved him into the lunchroom they poured coffee and sat at one of the cheap tables her cell chirped it was tj bad news my barhopping days are over just as i got started i found out where the pemberton woman was before she was killed and with some latino guy in the bar at the doubletree a business meeting some event he wanted her to handle the waiter thinks they left about six thirty you get a creditcard receipt yep but she paid business expense hey boss i think we should start doing that anything else about him zip her picturell be on the news so he might see it and come forward susans phone logs about forty calls yesterday ill check them out when im back in the office oh and statewide real estate tax records nope pell dont own no mountaintops or anything else i checked utah too nothing there either good i forgot about that or oregon nevada arizona i wasnt being diligent i was just trying to prolong my bar time as much as i could after they hung up she relayed the information to kellogg who grimaced a witness hm wholl see her picture on the tube and decide this is a real nice time to take that vacation to alaska and i can hardly blame him then the fbi agent smiled as he looked over dances shoulder she glanced back her mother and children were walking into the lunchroom hi honey she said to maggie then hugged her son thered be a day pretty soon when public hugs would be verboten and she was storing up for the drought he tolerated the gesture well enough today edie dance and her daughter cast glances each others way acknowledging millars death but not specifically referring to the tragedy edie and kellogg greeted each other and exchanged a similar look mom carly moved mr bledsoes wastebasket maggie told her breathlessly and every time he threw something out it went on the floor did you keep from giggling for a while but then brendon did and we couldnt stop say hello to agent kellogg maggie did but wes only nodded his eyes shifted away dance saw the aversion immediately you guys want hot chocolate she asked yay maggie cried wes said he would too dance patted her jacket pockets coffee was gratis but anything fancier took cash and shed left all of hers in her purse in her office edie had no change ill treat kellogg said digging into his pocket wes said quickly mom i want coffee instead the boy had sipped coffee once or twice in his life and hated it maggie said i want coffee too no coffee its hot chocolate or soda dance supposed that wes didnt want something that the fbi agent paid for what was going on here then she remembered how his eyes had scanned kellogg on the deck the other night she thought hed been looking for his weapon now she understood hed been sizing up the man mom had brought to his grandfathers party was winston kellogg the new brian in his eyes okay her daughter said chocolate wes muttered thats okay i dont want anything come on ill loan it to your mom kellogg said dispensing the coins the children took them wes reluctantly and only after his sister did thanks wes said thank you very much maggie offered edie poured coffee they sat at the unsteady table kellogg thanked dances mother again for the dinner the previous night and asked about stuart then he turned to the children and wondered aloud if they liked to fish maggie said sort of she didnt wes loved to but responded not really you know its boring dance knew the agent had no motive but breaking the ice his question probably inspired by his conversation with her father at the party about fishing in monterey bay she noted some stress reactionshe was trying too hard to make a good impression she guessed wes fell silent and sipped his chocolate while maggie inundated the adults with the mornings events at music camp including a rerun in detail of the trash can caper the agent found herself irritated that the problem with wes had reared its head yet againand for no good reason she wasnt even dating kellogg but dance knew the tricks of parenting and in a few minutes had wes talking enthusiastically about his tennis match that morning kelloggs posture changed once or twice and the body language told dance that he too was a tennis player and wanted to contribute but hed caught on that wes was ambivalent about him and he smiled as he listened but didnt add anything finally dance told them she needed to get back to work shed walk them out kellogg told her he was going to check in with the san francisco field office good seeing you all he waved edie and maggie said goodbye to him after a moment wes did tooonly so he wouldnt be outdone by his sister dance sensed the agent wandered off up the hallway toward his temporary office are you coming to grandmas for dinner maggie asked im going to try mags never promise if theres a chance you cant deliver but if she cant edie said whatre you in the mood for pizza maggie said fast with garlic bread and mint chocolate chip for dessert and i want a pair of ferragamos dance said whatre those shoes but what we want and what we get are sometimes two different things her mother put another offer on the table hows a big salad with blackened shrimp sure wes said thatll be great the children were infinitely polite with their grandparents but i think garlic bread can be arranged edie added which finally pried a smile from him outside the cbi office one of the administrative clerks was on his way to deliver documents to the monterey county sheriffs office in salinas he noticed a dark car pulling into the lot the driver a young woman wearing sunglasses despite the fog scanned the parking lot shes uneasy about something the clerk thought but of course you got that a lot here people whod come in voluntarily as suspects or reluctant complaining witnesses the woman looked at herself in the mirror pulled on a cap and climbed out she didnt go to the front door instead she approached him excuse me yes maam this is the california bureau of investigation if shed looked at the building she wouldve seen the large sign that repeated four of the words in her question but being a good public servant he said thats right can i help you is this the office where agent dance works kathryn dance yes is she in now i dont the clerk looked across the lot and barked a laugh well guess what miss thats her right over there the younger woman he saw dance with her mother and the two kids whom the clerk had met on a couple of occasions okay thank you officer the clerk didnt correct her he liked being misidentified as a real law enforcer he got into his car and pulled out of the driveway he happened to glance in the rearview mirror and saw the woman standing just where hed left her she seemed troubled he couldve told her she didnt need to be kathryn dance in his opinion was one of the nicest people in the whole of the cbi dance closed the door of her mothers prius hybrid it hummed out of the lot and the agent waved goodbye she watched the silver car negotiate the winding road toward highway she was troubled she kept imagining juan millars voice in her head kill me the poor man although his brothers lashing out had nothing to do with it kathryn dance did feel guilty that shed picked him to go check on what was happening in the lockup he was the most logical one but she wondered if being younger hed been more careless than a more experienced officer mightve been it was impossible to think that michael oneil or big albert stemple or dance herself would have let pell get the upper hand turning back toward the building she was thinking of the first few moments of the fire and the escape theyd had to move so quickly but should she have waited thought out her strategy better secondguessing it went with the territory of being a cop returning to the building humming julieta venegass music the notes were swirling through her thoughts intoxicatingand taking her away from juan millars terrible wounds and terrible words and susan pembertons deathand her sons eyes flipping from cheerful to stony the moment the boy had seen dance with winston kellogg what to do about that dance continued through the deserted parking lot toward the front door of cbi glad that the rain had stopped she was nearing the stairs when she heard a scrape of footstep on the asphalt and turned quickly to see that a woman had come up behind her silently until now she was a mere six or so feet away walking directly toward her dance stopped fast the woman did too she shifted her weight agent dancei neither spoke for a moment then samantha mccoy said ive changed my mind i want to help chapter i couldnt sleep after you came to see me and when i heard hed killed someone else that woman i knew i had to come samantha dance and kellogg were in her office the woman sat upright gripping the arms of the chair hard looking from one to the other never more than a seconds gaze at either youre sure it was daniel who killed her thats right kellogg said why we dont know were looking into it now her name was susan pemberton she worked for eve brock do the names mean anything to you no its an eventplanning company pell took all their files and presumably destroyed them there was something in them that he wanted to hide or maybe theres an event coming up that hes interested in do you have any thoughts about what that might be im sorry no dance told her i want to get you together with linda and rebecca as soon as possible theyre both here thats right samantha nodded slowly kellogg said i need to follow up on a few things here ill join you later dance told maryellen kresbach where shed be and the women left the cbi building the agent had samantha park her car in the secure garage under the building so no one would see it they then both got into dances ford samantha clicked on her seat belt and then stared straight ahead suddenly she blurted one thing my husband his familymy friends they still dont know what did you tell him about being away a publishing conferenceand linda and rebecca id just as soon they didnt know my new name about my family thats fine with me i havent given them any details they didnt already know now you ready a shaky smile no im not the least ready but okay lets go when they arrived at the inn dance checked with the mcso deputy outside and learned thered been no unusual activity in or around the cabin she gestured samantha out of the car the woman hesitated and climbed from the vehicle squinting taking in everything around her shed be vigilant of course under the circumstances but dance sensed something else behind this attentiveness samantha gave a faint smile the smells the sound of the oceani havent been back to the peninsula since the trial my husband keeps asking me to drive down for the weekend ive come up with some doozy excuses allergies carsickness pressing manuscripts to edit her smile faded she glanced at the cabin pretty its only got two bedrooms i wasnt expecting you if theres a couch i can sleep on that i dont want to bother anybody samantha the unassuming one the shy one dance recalled mouse i hope itll just be for one night kathryn dance stepped forward and knocked on the door to the past the toyota smelled of cigarette smoke which daniel pell hated he himself never smoked though hed bartered cigarettes like a floor broker on a stock exchange when he was inside the q or capitola he wouldve let the kids in the family smokedependency in someone else is exploitable of coursebut he loathed the smell reminded him of growing up his father sitting in his big armchair reading the bible jotting notes for sermons nobody would ever hear and chainsmoking his mother nearby smoking and drinking his brother not smoking or doing much else but hauling young daniel out from where he was hiding his closet the tree house the basement bathroom im not doing all the fucking work myself though his brother ended up not doing any of the work he just handed daniel a scrub bucket or toilet brush or dishrag and went to hang with his friends hed return to the house occasionally to pound on his brother if the house wasnt spicandspan or sometimes even if it was cleanliness son is next to godliness theres truth in that now polish the ashtrays i want them to sparkle so he and jennie were now driving with the windows down the scent of pine and cold salty air swirling into the car jennie did that rubbynose thing like she was trying to massage the bump out and was quiet she was content now not purring but back on track his distance last night after shed balked at helping him kill susan pemberton on the beach had worked just fine theyd returned to the sea view and shed done the only thing she could to try to win back his loveand spent two strenuous hours proving it hed withheld at first been sullen and she tried even harder she even was starting to enjoy the pain it reminded him of the time the family had stopped at carmel mission years ago hed learned about the monks whod beat themselves bloody getting a high in the name of god but that reminded daniel pell of his chunky father looking at him blankly over the bible through a cloud of camel cigarette smoke so he pushed the memory away last night after the sex hed grown warmer to her but later hed stepped outside and pretended to make a phone call just to keep her on edge when hed returned she hadnt asked about the call pell had returned to the material hed gotten from susan pembertons office and went online once more this morning hed told her he had to go see someone let that sit watched her insecurities roll uptaps on the lumpy nose a halfdozen sweetheartsand then finally hed said id like it if you came along really a thirsty dog lapping up water yep but i dont know it might be too hard for you no i want to please well see shed pulled him back to bed and theyd continued their balanceofpower game he let himself be tugged temporarily back into her camp now though as they drove he had no interest in her body whatsoever he was firmly back in control you understand about yesterday at the beach i was in a funny mood i get that way when something precious to me is endangered this was a bit of an apologywho can resist thatalong with the reminder that it might happen again thats one thing i love about you sweetie not sweetheart now good when pell had had the family tucked away all cozy in the town of seaside hed used a lot of techniques for controlling the girls and jimmy hed give them common goals hed dispense rewards evenly hed give them tasks but withhold the reason for doing them hed keep them in suspense until they were nearly eaten alive by uncertainty andthe best way to cement loyalty and avoid dissensionhed create a common enemy he now said to her we have another problem lovely oh thats where were going now rubadub on the nose it was a wonderful barometer thats right i told you honey i dont care about the money you dont have to pay me back this doesnt have anything to do with that its more important much more im not asking you to do what i did last night im not asking you to hurt anybody but i need some help and i hope you will carefully playing with the emphasis shed be thinking of the fake phone call last night whod he been talking to somebody else he could call on to step in whatever i can do sure they passed a pretty brunette late teens on the sidewalk pell noted immediately her posture and visagethe determined walk the angry downcast face the unbrushed hairwhich suggested shed fled after an argument perhaps from her parents perhaps her boyfriend so wonderfully vulnerable a days work and daniel pell could have her on the road with him the pied piper but of course now wasnt the time and he left her behind feeling the frustration of a hunter unable to stop by the roadside and take a perfect buck in a field nearby still he wasnt upset thered be plenty of other young people like her in his future besides feeling the gun and knife in his waistband pell knew that in just a short period of time his hunt lust would be satisfied chapter standing in the open doorway of the cabin at point lobos inn rebecca sheffield said to dance welcome back weve been gossiping and spending your money on room service she nodded toward a bottle of jordan cabernet which only she was drinking rebecca glanced at samantha and not recognizing her said hello probably thinking she was another officer involved in the case the women walked inside dance shut and doublelocked the door samantha looked from one woman to the other it seemed as if shed lost her voice and for a moment dance believed shed turn and flee rebecca did a double take and blinked wait oh my god linda didnt get it her brows furrowed rebecca said dont you recognize her what do you wait its you sam hello the slim woman was racked with uneasiness she couldnt hold a gaze for more than a few seconds your face linda said youre so different my samantha shrugged blushing uhhuh prettier and youve got some meat on your bones finally you were a scrawny little thing rebecca walked forward and firmly hugged samantha then hands on her shoulders she leaned back great jobwhatd they do implants on my jaw and cheeks lips and eyes mostly nose of course and then she glanced at her round chest a faint smile but id wanted to do that for years linda crying said i cant believe it another hug whats your new name not looking at either of them she said id rather not say and listen both of you please you cant tell anybody about me if they catch daniel and you want to talk to reporters please dont mention me no problem with that your husband doesnt know linda asked glancing at samanthas engagement and wedding rings a shake of the head howd you pull that one off rebecca asked samantha swallowed i lie thats how dance knew that married couples lie to each other with some frequency though less often than romantic partners who arent married but most lies are trivial very few involve something as fundamental as samanthas thats gotta be a pain rebecca said need a good memory i dont have any choice samantha added dance recognized the kinesic attributes of defensiveness body parts folding stature shrinking crossings aversions she was a volcano of stress rebecca said but he has to know you did time yes then how i told him it was a whitecollar thing i helped my boss embezzle some stocks because his wife needed an operation he believed that samantha gave a timid look to rebecca hes a good man but hed walk out the door if he knew the truth that i was in a cult it wasnt a cult linda said quickly whatever it was daniel pell was involved thats reason enough to leave me and i wouldnt blame him rebecca asked what about your parents do they know anything my mothers dead and my fathers as involved in my life as he always was which is not at all but im sorry id rather not talk about all this sure sam rebecca said the agent now returned to the specifics of the case first she gave them the details of the pemberton killing the theft of the companys files are you sure he did it linda asked yes the prints are his she closed her eyes and muttered a prayer rebeccas face tightened angrily neither of them had ever heard the name pemberton nor of the brock company they couldnt recall any events pell mightve gone to that had been catered wasnt a blacktie kind of life back then rebecca said dance now asked samantha about pells accomplice but like the others she had no idea who the woman might be nor did she recall any references to charles pickering in redding dance told them about the email from richard pell and asked if theyd ever had any contact with him who rebecca asked dance explained an older brother linda interrupted no scotty was younger and he died a year before i met daniel he had a brother rebecca asked he said he was an only child dance told them the story about the crimes pell had committed with his brothers sisterinlaw linda shook her head no no youre wrong his brothers name was scott and he was mentally disabled thats one of the reasons we connected so well my cousins got cerebral palsy rebecca said and he told me he was an only child like me a laugh he was lying to get our sympathy whatd he tell you sam she was reluctant to answer then she said richard was older he and daniel didnt get along at all richard was a bully their mother was drunk all the time and she never cleaned up so his father insisted the boys do it but richard would force daniel to do all the work he beat him up if he didnt he told you the truth linda asked stiffly well he just mentioned it the mouse scores rebecca laughed linda said he told me he didnt want anybody else in the family to know about his brother he only trusted me and i wasnt supposed to mention he was an only child rebecca said lindas face was troubled we all tell fibs sometimes ill bet the incident with the sisterinlawwhat his brother told you aboutdidnt happen at all or it wasnt so bad and his brother used it as an excuse to cut things off rebecca was clearly not convinced of this dance supposed that pell had identified both linda and rebecca as more of a threat to him than samantha linda was the mother of the family and would have some authority rebecca was clearly brash and outspoken but samanthahe could control her much better and knew she could be trusted with the truthwell some truth dance was glad shed decided to come help them she noticed that samantha was looking at the coffeepot like some im a little tired havent had much sleep lately welcome to the club rebecca said samantha half rose but dance waved her down milk sugar oh dont go to any trouble really the agent noticed that linda and rebecca shared a faint smile at samanthas habitual timidity mouse thanks milk dance continued linda mentioned pell might have wanted to move to the country somewhere a mountaintop do you have any idea what he was talking about well daniel told me a bunch of times he wanted to get out to the country move the family there it was real important to him to get away from everybody he didnt like neighbors didnt like the government he wanted space for more people he wanted the family to grow he did rebecca asked linda said nothing about this did he ever mention utah no where could he have had in mind he didnt say but it sounded like hed been doing some serious thinking about it recalling that hed possibly used a boat to escape from the pemberton crime scene dance had an idea she asked did he ever mention an island samantha laughed an island no way why not hes terrified of the water hes not getting into anything that floats linda blinked i didnt know that rebecca didnt either a wry smile of course not hed only share his fears with his mouse daniel said the oceans somebody elses world people have no business being there you shouldnt be in a place that you cant be master of same thing with flying he didnt trust pilots or airplanes we were thinking he escaped from the murder scene by boat impossible youre sure positive dance excused herself for a moment called rey carraneo and had him call off the search for stolen boats she hung up reflecting that oneils theory was wrong and kelloggs was right now id like to think about his motives for staying here what about money she mentioned rebeccas comment about a big scorea robbery or breakin a big heist i was thinking he might be here because he hid money or something valuable somewhere or has unfinished business something to do with the croyton murders money samantha shook her head no i dont really think thats it rebecca said firmly i know he said it oh no im not saying he didnt the mouse added quickly just he might not have meant big in the sense wed use he didnt like to commit crimes thatd be too visible we broke into houses well hardly any linda corrected rebecca sighed wellwe pretty much did linda and you folksd been busy before i joined you it was exaggerated samantha said nothing to support either woman and seemed uneasy as if afraid theyd call on her again to be the tiebreaker she continued he said if somebody did anything too illegal the press would cover the story and then the police got after you in a big way we stayed away from banks and checkcashing offices too much security too risky she shrugged anyway all the stealingit was never about the money it wasnt dance asked no we couldve made as much doing legitimate jobs but thats not what turned daniel on what he liked was getting people to do things they didnt want to that was his high linda said you make it sound like thats all we did i didnt mean it like that we werent a gang of thugs rebecca ignored linda i think he was definitely into making money samantha smiled uncertainly well i just had this sense it was more about manipulating people he didnt need a lot of money he didnt want it hed have to pay for his mountaintop somehow rebecca pointed out thats true i guess i could be wrong dance sensed this was an important key to understanding pell so she asked them about their criminal activities hoping it might spark some specific memories samantha said he was good daniel was even knowing what we were doing was wrong i couldnt help but admire him hed know the best places to go for pickpocketing or breaking into houses how security worked in department stores what designer labels had security tags and which didnt what kind of clerk would take returns without receipts linda said everybody makes him out to be this terrible criminal but it was really just a game to him like wed have disguises remember wigs different clothes fake glasses it was all harmless fun dance was inclined to believe samanthas theory that sending the family out on their missions was more about power than money but what about the charles manson connection oh samantha said there was no manson connection dance was surprised but all the press said so well you know the press samantha was typically reluctant to disagree but she was clearly certain about this he thought manson was an example of what not to do but linda shook her head no no he had all those books and articles about him dance recalled that shed gotten a longer prison sentence because shed destroyed some of the incriminating material about manson the night of the croyton murders she seemed troubled now that her heroic act might have been pointless the only parallels were that he lived with several women and had us doing crimes for him manson wasnt in control of himself daniel said he claimed he was jesus he tattooed a swastika on his forehead he thought he had psychic powers he ranted about politics and race that was another example of emotions controlling you just like tattoos and body piercings or weird haircuts they give people information about you and information is control no he thought manson did everything wrong daniels heroes were hitler hitler dance asked her yep except he faulted him because of that jewish thing it was a weakness pell said that if hitler could suck it up and live with jews even include them in the government hed have been the most powerful man in history but he couldnt control himself so he deserved to lose the war he admired rasputin too the russian monk right he worked his way into nicholas and alexandras household pell liked rasputins use of sex to control people drawing a laugh from rebecca and a blush from linda svengali too the trilby book dance asked oh samantha said you know about that he loved that story linda read it a dozen times and frankly rebecca said it was pretty bad glancing at her notebook the agent asked the newcomer about the keywords pell had searched in prison nimue samantha repeated no but he had a girlfriend named alison once who linda asked when he was in san francisco before the family she was in this group sort of like the family whatre you talking about linda asked samantha nodded she looked uneasily at linda but it wasnt his group he just was bumming around and met alison and got to know some of the people in that cult or whatever it was daniel wasnt a memberhe didnt take orders from anybodybut he was fascinated with it and hung out with them he learned a lot about how to control people but they got suspicious of himhe wouldnt really commit so he and alison left they hitchhiked around the state then he got arrested or picked up by the police for something and she went back to san francisco he tried to find her but he never could i dont know why hed want to try now what was her last name i dont know dance wondered aloud if pell was looking for this alisonor someone named nimuefor revenge after all hed need a pretty good reason to risk going online in capitola to find somebody oh samantha said daniel didnt believe in revenge rebecca said i dont know sam what about that biker that punk up the street daniel almost killed him dance remembered nagle telling them about a neighbor in seaside whom pell had assaulted first of all linda said daniel didnt do it that was somebody else well no he beat the crap out of him nearly killed him but the police let him go curious proof of innocence dance reflected only because the guy didnt have the balls to press charges rebecca looked at samantha was it our boy samantha shrugged avoiding their gaze i think so i mean yeah daniel beat him up linda looked unconvinced but that wasnt about revengesee the biker thought he was some kind of neighborhood godfather he tried to blackmail daniel threatened to go to the police about something that never even happened daniel went to see him and started playing these mind games with him but the biker just laughed at him and told daniel he had one day to come up with the money next thing theres an ambulance in front of the bikers house his wrists and ankles were broken but that wasnt revenge it was because he was immune to daniel if youre immune then daniel cant control you and that makes you a threat and he said all the time threats have to be eliminated control dance said that pretty much sums up daniel pell doesnt it this it seemed was one premise from their past that all three members of the family could agree on chapter from the patrol car the mcso deputy kept his vigilant eye on his turf the grounds the trees the gardens the road guard dutyit had to be the most boring part of being a police officer hands down stakeouts came in a close second but at least then you had a pretty good idea that the surveillee was a bad guy and that meant you might get a chance to draw your weapon and go knock heads youd get to do something but babysitting witnesses and good guysespecially when the bad guys dont even know where the good ones arewas borrrrring all that happened was you got a sore back and sore feet and had to balance the issue of coffee with bathroom breaks and oh hell the deputy muttered to himself wished he hadnt thought that now he realized he had to pee could he risk the bushes not a good idea considering how nice this place was hed ask to use one inside first hed make a fast circuit just to be sure everything was secure then go knock on the door he climbed out of the car and walked down the main road looking around at the trees the bushes still nothing odd typical of what youd see around here a limo driving past slowly the driver actually wearing one of those caps like they did in the movies a housewife across the street was having her gardener arrange flowers beneath her mailbox before he planted them the poor guy frustrated at her indecision the woman looked up and saw the deputy nodded his way he nodded back flashing on a wispy fantasy of her coming over and saying how much she liked a man in a uniform the deputy had heard stories of cops making a traffic stop and the women paying the fine behind a row of trees near the highway or in the backs of squad cars the seats of harleydavidsons figured in some versions as well but those were always iknowsomebodywhoknowssomebody stories itd never happened to any of his friends he suspected too that if anybodyeven this desperate housewifeproposed a romp he couldnt even get it up which put him in mind of the geography below the belt again and how much he needed to relieve himself then he noticed the housewife was waving to him and approaching he stopped is everything okay around here officer yes maam ever noncommittal are you here about that car she asked car she gestured up there about ten minutes ago i saw it park but the driver he sort of pulled up in between some trees i thought it was a little funny parking that way you know weve had a few breakins around here lately alarmed now the deputy stepped closer to where she was indicating through the bushes he saw a glint of chrome or glass the only reason to drive a car that far off the road was to hide it pell he thought reaching for his gun he took a step up the street wsssssh he glanced back at the odd sound just as the shovel swung by the housewifes gardener slammed into his shoulder and neck connecting with a dull ring a grunt the deputy dropped to his knees his vision filled with a dull yellow light black explosions going off in front of him please no he begged but the response was simply another blow of the shovel this one better aimed dressed in his dirtstained gardener outfit daniel pell dragged the cop into the bushes where he couldnt be seen the man wasnt dead just groggy and hurting quickly he stripped off the deputys uniform and put it on rolled up the cuffs of the toolong slacks he ducttaped the officers mouth and cuffed him with his own bracelets he slipped the cops gun and extra clips into his pocket then placed the glock hed brought with him in the holster he was familiar with that weapon and had dryfired it often enough to be comfortable with the trigger pull glancing behind him he saw jennie retrieving the flowers from the patch of dirt around the neighbors mailbox and dumping them into a shopping bag shed done a good job in her role as housewife shed distracted the cop perfectly and shed hardly flinched when pell had smacked the poor bastard with the shovel the lesson of murdering susan pemberton had paid off shed moved closer to the darkness within her but hed still have to be careful now killing the deputy would be over the top still she was coming along nicely pell was ecstatic nothing made him happier than transforming someone into a creature of his own making get the car lovely he handed her the gardener outfit a smile blossoming full ill have it ready she turned and hurried up the street with the clothes shopping bag and shovel she glanced back mouthing i love you pell watched her enjoying the confident stride then he turned away and walked slowly up the driveway that led to the house of the man whod committed an unforgivable sin against him a sin that would spell the mans death former prosecutor james reynolds daniel pell peered through a crack in the curtain of a front window he saw reynolds on a cordless phone holding a bottle of wine walking from one room to another a womanhis wife pell guessedwalked into what seemed to be the kitchen she was laughing pell had thought itd be easy to find almost anybody nowadays computers the internet google hed discovered some information about kathryn dance which would be useful but james reynolds was invisible no phone listing no tax records no addresses in any of the old state and county directories or bar association lists he would eventually have found the prosecutor through public records pell supposed but could hardly browse through the very county government building hed just escaped from besides he had little time he needed to finish his business in monterey and leave but then hed had his brainstorm and turned to the archives of local newspapers on the internet hed found a listing in the peninsula times about the prosecutors daughters wedding hed called the venue where the event was held the del monte spa and resort and found the name of the wedding planner the brock company a bit of coffeeand pepper spraywith susan pemberton had earned pell the files that contained the name and address of the man whod paid for the fete james reynolds and now here he was more motion inside a man in his late twenties was also in the house maybe a sonthe brother of the bride hed have to kill them all of course and anyone else inside he didnt care one way or the other about hurting the family but he couldnt leave anyone alive their deaths were simply a practical matter to give pell and jennie more time to get away at gunpoint hed force them into a closed spacea bathroom or denthen use the knife so no one would hear shots with some luck the bodies wouldnt be found until after hed finished his other mission here on the peninsula and would be long gone pell now saw the prosecutor hang up his phone and start to turn pell ducked back checked his pistol and pressed the doorbell there was the rustle of noise from inside a shadow filled the peephole pell stood where he could be seen in his uniform though he was looking down casually yes who is it mr reynolds its officer ramos who im the relief deputy sir id like to talk to you just a second ive got something on the stove pell gripped his pistol feeling that a huge irritation was about to be relieved he suddenly felt aroused he couldnt wait to get jennie back to the sea view maybe they wouldnt make it all the way to the motel hed take her in the backseat pell now stepped back into the shadows of a large tangled tree beside the door enjoying the feel of the heavy gun in his hand a minute passed then another he knocked again mr reynolds pell dont move a voice shouted it was coming from outside behind him drop the weapon the voice was reynoldss im armed no what had happened pell shivered with anger he nearly vomited he was so shaken and upset listen to me pell if you move one inch i will shoot you take the weapon in your left hand by the barrel and set it down now what sir what are you talking about no no hed planned this so perfectly he was breathless with rage he gave a brief glance behind him there was reynolds holding a large revolver in both hands he knew what he was doing and didnt seem the least bit nervous wait wait prosecutor reynolds my names hector ramos im the relief he heard the click as the hammer on reynoldss gun cocked okay i dont know what this is about but okay jesus pell took the barrel in his left hand and crouched lowering it to the deck when with a screech the black toyota skidded into the driveway and braked to a stop the horn blaring pell dropped flat to his belly swept up the gun and began firing in reynoldss direction the prosecutor crouched and fired several shots himself but panicked missed pell then heard the distant keening of sirens torn between selfpreservation and his raw lust to kill the man he hesitated a second but survival won out he sprinted down the driveway toward jennie who had opened the passenger door for him he tumbled inside and they sped away pell finding some bleak satisfaction in emptying his weapon toward the house hoping for at least one mortal hit chapter dance kellogg and james reynolds stood in his dewy front lawn amid pristine landscaping lit by the pulse of colored lights the prosecutors first concern he explained was that no one had been hit by his or pells slugs hed fired in defensive paniche was still shakenand even before the car had skidded away he was troubled that a bullet might have injured a neighbor hed run to the street to look at the cars tags but the vehicle was gone by then so he jogged to the houses nearby no one had been injured by a stray shot though the deputy in the bushes outside the house would have some bad bruises a concussion and very sore muscles but nothing more serious than that the medics reported when the doorbell rang and officer ramos announced his presence at the front door reynolds had actually been on the phone with kathryn dance who was telling him urgently that pell possibly disguised as a latino knew where he lived and was planning to kill him the prosecutor had drawn his weapon and sent his wife and son into the basement to call reynolds had slipped out a side door and come up behind the man hed been seconds away from shooting to kill only the girlfriends intervention had saved pell the prosecutor now stepped away to see how his wife was doing then returned a moment later pell took all this risk just for revenge i sure called that one wrong no james it wasnt revenge without mentioning her namereporters were already starting to show updance explained about samantha mccoys insights into pells psychology and told him about the incident in seaside where the biker had laughed at him you did the same thing in court when he tried to control you remember that meant you were immune to him and even worse you controlled himyou turned him into manson into somebody else somebody he had no respect for he was your puppet pell couldnt allow that you were too much of a danger to him thats not revenge no it was about his future plans dance said he knew you wouldnt be intimidated and that you had some insights and information about himmaybe even something in the case notes and he knew that you were the sort who wouldnt rest until he was recaptured even if you were retired she remembered the prosecutors determined visage in his house whatever i can do you wouldnt be afraid to help us track him down that made you a threat and like he said threats have to be eliminated what do you mean by the future whats he got in mind thats the big question we just dont know but how the hell did you manage to call two minutes before he showed up dance shrugged susan pemberton the woman killed yesterday she worked for eve brock his eyes flashed in recognition the caterer i mean the eventplanner who handled julias wedding he found me through her brilliant at first i thought pell used susan to get into the office and destroy some evidence or to get information about an upcoming event i kept picturing her office all the photos on the walls some were of local politicians some were of weddings then i remembered seeing the pictures of your daughters wedding in your living room the connection clicked i called eve brock and she told me that yes youd been a client howd you know about the latino disguise she explained that susan had been seen in the company of a slim latino man not long before shed been killed linda had told them about pells use of disguises becoming latino seemed a bit farfetchedbut apparently it wasnt she nodded at a cluster of bullet holes in the prosecutors front wall finished with their canvassing tj and rey carraneo arrived to report that thered been no sightings of the killers new wheels michael oneil too joined them hed been with the crime scene officers as theyd worked the street and the front yard oneil nodded politely toward kellogg as if the recent disagreements were long forgotten crime scene oneil reported hadnt discovered much at all theyd found shell casings from a mm pistol some useless tire prints they were so worn the technicians couldnt id the brand and about a million samples of trace thatll lead us nowhere the latter information was delivered with the sour hyperbole oneil slung out when frustrated and he added the guard gave only a groggy and inarticulate description of his attacker and the girl with him but he couldnt add anything to what they already knew reynolds called his daughter since pell now knew her and her husbands names and told her to leave town until the killer was recaptured reynoldss wife and other son would join them but the prosecutor refused to leave he was going to stay in the areathough at a separate hotel under police guarduntil hed had a chance to review the croyton murders files which would arrive from the county court archives soon he was more determined than ever to help them get pell most of the officers lefttwo stayed to guard reynolds and his family and two were keeping the reporters backand soon kellogg oneil and dance were alone standing on the fragrant grass im going back to point lobos dance said to both of the men then to kellogg you want me to drop you off at hq for your car ill go with you to the inn kellogg said if thats okay sure what about you michael want to come with us she could see that millars death was still weighing heavily on him the chief deputy glanced at kellogg and dance standing side by side like a couple in front of their suburban house saying goodnight to guests after a dinner party he said think ill pass ill make a statement to the press then stop by to see juans family he exhaled sending a stream of breath into the cool night been a long day he was exhausted and his round belly contained pretty much an entire bottle of vallejo springss smooth merlot wine there was no way morton nagle was going to drive home tonight through a tangle of combat traffic in contra costa county then the equally daunting roads around san jose hed found a motel not far from the vineyards hed moped around in all day and checked in he washed his face and hands ordered a club sandwich from room service and uncorked the wine waiting for the food to arrive he called his wife and spoke to her and the children then got through to kathryn dance she told him that pell had tried to kill the prosecutor in the croyton trial reynolds no everybodys all right dance said but he got away you think maybe that was his goal why he was staying in the area the agent explained she didnt think so she believed hed intended to kill reynolds as a prelude to his real plan because he was frightened of the prosecutor but what that real plan might be continued to elude them dance sounded tired discouraged apparently he did too morton dance asked are you all right im just wondering how bad my headachell be tomorrow morning she gave a sour laugh room service knocked on the door he said goodbye and hung up the phone nagle ate the meal without much appetite and channel surfed seeing virtually nothing that flickered by on the screen the large man lay back in bed kicking off his shoes as he sipped from the plastic glass of wine he was thinking of a color photo of daniel pell in time magazine years ago the killers head was turned partially away but the unearthly blue eyes stared straight into the camera they seemed to follow you wherever you were and you couldnt shake the thought that even if you closed the magazine pell would continue to stare into your soul nagle was angry that hed failed in his attempt to get the aunts agreement that the trip here had been a waste of time but then he told himself that at least hed stayed true to his journalists ethics and protected his sourcesand protected the girl hed been as persuasive as he could with the aunt but hadnt stepped over the moral boundary and told kathryn dance the girls new name and location no nagle realized hed done everything right in a difficult situation growing drowsy he found he was feeling better hed go home tomorrow back to his wife and children hed do the best he could with the book without theresa hed heard from rebecca sheffield and she was game to go aheadshed been making a lot of notes on life in the familyand wanted to sit down with him when he returned she was sure she could convince linda whitfield to be interviewed as well and there were certainly no lack of victims of daniel pell to write about finally drunk and more or less content morton nagle drifted off to sleep chapter they sat around the tv leaning forward watching the news like three reunited sisters which in a way they were thought samantha mccoy can you believe that rebecca asked in a low angry voice linda who with sam was cleaning up the remnants of a roomservice dinner shook her head in dismay james reynolds the prosecutor had been the target of daniel pell sam was very disturbed by the assault she remembered reynolds well a stern but reasonable man hed negotiated what her lawyer had said were fair plea bargains sam in fact had thought he was quite lenient there was no evidence that theyd had any involvement in the croyton deathssam like the others was stunned and horrified at the news still the familys record of petty crimes was extensive and if hed wanted to james reynolds could have gone to trial and probably gotten much longer sentences from a jury but he was sympathetic to what theyd been through he realized theyd fallen under the spell of daniel pell he called it the stockholm syndrome which sam had looked up it was an emotional connection that victims develop with their hostage takers or kidnappers sam was happy to accept reynoldss leniency but she wasnt going to let herself off the hook by blaming her actions on some psychological excuse every single day she felt bad about the thefts and letting pell run her life she hadnt been kidnapped shed lived with the family voluntarily a picture came on the tv an artists rendering of pell with darker skin moustache and black hair glasses and a vague latino look his disguise thats way bizarre rebecca offered the knock on the door startled them kathryn dances voice announced her arrival linda rose to let her in samantha liked hera cop with a great smile who wore an ipod like her gun and had shoes with bold daisies embossed on the straps shed like a pair of shoes like that sam rarely bought fun or frivolous things for herself sometimes shed windowshop and think neat id like one of those but then her conscience tweaked and she decided no i dont deserve it winston kellogg too was smiling but his was different from dances it seemed like his badge something to be flashed saying im really not what you think im a federal agent but im human too he was appealing kellogg wasnt really handsome certainly not in a classic way he had a bit of double chin was a little round in the middle but his manner and voice and eyes made him sexy glancing at the tv screen dance asked you heard linda said im so happy hes all right his family was there too theyre all fine on the news they mentioned a deputy was hurt rebecca asked kellogg said hell be all right he went on to explain how pell and his partner had planned the mans murder killing the other woman susan pemberton yesterday solely to find out where reynolds lived sam thought of what had struck her years ago the obsessed unstoppable mind of daniel pell dance said well i wanted to thank you the information you gave us saved his life us linda asked yep she explained how the observations theyd offered earlierparticularly about pells reaction to being laughed at and about disguiseshad let her deduce what the killer might be up to rebecca was shaking her head her expressive lips tight she said but he did get away from you i noticed sam was embarrassed at rebeccas abrasive comment it always amazed her how people wouldnt hesitate to criticize or insult even when there was no purpose to it he did dance said looking the taller woman in the eyes we didnt get there in time the newscaster said reynolds tried to capture him himself rebecca said thats right kellogg said so maybe hes the reason pell got away dance held her eye easily sam was so envious of that ability her husband would often say hey whats the matter look at me it seemed that her eighteenmonthold son was the only person in the world she could look in the eye dance said to rebecca possibly but pell was at the front door with a gun james didnt really have any choice rebecca shrugged still one of him all of you come on linda snapped theyre doing the best they can you know daniel he thinks out everything hes impossible to get ahead of the fbi agent said no youre right rebecca we have to work harder were on the defensive but we will get him i promise samantha noticed kellogg glance at kathryn dance and sam thought damn hes sweet on her the phrase from one of the hundreds of oldtime books shed spent her summers reading as a girl as for the policewoman hm could be sam couldnt tell but she didnt waste much time thinking about the romantic life of two people shed known for one day they were part of a world she wanted to leave behind as fast as possible rebecca relented well if we got you that close last time maybe well get you there five minutes earlier the next dance nodded thank you for that and everything we really appreciate it now a couple of things just to reassure you ive added another deputy outside theres no reason to believe that pell has any clue youre here but i thought it couldnt hurt wont say no to that rebecca said the agent glanced at the clock it was im proposing we call it quits for tonight if you think of anything else about pell or the case and want to talk about it i can be here in twenty minutes otherwise well reconvene in the morning youve got to be exhausted samantha said reunions have a way of doing that parking in the back of the sea view jennie shut off the toyotas engine daniel pell didnt get out he felt numb and everything seemed surreal the lights ghostly auras in the fog the slowmotion sound of the waves piling up on asilomar beach an alternate world out of some weird movie the cons would watch in capitola and talk about for months afterward all because of the bizarre incident at the prosecutors house are you all right sweetie he said nothing i dont like it that youre unhappy she rested a hand on his leg im sorry things didnt work out for you he was thinking of that instant eight years ago at the croyton trial when he had turned his blue eyes blue like ice on prosecutor james reynolds to intimidate to make him lose his concentration but reynolds had glanced his way and snickered then turned to the jury with a wink and a sour joke and they had laughed too all his efforts were wasted the spell was broken pell had been convinced that he could will his way to an acquittal to make the jury believe that jimmy newberg was the killer that pell was a victim too all hed done was act in selfdefense reynolds laughing like pell was some kid making faces at adults calling him the son of manson controlling me that had been the unforgivable sin not prosecuting pellno many people had done that but controlling him jerking him about like a puppet to be laughed at and not long after that the jury foreman had read the verdict he saw his precious mountaintop vanishing his freedom his independence the family all gone his whole life destroyed by a laugh and now reynoldsa threat to pell as serious as kathryn dancewould go underground be far more difficult to find he shivered in rage you okay baby now still feeling like he was in a different dimension pell told jennie the story about reynolds in court and the danger he representeda story no one knew and funny she didnt seem to think it was so odd thats terrible my motherd do that laugh at me in front of other people and shed hit me too i think the laughing was worse a lot worse he was actually moved by her sympathy hey lovelyyou held fast tonight she smiled and made fistsas if displaying the tattooed letters hold fast im proud of you come on lets go inside but jennie didnt move her smile slipped away i was thinking about something what how did he figure it out who the man tonight reynolds saw me i suppose recognized me no i dont think so it sounded like the sirens were coming you know before you knocked on the door they were i think so kathryn eyes as green as mine are blue short pink nails red rubber band around her braid pearl on her finger and a polished shell at her throat holes in her lobes but no earrings he could picture her perfectly he could almost feel her body next to him the balloon within him began to expand well theres this policewoman shes a problem tell me about her pell kissed jennie and slipped his hand down her bony spine past the strap of her bra and kept going into the waistband of her slacks felt the lace not here inside ill tell you about her inside chapter ive had enough of that linda whitfield said nodding toward the tv where news stories about pell kept looping over and over samantha agreed linda walked into the kitchen and made decaf coffee and tea then brought out the cups and milk and sugar along with some cookies rebecca took the coffee but set it down and continued to sip her wine sam said that was nice what you said at dinner linda had said grace apparently improvised but articulate samantha herself wasnt religious but she was touched by lindas words intended for the souls of the people daniel pell had killed and their families as well as gratitude for the chance to reunite with her sisters and a plea for a peaceful resolution of this sad situation even rebeccathe steel magnolia among themhad seemed moved when she was young sam often wished her parents would take her to church many of her friends went with their families and it seemed like something parents and a daughter could do together but then shed have been happy if theyd taken her to grocery shop or for a drive to the airport to watch the planes take off and land while they ate hot dogs from a catering truck parked near the fence like ellie and tim schwimmer from next door did with their folks samantha id love to go with you but you know how important the meeting is the issue isnt just about walnut creek it could affect all of contra costa you can make a sacrifice too the worlds not all about you dear but enough of that sam commanded herself during dinner the conversation had been superficial politics the weather what they thought of kathryn dance now rebecca whod had plenty of wine tried to draw linda out some find out what had happened in prison to make her so religious but the woman might have sensed as did sam that there was something challenging about the questions and deflected them rebecca had been the most independent of the three and was still the most blunt linda did though explain about her daytoday life she ran the churchs neighborhood center which sam deduced was a soup kitchen and helped with her brother and sisterinlaws foster children it was clear from the conversationnot to mention her shabby clothingthat linda was struggling financially still she claimed she had a rich life in the spiritual sense of the word a phrase shed repeated several times you dont talk to your parents at all sam asked no linda said softly my brother does every once in a while but i dont sam couldnt tell whether the words were defiant or wistful sam recalled that lindas father had tried to run for some election following lindas arrest and been defeatedafter the opposing candidate ran ads implying that if lyman whitfield couldnt maintain law and order in his family hed hardly be a good public servant the woman added that she was dating a man from her church nice was how she described him he works at macys linda didnt go into specifics and samantha wondered if she was actually dating him or they were merely friends rebecca was much more forthcoming about her life womens initiatives was doing well with a staff of four fulltime employees and she lived in a condo overlooking the water as for her romantic life she described her latest boyfriend a landscape designer almost fifteen years older but handsome and pretty well off rebecca had always wanted to get married but as she talked about their future sam deduced there were stumbling blocks and guessed that his divorce wasnt final if the papers had even been filed rebecca mentioned other recent boyfriends too which made sam a bit envious after prison shed changed her identity and moved to san francisco where she hoped she could get lost in the anonymity of a big city shed avoided socializing for fear shed let slip some fact about her real identity or that somebody might recognize her despite the surgery finally the loneliness caught up and she started to go out her third date ron starkey was a stanford electrical engineer grad he was sweet and shy and a bit insecurea classic nerd he wasnt particularly interested in her past in fact he seemed oblivious to just about everything except avionics navigation equipment movies restaurants and now their son not the sort of personality most women would go for but samantha decided it was right for her six months later they were married and peter was born a year after that sam was content ron was a good father a solid man she only wished shed met him a few years later after shed lived and experienced a bit more of life she felt that meeting daniel pell had resulted in a huge hole in her life one that could never be filled both linda and rebecca tried to get sam to talk about herself she demurred she didnt want anyone least of all these women to have any possible clues as to her life as sarah starkey if word got out ron would leave her she knew it hed broken up with her for a few months when shed tearfully confessed about the fake embezzlement hed walk right out the doorand take their child with him she knewif he learned shed been involved with daniel pell and been lying to him about it for years linda offered the plate of cookies again no no samantha said im full i havent eaten that much for dinner in a month linda sat nearby ate half a cookie oh sam before you got here we were telling kathryn about that easter dinner our last one together remember that remember it it was fantastic it had been a wonderful day sam recalled theyd sat outside around a driftwood table she and jimmy newberg had made piles of food great music from jimmys complicated stereo sprouting wires everywhere theyd dyed easter eggs filling the house with the smell of hot vinegar sam tinted all of hers blue like daniels eyes the family wouldnt survive long after that six weeks later the croyton family and jimmy would be dead the rest of them in jail but that had been a good day that turkey sam said shaking her head at the memory you smoked it right linda nodded about eight hours in that smoker daniel made for me the what rebecca asked that smoker out back the one he made i remember but he didnt make it linda laughed yes he did i told him id always wanted one my parents had one and my fatherd smoke hams and chickens and ducks i wanted to help but they wouldnt let me so daniel made me one rebecca was confused no nohe got it from whatshername up the street up the street linda frowned youre wrong he borrowed some tools and made it out of an old oil drum he surprised me with it wait it wasrachel yeah that was her name remember her not a good lookgray roots with bright red hair rebecca looked perplexed you have to remember her i remember rachel lindas response was stiff whats she got to do with anything rachel was a stoner whod caused serious disharmony within the family because pell had spent a lot of time at her house doing well what daniel pell loved to do most sam hadnt caredanything to avoid pells unpleasantries in the bedroom was fine with her but linda had been jealous their last christmas together rachel had stopped by the familys house on some pretense when daniel was away linda had thrown the woman out of the house pell had heard about it and promised he wouldnt see her anymore he got the smoker from her said rebecca whod arrived after the yuletide blowout and knew nothing about the jealousy no he didnt he made it for my birthday sam foresaw disaster looming she said quickly well whatever you made a real nice turkey i think we had sandwiches for two weeks they both ignored her rebecca sipped more of the wine linda he gave it to you on your birthday because he was with her that morning and she gave it to him some surfer dude made it for her but she didnt cook he was with her linda whispered on my birthday pell had told linda he hadnt seen rachel since the incident at christmas lindas birthday was in april yeah and like three times a week or so you mean you didnt know it doesnt matter sam said it was a long shut up linda snapped she turned to rebecca youre wrong what youre surprised daniel lied to you rebecca was laughing he told you he had a retarded brother and he told me he didnt have a brother lets ask the authority sam was daniel seeing rachel that spring i dont know wrong answeryes you do rebecca announced oh come on sam said what difference does it make lets play who knows daniel best did he say anything to you about it he told everything to his mouse we dont need to answer the question i dont have any idea rebecca come on let it go did he yes in fact he had but sam said i dont remember bullshit why would he lie to me linda growled because you told him that mommy and daddy didnt let you play at the cookout that gave him something to work with and he used it and he didnt just buy you one he claimed he made it what a fucking saint youre the one whos lying why because daniel never made anything for you oh please are we back in high school rebecca looked linda over oh i get it you were jealous of me thats why you were so pissed off then thats why youre pissed off now this was true too sam reflected after rebecca joined the family daniel had spent far less time with the other women sam could handle itanything as long as he was happy and didnt want to kick her out of the family but linda in the role of mother was stung that rebecca seemed to supplant her linda denied it now i was not how could anybody afford to be jealous living in that situation one man and three women living together how because were human thats how hell you were jealous of rachel that was different she was a slut she wasnt one of us she wasnt part of the family sam said look were not here about us were here to help the police rebecca scoffed how could we not be here about us the first time weve been together after eight years what you think wed just show up write a topten listthings i remember about daniel pelland go home of course thiss about us as much as him angry too linda gazed at sam and you dont have to defend me a contemptuous nod toward rebecca shes not worth it she wasnt there from the beginning like we were she wasnt a part of it and she took over turning to rebecca i was with him for more than a year you a few months daniel asked me i didnt force my way in we were going along fine and then you show up going along fine rebecca set down her wineglass and sat forward are you hearing what youre saying rebecca please sam said her heart was pounding she thought shed cry as she looked at the two redfaced women facing each other across a coffee table of varnished yellowing logs dont the lean woman ignored her linda ive been listening to you since i got here defending him saying it wasnt so bad we didnt steal all that much maybe daniel didnt kill soandsowell thats bullshit get real yes the family was sick totally sick dont say that its not true goddamn it it is true and daniel pells a monster think about it think about what he did to us rebeccas eyes were glowing jaw trembling he looked at you and saw somebody whose parents never gave her an inch of freedom so what does he do he tells you what a fine independent person you are how youre being stifled and puts you in charge of the house he makes you mommy he gives you power which you never had before and he hooks you in with that tears dotted lindas eyes it wasnt like that youre right it was worse because then look at what happened the family breaks up we go to jail and where do you end up right back where you started with a domineering male figure againonly this time daddys god if you thought you couldnt say no to your real father think about your new one dont say that sam began shes rebecca turned on her and you just like the old days linda and i go at it and you play little miss united nations dont want anybody upset dont want anybody making waves why is it because you care about us dear or is it because youre terrified well selfdestruct and youll be even more alone than you already are you dont have to be like that sam muttered oh i think i do lets take a look at your story mouse your parents didnt know you existed go do whatever you want sammy mommy and daddyre too busy with greenpeace or the national organization for women or walking for the cure to tuck you in at night and what does daniel do for you hes suddenly the involved parent you never had he looks out for you tells you what to do when to brush your teeth when to repaint the kitchen when to get on all fours in bedand you think it means he loves you so guess what youre hooked too and now youre back to square one just like linda you didnt exist to your parents and now you dont exist to anyone because youre not samantha mccoy you became somebody else stop it sam was crying hard now the harsh words born from a harsh truth stung deeply there were things she could say toorebeccas selfishness her bluntness bordering on crueltybut she held back it was impossible for her to be harsh even in selfdefense mouse but linda didnt have sams reticence and what gives you the right to talk you were just some tramp pretending to be this bohemian artist lindas voice shook with anger tears streaming down her face sure we had some problems sam and me but we cared for each other you were just a whore and here you are judging us you werent any better rebecca sat back her face still sam could almost see the anger bleeding away she looked down at the table said in a soft voice youre right linda youre absolutely right im no better at all i fell for it too he did the same thing to me you the woman snapped you didnt have any connection with daniel you were just there to fuck exactly she said with a sad smile on her face one of the saddest that samantha mccoy had ever seen sam asked what do you mean rebecca more wine how do you think he got me hooked another sip of wine i never told you that i hadnt slept with anybody for three years before i met him you funny huh sexy me the femme fatale of the central coast the truth was a lot different what did daniel pell do for me he made me feel good about my body he taught me that sex was good it wasnt dirty she set down the wineglass it wasnt something that happened when my father got home from work oh sam whispered linda said nothing downing the last of the wine two or three times a week middle and high schoolyou want to hear what my graduation present was rebeccaim so sorry sam said you never said anything you mentioned that day in the van when we met speaking to linda whose face was unmoved yeah we were there for three hours you thought we were fucking but all we did was talk he was comforting me because i was so freaked out just like so many other timesbeing with a man who wanted me and me wanting him only i couldnt go there i couldnt let him touch me a sexy packagewith no passion inside but daniel he knew exactly what to say to make me feel comfortable and now look at meim thirtythree and ive dated four different men this year and you know i cant remember the name of the second one oh and guess whatevery one of them was at least fifteen years older than me no im not any better than you guys and everything i said to you i mean it twice for myself but come on linda look at him for who he is and what he did to us daniel pells the worst thing you can possibly imagine yes it was all that badsorry im drunk and thiss brought up more crap than i was prepared to deal with linda said nothing sam could see the conflict in her face after a moment she said im sorry for your misfortune ill pray for you now please excuse me im going to bed clutching her bible she went off to the bedroom that didnt go over very well rebecca said sorry mouse she leaned back eyes closed sighing funny about trying to escape the past its like a dog on a tether no matter how much he runs he just cant get away chapter dance and kellogg were in her office at cbi headquarters where theyd briefed overby working late for a change on the events at reynoldss houseand learned from tj and carraneo that there were no new developments the hour was just after pm she put her computer on standby okay thats it she said im calling it a night im with you there as they walked down the dim hallway kellogg said i was thinking they really are a family back there at the lodge right the three of them theyre not related they dont even like each other particularly but they are a family he said this in a tone suggesting that he defined the word from the perspective of its absence the interaction of the three women which shed noted clinically and found revealing even amusing had touched kellogg in some way she didnt know him well enough either to deduce why or to ask she noted his shoulders lift very slightly and two fingernails of his left hand flicked together evidence of general stress you going to pick up the children he asked no theyll stay at their grandparents tonight theyre great they really are and you never thought about having kids not really his voice faded we were both working i was on the road a lot you know professional couples in interrogation and kinesic analysis the content of speech is usually secondary to the tonethe verbal qualitywith which the words are delivered dance had heard many people tell her theyd never had children and the resonance of the words explained whether that fact was inconsequential a comfortable choice a lingering sorrow shed sensed something significant in kelloggs statement she noted more indications of stress little bursts of body language maybe a physical problem on his part or his wifes maybe it had been a big issue between them the source of their breakup wes has his doubts about me ah hes just sensitive about mom meeting other men hell have to get used to it someday wont he oh sure but just now got it kellogg said though he seemed to be comfortable when youre with michael oh thats different michaels a friend and hes married hes no threat aware of what shed just said dance added quickly its just youre the new kid in town he doesnt know you there was a faint hesitation before kellogg answered sure i can see that dance glanced at him to find the source of the pause his face gave nothing away dont take wess reaction personally another pause maybe its a compliment his face remained neutral after this exploratory venture too they walked outside the air was so crisp it would signal impending autumn in any other region dances fingers were quivering from the chill but she liked the sensation it felt she decided like ice numbing an injury the mist coalesced into rain ill drive you to yours she said kelloggs car was parked behind the building they both got in and she drove to his rental neither of them moved for a minute she put the transmission in park she closed her eyes stretched and pressed her head back against the rest it felt good she opened her eyes and saw him turning toward her and leaving one hand on the dash touched the shoulder closest to himboth firmly yet somehow tentatively he was waiting for some signal she gave him none but looked into his eyes and remained silent both of which of course were signals in themselves in any case he didnt hesitate any longer but leaned forward and kissed her aiming straight for her lips she tasted mint hed subtly dropped a tic tac or altoid when she wasnt looking slick she thought laughing to herself shed done the same with brian that day on the beach in front of the sea otter and seal audience kellogg now backed off slightly regrouping and waiting for intelligence about the first skirmish this gave dance a moment to figure how she was going to handle it she made a decision and when he eased in again met him halfway her mouth opened she kissed back fervently she slipped her arms up to his shoulders which were as muscular as shed thought theyd be his beard stubble troubled her cheek his hand slipped behind her neck pulling her harder into him she felt that uncurling within her heart stepping up its pace mindful of the bandaged wound she pressed her nose and lips against the flesh beneath his ear the place where with her husband shed rested her face when theyd made love she liked the smooth plane of skin there the smell of shave cream and soap the pulse of blood then kelloggs hand detached itself from her neck and found her chin easing her face to him again their whole mouths participated now and their breathing came fast she felt his fingers moving tentatively to her shoulder locating the satin strap and using it as a road map beginning to move down outside her blouse slowly ready to divert at the least sign of reluctance her response was to kiss him harder her arm was near his lap and she could feel his erection flirting with her elbow he shifted away perhaps so he wouldnt seem too eager too forward too much of a teenager but kathryn dance pulled him closer as she reclinedkinesically an agreeable submissive position images of her husband came to mind once or twice but she observed them from a distance she was completely with winston kellogg at this moment then his hand reached the tiny metal hoop where the strap transitioned to the white victorias secret cup and he stopped the hand retreated though the evidence near her elbow was undiminished the kisses became less frequent like a merrygoround slowing after the powers shut off but this seemed to her exactly right theyd arrived at the highest pinnacle they could under the circumstanceswhich included the manhunt for a killer the short time theyd known each other and the terrible deaths that had recently occurred i think he whispered no its okay i she smiled and lightly kissed away any more words he sat back and squeezed her hand she curled against him feeling her heart rate slow as she found within herself a curious balance the perfect stasis of reluctance and relief rain pelted the windshield dance reflected that she always preferred to make love on rainy days but one thing he said she glanced at him kellogg continued the case wont go on forever from his mouth to gods ear if youd be interested in going out afterward how does that sound afterward has a nice ring to it real nice a halfhour later dance was parking in front of her house she went through the standard routine a check of security a glass of pinot grigio two pieces of cold flank steak left over from last night and a handful of mixed nuts enjoyed to the sound track of phone messages then came canine feeding and their backyard tasks and stowing her glockwithout the kids home she kept the lockbox open though she still stashed the gun inside since imprinted memory would guide her hand there automatically no matter how deep a sleep she awoke from alarms on she opened the window to the guardsabout six inchesto let in the cool fragrant night air shower a clean tshirt and shorts she dropped into bed protecting herself from the mad world by an inchthick down comforter thinking golly damn girl making out in a carwith a bench front seat no buckets just made for reclining with the man of the hour she recalled mint recalled his hands the flop of hair the absence of aftershave she also heard her sons voice and saw his eyes earlier that day wary jealous dance thought of lindas comments earlier theres something terrifying about the idea of being kicked out of your family which was ultimately wess fear the concern was unreasonable of course but that didnt matter it was real to him shed be more careful this time keep wes and kellogg separate not mention the word date sell the idea that like him she had friends who were both male and female your children are like suspects in an interrogation its not smart to lie but you dont need to tell them everything a lot of work a lot of juggling time and effort or she wondered her thoughts spinning fast was it better just to forget about kellogg wait a year or two before she dated age thirteen or fourteen is hugely different from twelve wes would be better then yet dance didnt want to she couldnt forget the complicated memories of his taste and touch she thought too of his tentativeness about children the stress he exhibited she wondered if it was because he was uneasy around youngsters and was now forming a connection with a woman who came with a pair of them how would he deal with that maybe but hold on here lets not get ahead of ourselves you were making out you enjoyed it dont call the caterer yet for a long time she lay in bed listening to the sounds of nature you were never very far from them around herethroaty sea animals temperamental birds and the settling bed sheet of surf often loneliness sprang into kathryn dances life a striking snake and it was at moments like thisin bed late hearing the sound track of nightthat she was most vulnerable to it how nice it was to feel your lovers thigh next to yours to hear the adagio of shallow breath to awake at dawn to the thumps and rustling of someones rising sounds otherwise insignificant that were the comforting heartbeats of a life together kathryn dance supposed longing for these small things revealed weakness a sign of dependency but what was so wrong with that my god look at us fragile creatures we have to depend so why not fill that dependency with somebody whose company we enjoy whose body we can gladly press against late at night who makes us laughwhy not just hold on and hope for the best ah bill she thought to her late husband bill distant memories tugged but so did fresh ones with nearly equal gravitation afterward how does that sound thursday chapter in her backyard again her shire her narnia her hogwarts her secret garden seventeenyearold theresa croyton bolling sat in the gray teak smith amp hawken glider and read the slim volume in her hand flipping pages slowly it was a magnificent day the air was as sweet as the perfume department at macys and the nearby hills of napa were as peaceful as ever covered with a mat of clover and grass verdant grapevines and pine and gnarly cypress theresa was thinking lyrically because of what she was readingbeautifully crafted heartfelt insightful and totally boring poetry she sighed loudly wishing her aunt were around to hear her the paperback drooped in her hand and she gazed over the backyard once more a place where she seemed to spend half her life the green prison she sometimes called it other times she loved the place it was beautiful a perfect setting to read or practice her guitar theresa wanted to be a pediatrician a travel writer or in the best of all worlds sharon isbin the famous classical guitarist she was here not in school at the moment because of an unplanned trip she and her aunt and uncle were going to be taking oh tare well have fun rogers got this thing he has to do in manhattan a speech or research i dont really know wasnt paying attention he was going on and on you know your uncle but wont it be great getting away just on a whim an adventure which was why her aunt had taken her out of school at am on monday only hello they hadnt left yet which was a little odd her aunt explaining there were some logistical difficulties you know what i mean theresa was eighth in her class of students at vallejo springs high she said yes i do you mean logistic but what the girl didnt understand was since they were still not on a fucking airplane to new york why couldnt she stay in school until the difficulties were taken care of her aunt had pointed out besides its study week so study which didnt mean study what it meant was no tv and meant no hanging with sunny or travis or kaitlin and meant not going to the big literacy benefit formal in tiburon that her uncles company was a sponsor of shed even bought a new dress of course it was all bullshit there was no trip to new york there were no difficulties logistic logistical or otherwise it was just an excuse to keep her in the green prison and why the lies because the man whod killed her parents and her brother and sister had escaped from prison which her aunt actually seemed to believe she could keep secret from theresa like pleasethe news was the first thing you saw on yahoos home page and everybody in california was talking about it on myspace and facebook her aunt had disabled the familys wireless router somehow but theresa had simply piggybacked through a neighbors unsecured system the girl tossed the book on the planks of the swing and rocked back and forth as she pulled the scrunchi out of her hair and rebound her ponytail theresa was certainly grateful for what her aunt had done for her over the years and gave the woman a lot of credit she really did after those terrible days in carmel eight years ago her aunt had taken charge of the girl everybody called the sleeping doll theresa found herself adopted relocated renamed theresa bolling could be worse and plopped down on the chairs of dozens of therapists all of whom were clever and sympathetic and who plotted out routes to psychological wellness by exploring the grieving process and being particularly mindful of the value of transference with parental figures in the treatment some shrinks helped some didnt but the most important factortimeworked its patient magic and theresa became someone other than the sleeping doll survivor of a childhood tragedy she was a student friend occasional girlfriend veterinary assistant not bad sprinter in the fiftyand the hundredyard dash guitarist who could play scott joplins the entertainer and do the diminished chord run up the neck without a single squeak on the strings now though a setback the killer was out of jail true but that wasnt the real problem no it was the way her aunt was handling everything it was like reversing the clock sending her back in time six seven oh god eight years theresa felt as if she were the sleeping doll once again all the gains erased honey honey wake up dont be afraid im a policewoman see this badge why dont you get your clothes and go into your bathroom and get changed her aunt was now panicked edgy paranoid it was like in that hbo series shed watched when she was over at bradleys last year about a prison if something bad happened the guards would lock down the place theresa the sleeping doll was in lockdown stuck here in hogwarts in middle earthin oz the green prison hey thats sweet she thought bitterly daniel pell is out of prison and im stuck inside one theresa picked up the poetry book again thinking of her english test she read two more lines borrrring theresa then noticed through the chainlink fence at the end of the property a car ease past braking quickly it seemed as the driver looked through the bushes her way a moments hesitation and then the car continued on theresa planted her feet and the swinging stopped the car could belong to anyone neighbors one of the kids on break from school she wasnt worriednot too much of course with her aunts media blackout she had no idea if daniel pell had been rearrested or was last seen heading for napa but that was crazy thanks to her aunt she was practically in the witness protection program how could he possibly find her still shed go sneak a look at the computer see what was going on a faint twist in her stomach theresa stood and headed for the house okay were bugging a little now she looked behind her back at the gap through the bushes at the far end of their property no car nothing and turning back to the house theresa stopped fast the man had scaled the tall fence twenty feet away between her and the house he looked up breathing hard from the effort from where he landed on his knees beside two thick azaleas his hand was bleeding cut on the jagged top of the sixfoot chain link it was him it was daniel pell she gasped he had come here he was going to finish the murders of the croyton family a smile on his face he rose stiffly and began to walk toward her theresa croyton began to cry no its all right the man said in a whisper as he approached smiling im not going to hurt you shhhh theresa tensed she told herself to run now do it but her legs wouldnt move fear paralyzed her besides there was nowhere to go he was between her and the house and she knew she couldnt vault the sixfoot chainlink fence she thought of running away from the house into the backyard but then he could tackle her and pull her into the bushes where hed no that was too horrible gasping actually tasting the fear theresa shook her head slowly felt her strength ebbing she looked for a weapon nothing only an edging brick a bird feeder the collected poems of emily dickinson she looked back at pell you killed my parents youdont hurt me a frown no my god the man said eyes wide oh no i just want to talk to you im not daniel pell i swear look he tossed something in her direction ten feet away look at it the back turn it over theresa glanced at the house the one time she needed her aunt the woman was nowhere in sight there the man said the girl stepped forwardand he continued to retreat giving her plenty of room she walked closer and glanced down it was a book a stranger in the night by morton nagle thats me theresa wouldnt pick it up with her foot she eased it over on the back cover was a picture of a younger version of the man in front of her was it true theresa suddenly realized that shed seen only a few pictures of daniel pell taken eight years ago shed had to sneak a look at a few articles onlineher aunt told her it would set her back years psychologically if she read anything about the murders but looking at the younger author photo it was clear that this wasnt the gaunt scary man she remembered theresa wiped her face anger exploded inside her a popped balloon whatre you doing here you fucking scared me the man pulled his sagging pants up as if planning to walk closer but evidently he decided not to there was no other way to talk to you i saw your aunt yesterday when she was shopping i wanted her to ask you something theresa glanced at the chain link nagle said the police are on their way i know i saw the alarm on the fence theyll be here in three four minutes and theyll arrest me thats fine but i have to tell you something the man who killed your parents has escaped from prison i know you do your aunt just leave me alone theres a policewoman in monterey whos trying to catch him but she needs some help your aunt wouldnt tell you and if you were eleven or twelve id never do this but youre old enough to make up your own mind she wants to talk to you a policewoman please just call her shes in monterey you canoh god the gunshot from behind theresa was astonishingly loud way louder than in the movies it shook the windows and sent birds streaking into the clear skies theresa cringed at the sound and dropped to her knees watching morton nagle tumble backward onto the wet grass his arms flailing in the air eyes wide in horror the girl looked at the deck behind the house weird she didnt even know her aunt owned a gun much less knew how to shoot it tj scanlons extensive canvassing of james reynoldss neighborhood had yielded no helpful witnesses or evidence no veehicles no nothin he was calling from a street near the prosecutors house dance in her office stretched and her bare feet fiddled with one of the three pairs of shoes under her desk she badly wanted an id of pells new car if not a tag number reynolds had reported only that it was a dark sedan and the officer whod been bashed with the shovel couldnt remember seeing it at all the mcsos crime scene team hadnt found any trace or other forensic evidence to give even a hint as to what pell might be driving now she thanked tj and disconnected then joined oneil and kellogg in the cbi conference room where charles overby was about to arrive to ask for fodder for the next press conferenceand his daily update to amy grabe of the fbi and the head of the cbi in sacramento both of whom were extremely troubled that daniel pell was still free unfortunately though overbys briefing this morning would be primarily about the funeral plans for juan millar her eyes caught kelloggs and they both looked away she hadnt had a chance to talk to the fbi agent about last night in the car then decided what is there to talk about afterward how does that sound young rey carraneo eyes wide stuck his perfectly round head into the conference room and said breathlessly agent dance im sorry to interrupt what rey i think his voice vanished hed been sprinting sweat dotted his dark face what whats wrong the skinny agent said the thing is agent dance i think ive found him who pell chapter the young agent explained that hed called the upscale sea view motel in pacific groveonly a few miles from where dance livedand learned that a woman had checked in on saturday she was midtwenties attractive and blond slightly built on tuesday night the desk clerk saw a latino man go into her room the clinchers the car though carraneo said on the registration she put down mazda with a fake tag numberi just ran it but the manager was sure he saw a turquoise tbird there for a day or two its not there anymore theyre at the motel now he thinks so the curtains drawn but he saw some motion and lights inside whats her name carrie madison but theres no credit card info she paid cash and showed a military id but it was in a plastic wallet sleeve and scratched mightve been faked dance leaned against the edge of the table staring at the map occupancy of the motel no vacancies she grimaced plenty of innocents in the place kellogg said lets plan the takedown to michael you have mcso tactical on alert oneil was looking at dances troubled face and kellogg had to repeat the question the detective answered we can get teams there in twenty minutes he sounded reluctant dance was as well im not sure about what the fbi agent asked we know hes armed and hell target civilians and i know the motel the rooms look out on a parking lot and courtyard hardly any cover he could see us coming if we try to empty the rooms nearby and across the way hed spot us if we dont peoplere going to get hurt those walls wouldnt stop a twentytwo kellogg asked whatre you thinking surveillance get a team around the building watch it nonstop when he leaves take him on the street oneil nodded id vote for that too vote for what charles overby asked joining them dance explained the situation weve found him all right he turned to kellogg what about fbi tactical teams they cant get here in time well have to go with county swat michael youve called them not yet kathryn and i have some problems with a takedown what overby asked testily she explained the risk the cbi chief understood but he shook his head bird in the hand kellogg too persisted i really dont think we can risk waiting hes gotten away from us twice now if he gets any hint were moving inand all he has to do is look out the windowhell go barricade if theres a door to the adjoining room there is carraneo said i asked she gave him a nod for his initiative then continued he could take hostages i say we get a team on the roof across the way and maybe somebody in a housekeeping uniform sit back and watch when he leaves well tail him he hits a deserted intersection block him in and get him in a crossfire hell surrender or be killed in a shootout either way hes too slippery for that kellogg countered we surprise him in the motel we move fast hell give up our first spat dance thought wryly and go back to capitola i dont think so hell fight tooth and nail everything the women have told me about him makes me believe that he cant stand to be controlled or confined michael oneil said i know the motel too it could turn barricade real easy and i dont think pells the sort you could have a successful negotiation with dance was in an odd situation she had a strong gut feel that moving too fast was a mistake but when it came to daniel pell she was wary of trusting her instinct overby said heres a thought if we do end up with a barricade what about the women in the family would they be willing to help talk him out dance persisted why would pell listen to them they never had any sway over him eight years ago they sure dont now but still theyre the closest thing to family that pells got he stepped toward her phone ill give them a call the last thing she wanted was overby scaring them off no ill do it dance called and spoke to samantha and explained the situation to her the woman begged dance not to involve her there was too great a risk her name would appear in the press rebecca and linda though said they were willing to do what they could if it came to a barricade dance hung up and related to those in the room what the women had said overby said well theres your backup plan good dance wasnt convinced that pell would be swayed by sympathetic pleas for surrender evenor maybe especiallyfrom members of his former surrogate family i still say surveillance hes got to come out eventually oneil said firmly i agree kellogg looked absently at a map on the wall troubled he then turned to dance if youre really opposed okay its your choice but remember what i was saying about the cult profile when he goes out on the street hell be alert expecting something to go down hell have contingencies planned out in the motel he wont be as well prepared hell be complacent in his castle all cult leaders are didnt work too well in waco oneil pointed out waco was a standoff koresh and his people knew the officers were there pell wont have a clue were coming that was true she reflected it is winstons expertise kathryn overby said thats why hes here i really think we should move maybe her boss genuinely felt this way though he could hardly oppose the view of the specialist that hed wanted on board stash the blame she stared at the map of monterey kathryn overby asked his voice testy dance debated okay we go in oneil stiffened we can afford some time here she hesitated again glancing at kelloggs confident eyes as he too scanned the map no i think we should move on it she said good overby said the proactive approach is the best absolutely proactive dance thought bitterly a good press conference word she hoped the announcement to the media would be the successful arrest of daniel pell and not more casualties michael overby asked you want to contact your people oneil hesitated then called his office and asked for the mcso swat commander lying in bed in the soft morning light daniel pell was thinking that theyd now have to be particularly careful the police would know what he looked like in the latino disguise he could bleach much of the color out and change his hair again but theyd be expecting that too still he couldnt leave yet he had one more mission on the peninsula the whole reason for his remaining here pell made coffee and when he returned to the bed carrying the two cups he found jennie looking at him like last night her expression was different she seemed more mature than when theyd first met what lovely can i ask you something sure youre not coming with me to my house in anaheim are you her words hit him hard he hesitated not sure what to say then asked why do you think that i just feel it pell set the coffee on the table he started to liedeception came so easily to him and he could have gotten away with it instead he said i have other plans for us lovely i havent told you yet i know you do he was surprised ive known all along not exactly known but i had a feeling after we take care of a few things here were going somewhere else where a place i have its not near anything theres no one around its wonderful beautiful we wont be bothered there its on a mountain do you like the mountains sure i guess that was good because daniel pell owned one pells aunt in bakersfield was the only decent person in his family as far as he was concerned aunt barbara thought her brother pells father was mad the chainsmoking failed minister obsessed with doing exactly what the bible told him terrified of god terrified of making decisions on his own as if that might offend him so the woman tried to divert the pell boys as best she could richard would have nothing to do with her but she and daniel spent a lot of time together she didnt corral him didnt order him around didnt force him to be a housekeeper and never even raised her voice to him much less her hand she let him come and go as he wished spent money on him asked about what hed done during the days when he visited she took him places pell remembered driving up into the hills for picnics the zoo movieswhere he sat amid the smell of popcorn and her weighty perfume mesmerized by the infallible assuredness of hollywood villains and heroes up on the screen she also shared her views with him one of which was her belief that thered be a wildfire of a race war in the country at some point her vote was the millenniumoops on that one so she bought two hundred plus acres of forestland in northern california a mountaintop near shasta daniel pell had never been racist but neither was he stupid and when the aunt ranted about the forthcoming great war of black and white he was with her percent she deeded over the land to her nephew so that he and other decent good rightthinking people defined as caucasian could escape to it when the shooting started pell hadnt thought much about the place at the time being young but then hed hitchhiked up there and knew instantly it was the place for him he loved the view and the air mostly loved the idea that it was so private hed be unreachable by the government and unwelcome neighbors it even had some large cavesand he often fantasized about what would go on in those expanding the balloon within him nearly to the bursting point he did some clearing work himself and built a shack by hand he knew that some day this would be his kingdom the village the pied piper would lead his children to pell had to make sure though that the property stayed invisiblenot from the rampaging minorities but from law enforcers given his history and proclivity toward crime he bought books written by survivalists and the rightwing antigovernment fringe about hiding ownership of property which was surprisingly easy provided you made sure the property taxes were paid a trust and a savings account were all that it took the arrangement was selfperpetuating a term that daniel pell loved no dependency pells mountaintop only one glitch had interfered with his plan after he and a girl hed met in san francisco alison had hitched up there he happened to run into a guy who worked for the county assessors office charles pickering hed heard rumors of building supplies being delivered there did that mean improvements which in turn would mean a tax hike that itself wouldntve been a problem pell could have added money to the trust but the worst of all coincidences pickering had family in marin county and recognized pell from a story in the local paper about his arrest for a breakin later that day the man tracked pell down near his property hey i know you the assessor said which turned out to be his last words out came the knife and pickering was dead thirty seconds after slumping to the ground in a bloody pile nothing was going to jeopardize his enclave hed escaped that one though the police had held him for a timelong enough for alison to decide it was over and head back south hed been searching for her ever since shed have to die of course since she knew where his property was the mountaintop was what sustained him after he went into the q and then into capitola he dreamed of it constantly living there with a new family it was what had driven him to study appellate law and craft a solid appeal for the croyton murders which he believed hed win getting the convictions knocked down maybe even to time served but last year hed lost and hed had to start thinking of escape now he was free and after doing what he needed to in monterey hed get to his mountain as soon as he could when that idiot of a prison guard had let pell into the office on sunday hed managed to take a look at the place on the website visualearth he wasnt exactly sure of the coordinates of his property but hed come close enough and been thrilled to see that the area appeared as deserted as ever no structures for miles aroundthe caves invisible from the prying eye of the satellite lying now in the sea view motel he told jennie about the placein general terms of course it was against his nature to share too much he didnt tell her for instance that she wouldnt be the only one living there but one of a dozen hed lure away from their homes and he certainly couldnt tell her what he envisioned for them all living on the mountaintop pell realized the mistakes hed made in seaside ten years ago he was too lenient too slow to use violence this time any threats would be eliminated fast and ruthlessly absolute control but jennie was contenteven excitedabout the few facts he shared i mean it ill go wherever you are sweetie she took his coffee cup from his hands set it aside she lay back make love to me daniel please make love he noticed not fuck it was an indication that his student had graduated to another level this more than her body began expanding the bubble within him he smoothed a strand of dyed hair off her forehead and kissed her his hands began that familiar yet always new exploration which was interrupted by a jarring ring he grimaced and picked up the phone listened to what the caller said and then held his hand over the mouthpiece its housekeeping they saw the do not disturb sign and want to know when they can make up the room jennie gave a coy smile tell her we need at least an hour ill tell her two just to be sure chapter the staging area for the assault was in an intersection around the corner from the sea view motel dance still wasnt sure about the wisdom of a tactical operation here but once the decision had been made certain rules fell automatically into place and one of those was that she had to take a backseat this wasnt her expertise and there was little for her to do but be a spectator albert stemple and tj would represent the cbi on the takedown teams which were made up mostly of swat deputies from monterey county and several highway patrol officers the eight men and two women were gathered beside a nondescript truck which held enough weapons and ammunition to put down a modest riot pell was still inside the room that the woman had rented the lights were off but a surveillance officer on the back side of the motel clapped a microphone on the wall and reported sounds coming from their room he couldnt be sure but it sounded like they were having sex that was good news thought dance a naked suspect is a vulnerable suspect on the phone with the manager she asked about the rooms next to pells the one to his left was empty the guests had just left with fishing tackle which meant they wouldnt be back until much later unfortunately though as for the room on the other side a family appeared to be still inside dances initial reaction was to call them and tell them to get down on the floor in the back but they wouldnt do that of course theyd flee flinging open the door the parents rushing the children outside and pell would know exactly what was going on he had the instincts of a cat imagining them the others in the rooms nearby and the housekeeping staff kathryn dance thought suddenly call it off do what your gut tells you youve got the authority overby wouldnt like itthat would be a battlebut she could handle him oneil and the mcso would back her up still she couldnt trust her instinct at the moment she didnt know people like pell winston kellogg did he happened to arrive just then walking up to the tactical officers shaking hands and introducing himself hed changed outfits yet again but there was nothing country club about his new look he was in black jeans a black shirt and a thick bulletproof vest the bandage on his neck visible tjs words came back to her hes a bit of a straight arrow but hes not afraid to get his hands dirty in this garb with his attentive eyes he reminded her even more of her late husband bill had spent most of his time doing routine investigations but occasionally hed dressed for tactical ops shed seen him once or twice looking like this confidently holding an elaborate machine gun dance watched kellogg load and chamber a round in a large silver automatic pistol now thats some weapon of mass destruction tj said schweizerische industries gesellschaft what impatient sig as in sigsauer its the new p fortyfive its fortyfive caliber yup tj said apparently the bureaus adopted a letsmakesuretheyrenevergettingupevereveragain philosophy one im not necessarily opposed to dance and all the other agents at the cbi carried only mm glocks concerned that a higher caliber could cause more collateral damage kellogg pulled on a windbreaker advertising him as an fbi agent and joined her and oneil who was today in his khaki chief deputy uniformbody armor too dance briefed them about the rooms next to pells kellogg said when they did the kickin hed simultaneously have somebody enter the room next door and get the family down under cover not much but it was something rey carraneo radioed in he was in a surveillance position on the far side of the parking lot out of sight behind a dumpster the lot was empty of people at the momentthough there were a number of carsand the housekeepers were going about their business as kellogg had instructed at the last minute as the tac teams were on their way other officers would pull them to cover in five minutes the officers had finished dressing in armor and checking weapons they were huddled in a small yard near the main office they looked at oneil and dance but it was kellogg who spoke first i want a rolling entry one team through the door the second backup right behind he held up a sketch of the room which the manager had drawn first team here to the bed second the closets and bathroom i need some flashbangs he was referring to the loud blinding hand grenades used to disorient suspects without causing serious injury one of the mcso officers handed him several he put them in his pocket kellogg said ill take the first team in im on point dance wished he wouldnt there were far younger officers on the monterey swat team most of them recent military discharges with combat experience the fbi agent continued hell have that woman with him and she may appear to be a hostage but shes just as dangerous as he is remember shes the one who lit up the courthouse and thats what killed juan millar acknowledging nods from them all now well circle around the side of the building and move in fast along the front those going past his window stay on your bellies dont crouch as close to the building as you can get assume hes looking out i want people in armor to pull the housekeepers behind cars then we go in and dont assume there are only two perps in there his words put in mind dances conversation with rebecca sheffield structure the solution he said to dance that sound okay to you which wasnt really the question he was asking his query was more specific do i have authority here kellogg was being generous enough to give her one last chance to pull the plug on the op she debated only a moment and said its fine do it dance started to say something to oneil but couldnt think of any words that conveyed her thoughtsshe wasnt sure what those thoughts were in any case he didnt look at her just drew his glock and along with tj and stemple moved out with a backup team lets get into position kellogg said to the tactical officers dance joined carraneo by the dumpster and plugged in her headset and stalk mike a few minutes later her radio crackled kellogg saying on my five we move affirmative responses came in from the leaders of the various teams lets do it onetwo dance wiped her palm on her slacks and closed it around the grip of her weapon threefourfive go the men and women dashed around the corner and dances eyes flipped back and forth from kellogg to oneil please she thought no more deaths had they structured it right had they recognized the patterns kellogg got to the door first giving a nod to the mcso officer carrying a battering ram the big man swung the weighty tube into the fancy door and it crashed open kellogg pitched in one of the grenades two officers rushed into the room beside pells and others pulled the maids behind parked cars when the flashbang detonated with a stunning explosion kelloggs and oneils teams raced inside then silence no gunshots no screams finally she heard kelloggs voice lost in a staticky transmission ending with him say again dance transmitted urgently say again win do you have him a crackle negative hes gone her daniel was brilliant her daniel knew everything as they drove fast but not over the limit away from the motel jennie marston looked back no squad cars yet no lights no sirens angel songs she recited to herself angel songs protect us her daniel was a genius twenty minutes ago as theyd started to make love hed frozen sitting up in bed what honey shed asked alarmed housekeeping have they ever called about making up the room i dont think so why would they today and its early they wouldnt call until later somebody wanted to see if we were in the police get dressed now you want get dressed she leapt from bed grab what you can get your computer and dont leave anything personal hed put a porn movie on tv looked outside then walked to the adjoining door held the gun up and kicked it in startling two young men inside at first she thought hed kill them but he just told them to stand up and turn around tied their hands with fishing line and taped washcloths in their mouths he pulled their wallets out and looked them over ive got your names and addresses you stay here and be quiet if you say anything to anybody your familiesre dead okay they nodded and daniel closed the adjoining door and blocked it with a chair he dumped out the contents of the fishermens cooler and tackle boxes and put their own bags inside they dressed in the mens yellow slickers and wearing baseball caps they carried the gear and the fishing rods outside dont look around walk right to our car but slow they headed across the parking lot he spent some minutes loading the car trying to look casual they then climbed in and drove away jennie struggling to keep calm she wanted to cry she was so nervous but excited too she had to admit that the escape had been a total high shed never felt so alive driving away from the motel she thought about her husband the boyfriends her mothernothing shed experienced with any of them approached what she felt at this moment they passed four police cars speeding toward the motel no sirens angel songs her prayer worked now they were miles from the inn and no one was after them finally he laughed and exhaled a long breath how about that lovely we did it sweetie she whooped and shook her head wildly as if she were at a rock concert she pressed her lips against his neck and bit him playfully soon they were pulling into the parking lot of the butterfly inn a small dump of a motel on lighthouse the commercial strip in monterey daniel told her go get a room well be finished up here soon but it might not be till tomorrow get it for a week though itll be less suspicious in the back again maybe that cottage there use a different name tell the clerk you left your id in your suitcase and youll bring it later jennie registered and returned to the car they carried the cooler and boxes inside pell lay on the bed arms behind his neck she curled up next to him were going to have to hide out here theres a grocery store up the street go get some food would you lovely and more hair dye he smiled not a bad idea can i be a redhead you can be green if you want id love you anyway god he was perfect she heard the crackle of the tv coming on as she stepped out of the door slipping the cap on a few days ago shed never have thought shed be okay with daniel hurting people giving up her house in anaheim never seeing the hummingbirds and wrens and sparrows in her backyard again now it seemed perfectly natural in fact wonderful anything for you daniel anything chapter and how did he know you were there overby asked standing in dances office the man was jumpy not only had he engineered cbis taking over the manhunt but he was now on record as supporting the bad tactical decision at the motel paranoid too dance could tell this from his body language and his verbal content as well his use of you whereas dance or oneil wouldve said we stashing the blame mustve sensed something about the hotel was different maybe the staff were acting strange kellogg replied like in the restaurant at moss landing hes got the instincts of a cat echoing dances thoughts earlier and i thought your people heard him inside michael porn dance said the detective explained he had porn on payperview that was what surveillance heard the postmortem was discouraging if not embarrassing it turned out that the manager had without knowing it seen pell and the woman leavingpretending to be the two fishermen in the adjoining roomheaded off for squid and salmon in monterey bay the two men bound and gagged in the next room were reluctant to talk dance pried out of them that pell had gotten their addresses and threatened to kill their families if they called for help patternsgoddamn patterns winston kellogg was upset about the escape but not apologetic hed made a judgment call like dances at moss landing his plan could have worked but fate had intervened and she respected that he wasnt bitter or whiny about the outcome he was focused on the next steps overbys assistant joined them she told her boss he had a call from sacramento and sac amy grabe from the fbi was holding on two she wasnt happy an angry grunt the cbi chief turned and followed her back to his office carraneo called to report that the canvass he and several other officers were conducting had so far yielded nothing a cleaning woman thought shed seen a dark car driving toward the back of the lot before the raid no tag number no one had seen anything else dark sedan the same useless description theyd gotten at james reynoldss house a monterey sheriffs deputy arrived with a large packet he handed it to oneil crime scene sir the detective set out photos and a list of the physical evidence there was no doubt the fingerprints revealed that the two occupants of the room were indeed pell and his accomplice clothes food wrappers newspapers personal hygiene items some cosmetics also clothespins what looked like a whip made out of a coat hanger dotted with blood panty hose that had been tied to the bedposts dozens of condomsnew and usedand a large tube of ky lubricant kellogg said typical of cult leaders jim jones in guyana he had sex three or four times a day why is that dance asked because they can they can do pretty much whatever they want oneils phone rang and he took the call he listened for a few moments good scan it and send it to agent dances computer you have her emailthanks he looked at dance crime scene found an email in the pocket of the womans jeans a few minutes later dance called up the message on the screen she printed out thepdf attachment from centraladmincapitolacorrectionalcom to jmsungirleuroservecouk re jennie my lovely bargained my way into the office to write this i had to theres something i want to say i woke up thinking about youour plans to go out to the beach and the desert and watching the fireworks every night in your backyard i was thinking youre smart and beautiful and romanticwho could ask for anything more in a girl weve danced around it a lot and havent said it but i want to now i love you theres no doubt in my mind youre unlike anybody ive ever met so there you have it have to go now hope these words of mine havent upset you or freaked you out soon daniel so pell had sent emails from capitolathough prior to sunday dance noted probably why the tech hadnt found them dance noted that jennie was her first name last or middle initial m jmsungirl oneil added our tech departments contacting the isp now foreign servers arent very cooperative but well keep our fingers crossed dance was staring at the email look at what he said beach desert and fireworks every night all three near her house that ought to give us some ideas kellogg said the car was stolen in los angeles shes from southern california somewhere beach and desert but fireworks every night anaheim dance said the other parent present nodded oneil said disneyland dance met oneils eye she said your idea earlier the banks and withdrawals of ninetytwo hundred dollars all of la countyokay maybe that was too much but anaheim much smaller and now we know her first name and possibly an initial can your people handle this one win sure thatd be a more manageable number of banks he said agreeably he picked up the phone and called the request in to the la field office dance called the point lobos inn she explained to the women what had happened at the motel he got away again samantha asked im afraid so she gave her the details of the email including the screen name but none of them could recall anybody with that name or initials we also found evidence of s and m activity she described the sexual gear could thatve been pell or would itve been the womans idea might help us narrow down a search if it was hers a professional a dominatrix maybe samantha was quiet for a moment then she said i ahthat wouldve been daniels idea he was kind of that way embarrassed dance thanked her i know youre anxious to leave i promise i wont keep you much longer it was only a few minutes later that winston kellogg received a call his eyes flashed in surprise he looked up theyve got an id a woman named jennie marston withdrew nine thousand two hundred dollarsvirtually her whole savings accountfrom pacific trust in anaheim last week cash were getting a warrant and our agents and orange county deputiesre going to raid her house theyll let us know what they find sometimes you do get a break oneil grabbed the phone and in five minutes a jpeg image of a young womans drivers license photo was on dances computer she called tj into her office yo she nodded at the screen do an efis image make her a brunette redhead long hair short hair get it to the sea view i want to make sure its her and if it is i want a copy sent to every tv station and newspaper in the area you bet boss without sitting he typed on her keyboard then hurried out as if he were trying to beat the pictures arrival to his office charles overby stepped into the doorway that call from sacramento is hold on charles dance briefed him on what had happened and his mood changed instantly well a lead good at lastanyway weve got another issue sacramento got a call from the napa county sheriffs office napa theyve got someone named morton nagle in jail dance nodded slowly she hadnt told overby about enlisting the writers aid to find the sleeping doll i talked to the sheriff and hes not a happy camper whatd nagle do kellogg asked lifting an eyebrow to dance the croyton girl she lives up there somewhere with her aunt and uncle he apparently wanted to talk her into being interviewed by you thats right oh i didnt hear about it he let that linger for a moment the aunt told him no but this morning he snuck onto their property and tried to convince the girl in person so much for uninvolved objective journalism the aunt took a shot at him what she missed but if the deputies hadnt shown up the sheriff thinks she wouldve taken him out on the second try and nobody seemed very upset about that possibility they think we had something to do with it thiss a can of worms ill handle it dance told him we werent involved were we i told him we werent ill handle it overby considered this then gave her the sheriffs number and headed back to his office dance called the sheriff and identified herself she told him the situation the man grunted well agent dance i appreciate the problem pell and all made the news up here ill tell you but we cant just release him theresas aunt and uncle went forward with the complaint and i have to say we all keep a special eye out for that girl around here knowing what she went through the magistrate set bail at a hundred thousand and none of the bailbondsmenre interested in handling it can i talk to the prosecutor hes on trial will be all day morton nagle would have to spend a little time in jail she felt bad for him and appreciated his change of mind but there was nothing she could do id like to talk to the girls aunt or uncle i dont know what good itd do its important a pause well now agent dance i really dont think theyd be inclined in fact i can pretty much guarantee it will you give me their number please direct questions are often the most effective but so are direct answers no goodbye now agent dance chapter dance and oneil were alone in her office shed learned from the orange county sheriffs department that jennie marstons father was dead and her mother had a history of petty crime drug abuse and emotional disabilities there was no record of the mothers whereabouts she had a few relatives on the east coast but no one had heard from jennie in years dance learned that jennie had gone to community college for a year studying food management then dropped out apparently to get married shed worked for a hair cuttery for a year and then went into food service employed by a number of caterers and bakeries in orange county a quiet worker who would arrive on time do her job and then leave she led a solitary life and deputies could find no acquaintances no close friends her exhusband hadnt talked to her in years but said that she deserved whatever happened to her not surprisingly police records revealed a history of difficult relationships deputies had been summoned by hospital workers at least a halfdozen times on suspicion of domestic abuse involving the ex and at least four other partners social services had started files but jennie had never pursued any complaints let alone sought restraining orders just the sort to fall prey to someone like daniel pell dance mentioned this to oneil the detective nodded he was looking out dances window at two pine trees that had grafted themselves to each other over the years producing a knucklelike knot at eye level dance would often stare at the curious blemish when the facts of a case refused to coalesce into helpful insights so whats on your mind she asked you want to know i asked didnt i in a tone of good humor it wasnt reciprocated he said testily you were right he was wrong kellogg at the motel we shouldve followed your initial plan set up a surveillance perimeter the minute we heard about the motel not spent a halfhour assembling tactical thats how he caught on somebody gave something away instincts of a cat she hated defending herself especially to someone she was so close to a takedown made sense at the time a lot was going on and it was happening fast no it didnt make sense thats why you hesitated even at the end you werent sure who knows anything in situations like this okay you felt it was the wrong approach and what you feel is usually right it was just bad luck if wed moved in earlier we probably wouldve had him she regretted saying this afraid hed take her words as a criticism of the mcso and people wouldve died were just goddamn lucky nobody was hurt kelloggs plan was a prescription for a shootout i think were lucky pell wasnt there it couldve been a bloodbath he crossed his armsa protective gesture which was ironic because he still had on the bulletproof vest youre giving up control of the operation your operation to winston yes exactly hes a consultant and it seems like hes running the case hes the specialist michael im not youre not he is im sorry he talks about the cult mentality he talks about profiles but i dont see him closing in on pell youre the one whos been doing that look at his credentials his background hes an expert okay hes got some insights theyre helpful but he wasnt enough of an expert to catch pell an hour ago he lowered his voice look at the hotel overby backed winston obviouslyhes the one who wanted him on board you got the pressure from the fbi and your boss but weve handled pressure before the two of us we couldve backed them down what exactly are you saying that im deferring to him for some other reason looking away an aversion gesture people feel stress not only when they lie sometimes they feel it when they tell the truth im saying youre giving kellogg too much control over the operation and frankly over yourself she snapped because he reminds me of my husband is that what youre saying i dont know you tell me does he remind you of bill this is ridiculous you brought it up well anything other than professional judgments none of your business fine oneil said tersely ill stick to professional judgment winston was off base and you acquiesced to him knowing he was wrong knowing it was fiftyfive fortyfive on the tac approach at the motel i had one opinion at first i changed it any good officer can be swayed by reason by logical analysis what about your judgment how objective are you me why arent i objective because of juan a faint recognition response in oneils eyes dance had hit close to home and she supposed the detective felt responsible in some way for the young officers death thinking perhaps that he hadnt trained millar enough his protégés she regretted her comment dance and oneil had fought before you cant have friendship and a working relationship without wrinkles but never with an edge this sharp and why was he saying what he did his comments slipping over the bounds into her personal life this was a first and the kinesics read almost as jealousy they fell silent the detective lifted his hands and shrugged this was an emblem gesture which translated ive said my piece the tension in the room was as tight as that entwined pine knot thin fibers woven together into steel they resumed their discussion of the next steps checking with orange county for more details about jennie marston canvassing for witnesses and following up on the crime scene at the sea view motel they sent carraneo to the airport bus station and rentalcar offices armed with the womans picture they kicked around a few other ideas too but the climate in the office had dropped significantly summer to fall and when winston kellogg came into the room oneil retreated explaining that he had to check in with his office and brief the sheriff he said a perfunctory goodbye that was aimed at neither of them his hand throbbing from the cut sustained when he vaulted the bollings chainlink fence morton nagle glanced at the guard outside the holding cell of napa county mens detention the big latino reciprocated with a cold gaze apparently nagle had committed the numberone offense in vallejo springsnot the technical infractions of trespass and assault where the hell had they got that but the far more troubling crime of upsetting their local daughter i have a right to make a phone call no response he wanted to reassure his wife that he was okay but mostly he wanted to get word to kathryn dance about where theresa was hed changed his mind and given up on his book and journalistic ethics goddamn it he was going to do everything in his power to make sure that daniel pell got caught and flung back into capitola not illuminating evil but attacking it himself like a shark seeing theresa in person was what had swayed him a dear attractive vivacious girl who deserved to be leading the normal life of a teenager and pure evil had destroyed the hope for that telling people her story wasnt enough morton nagle personally wanted pells head but apparently they were going to keep him incommunicado for as long as they possibly could i really would like to make a phone call the guard looked at him as if hed been caught selling crack to kids outside sunday school and said nothing he stood up and paced the look from the guard said sit down nagle sat ten long long minutes later he heard a door open footsteps approached nagle he gazed at another guard bigger than the first one stand up the guard pushed a button and the door opened hold out your hands it sounded ridiculous like someone offering a child some candy he lifted them and watched the cuffs clatter around his wrists this way the man took him by the arm strong fingers closing around his biceps nagle smelled garlic and cigarette smoke residue he almost pulled away but didnt think it would be a smart idea they walked like this the chains clinking for fifty feet down a dim corridor they continued to interview room a the guard opened it and gestured nagle inside he paused theresa croyton the sleeping doll sat at a table looking up at him with dark eyes the guard pushed him forward and he sat down across from her hello again he said the girl looked over his arms and face and hands as if searching for evidence of prisoner abuse or maybe hoping for it she noticed the bandage on his hand squinted and then must have remembered that hed cut it vaulting the fence he knew she was only seventeen but there was nothing young about her except the white delicacy of her skin she didnt die in daniel pells attack nagle thought but her childhood did his anger at the killer burned hotter yet the guard stepped back but he remained close nagle could hear his large body absorbing sounds you can leave us alone theresa said i have to be here miss rules he had a moveable smile polite to her hostile to nagle theresa hesitated then focused on the writer tell me what you were going to say in my backyard about daniel pell hes staying in the monterey area for some reason the police cant figure out why and he tried to kill the prosecutor who sent him to jail james reynolds thats right hes okay yes the policewoman i was telling you about saved him who are you exactly she asked direct questions unemotional your aunt didnt tell you anything no ive been speaking to her for a month now about a book i wanted to write about you me like why would you want to write that im nobody interesting oh i think you are i wanted to write about somebody whos been hurt by something bad how they were beforehand how they are after how their life changesand how things mightve gone without the crime no my aunt didnt tell me any of that does she know youre here yeah i told her she drove me here she wont let me have a drivers license she glanced up at the guard then back to nagle they didnt want me to talk to you either the police here but there was nothing they could do about it why did you come to see me theresa he asked that policewoman you mentioned nagle was astonished you mean its all right if she comes to see you no the girl said adamantly shaking her head nagle couldnt blame her i understand but i want to go see her the writer wasnt sure hed heard correctly you want to what i want to go down to monterey meet her in person oh you dont have to do that she nodded firmly like yeah i do why because which nagle thought was as good a response as any ill have my aunt drive me down there now shell do that or ill take the bus or hitchhike you can come with us well theres one problem nagle said the girl frowned he chuckled im in jail she looked toward the guard surprise in her eyes didnt you tell him the guard shook his head theresa said i bailed you out you my father was worth a lot of money she now gave a laugh a small one but genuine and from her heart im a rich girl chapter footsteps approaching the gun was in daniel pells hand instantly in the cheap hotel its aroma air freshener and insecticide he glanced outside slipped the pistol back into his waistband seeing that it was jennie he shut off the tv and opened the door she stepped inside carrying a heavy shopping bag he took it from her and set it on the bedside table beside a clock alarm flashing howd it go lovely see any police none she pulled her cap off and rubbed her scalp pell kissed her head smelled sweat and the sour scent of the dye another glance out the window after a long moment daniel pell came to a decision lets get out of here for a bit lovely outside i thought you didnt think it was a good idea oh i know a place itll be safe she kissed him like were going on a date like a date they put their caps on and walked to the door her smile gone jennie paused and looked him over you okay sweetheart sweetheart sure am lovely just that scare back at the motel but everythings fine now fine as could be they drove along a complicated route of surface streets to a beach on the way to big sur south of carmel wooden walkways wound past rocks and dunes cordoned off with thin wires to protect the fragile environment sea otters and seals hovered in the raging surf and at ebb the tidal pools displayed whole universes in their saltwater prisms it was one of the most beautiful stretches of beach on the central coast and one of the most dangerous every year three or four people died here wandering out onto the craggy rocks for photos only to be swept breathlessly into the fortyfivedegree water by a surprise wave hypothermia could kill though most didnt last that long usually the screaming victims were smashed on the rocks or drowned tangled in the mazelike kelp beds normally the place would be crowded but now with the days sweeping fog wind and mist the area was deserted daniel pell and his lovely walked from the car down to the water a gray wave exploded on rocks fifty feet away oh its beautiful but its cold put your arm around me pell did felt her shivering this is amazing near my house the beaches there theyre all flat its like just sand and surf unless you go down to la jolla even then its nothing like this its very spiritual here oh look at them jennie sounded like a schoolgirl she was staring at the otters a large one balanced a rock on his chest and pounded something against it whats he doing hes breaking open a shell abalone or a clam or something howd they figure out how to do that got hungry i guess where were going your mountain is it as pretty as this i think its prettier and a lot more deserted we dont want tourists do we nope her hand went to her nose was she sensing something was wrong she muttered something the words lost in the relentless wind what was that oh i said angel songs lovely you keep saying that what do you mean jennie smiled i do that too much its like a prayer or a mantra i say it over and over to help me feel better and angel song is your mantra jennie laughed when i was little and motherd get arrested for what oh i dont have time to tell you everything pell looked around again the area was deserted that bad huh you name it she did it shoplifting menacing stalking assault too she attacked my father and boyfriends who were breaking up with herthere were a lot of those if there was a fight the police came to our house or wherever we were and a lot of times theyd be in a hurry and use the siren whenever id hear it id think thank god theyre going to take her away for a while its like the angels were coming to save me i got to think of sirens like that angel songs angel songs i like that pell nodded suddenly he turned her around and kissed her on the mouth he leaned back and looked at her face now the same face that had been on the motel tv screen a halfhour earlier while shed been out shopping theres been a new development in the daniel pell escape his accomplice has been identified as jennie ann marston twentyfive from anaheim california shes described as about five foot five weighing a hundred and ten pounds her drivers license picture is in the upper lefthand corner of your screen and the photos to the right and below show what she might look like now after cutting and dyeing her hair if you see her do not attempt to apprehend call or the hotline you see at the bottom of your screen the picture was unsmiling as if she was upset that the motor vehicles camera would capture her flawed nose and make it more prominent than her eyes ears and lips apparently jennie had left something in the sea view motel room after all he turned her around to face the raging ocean stood behind her angel songs she whispered pell held her tight for a moment then kissed her on the cheek look at that he said gazing at the beach what that rock there in the sand he bent down and unearthed a smooth stone which weighed maybe ten pounds it was luminescent gray what do you think it looks like lovely oh when you hold it that way its like a cat dont you think a cat sleeping all curled up like my jasmine that was your cat pell hefted it in his hand when i was a little girl my mother loved it shed never hurt jasmine shed hurt me shed hurt a lot of people but never jasmine isnt that funny thats exactly what i was thinking lovely it looks just like a cat dance called oneil first with the news he didnt pick up so she left a message about theresa it wasnt like him not to answer but she knew he wasnt screening even his outburstwell not outburst okayeven his criticism earlier had been grounded in a law enforcers desire to run a case most efficiently she wondered now as she occasionally did what it would be like to live with the copbookcollectorseafarer good and bad each in large quantities was her usual conclusion and she now hung up on that thought at the same time she did the phone dance found kellogg in the conference room she said weve got theresa croyton nagle just called from napa get this she bailed him out how bout that napa hm thats where they moved to are you going up there to talk to her no shes coming here with her aunt here with pell still loose she wanted to come insisted in fact it was the only way shed agree gutsy ill say dance called massive albert stemple and arranged for him to take over theresas guard detail when they arrived she looked up and found kellogg studying the pictures on her desk the ones of her children his face was still she wondered again if there was something about the fact that she was a mother that touched or troubled him this was an open question between them she noted wondering if there were othersor more likely what the others would be the great complicated journey of the heart she said theresa wont be here for a while id like to go back to the inn see our guests again ill leave that up to you i think a male figures a distraction dance agreed the sex of each participant makes a difference in how an interrogator handles a session and she often adjusted her behavior along the androgyny scale depending on the subject since daniel pell had been such a powerful force in these womens lives the presence of a man might throw off the balance kellogg had backed off earlier and let her pursue the questioning but it would be better for him not to be there at all she told him this and said she appreciated his understanding she started to rise but he surprised her by saying wait please dance sat back he gave a faint laugh and looked into her eyes i havent been completely honest with you kathryn and it wouldnt mean anythingexcept for last night what was this she wondered an ex who isnt exactly an ex or a girlfriend whos very much present neither of which made any difference at this point they hardly knew each other and the emotional connection was potentially significant but negligible so far whatever it might be better to air the issue now up front about children dance dropped the itsaboutme line of thought and sat forward giving him her full attention the fact is my wife and i did have a child the tense of the verb made kathryn dances stomach clench she died in a car accident when she was sixteen oh win he gestured at the picture of dance and her husband bit of a parallel car crashanyway i was a shit about it terrible i couldnt handle the situation at all i tried to be there for jill but i really wasnt not the way i shouldve been you know what its like being a cop the job can fill up as much of your life as you want and i let too much in we got divorced and it was a really bad time for a few years for both of us weve patched it up and were friends now sort of and shes remarried but i just have to say the kid thing its hard for me to be natural with them ive cut that out of my life youre the first woman ive gotten anywhere near close to who has children all im saying is if i act a little stiff its not you or wes or maggie theyre wonderful its something im working on in therapy so there he lifted his hands which is usually an emblem gesture meaning ive said what i wanted to hate me or love me but there it is im so sorry win without hesitation she took his hand and pressed it im glad you told me i know it was hard and i did see something i wasnt sure what though eagle eye she laughed i overheard wes one time he told his friend it sucks to have a mom whos a cop especially one whos a walking lie detector he smiled too ive got my own issues because of bill and because of wes she thought but said nothing well take things slow slow is good she said he gripped her forearm a simple intimate and appropriate gesture now i should get back to the family reunion she walked him to his temporary office then drove back to the point lobos inn as soon as she walked inside she knew the atmosphere had changed the kinesics were wholly different from yesterday the women were restless and edgy she noted postures and facial expressions that suggestion tension defensiveness and outright hostility interviews and interrogations were longterm processes and it wasnt unusual for a successful day to be followed by one that was a complete waste of time dance was discouraged and assessed that it might take long hours if not days to get them in a place mentally where they could once again provide helpful information still she gave it a shot she ran through what theyd learned about jennie marston and asked if the women knew anything about her they didnt dance then tried to resume the conversation of yesterday but today the comments and recollections were superficial linda seemed to be speaking for all of them when she said i just dont know how much more i can add id like to go home dance believed theyd already proved invaluable theyd saved the life of reynolds and his family and had given insights into pells mo and more important his goal to retreat to a mountaintop somewhere with more investigation they might find out where still dance wanted them to stay until shed interviewed theresa croyton in the hope that something the girl said might be a springboard to help the womens memories though as shed promised the aunt she said nothing of the impending visit they agreed reluctantly to wait for a few more hours as dance left rebecca accompanied her outside they stood under an awning a light drizzle was falling the agent lifted an eyebrow she was wondering if the woman was going to deliver another lecture on their incompetence but the message was different maybe its obvious but i thought i should mention something sam doesnt appreciate how dangerous pell is and linda thinks hes a poor misunderstood product of his childhood go on what we were telling you yesterday about himall that psychological stuffwell its true but ive been through plenty of therapy and i know its easy to focus on the jargon and the theory and forget about the person behind them youve managed to stop pell from doing what he wants to a couple of times and nearly caught him does he know your name a nod but do you think hed waste time coming after me are you immune to him rebecca asked cocking an eyebrow and that answered the question right there yes she was immune to his control and therefore she was a risk threats have to be eliminated i have a feeling hes worried youre a real danger to him and he wants to stop you and he gets to people through their family patterns dance said rebecca nodded you have family in the area i assume my parents and children are the children with your husband im a widow oh im sorry but theyre not at home right now and ive got a deputy guarding them good but watch your back thank you dance nodded back into the cabin did something happen last night between all of you she laughed i think weve had a little more past than we can handle we aired some laundry it shouldve been aired years ago but im not sure everybody felt that way rebecca walked back inside and closed and locked the door dance glanced in through a gap in the curtain she saw linda reading the bible samantha looking at her cell phone undoubtedly thinking up some lie to tell her husband about her outoftown conference rebecca sat down and began covering her sketchpad with broad angry strokes the legacy of daniel pell and his family chapter kathryn dance had been gone a half hour when one of the deputies called the cabin to check up on the women everythings fine sam repliedapart from the broiling tensions inside the suite he had her make sure the windows and doors were locked she checked and confirmed that everything was secure sealed in nice and tight she felt a burst of anger that daniel pell had them trapped once again stuck in this little box of a cabin im going stir crazy rebecca announced ive got to get outside oh i dont think you should linda looked up sam noticed that the tattered bible had many fingerprints on the page it was open to she wondered what particular passages had given her so much comfort she wished she could turn to something so simple for peace of mind rebecca shrugged im just going out there a little ways she gestured toward point lobos state park really i dont think you should lindas voice was brittle ill be careful ill wear my galoshes and look both ways she was trying to make a joke but it fell flat its stupid but do what you want rebecca said look im sorry about last night i drank too much fine linda said distractedly and continued to read her bible sam said youll get wet ill go to one of the shelters i want to do some drawing rebecca pulled on her leather jacket unlatched the back door and picking up her sketchpad and box of pencils stepped outside sam saw her looking back and could easily read the regret in the womans face for her vicious words last night lock it after me sam went to the door and put the chain on double locked it she watched the woman walking down the path wishing she hadnt gone but for an entirely different reason than her safety she was now alone with linda no more excuses yes or no sam continued the internal debate that had begun several days ago prompted by kathryn dances invitation to come to monterey and help them come back rebecca she thought no stay away i dont think she shouldve done that linda muttered should we tell the guards what good would it do shes a big girl a grimace shell tell you so herself sam said those things that happened to her with her father thats so terrible i had no idea linda continued to read then she looked up they want to kill him you know what theyre not going to give daniel a chance sam didnt respond she was still hoping rebecca would return hoping she wouldnt with an edge to her voice linda said he can be saved hes not hopeless but they want to gun him down on sight be rid of him of course they do sam thought as to the question of his redemption that was unanswerable in her mind that rebeccajust like i remember her linda grunted sam said whatre you reading linda asked would you know if i told you the chapter and verse no so linda started to read but then she looked up from the holy book again she was wrong what rebecca said it wasnt a nest of selfdeception or whatever she thinks sam was silent okay she told herself go ahead nows the time i know she was wrong about one thing whats that sam exhaled long i wasnt a mouse all the time oh that dont take it seriously i never said you were i stood up to him once i told him no she gave a laugh ought to get a tshirt printed up i told daniel pell no lindas lips pressed together the attempt at humor fell leaden between them walking to the tv sam shut it off sat down in an armchair leaning forward lindas voice was wary as she said this is going somewhere i can tell but im not in the mood to get beat up again its about beating me up not you what a few deep breaths about the time i said no to daniel sam do you know why i came down here a grimace to help capture the evil escapee to save lives you felt guilty you wanted a nice drive in the country i dont have any idea sam why did you come i came because kathryn said youd be here and i wanted to see you youve had eight years why now i thought about tracking you down before i almost did once but i couldnt i needed an excuse some motivation you needed daniel to escape from prison for motivation whats this all about linda set the bible down open samantha kept staring at the pencil notes in the margins they were dense as bees clustered in a hive you remember that time you were in the hospital of course in a soft voice the woman was gazing steadily at sam wary the spring before the croyton murders pell had told sam he was serious about retreating to the wilderness but he wanted to increase the size of the family first i want a son pell had announced with all the bluntness of a medieval king bent on heirs a month later linda was pregnant and a month after that shed miscarried their absence of insurance relegated them to a line at a lowertier hospital in the barrio frequented by pickers and illegals the resulting infection led to a hysterectomy linda was devastated shed always wanted children shed told sam often that she was meant to be a mother and aware of how badly her parents had raised her she knew how to excel at the role why are you bringing this up now sam picked up a cup filled with tepid tea because it wasnt supposed to be you who got pregnant it was supposed to be me you sam nodded he came to me first he did tears stung sams eyes i just couldnt go through with it i couldnt have his baby if i did hed have control over me for the rest of my life no point in holding back sam reflected she gazed at the table and said so i lied i said you werent sure you wanted to stay in the family ever since rebecca joined you were thinking about leaving you what i know she wiped her face im sorry i told him that if you had his baby itd show how much he wanted you to stay linda blinked she looked around the room picked up and rubbed the cover of the holy book sam continued and now you cant have children at all i took them away from you i had to choose between you and me and i chose me linda stared at a bad picture in a nice frame why are you telling me this now guilt i guess shame so this confession then thats about you too right no its about us all of us us all right rebeccas a bitch the word felt alien in her mouth she couldnt remember the last time shed used it she doesnt think before she says things but she was right linda none of usre leading normal lives rebecca should have a gallery and be married to some sexy painter and be flying around the world but shes jumping from older man to older manwe know why now and you should have a real life get married adopt kids a ton and spoil em like crazy not spend your time in soup kitchens and caring for children you see for two months and never again and maybe you could even give your dad and mom a call no linda it isnt a rich life youre living and youre miserable you know you are youre hiding behind that a nod at the bible and me she laughed well im hiding even deeper than you are sam rose and sat next to linda who leaned away the escape daniel coming back like thisits a chance for us to fix things look here we are the three of us in a room together again we can help each other and what about now sam wiped her face now do you have children you havent told us a thing about your mysterious life a nod i have a son whats his name my whats his name sam hesitated peter is he a nice boy linda is he a nice boy i asked linda you think it wasnt so bad back then in the family and youre right but not because of daniel because of us we filled all those gaps in our lives that rebecca was talking about we helped each other and then it fell apart and were back to where we started but we can help each other again like real sisters sam leaned forward and gripped the bible you believe in this right you think things happen for a purpose well i think we were meant to get back together to give us this chance to fix our lives oh but mine is perfectly fine linda said evenly pulling the bible away from sams trembling fingers work on yours as much as you want daniel pell parked the camry in a deserted lot off highway near carmel river state beach beside a sign that warned of the dangerous waters here he was alone in the car he caught a whiff of jennies perfume slipping his pistol into a pocket of the windbreaker he climbed out of the car that perfume again noticing jennie marstons blood in the crescent of his nails he spit on his fingers and wiped it but couldnt remove all of the crimson stain pell looked around at the meadows the cypress and pine and oak woods and the rugged outcroppings of granite and carmelo formation rock in the gray ocean sea lions seals and otters swam and played a halfdozen pelicans flew in perfect formation over the uneasy surface and two gulls fought relentlessly for a scrap of food washed up on the shore head down pell moved south through the thick trees there was a path nearby but he didnt dare take it though the park seemed deserted he couldnt risk being seen as he headed for his destination the point lobos inn the rain had stopped but the overcast was heavy and more sprinkles seemed likely the air was cold and thick with the scent of pine and eucalyptus after ten minutes he came to the dozen cabins of the inn crouching he circled to the rear of the place and continued pausing to get his bearings and look for police he froze gripping his gun when a deputy appeared surveyed the grounds then returned to the front of the cabin easy he told himself nows not the time to be careless take your time he walked for five minutes through the fragrant misty forest about a hundred yards away invisible to the cabins and the deputy was a small clearing inside which was a shelter someone sat at a picnic bench underneath it pells heart gave an uncharacteristic thud the woman was looking out over the ocean a pad of paper was in her hand and she was sketching whatever she was drawing he knew it would be good rebecca sheffield was talented he remembered when theyd met a cool clear day by the beach shed squinted up from the low chair in front of her easel near where the family had a booth at a flea market hey howd you like me to do your portrait i guess how much youll be able to afford it take a seat he looked around once more and not seeing anyone else made his way toward the woman who was oblivious to his approach wholly focused on the scenery on the motion of her pencil pell closed the distance quickly until he was right behind her he paused hello he whispered she gasped dropped the pad and stood turning quickly jesus a moment of silence then rebeccas face lurched into a smile as she stepped forward the wind slapped them hard and nearly carried off her words damn i missed you come here lovely he said and pulled her toward him chapter theyd moved into the grove of trees so there was no chance of being spotted by anyone at the motel they know about jennie rebecca said i know i saw it on the tv he grimaced she left something in the room they tracked her down and he shrugged she wont be a problem glanced down at the blood in his nails lovely if you hadnt called i dont know what wouldve happened pell had left a message on rebeccas voice mail at home giving her the name of the sea view motel the call hed received there supposedly from housekeeping was from rebecca telling him in a frantic whisper that the police were on their waykathryn dance had asked if the women would help out in the event pell took hostages he hadnt wanted jennie to know about rebecca yet so hed come up with the story about the maids that was lucky rebecca said wiping a coating of mist from her face pell thought she did look pretty good jennie was fine in bed but less of a challenge rebecca could keep you going all night jennie needed sex to validate herself rebecca simply needed sex he got a twist inside him the bubble expanding how are my little gals holding up under the pressure bickering and driving me fucking crazy i mean its like not a days gone by same as eight years ago except lindas a biblethumper and sam isnt sam changed her name and shes got boobs too and theyre helping the cops theyre actually doing that oh you bet i tried to lead things off as best i could but i couldnt be too obvious about it and they dont guess anything about you nope pell kissed her again youre the best baby im free only cause of you jennie marston had been just a pawn in the escape it was rebecca whod planned everything after his appeal was finally rejected pell had begun thinking about escape hed managed some unsupervised phone time in capitola and spoken to rebecca for some time shed been considering how to break pell out but thered been no opportunities until recently when rebecca told him shed come up with an idea she had read about the unsolved robert herron killingwhich pell had nothing to do withand decided to make him the prime suspect so hed be transferred to a lowersecurity facility for the indictment and trial rebecca had found some of his tools which shed had from the days of the family in seaside and slipped them into his aunts garage in bakersfield pell had sifted through his fan letters to look for a candidate whod help he settled on jennie marston a woman in southern california who suffered from the disease of badboy worship she seemed wonderfully desperate and vulnerable pell had limited access to computers so rebecca had set up an untraceable email address and masqueraded as pell to win jennies heart and work out the plan one reason theyd picked her was that jennie lived only an hour or so away from rebecca who could check her out and learn details of her life to make it seem that she and pell had some spiritual connection oh youre so much like me honey its like were two sides of the same coin the love of cardinals and hummingbirds the color green mexican comfort food it doesnt take much in this mean world to make somebody like jennie marston your soul mate finally rebecca as pell convinced jennie that he was innocent of the croyton killings and got her to agree to help him escape rebecca had come up with the idea for the gas bombs after scoping out the salinas lockup and the deliveryservice schedules at the you mail it franchise shed sent the woman instructions stealing the hammer making up the fake wallet planting them in salinas and then how to construct the gas bomb and where to buy the fire suit and bag rebecca had checked with jennie via email and then when everything seemed in order posted the message on the manslaughter bulletin board that everything was in place pell now asked her that was sam when i phoned wasnt it the callthirty minutes agopurporting to be the guard checking up on them was pell the arrangement hed made with rebecca was that hed ask whoever answeredif she didntto check the window locks that meant hed be there soon and rebecca was supposed to go to the shelter and wait for him she didnt catch on the poor things still a little mouse she just doesnt get it i want to get out of here as soon as possible lovely whats our time like wont be long now pell said ive got her address dances oh one thing youll want to know her kids arent at home she didnt say where they are but i found a stuart danceprobably her father or brotherin the phone book id guess theyre there oh and theres a cop guarding them theres no husband a widow right howd you know just did how old are the kids i dont know does it matter no rebecca eased back and studied him for an undocumented alien you look pretty damn good you really do her arms looped him the nearness of her body bathed in air fragrant with ripe sea vegetation and pine added to his already stoked arousal he slipped his hand into the small of her back the pressure inside him growing he kissed her hungrily tongue slipping into her mouth danielnot now i have to get back but pell hardly heard the words he led her farther into the forest put his hands on her shoulders and started to push her down she held up a finger then set her sketchpad on the wet ground cardboard base down she knelt on it theyd wonder how i got wet knees and began to unzip his jeans that was rebecca he reflected always thinking michael oneil finally called she was glad to hear his voice though the tone was purely professional and she knew he didnt want to talk about their fight earlier he was she sensed still angry which was odd for him it bothered her but there was no time to consider their grievances given his news got a call from chp oneil said some hikers halfway to big sur found a purse and some personal effects on the beach jennie marstons no body yet but there was blood all over the sand and blood and some hairs and scalp tissue on a rock that crime scene found pells printsre on the rock the coast guard has two boats out looking there wasnt anything helpful in the purse id and credit cards if thats where she kept whats left of the ninetytwo hundred dollars pells got it now he killed her dance closed her eyes pell had seen her picture on tv and knew shed been identified shed become a liability to him a second suspect logarithmically increases the chances for detection and arrest im sorry oneil said hed understand what she was thinkingthat dance never would have guessed releasing the womans picture would result in her death i believed it would be just another way to help find this terrible man the detective said it was the right call we had to do it we she noted not you how long ago crime scenes estimating an hour were checking along one and the cross roads but no witnesses thanks michael she said nothing more waiting for him to say something else something about their earlier discussion something about kellogg didnt matter what just some words that would give her a chance to broach the subject but he said merely im making plans for a memorial service for juan ill let you know the details thanks bye click she called kellogg and overby with the news her boss was debating whether it was good or bad someone else had been killed on his watch but at least it was one of the perps on the whole he suggested the press and public would receive the development as a score for the good guys dont you think kathryn dance had no chance to formulate an answer though because just then the cbis front desk called on the intercom to tell her the news that theresa croyton the sleeping doll had arrived the girl didnt resemble what kathryn dance expected in baggy sweats theresa croyton bolling was tall and slim and wore her light brown hair long to the middle of her back the strands had a reddish sheen four metallic dots were in her left ear five in the other and the majority of her fingers were encircled by silver rings her face free of makeup was narrow and pretty and pale morton nagle ushered the girl and her aunt a solid woman with short gray hair into dances office mary bolling was somber and cautious and it was obvious that this was the last place in the world she wanted to be hands were shaken and greetings exchanged the girls was casual and friendly if a bit nervous the aunts stiff nagle would want to stay of coursetalking to the sleeping doll had been his goal even before pells escape but some bargain had apparently been struck that hed take a backseat for the time being he now said hed be at home if anybody needed him dance gave him a sincere thank you goodbye mr nagle theresa said he nodded a friendly farewell to both of themthe teenager and the woman whod tried to gun him down she looked as if shed like a second opportunity nagle gave one of his chuckles tugged up his saggy pants and left thank you for coming you go by theresa mostly tare dance said to her aunt do you mind if i talk to your niece alone its okay this was from the girl the aunt hesitated its okay the girl repeated more firmly a hit of exasperation like musicians with their instruments young people can get an infinite variety of sounds out of their voices dance had arranged a room at a chain motel near cbi headquarters it was booked under one of the fictional names she sometimes used for witnesses tj escorted the aunt to the office of albert stemple who would take her to the motel and wait with her when they were alone dance came out from around the desk and closed her door she didnt know if the girl had hidden memories to be tapped some facts that could help lead them to pell but she was going to try to find out it would be difficult though despite the girls strong personality and her gutsy foray here shed be doing what every other seventeenyearold in the universe would do at a time like this raising subconscious barriers to protect herself from the pain of recollection dance would get nothing from her until those barriers were lowered in her interrogations and interviews the agent didnt practice classic hypnosis she did though know that subjects who were relaxed and not focused on external stimuli could remember events that otherwise they might not the agent directed theresa to the comfortable couch and shut off the bright overhead light leaving a single yellow desk lamp burning you comfortable sure i guess still she clasped her hands together shoulders up and smiled at dance with her lips taut stress the agent noted that man mr nagle said you wanted to ask me about what happened the night my parents and brother and sister were killed thats right i know you were asleep at the time but what i know you were asleep during the murders who told you that well all the news storiesthe police no no i was awake dance blinked in surprise you were the girls expression was even more surprised like yeah i mean i thought thats why you wanted to see me chapter go ahead tare dance felt her heart tapping fast was this the portal to an overlooked clue that might lead to daniel pells purpose here the girl tugged at her earlobe the one with five dots of metal in it and the top of her shoe rose slightly indicating she was curling her toes stress i was asleep earlier for a while yeah i wasnt feeling good but then i woke up i had a dream i dont remember what it was but i think it was scary i woke myself up with a noise kind of moaning you know how that happens sure or shouting only her voice faded she was squeezing her ear again youre not sure it was you making the noise it mightve been somebody else the girl swallowed shed be thinking that the sound had perhaps come from one of her dying family members right do you remember what time the tods were between six thirty and eight dance recalled but theresa couldnt remember for sure she guessed around seven you stayed in bed uhhuh did you hear anything after that yeah voices i couldnt hear them real well i was you know groggy but i definitely heard them who was it i dont know mens voices but definitely not my father or brother i remember that tare did you tell anybody this back then yeah she nodded but nobody was interested how on earth had reynolds missed it well tell me now what did you hear there were like a couple of things first of all i heard somebody mention money four hundred dollars i remember that exactly pell had been found with more than that when he was arrested maybe he and newberg were going through croytons wallet and commenting on how much money was inside or was the phrase actually four hundred thousand what else okay then somebodya man but somebody differentsaid something about canada and somebody else asked a question about quebec and what was the question he just wanted to know what quebec was somebody not knowing about quebec dance wondered if that was newbergthe women had said that while he was a genius at woodworking electronics and computers he was pretty damaged otherwise thanks to drugs so a canadian connection is that where pell wanted to escape to a lot easier to get through that border than going south a lot of mountaintops too dance smiled and sat forward go on tare youre doing great then theresa continued somebody was talking about used cars another man he had a really low voice he talked fast usedcar dealerships were popular venues for money laundering or they might have been talking about getting a car for their escape and it hadnt been just pell and newberg somebody else was there a third person did your father do business in canada i dont know he traveled a lot but i dont think he ever mentioned canada i could never figure out why the police back then didnt ask me more about it but since pell was in jail it didnt matter but now that hes outever since mr nagle said you needed help finding the killer ive been trying to make sense out of what i heard maybe you can figure it out i hope i can anything else no it was about then that i guess i fell back asleep and the next thing i knew she swallowed again there was this woman in a uniform there a policewoman she had me get dressed andthat was it dance reflected four hundred dollars a car dealership a french canadian province and a third man was pell intent on heading north now at the very least shed call homeland security and immigration they could keep an eye on the northern border crossings dance tried again walking the girl through the events of that terrible night but the efforts were useless she knew nothing more four hundred dollarscanadawhats quebecused carsdid they contain the key to the daniel pell conspiracy and then dance had a thought that surprisingly involved her own family herself wes and maggie an idea occurred to her she ran through the facts of the murder in her mind impossiblebut then the theory grew more likely though she didnt like the conclusion she reluctantly asked tare you said this was around seven pm or so yeah maybe where did your family eat where the den most of the time we werent allowed to use the dining room that was just for like formal things did you watch tv while you were having dinner yeah a lot me and my brother and sister at least and was the den near your bedroom like right down the stairs how did you know did you ever watch jeopardy she frowned yeah tare im wondering if maybe the voices you heard were from the show maybe somebody picking the category of geography for four hundred dollars and the answer was the frenchspeaking province of canada the question would be what is quebec the girl fell silent her eyes were still no she said firmly shaking her head no that wasnt it im sure and the voice talking about the dealershipcould it have been a commercial somebody talking fast in a low voice like they do on car ads the girls face flushed with dismay then anger no but maybe dance asked gently theresas eyes closed no a whisper then i dont know that was why reynolds hadnt pursued the childs testimony he too had figured out she was talking about a tv show theresas shoulders slumped forward collapsing in on themselves it was a very subtle movement but dance could clearly read the kinesic signal of defeat and sorrow the girl had been so certain that shed remembered something helpful to find the man whod killed her family now she realized that her courageous trip here defying her auntthe efforts had been pointless she was crestfallen im sorry tears pooled in her eyes kathryn dance smiled tare dont worry its nothing she gave the girl a kleenex nothing its terrible i wanted to help so bad another smile oh tare believe me were just getting warmed up in her seminars dance told the story of the city slicker stopping in a small town to ask a farmer directions the stranger looks at the dog sitting at the mans feet and says your dog bite the farmer says no and when the stranger reaches down to pet the dog he gets bitten the man jumps back and angrily says you said your dog didnt bite the farmer replies mine doesnt this here dogs not mine the art of interviewing isnt only about analyzing the subjects answers and their body language and demeanor its also about asking the right questions the facts about the croytons murders and every moment afterward had been documented by police and reporters so kathryn dance decided to inquire about the one period of time that no one had apparently ever asked about before the murders tare i want to hear about what happened earlier earlier sure lets start with earlier that day theresa frowned oh i dont even remember much about it i mean what happened that night it kind of shoved everything else away give it a try think back it was may you were in school then right yeah what day of the week um it was friday you remembered that pretty fast oh because on a lot of fridays dadd take us kids places that day we were going to the carnival rides in santa cruz only everything got messed up because i got sick theresa thought back rubbing her eyes brenda and stevemy sister and brotherand i were going and mom stayed at home because she had a benefit or something on saturday she had to work on but plans got changed right we were like on our way but she looked down i got sick in the car so we turned around and went home what did you have a cold stomach flu theresa winced and touched her belly oh i just hate that yeah it sucks and you got back home about when five thirty maybe and you went straight to bed yeah thats right she looked out the window at the gnarled tree and then you woke up hearing the tv show the girl twined a brown strand of hair around a finger quebec a laughing grimace at this point kathryn dance paused she realized she had a decision to make an important one because there was no doubt that theresa was being deceptive when shed been making casual conversation and later talking about what theresa had overheard from the tv room the girls kinesic behavior was relaxed and open though she obviously was experiencing general stressanyone whos talking to a police officer as part of an investigation even an innocent victim experiences this but as soon as she started talking about the trip to the santa cruz boardwalk she displayed hesitations of speech she covered parts of her face and earnegation gesturesand looked out the windowaversion trying to appear calm and casual she revealed the stress she was experiencing by bobbing her foot dance sensed deception stress patterns and that the girl was in the denial response state everything theresa was telling her was presumably consistent with facts that dance could verify but deception includes evasion and omission as well as outright lying there were things theresa wasnt sharing tare something troubling happened on the drive didnt it troubling no really i swear a triple play there two denial flag expressions along with answering a question with a question now the girl was flushed and her foot bobbed again an obvious cluster of stress responses go on tell me its all right theres nothing you have to worry about tell me like you know my parents my brother and sisterthey were killed who wouldnt be upset a bit of anger now dance nodded sympathetically i mean before that youve left carmel youre driving to santa cruz youre not feeling well you go home other than being sick what was there about that drive that bothered you i dont know i cant remember that sentence from a person in a denial state means i remember perfectly well but i dont want to think about it the memorys too painful youre driving along and i theresa began then she fell silent and lowered head to hands breaking into tears a torrent accompanied by the sound track of breathless sobbing tare dance rose and handed her a wad of tissues as the girl cried hard though quietly the sobs like hiccups its okay the agent said compassionately gripping her arm whatever happened its fine dont worry i the girl was paralyzed dance could see she was trying to make a decision which way would it go the agent wondered shed either spill everything or stonewallin which case the interview was now over finally she said oh ive wanted to tell somebody i just couldnt not the counselors or friends my aunt more sobbing collapsed chest chin down hands in her lap when not mopping her face the textbook kinesic signs that theresa croyton had moved into the acceptance stage of emotional response the terrible burden of what shed been living with was finally going to come out she was confessing its my fault its all my fault theyre dead now she pressed her head back against the couch her face was red tendons rose tears stained the front of her sweater brenda and steve and mom and dadall because of me because you got sick no because i pretended to be sick tell me i didnt want to go to the boardwalk i couldnt stand going i hated it all i could think of was to pretend to be sick i remembered about these models who put their fingers down their throats so they throw up and dont get fat when we were in the car on the highway i did that when nobody was looking i threw up in the backseat and said i had the flu it was all gross and everybody was mad and dad turned around and drove back home so that was it the poor girl was convinced it was her fault her familyd been slaughtered because of the lie she told shed lived with this terrible burden for eight years one truth had been excavated but at least one more remained and kathryn dance wanted to unearth this one as well tell me tare why didnt you want to go to the pier i just didnt it wasnt fun confessing one lie doesnt lead automatically to confessing them all the girl had now slipped into denial once again why you can tell me go on i dont know it just wasnt fun why not well dad was always busy so hed give us money and tell us hed pick us up later and hed go off and make phone calls and things it was boring her feet tapped again and she squeezed the rightside earrings in a compulsive pattern top bottom then the middle the stress was eating her up yet it wasnt only the kinesics that were sending significant deception signals to kathryn dance childreneven a seventeenyearold high school studentare often hard to analyze kinesically most interviewers of youngsters perform a contentbased analysis judging their truth or deception by what they say not how they say it what theresa was telling dance didnt make senseboth in terms of the story she was offering and in terms of dances knowledge of children and the place in question wes and maggie for instance loved the santa cruz boardwalk and would have leapt at the chance to spend hours there unsupervised with a pocketful of money there were hundreds of things for children to do carnival rides food music games and another contradiction dance noted why hadnt theresa simply said she wanted to stay home with her mother before they left that friday and let her father and siblings go without her it was as if she didnt want them to go to santa cruz either dance considered this for a moment a to b tare you were saying your father worked and made phone calls when you and your brother and sister went on the rides she looked down yeah i guess where would he go to make the calls i dont know he had a cell phone not a lot of people had them then but he did did he ever meet anybody there i dont know maybe tare who were these other people the ones hed be with she shrugged were they other women no you sure theresa was silent looking everywhere but at dance finally she said maybe some yeah and you think they mightve been girlfriends of his a nod tears again through clenched teeth she began and what tare he said when we got home if mom asked we were supposed to say he was with us her face was flushed now dance recalled that reynolds hinted croyton was a womanizer a bitter laugh escaped the girls trembling lips i saw him brenda and me we were supposed to stay on the boardwalk but we went to an ice cream place across beach street and i saw him there was this woman getting into his car and he was kissing her and she wasnt the only one i saw him later with somebody else going into her apartment or house by the beach thats why i didnt want him to go there i wanted him to go back home and be with mommy and us i didnt want him to be with anybody else she wiped her face and so i lied she said simply i pretended i was sick so hed meet his mistresses in santa cruzand take his own children with him to allay his wifes suspicion abandoning them till he and his lover were finished and my family got killed and it was my fault dance leaned forward and said no no tare its not your fault at all were pretty sure daniel pell intended to kill your father it wasnt random if hed come by that night and you werent there he wouldve left and come back when your dad was home she grew quiet yeah dance wasnt sure about this at all but she absolutely couldnt let the girl live with the terrible burden of her guilt yeah theresa calmed at this tentative comfort stupid she was embarrassed its all so stupid i wanted to come help you catch him and i havent done anything except act like a baby oh were doing fine dance said with significance reflecting some intriguing thoughts shed just had we are yepin fact ive just thought of some more questions i hope youre up for them dances stomach gave a peculiar and opportune growl just at that moment they both laughed and the agent added provided therere two frappuccinos and a cookie or two in the near future theresa wiped her eyes i could go for that yeah dance called rey carraneo and set him on the mission of collaring some sustenance from starbucks she then made another call this one was to tj telling him to remain in the office she believed thered be a change of plans a to b to x chapter parked up the road from the point lobos inn out of sight of the guards daniel pell continued to stare at a space between the cypress trees come on he muttered and then just a few seconds later there she was rebecca hurrying through the bushes with her backpack she climbed into the car and kissed him firmly she sat back shitty weather she said grinned and kissed him again sorry im late nobody saw you a laugh climbed out the window they think i went to bed early he put the car in gear and they started up the highway this was daniel pells last night in the monterey peninsulaand in a way his last night on earth later theyd steal another caran suv or truckand head north winding along the increasingly narrow and rugged roads of northern california until they came to pells mountain property hed be king of the mountain king of a new family not answering to anybody no one to interfere no one to challenge him a dozen young people two dozen seduced by the pied piper heaven but first his mission here he had to make certain his future was guaranteed pell handed her the map of monterey county she opened a slip of paper and read the street and number as she studied the map its not too far shouldnt take us more than fifteen minutes edie dance glanced out the window of the front of her house and observed the police car it certainly made her feel comfortable with an escaped killer somewhere in the area and she appreciated the fact that katie was looking out for them still it wasnt daniel pell who occupied her thoughts but juan millar edie was tired the old bones not behaving and she was grateful shed decided not to work overtimeit was always available for any nurse who wanted it death and taxes werent the only certain aspects of life the need for health care was a third and edie dance would have a career for as long as she wished anywhere she wished she couldnt understand her husbands preference for marine over human life people were so fascinating helping them reassuring them taking away their pain kill me stuart would be back with the children soon she loved her grandchildren of course but she also truly enjoyed their company edie knew how lucky she was that katie lived nearby so many of her friends had children hundreds even thousands of miles away yes she was happy wes and mags were staying here but shed be a lot happier when that terrible man was arrested again and thrown back in jail katies becoming a cbi agent had always bothered her a lotstu actually seemed pleased which irritated her all the more edie dance would never suggest a woman give up a careershed worked all her lifebut my god carrying around a gun and arresting murderers and drug dealers edie would never say it but her secret desire was that her daughter would meet another man remarry and abandon police work katie had been a successful jury consultant why not go back to that and she and martine christensen had that wonderful website which actually made a little money if the women devoted themselves to it fulltime think how successful it could be edie had loved her soninlaw dearly bill swenson was sweet funny a great father and the accident that had taken his life was a true tragedy but that was several years ago now it was time for her daughter to move on too bad michael oneil wasnt available he and katie were a perfect match edie couldnt see why on earth he was with that prima donna anne who seemed to treat her children like christmas decorations and cared more about her gallery than her home then that fbi agent at stus party winston kellogg seemed pretty nice too he reminded edie of bill and then there was brian gunderson the man katied dated recently edie never worried about her daughters good sense when it came to picking partners her problem was like the one plaguing edies golf swingthe followthrough and she knew the source katied told her about wes his unhappiness at his moms dating edie had been in nursing for a long time both pediatric and adult shed seen how controlling children can be how clever and manipulative even subconsciously her daughter had to approach the subject but she simply wouldnt her approach was duck and cover but it wasnt edies role to talk to the boy directly grandparents have the unqualified joy of childrens company but the price for that is abdicating much of the right to parental intervention edied said her piece to katie whod agreed but apparently ignored her completely by breaking up with brian and the woman cocked her head a noise from outside the backyard she glanced up to see if stu had arrived no the carport was empty except for her prius looking out the front window she saw the police officer was still there then she heard the sound again the clatter of rocks edie and stu lived off ocean on the long hill descending from downtown to carmel beach their backyard was a stepped series of gardens boarded by rock walls walking the short path to or from the neighbors adjoining backyard sometimes set loose a tiny spill of gravel down the face of those walls thats what the noise sounded like she walked to the back deck and opened the door stepped outside she couldnt see anyone and heard nothing else probably just a cat or a dog they werent supposed to run free carmel had strict pet laws but the town was also very animal friendly the actress doris day owned a wonderful hotel here where pets were welcome and several cats and dogs roamed the neighborhood she closed the door and hearing stus car pull into the driveway forgot all about the noise edie dance walked to the refrigerator to find a snack for the children the interview with the sleeping doll had come to an intriguing conclusion back in her office dance called and checked up on the girl and her aunt both safely ensconced in the motel and protected by a pound monolith of a cbi agent who carried two large weapons they were fine albert stemple reported then added the girls nice i like her the aunt you can keep dance read over the notes shed taken in the interview then read them again finally she called tj your genie awaits boss bring me what weve got so far on pell the whole ball of wax whatever that means all the wax dance was reviewing james reynoldss notes from the croyton murder case when tj arrivedonly three or four minutes later breathless maybe her voice had sounded more urgent than shed realized she took the files he carted and spread them out until they covered her desk an inch thick in a short time theyd accumulated an astonishing amount of material she began riffling through the pages the girl was she helpful yep the agent replied absently staring at a particular sheet of paper tj made another comment but she wasnt paying any attention flipping through more reports more pages of handwritten notes and looking over reynoldss time line and his other transcriptions then returning to the piece of paper she held finally she said ive got a computer question you know a lot about them go check this out she circled some words on the sheet he glanced down what about it its fishy not a computer term im familiar with but im on the case boss we never sleep weve got a situation dance was addressing charles overby winston kellogg and tj they were in overbys office and he was playing with a bronze golf ball mounted on a wooden stand like a gearshift in a sports car she wished michael oneil were here dance then dropped the bomb rebecca sheffields working with pell what overby blurted it gets better i think she was behind the whole escape her boss shook his head the theory troubling him he was undoubtedly wondering if hed authorized something he shouldnt have but winston kellogg encouraged her interesting go on theresa croyton told me a few things that made me suspicious so i went back and looked over the evidence so far remember that email we found in the sea view supposedly pell sent it to jennie from prison but look she showed the printout the email address says capitola correctional but it has a dot com extension if it was really a department of corrections address it wouldve had dot ca dot gov kellogg grimaced hell yes missed that completely i just had tj check out the address the young agent explained the companys a service provider in denver you can create your own domain as long as the names not taken by somebody else its an anonymous account but were getting a warrant to look at the archives anonymous then why do you think it was rebecca overby asked look at the email that phrase who could ask for anything more in a girl its not that common it stuck with me because it echoes a line in an old gershwin song why is that important because rebecca used the exact expression the first time i met her overby said still she pushed forward not in the mood to be obstructed now lets look at the facts jennie stole the thunderbird from that restaurant in la on friday and checked into the sea view on saturday her phone and credit card records show she was in orange county all last week but the woman who checked out the you mail it office near the courthouse was there on wednesday we faxed a warrant to rebeccas credit card companies she flew from san diego to monterey on tuesday flew back on thursday rented a car here okay overby allowed now im guessing that in capitola it wasnt jennie that pell was talking to it was rebecca he mustve given her jennies name and street and email address rebecca took over from there they picked her because she lived near rebecca at least close enough to check her out kellogg added so she knows where pell is what hes doing here has to overby said lets pick her up you can work your magic kathryn i want her in custody but i need some more information before i interrogate her i want to talk to nagle the writer she nodded then said to kellogg can you bring rebecca in sure if you can get some backup for me overby said hed call the mcso and have another officer meet kellogg outside the point lobos inn the agent in charge surprised dance by pointing out something she hadnt thought of they had no reason to think rebecca was armed but since shed driven from san diego and not gone through airport security she could have a weapon with her dance said good charles then a nod at tj lets go see nagle dance and the younger agent were en route to their destination when her phone rang hello winston kellogg said in an uncharacteristically urgent voice kathryn shes gone rebecca yes are the others okay theyre fine linda said rebecca wasnt feeling well went to lie down didnt want to be disturbed we found her bedroom window open but her cars still at cbi so pell picked her up im guessing how long ago she went to bed an hour ago they dont know when she slipped out if rebecca had wanted to hurt the other women she couldve done it herself or snuck pell in through the window dance decided they werent at immediate risk especially with the guards where are you now she asked kellogg going back to cbi i think pell and rebecca are making a run for it ill talk to michael about getting roadblocks set up again when they hung up she called morton nagle hello he answered its kathryn listen rebeccas with pell what he kidnapped her theyre working together she was behind the escape no they might be headed out of town but theres a chance youre in danger me lock your doors dont let anybody in were on our way ill be there in five minutes it took them closer to ten even with tjs aggressivehe called it assertivedriving the roads were crowded with tourists getting an early start on the weekend they skidded to a stop in front of the house and walked to the front door dance knocked the writer answered a moment later he glanced past her at tj then scanned the street the agents stepped inside nagle closed the door his shoulders slumped im sorry the writers voice broke he told me if i gave anything away on the phone hed kill my family im so sorry daniel pell standing behind the door touched the back of her head with a pistol chapter its my friend the cat to my mouse with the funny name kathryn dance nagle continued when you phoned your number came up on caller id he made me tell him who it was i had to say everything was fine i didnt want to but my children i its all right she began shhhhh mr writer and ms interrogator shush in the bedroom to the left dance could see nagles family lying bellydown on the floor their hands on top of their heads his wife joan and the childrenteenage eric and young round sonja rebecca was sitting on the bed over them holding a knife she gazed at dance without a fleck of emotion the only reason the family werent dead dance knew was that pell was controlling nagle through them patterns come on out here baby lend a hand rebecca slid off the bed and joined them get their guns and phones pell held the gun to dances ear while rebecca took her weapon then pell told her to cuff herself she did not tight enough he squeezed the bracelets and dance winced they did the same with tj and pushed both of them down on the couch watch it tj muttered pell said to dance listen to me you listening yes is anybody else coming i didnt call anyone thats not what i asked you being the ace interrogator ought to know that the essence of calm as far as i know no i was coming here to ask morton some questions pell set their phones on a coffee table if anybody calls you tell them that everythings fine youll be back at your headquarters in an hour or so but you cant talk now we clear on that if not i pick one of the kiddies in there and clear she said now no more words from anybody weve this is not smart tj said no no dance thought let him control you with daniel pell you cant be defiant pell stepped up to him and almost leisurely touched his gun to the mans throat what did i tell you the young mans flippancy was gone not to say a word but you did say something why would you do that what a stupid stupid thing to do hes going to kill him dance thought please no pell listen to me youre talking too the killer said and swung the gun toward her im sorry tj whispered thats more words pell turned to dance ive got a few questions for you and your little friend here but in a minute you sit tight enjoy the scene of domestic bliss then he said to nagle keep going nagle returned to what was apparently the task dance and tj had interrupted it seemed he was burning all of his notes and research material pell watched the bonfire and added absently and if you miss something and i find it i will cut your wifes fingers off then start on your kids and quit crying its not dignified have some control ten agonizing minutes of silence passed as nagle found his notes and tossed them into the fire dance knew that as soon as he finished and pell learned from her and tj what he needed to know theyd be dead nagles wife was sobbing she said leave us alone please please anythingill do anything please dance glanced into the bedroom where she lay beside sonja and eric the little girl was crying pathetically quiet there mrs writer dance glanced at her watch partly obscured by the cuffs she imagined what her own children were doing now the thought was too painful though and she forced herself to concentrate on what was happening in the room was there anything she could do bargain with him but to bargain you need something of value the other person wants resist but to resist you need weapons why are you doing this nagle moaned as the last of the notes went up in flames hush there pell rose and stirred the fire with a poker to keep the pages burning he dusted his hands off he held up his sooty fingers makes me feel at home ive been fingerprinted probably fifty times in my life i can always tell the new clerks their hands shake when they roll your fingers okay then he turned to dance now i understand from your call earlier to mr writer here you figured out about rebecca which is what i have to talk to you about what do you know about us and who else knows it weve got to make some plans and we need to know what to do next and understand this agent dance youre not the only one who can spot liars at fifty paces i have that gift too you and me were naturals whether she lied or not didnt matter they were all dead oh and i should say that rebecca found another address for me the home of one stuart dance dance felt this news like a slap in the face she struggled to keep from being sick a wash of heat scalding water enveloped her face and chest you son of a bitch tj raged and if you tell me the truth your mom and pop and kiddiesll be fine i was right about your brood wasnt i at our first gettogether and no husband you a poor widow rebecca tells me sorry about that anyway ill bet the kiddiesre with the grandfolks right now at that moment kathryn dance came to a decision it was a gamble and under other circumstances it would have been a difficult if not impossible choice now although the consequences would probably be tragic one way or the other there was no option no weaponsexcept words and her intuition a to b to x they would have to do dance shifted so she was facing pell directly arent you curious why were here thats a question i didnt want a question i wanted an answer make sure he remains in chargedaniel pells trademark please let me go on i am answering your question please let me pell looked her over with a frown he didnt object now think about it why would we come here in such a big hurry normally she would have used a subjects first name but doing so could be interpreted as an attempt to dominate and daniel pell needed to know he was in control he grimaced impatiently get to the point rebecca scowled shes stalling lets go baby dance said because i had to warn morton rebecca whispered lets just finish up and get going jesus were wasting quiet lovely pell turned his bright blue eyes back to dance just as hed done in salinas during their interview on monday it seemed like years ago yeah you wanted to warn him about me so no i wanted to warn him about rebecca whatre you talking about dance held pells eyes as she said i wanted to warn him that she was going to use you to kill him just like she used you at william croytons house eight years ago chapter dance saw the flicker in daniel pells otherworldly eyes shed touched something close to the god of control she used you this is such bullshit rebecca snapped probably pell said dance noted the conditional word not an absolute one the agent eased forward we believe that those who are physically closer to us tell the truth more than those leaning away she set you up daniel and you want to know why to kill william croytons wife he was shaking his head but he was listening to every word rebecca was croytons lover and when his wife wouldnt give him a divorce she decided to use you and jimmy newberg to kill her rebecca laughed harshly dance said you remember the sleeping doll daniel theresa croyton now she was using his first name shed established a bondby suggesting a common enemy he said nothing his eyes flicked to rebecca then back to dance who continued i just talked to the girl rebecca was shocked you what we had a long conversation it was quite revealing rebecca tried to recover daniel she didnt talk to her at all shes bluffing to save her ass but dance asked was jeopardy on the tv in the den the night you and newberg broke into the croytons she told me it was who else would have known that what is quebec the killer blinked dance saw she had his complete attention theresa told me that her father was having affairs hed drop the children off at the santa cruz boardwalk and then meet his lovers there one night croyton spotted rebecca doing sketches and picked her up they started an affair she wanted him to get a divorce but he wouldnt or couldnt because of his wife so rebecca decided to kill her oh this is ridiculous rebecca raged she doesnt know any of this but dance could see it was posed the woman was flushed and her hands and feet were flashing subtle but clear affect displays from the stress there was now no doubt that dance was on to something dance looked at him with steady eyes the boardwalkrebecca wouldve heard about you there wouldnt she daniel thats where the family went to sell things at flea markets and to steal and shoplift caused kind of a stir this cult of criminals gypsies they called you it made the news she needed a fall guy a killer linda told me you two met on the boardwalk you thought you seduced her no it was the other way around rebeccas voice remained calm shut up shes lying dan quiet pell snapped she joined your clan when not long before the croyton murders a few months dance pressed forward relentlessly rebecca talked her way into the family didnt it seem a little sudden didnt you wonder why she wasnt like the others linda and samantha and jimmy they were children theyd do what you wanted but rebecca was different independent aggressive dance recalled winston kelloggs comment about cult leaders women can be just as effective and as ruthless as men and often theyre more devious once she was in the family she saw right away that she could use jimmy newberg too she told him that croyton had something valuable in his house and he suggested that the two of you break in and steal it right dance saw that she was but rebecca had made other plans with jimmy once you were in the croytons house he was supposed to kill croytons wife then kill you with you gone he and rebecca could be in charge of course her idea was to turn jimmy in after the killingsor maybe even kill him herself william croyton would go through a suitable period of mourning and hed marry her honey no this is pell lunged forward and grabbed rebeccas short hair pulled her close dont say another word let her talk moaning in pain cringing she slipped to the floor with pells attention elsewhere dance caught tjs eye he nodded slowly she continued rebecca thought only croytons wife would be home but the whole family was there because theresa said she was sick whatever happened that nightonly you know that danielwhatever happened everybody ended up dead and when you called the family to tell them what happened rebecca did the only thing she could to save herself she turned you in shes the one who made the call that got you arrested thats bullshit rebecca said im the one who got him out of jail now dance laughed coldly she said to pell because she needed to use you again daniel to kill morton a few months ago she got a call from him and he tells her about the book the sleeping doll how hes going to write about the croytonstheir life before the murders and theresas life afterward she knows hed learn about the affairs croyton had it was just a matter of time before somebody put the pieces togetherthat she was behind a plot to murder croytons wife so rebecca came up with the plan to break you out of capitola one thing i dont know she added is what she said to you daniel to convince you to murder him she glanced angrily at rebecca as if she were offended by what the woman had done to her good friend daniel pell so what lies did you tell him pell shouted at rebecca what you told meis it true or not but before she could speak pell grabbed nagle who cringed that book youre writing what were you going to say about me it wasnt about you it was about theresa and the croytons and the girls in the family thats all it was about your victims not you pell pushed the man to the floor no no you were going to write about my land land yes whatre you talking about my land my mountaintop you found out where it was you were going to write about it in your book ah dance finally understood pells precious mountaintop rebecca had convinced him that the only way to keep it secret was to kill morton nagle and destroy the notes i dont know anything about that i swear pell looked him over closely he believed the writer dance could see as soon as you killed nagle and his family daniel you know what was coming next dont you rebecca was going to murder you claim you kidnapped her from the inn dance gave a sad laugh daniel you thought all along you were in charge but no she was svengali she was the pied piper pell blinked at her words then rose and charged toward rebecca knocking a table over as he lifted the gun the woman cringed but suddenly she too leapt forward swinging the knife madly slicing into pells arm grabbing at his gun the weapon went off the bullet digging a chunk of rosy brick out of the fireplace instantly dance and tj were on their feet the young agent kicked rebecca hard in the ribs and grabbed pells gun hand they wrestled for control of the weapon sliding to the floor call nineoneone dance shouted to nagle who scrabbled for a phone she started for the guns on the table recalling check your backdrop aim squeeze in bursts count the rounds at twelve drop the clip reload check your backdrop screaming from nagles wife wailing from his daughter kathryn tj shouted breathlessly she saw that pell was twisting the gun toward her it fired the bullet streaked past her tj was young and strong but his wrists were still cuffed and pell had desperation and adrenaline coursing through him with his free hand he pounded at tjs neck and head finally the killer broke away holding the gun as the young agent rolled desperately for cover under a table dance struggled forward but knew shed never make it to the weapons in time tj was dead then a huge explosion another dance dropped to her knees and looked behind her morton nagle had picked up one of their guns and was firing the weapon toward pell clearly unfamiliar with guns he jerked the trigger and the bullets were wide still he stood his ground and kept firing you son of a bitch crouching hands up in a futile effort to protect himself pell cringed hesitated a moment fired one round into rebeccas belly and then flung the door open and ran outside dance took the gun from nagle grabbed tjs as well and shoved it into his cuffed hands the agents got to the halfopen door just as a round slammed into the jamb peppering them with splinters they jumped back crouching she fished the cuff keys from her jacket and undid the bracelets tj did the same cautiously they glanced outside at the empty street a moment later they heard the screech of an accelerating car calling back to nagle keep rebecca alive we need her dance ran to her car and grabbed the microphone off the dash it slipped out of her shaking hands she took a breath controlled the tremors and called the monterey sheriffs office chapter an angry man is a man out of control but daniel pell couldnt staunch the rage as he sped away from monterey replaying what had just happened kathryn dances voice rebeccas face replaying the events of eight years ago too jimmy newberg the goddamn computer freak the doper had said that he had inside information about william croytonthanks to a programmer whod been fired six months earlier hed managed to find out croytons alarm code and had a key to the back door though pell now knew where hed gotten thosefrom rebecca of course jimmyd said too that the eccentric croyton kept huge amounts of cash in the house pell would never rob a bank or checkcashing operation nothing big but still he needed money to expand the family and to move to his mountaintop and here was a chance for a onceinalifetime breakin no one was going to be home jimmy said so thered be no risk of injuries theyd walk away with a hundred thousand dollars and croyton would make a routine call to the police and the insurance company then forget the matter just what kathryn dance had figured the two men had snuck through the backyard and made their way to the house through the sumptuous landscaping pell had seen the lights on but jimmy told him they were on a timer for security they slipped into the house through a side utility door but something wasnt right the alarm was off pell turned to jimmy to tell him that somebody must be home after all but the young man was already hurrying into the kitchen walking right up to the middleaged woman cooking dinner her back to him no pell remembered thinking in shock what was he doing murdering her it turned out using a paper towel jimmy pulled a steak knife from his pocketone from the familys house with pells fingerprints on it he realizedand gripping the woman around the mouth stabbed her deeply she slumped to the floor enraged pell whispered what the hell are you doing newberg turned and hesitated but his face was telegraphing what was coming when he lunged pell was already leaping aside he just managed to dodge the vicious blade pell swept up a frying pan smashed it into newbergs head he crashed to the floor and with a butcher knife from the counter pell killed him a moment later william croyton hurried into the kitchen hearing the noise of the struggle his two older children were behind him screaming as they stared at their mothers body pell pulled his gun out and forced the hysterical family into the pantry he finally calmed croyton down enough to ask about the money which the businessman said was in the desk in the groundfloor office daniel pell had found himself looking at the sobbing terrified family as if he were looking at weeds in a garden or crows or insects hed had no intention of killing anyone that night but to stay in control of his life he had no choice in two minutes they were all dead he used the knife so the neighbors would hear no gunshots pell had then wiped what fingerprints he could taken jimmys steak knife and all his id then run to the office where he found to his shock that yes there was money in the desk but only a thousand dollars a fast search of the master bedroom downstairs revealed only pocket change and costume jewelry he never even got upstairs where that little girl was in bed asleep he was now glad shed been up there ironically if hed killed her then he never wouldve learned about rebeccas betrayal and yes to the sound track of jeopardy hed run back to the kitchen where he pocketed the dead mans wallet and his wifes diamond cocktail ring then outside to his car and only a mile later he was pulled over by the police rebecca thinking back to meeting her for the first timethe coincidental meeting that shed apparently engineered near the boardwalk in santa cruz pell remembered how much he loved the boardwalk all the rides amusement parks fascinated him people giving up complete control to somebody elseeither risking harm on the roller coasters and parachute drops or becoming mindless laboratory rats on rides like the boardwalks famous hundredyearold looff carousel round and round remembered too rebecca eight years ago near that very same merrygoround gesturing him over hey howd you like me to do your portrait i guess how much youll be able to afford it take a seat and then after five minutes with only the basic features of his face sketched in shed lowered the charcoal stick looked him over and asked challenging if there was someplace private to go theyd walked to the van linda whitfield watching them with a solemn jealous face pell hardly noticed her and a few minutes later after kissing frantically his hands all over her shed eased back wait what hed wondered clap aids breathless shed said ihave to say something shed paused looking down go on you might not like this and if not okay well just call it quits and you get a picture for free but i feel this connection with you even after just a little while and ive got to say tell me when it comes to sex i dont really enjoy itunless you hurt me i mean really hurt me a lot of men dont like that and its okay his response was to roll her over on her taut little belly and pull off his belt he gave a grim laugh now it was all bullshit he realized somehow in that ten minutes on the beach and five minutes in the van shed tipped to his fantasy and played it for all it was worth svengali and trilby he now continued driving until his right arm began to throb with pain from rebeccas knife slash at nagles house he pulled over opened his shirt and looked at it not terriblethe bleeding was slowing but damn it hurt nothing like the slash of her betrayal though he was at the edge of the quiet portion of town and would have to continue through populated areas where the police would be looking for him everywhere he made a uturn and drove through the streets until he found an infiniti pausing at a stoplight ahead of him only one person inside no other cars were around pell slowed but didnt hit the brakes until he was right on top of the luxury car the bumpers tapped with a resonant thud the infiniti rolled forward a few feet the driver glared in his rearview mirror and got out pell shaking his head climbed out too he stood studying the damage werent you looking the driver of the infiniti was a middleaged latino man i just bought it last month he glanced up from the cars and frowned at the blood on pells arm are you hurt his eyes followed the stain down to pells hand where he saw the gun but by then it was too late chapter the first thing kathryn dance had done at nagles housewhile tj called in the escapewas to phone the deputy guarding her parents and children and have him take them under guard to cbi headquarters she doubted pell would waste time at this point carrying out his threats but she wasnt going to take any chances she now asked the writer and his wife if pell had said anything about where he might be fleeing especially his mountaintop nagle had been honest with pell hed never heard anything about an enclave in the wilderness he his wife and children could add nothing more rebecca was badly wounded and unconscious oneil had sent a deputy with her in the ambulance the moment she was able to talk hed call the detective dance now joined kellogg and oneil who stood nearby heads bowed as they discussed the case whatever personal reservations oneil had about the fbi man and vice versa you couldnt tell it from their posture and gesturing they were efficiently and quickly coordinating roadblocks and planning a search strategy oneil took a phone call he frowned okay sure call watsonville ill handle it he hung up and announced got a lead carjacking in marina man fitting pells descriptionand bleedingsnatched a black infiniti had a gun he added grimly witness said he heard a gunshot and when he looked pell was closing the trunk dance closed her eyes and sighed in disgust yet another death oneil said theres no way hes staying on the peninsula anymore he jacked the car in marina so hes headed north probably aiming for the oneohone he climbed into his car ill set up a command post in gilroy and watsonville in case he sticks to the one she watched him drive off lets get up there too kellogg said turning to his car following him dance heard her phone ring she took the call it was from james reynolds she briefed him on what had just happened and then the former prosecutor said hed been through the files from the croyton murders hed found something that might be helpful did dance have a minute now you bet sam and linda huddled together watching the news reports about yet another attempted murder by daniel pell the writer nagle rebecca described as an accomplice of pells had been badly wounded and pell had once again escaped he was in a stolen car most likely heading north the owner of the car another victim oh my linda whispered rebecca was with him all along sam stared at the tv screen her face a mask of shock but who shot her the police daniel linda closed her eyes momentarily sam didnt know if this was a prayer or a reaction to the exhaustion from the ordeal theyd been through in the past few days crosses to bear sam couldnt help but think which she didnt tell to her christian friend another newscaster devoted a few minutes to describing the woman whod been shot rebecca sheffield founder of womens initiatives in san diego one of the women in the family eight years ago she mentioned that sheffield had been born in southern california her father had died when she was six and shed been raised by her mother who had never remarried six years old linda muttered sam blinked she lied none of that stuff with her father ever happened oh boy were we taken in this is all way too much for me im packing linda wait i dont want to talk about anything sam ive had it just let me say one thing youve said plenty i dont think you were really listening and i wouldnt be listening if you said it again she headed toward her bedroom sam jumped when the phone rang it was kathryn dance oh we just heard but the agent said listen to me sam i dont think hes headed north i think hes coming for you what i just heard from james reynolds he found a reference to alison in his old case files it seems that during his interrogation after the croyton deaths pell assaulted him reynolds was questioning him about the incident in redding the charles pickering murder and was talking about alison his girlfriend you mentioned pell went crazy and attacked him or tried tothe same thing that happened to me in salinasbecause he was getting close to something important james thinks he killed pickering because the man knew about pells mountaintop and thats why he was trying to find alison shed know about it too but why hurt us because pell told you about alison maybe you wouldnt make the connection between her and his property maybe you wouldnt even remember but that place is so important to himhis kingdomthat hes willing to murder anybody whos a risk to it that means you both of you linda come here the woman appeared in the doorway frowning angrily dance continued ive just radioed the officers outside theyre going to take you to cbi headquarters agent kellogg and i are on our way to the inn now were going to wait in the cabin and see if pell shows up breathlessly sam said to linda kathryn thinks daniel might be coming this way no the curtains were drawn but the women instinctively looked toward the windows then sam glanced toward rebeccas bedroom had she remembered to lock the window after finding that the woman had climbed out yes sam recalled she had there was a knock on the door ladies its deputy larkin sam glanced at linda they froze then linda slowly walked to the peephole and looked out she nodded and opened the door the mcso deputy stepped inside ive been asked to take you to cbi just leave everything and come with me the other deputy was outside looking around the parking lot sam said into the phone its the deputy kathryn were leaving now they hung up samantha grabbed her purse lets go her voice was shaking the deputy hand near his pistol nodded them forward at that moment a bullet struck him in the side of his head another shot and the second deputy grabbed his chest slumping to the ground crying out a third bullet struck him as well the first officer crawled toward his car and collapsed on the sidewalk linda gasped no no footsteps were running on the pavement daniel pell was sprinting toward the cabin sam was paralyzed then she leapt forward and slammed the door managed to get the chain on and step aside just as another bullet snapped through the wood she lunged for the phone daniel pell gave two solid kicks the second one cracked the lock on the door though the chain held it opened only a few inches rebeccas room sam cried she ran to linda and grabbed her arm but the woman stood rooted in the doorway sam assumed she was frozen in panic but her face didnt look frightened at all she pulled away from sam daniel she called what are you doing sam screamed come on pell kicked the door again but the chain continued to hold sam dragged linda a step or two closer to rebeccas bedroom but she pulled away daniel linda repeated please listen to me its not too late you can give yourself up well get you a lawyer ill make sure youre pell shot her simply lifted the gun aimed through the gap in the door and shot linda in the abdomen as casually as if he were swatting a fly he tried to shoot again but sam dragged her into the bedroom pell kicked the door once more this time it crashed open smashing into the wall and shattering a picture of a seashore sam closed and locked rebeccas door she whispered fiercely were going outside now we cant wait here pell tested the bedroom knob kicked the panel but this door opened outward and it now held firmly against his blows feeling a horrifying tickle on her back sure that at any moment hed shoot through the door and hit her by chance sam helped linda to the windowsill pushed her out then tumbled after her onto the damp fragrant earth linda was whimpering in pain and clutching her side sam helped her up and holding her arm in a bruising grip guided her jogging toward point lobos state park he shot me linda moaned still astonished it hurts lookwait where are we going sam ignored her she was thinking only of getting as far away as she could from the cabin as for their destination sam couldnt say all she could see ahead of them was acres of trees formations of harsh rock and at the end of the world the explosive gray ocean chapter no kathryn dance gasped no win kellogg skidded the car to a stop beside the two deputies sprawled on the sidewalk in front of the cabin see how they are kellogg told her and pulled out his cell phone to call for backup gun in her sweating hand dance knelt beside the deputy saw he was dead his blood a huge stain slightly darker than the dark asphalt that was his deathbed the other officer as well she glanced up and mouthed theyre gone kellogg folded up his phone and joined her though theyd had no tactical training together they approached the cabin like seasoned partners making sure they offered no easy target and checking out the halfopen door and the windows im going in kellogg said dance nodded just back me up keep an eye on the doorways inside scan constantly scan them hell lead with the gun look for metal and if therere bodies inside ignore them until the place is clear he touched her arm thats important okay ignore them even if theyre screaming for help we cant do anything for anyone if were wounded or dead got it ready no not the least bit but she nodded he squeezed her shoulder then took several deep breaths and pushed through the doorway fast weapon up swinging it back and forth covering the inside of the cabin dance was right behind him remembering to target the doorsand to raise her muzzle when he passed in front of her scan scan scan she glanced behind them from time to time checking out the open doorway thinking pell could easily have circled around and be waiting for them then kellogg called clear and inside thank god no bodies kellogg though pointed out bloodstains fresh ones on the sill of an open window in the bedroom rebecca had been using dance noticed some on the carpet too she looked outside saw more blood and footprints in the dirt beneath it she told kellogg this and added think we have to assume they got away and hes after them the fbi agent said ill go why dont you wait here for the backup no she said automatically there was no debate the reunion was my idea and im not letting them die i owe them that he hesitated all right they ran to the back door inhaling deeply she flung it open with kellogg behind her dance sprinted outside expecting at any moment to hear the crack of a gunshot and feel the numbing slap of a bullet he hurt me my daniel hurt me why the pain in lindas heart was nearly as bad as the pain in her side the good christian within her had forgiven daniel for the past she was ready to forgive him for the present yet hed shot me she wanted to lie down let jesus cloak them let jesus save them she whispered this to sam but maybe she didnt maybe it was in her imagination samantha said nothing she kept them jogging linda in agony along the twisty paths of the beautiful yet stern park paul harry lisathe names of the foster children reeled through her mind no that was last year they were gone now she had others now what were their names why dont i have a family because god our father has another plan for me thats why because samantha betrayed me mad thoughts rolling through her mind like the nearby sea cycled over the bony rocks it hurts keep going was sams whisper kathryn and that fbi agentll be here any minute he shot me daniel shot me her vision crinkled she was going to faint then whatll the mouse do lug my pounds over her shoulder no shell betray me like she did before samantha my judas through the sound of the troubled waves the wind hissing through the slippery pines and cypress linda heard daniel pell behind them the snap of a branch occasionally a rustle of leaves they hurried on until the root of a scrub oak caught her foot and she went down hard her wound burning with pain she screamed shhhhh it hurts sams voice shaking with fear come on get up linda please i cant more footfalls he was closer now but then it occurred to linda that maybe the sounds were the police kathryn and that cute fbi agent she winced in agony as she turned to look but no it wasnt the police she could see fifty feet away daniel pell he spotted them he slowed caught his breath and continued forward linda turned to samantha but the woman was no longer there sam had left her yet again just like shed done years ago abandoned her to those terrible nights in daniel pells bedroom abandoned then abandoned now chapter my lovely my linda he approached slowly she winced at the pain daniel listen to me its not too late god will forgive you turn yourself in he laughed as if this were a joke of some sort god he repeated god forgives me rebecca told me youd gone religious youre going to kill me wheres sam please you dont need to do this you can change change oh linda people dont change never never never why youre still the same person you were when i found you all redeyed and lumpy under that tree in golden gate park a runaway linda felt her vision turning to black sand and yellow lights the pain ebbed as she nearly fainted when she floated back to the surface he was leaning forward with his knife im sorry baby ive got to do it this way an absurd but genuine apology but ill be fast i know what im doing you wont feel much our father he pushed her head to the side so that her neck was exposed she tried to resist but she couldnt the fog was burned away completely now and as he moved the blade toward her throat it flashed with a red glint from the low sun who art in heaven hallowed be and then a tree fell or an avalanche of rock crashed onto the path or a flock of gulls screaming in rage landed on him daniel pell grunted and slammed into the rocky ground samantha mccoy leapt off the killer climbed to her feet and hysterical swung the solid tree branch onto his head and arms pell seemed astonished to see his little mouse attacking him the woman who scurried off to do everything he told her who never told him no except once daniel slashed at her with the knife but she was too fast for him he grabbed for the gun which had fallen to the trail but the rough branch connected hard again and again bouncing off his head tearing his ear he wailed in pain goddamn he struggled to his feet lashing out with his fist he caught her in the knee with a solid blow and she dropped hard daniel dove for the gun grabbed it he scrabbled back rose to his feet once more and swung the pistol muzzle her way but samantha rolled to her feet and struck with the branch again twohanded it connected with his shoulder he stepped back flinching two words from the past came back to linda seeing sam fight what daniel used to say when he was proud of someone in the family you held fast lovely hold fast samantha lunged again swinging the branch but now daniel had a solid stance he managed to catch the branch with his left hand for a moment they stared at each other three feet apart the wooden stick connecting them like a live wire daniel gave a sad smile and lifted the gun no linda croaked samantha gave a smile too and she pushed toward him hard and let go of the branch daniel stepped backwardinto the air hed been standing on the edge of a cliff twenty feet above another nature trail he cried out fell backward and tumbled down the rough rock face whether he survived or not linda didnt know not at first but then she supposed he must have samantha glanced down with a grimace helped linda to her feet weve got to go now and led her into the dense woods exhausted in agony samantha mccoy struggled to keep linda upright the woman was pale but the bleeding wasnt bad the wound would be excruciating but she could at least walk a whisper what thought you left me no way but he had the guni had to trick him hes going to kill us linda still sounded amazed no hes not dont talk we have to hide i cant go on down by the water the beach therere caves we can hide in one until the police get here kathryns on her way theyll come after us no i cant its miles its not that far we can make it they continued for another fifty feet then sam felt linda start to falter no noi cant im sorry sam found some reserve of strength and managed to get linda another twenty feet but then she collapsedat the worst possible place a clearing visible for a hundred yards from all around she expected pell to appear at any moment he could easily pick them off a shallow trough in the rocks was nearby it would hide them well enough whispers floating from lindas mouth what sam asked she leaned closer linda was speaking to jesus not her come on weve got to go no no you go on please i mean it you dont need to make up for what happened you just saved my life a minute ago were even i forgive you for what happened back in seaside i not now linda sam snapped the wounded woman tried to rise but then collapsed i cant you have to jesusll take care of me you go on come on linda closed her eyes and began to whisper a prayer you are not going to die here stand up she took a deep breath nodded and with sams help climbed to her feet together they staggered off the path stumbling through brush and over roots as they made their way to the shallow ravine they were on a promontory about fifty feet above the ocean the crashing of the surf was nearly constant a jet engine not a pulse deafening too the low sunlight hit them full on in a blinding orange wash sam squinted and made out the ravine very close now theyd lie down in it pull brush and leaves over themselves youre doing fine a few more feet well twenty but then they closed the distance to ten and finally they reached their sanctuary it was deeper than sam had thought and would be perfect cover she began to ease linda into it suddenly with the sound of crackling underbrush a figure pushed out of the woods coming right at them no sam cried letting linda slump toward the ground she grabbed a small rock a pathetic weapon then gasping she barked a hysterical laugh kathryn dance crouching whispered where is he her heart slamming sam mouthed i dont know then repeated the words louder we saw him about fifty yards back that way hes hurt but i saw him walking hes armed a nod a gun and a knife dance scanned the area around them squinting into the sun she then assessed lindas condition get her down there nodding at the ravine press something on the wound together they eased the woman into the depression please stay with us sam whispered dont worry dance said im not going anywhere chapter winston kellogg was somewhere to the south of them after theyd left the point lobos inn theyd lost track of the footprints and blood near a fork in the nature trails arbitrarily dance had gone right kellogg left shed moved silently through the brushstaying off the trailuntil she saw motion by the edge of a cliff shed identified the women and approached them quickly now she called the fbi agent from her mobile phone win ive got sam and linda where are you were about a hundred yards from where we split up i went due west were almost to the cliff theres a round rock near us about twenty feet high do they know where pell is he was near here below us and to our left about fifty yards and hes still armed pistol and knife then she tensed looking down saw a mans form on the sand win where are you are you on the beach no im on a path the beach is below me maybe two three hundred feet away okay hes there you see that small island seals all over it and gulls got it the beach in front of that i cant see it from here but im moving that way no win theres no cover for your approach we need tactical wait we dont have time hes gotten away too many times already im not letting it happen again the gunslinger attitude it bothered her a lot suddenly she really didnt want anything to happen to winston kellogg afterward how does that sound justbe careful i lost sight of him he was on the beach but hes in the rocks now thered be perfect firing positions from there he can cover all the approaches dance stood up shielding her eyes as she scanned the beach where is he she found out a second later a bullet slammed into the rocks not far from her and then she heard the crack of pells pistol samantha screamed and dance dropped to cover in the recess nicking her skin furious that shed presented a target kathryn kellogg called on the radio are you firing no that was pell you okay were fine where did it come from i couldnt see had to be the rocks near the beach you stay down hes got your position now she asked samantha does he know the park the family spent a lot of time here he knows it pretty good id guess win pell knows point lobos you could walk right into a trap really why dont you wait hold on kelloggs voice was a quiet rasp i think i see something ill call you back wait win are you there she changed position moving some distance away so pell wouldnt be looking for her she glanced out fast between two rocks couldnt see a thing then she noticed winston kellogg making his way toward the beach against the massive rocks gnarled trees the expanse of ocean he seemed so fragile pleasedance sent him a silent message to stop to wait but of course he kept on moving her tacit plea as ineffectual as she reflected his would have been with her daniel pell knew more cops were on their way but he was confident he knew this area perfectly hed robbed plenty of tourists in point lobosmany of them stupid to the point of being coconspirators theyd leave their valuables in their cars and at the picnic grounds never thinking that anybody would conceive of robbing fellow humans in such a spiritual setting he and the family had also spent plenty of time just relaxing here camping out on the way back from big sur when they didnt feel like making the drive up to seaside he knew routes that would get him to the highway or to the private residences nearby invisible routes hed steal another car head east into the back roads of the central valley through hollister and work his way north to the mountaintop but now he had to deal with the immediate pursuers there were just two or three he believed he hadnt seen them clearly they mustve stopped at the cabin seen the dead deputies then pursued him on their own and it seemed that only one was actually nearby he closed his eyes momentarily against the pain he pressed the stab wound which had opened in the fall down the rocks his ear was throbbing from sams blow mouse he rested his head and shoulder against a cold wet rock it seemed to lessen the agony he wondered if one of the pursuers was kathryn dance if so he suspected that no it wasnt a coincidence shed shown up at the cabin shed have guessed that he had stolen the infiniti not to go north but to head here well one way or the other she wasnt going to be a threat much longer but how to handle the immediate situation the cop pursuing him was getting close there were only two approaches to where he was at the moment whoever came after him would either have to climb down a twentyfoothigh rock face completely exposed to pell below ortaking the pathwould turn a sharp corner from the beach and be a perfect target pell knew that only a tactical officer would try the rock face and that his pursuer probably wouldnt be decked out in rappelling gear theyd have to come from the beach he hunkered down behind a cluster of rocks hidden from above and from the beach and waited for the officer to get close resting the gun on a boulder he wouldnt shoot to kill hed wound maybe in the knee and then when he was down pell would blind him with the knife hed leave the radio nearby so the cop racked by agony would call for help screaming and distracting the other officers pell could escape into a deserted area of the park he now heard someone approaching trying to be quiet but pell had hearing like a wild animals he curled his hand around his gun the emotion was gone rebecca and jennie and even the hateful kathryn dance were far far from his thoughts daniel pell was in perfect control dance in yet another spot on the ridge hidden by thick pines looked out fast winston kellogg was on the beach now close to where pell must have been when hed fired at her the agent was moving slowly looking around him gun in both hands he looked up at a cliff and seemed to be debating climbing it but the walls were steep and kellogg was in street shoes impractical for the slippery stone besides hed undoubtedly be an easy target climbing down the other side looking back to the path in front of him he seemed to notice marks in the sand where shed seen pell he crouched and moved closer to them he paused at an outcropping whats going on samantha asked dance shook her head she looked down at linda the woman was halfconscious and paler than before shed lost a lot of blood shed need emergency treatment soon dance called mcso central and asked for the status of the troops first tac responders in five minutes boats in fifteen dance sighed why was it taking the cavalry so damn long she gave them her approximate position and explained how the med techs should approach to stay out of the line of fire dance glanced out again and saw winston kellogg ease around the rock glistening burgundy in the low sun the agent was heading directly toward the spot where shed seen pell vanish a few minutes earlier a long minute passed two where was he what the boom of an explosion what the hell was that then a series of gunshots from behind the outcropping a pause then several more pistol cracks what happened samantha called i dont know dance pulled her radio out win win are you there over but the only sounds she heard over the rush of the waves were the edgy cries of the frightened fleeing gulls chapter kathryn dance hurried along the beach her aldo shoes among her favorites ruined by the salt water she didnt care behind her back on the ridge medical technicians were trundling linda to the ambulance parked at the point lobos inn samantha with her she nodded to two mcso officers ringing yellow tape from rock to rock though the only intruder to trouble the crime scene would be the rising tide dance ducked under the plastic tape and turned the corner continuing to the scene of the death dance paused then walked straight up to winston kellogg and hugged him he seemed shaken and kept staring at what lay in front of them the body of daniel pell he was on his back his sandstained knees in the air arms out to the sides his pistol lay nearby where it had flown from his hand pells eyes were partly open intensely blue no longer but hazy in death dance realized that her hand remained on kelloggs back she dropped it and stepped aside what happened she asked i nearly walked right into him he was hiding there he pointed out a stand of rocks but i saw him just in time i got under cover i had one of the flashbangs left from the motel i pitched it his way and it stunned him he started shooting but i was lucky the sun was behind me blinded him i guess i returned fire and he shrugged youre okay oh sure little scraped up from the rocks not used to mountain climbing her phone rang she answered glancing at the screen it was tj lindas going to be fine lost some blood but the slug missed the important stuff oh and samanthas not hurt bad samantha dance hadnt noticed the woman was injured what happened cuts and bruises is all had a boxing match with the deceased prior to his deceasing of course shes hurting but shell be peachy shed fought with pell mouse monterey county sheriffs crime scene officers arrived and began working the site michael oneil she noticed wasnt here one of the cs officers said to kellogg hey congrats he nodded at the body the fbi agent smiled noncommitally a smile kinesics experts know is the most elusive signal that the human face generates a frown a perplexed gaze or an amorous glance means only one thing a smile though can telegraph hate indifference humor or love dance wasnt sure exactly what this smile meant but she noticed that an instant later as he stared at the man hed just killed the expression vanished as if it had never existed kathryn dance and samantha mccoy stopped by monterey bay hospital to see linda whitfield who was conscious and doing well shed spend the night in the hospital but the doctors said she could go home tomorrow samantha was chauffeured by rey carraneo back to a new cabin in the point lobos inn where shed decided to spend the night rather than returning home dance asked samantha to join her for dinner but the woman said she wanted some downtime and who could blame her dance left the hospital and returned to cbi where she saw theresa and her aunt standing by their car apparently awaiting her return to say goodbye the girls face brightened when she saw dance they greeted each other warmly we heard the aunt said unsmiling hes dead as if she couldnt have too much confirmation thats right she gave them the details of the incident at point lobos the aunt seemed impatient though theresa was eager to hear exactly what had happened dance didnt edit the account theresa nodded and took the news unemotionally we cant thank you enough the agent said what you did saved lives the subject didnt come up of what had actually happened on the night her family was killed theresas feigned illness dance supposed that would remain a secret between herself and the girl forever but why not sharing with one person was often as cathartic as sharing with the world youre driving back tonight yeah the girl said with a glance at her aunt but were making a stop first dance thinking seafood dinner shopping at the cute stores in los gatos i want to see the house my old house where her parents and siblings had died were going to meet mr nagle he talked to the family who lives there now and theyve agreed to let me see it did he suggest that dance was ready to run interference for the girl and knew that nagle would back down in an instant no it was my idea theresa said i just you know want to and hes going to come to napa and interview me for that book the sleeping doll thats the title isnt it weird having a book written about you mary bolling didnt say anything though her body languageslightly lifted shoulders a shift in the jawtold dance instantly that she didnt approve of the evenings detour and that thered been an argument on the subject as often following significant life incidentslike the familys reunion or theresas journey here to help catch her familys killertheres a tendency to look for fundamental changes in the participants but that didnt happen very often and dance didnt think it had here she found herself looking at the same two people theyd undoubtedly been for some time a protective middleaged woman blunt but stepping up to the difficult task of becoming a substitute parent and a typically attitudinal teenage girl whod impulsively done a brave thing theyd had a disagreement about how to spend the rest of the evening and in this case the girl had won undoubtedly with concessions maybe though the very fact that the disagreement had occurred and been resolved was a step forward this was dance supposed how people change incrementally she hugged theresa shook her aunts hand and wished them a safe trip five minutes later dance was back in the gw side of cbi headquarters accepting a cup of coffee and an oatmeal cookie from maryellen kresbach walking into her office she kicked off the damaged aldos and dug in her closet for a new pair joan and david sandals then she stretched and sat sipping the strong coffee and searching through her desk for the remainder of a pack of m ampms shed stashed there a few days ago she ate them quickly stretched again and enjoyed looking at the pictures of her children photos of her husband too how she would have liked to lie in bed next to him tonight and talk about the pell case ah bill her phone chirped she glanced at the screen and her stomach did a small jump hi she said to michael oneil hey just got the news you okay heard there were rounds exchanged pell parked one near me thats all hows linda dance gave him the details and rebecca icu shell live but shes not getting out any time soon he in turn told her about the phony getaway carpells favorite means of diversion and distraction the infiniti driver wasnt dead he had been forced by pell to call and report his own murder and carjacking hed then driven home put the car in the garage and sat in a dark room until hed heard the news of pells death he added that he was sending her the crime scene reports from the butterfly inn which pell and jennie had checked into after escaping from the sea view and from point lobos shed been glad to hear oneils voice but something was off there was still the matteroffact tone he wasnt angry but he wasnt overly pleased to be speaking to her she thought his earlier remarks about winston kellogg were out of line but while she didnt want an apology she did wish that the rough seas between them would calm she asked you all right with some people you had to prime the pump fine he said that goddamn word which could mean everything from wonderful to i hate you she suggested he come by the deck that night cant sorry anne and i have plans ah plans thats one of those words too better go just wanted to let you know about the infiniti driver sure take care click dance grimaced for the benefit of no one and turned back to a file ten minutes later winston kelloggs head appeared in the door she gestured toward the chair and he dropped down into it he hadnt changed his clothes were still muddy and sandy he saw her saltstained shoes sitting by the door and gestured toward his own then laughed pointing to a dozen pairs in her closet probably nothing in there thatd work for me sorry she answered deadpan theyre all a size six too bad that limegreen number has a certain appeal they discussed the reports that needed to be completed and the shooting review board that would have to issue a report on the incident shed wondered how long hed be in the area and realized that whether or not he followed through on asking her out hed have to stay for four or five days a review board could take that long to convene hear testimony and write the report afterward how does that sound like dance herself a few minutes ago kellogg stretched his face gave a very faint signalhe was troubled it would be the shootout of course dance had never even fired her weapon at a suspect let alone killed anyone shed been instrumental in tracking down dangerous perps some of whom had been killed in the takedown others had gone to death row but that was different from pointing a gun at someone and ending his life and here kellogg had done so twice in a relatively short period of time so whats next for you she asked im giving a seminar in washington on religious fundamentalismit shares a lot with cult mentality then some time off if the real world cooperates of course he slouched and closed his eyes in his smudged slacks and with floppy hair and a bit of fiveoclock shadow he was really an appealing man dance reflected sorry he said opening his eyes and laughing bad form to fall asleep in colleagues offices the smile was genuine and whatever had been troubling him earlier was now gone oh one thing ive got paperwork tonight but tomorrow can i hold you to that offer of dinner it is afterward remember she hesitated thinking you know counterinterrogation strategy anticipate every question the interrogators going to ask and be ready with an answer but even though shed just been thinking about this very matter she was caught off guard so whats the answer she asked herself tomorrow he repeated sounding shycuriously for a man whod just nailed one of the worst perps in monterey county history youre stalling she told herself her eyes swept the pictures of her children her dogs her late husband she thought of wes she said you know tomorrowd be great chapter its over she said in a low voice to her mother i heard michael briefed us at cbi they were at her parents house in carmel the family was back from the castle keep of headquarters did the gang hear meaning the children i put some spin on it phrased it like oh momll be home at a decent hour tonight because by the way that stupid case of hers is over with they got the bad guy i dont know the details that sort of thing mags didnt pay any attentionshes working up a new song for piano camp wes headed right for the tv but i had stu drag him outside to play pingpong he seems tove forgotten about the story but the key word is seems dance had shared with her parents that where her children were concerned she wanted to minimize news about death and violence particularly as it involved her work ill keep an eye on him and thanks dance cracked open an anchor steam beer and split it in two glasses handed one to her mother edie sipped and then with a frown asked when did you get pell dance gave her the approximate time why glancing at the clock her mother said i was sure i heard somebody in the backyard around four fourthirty i didnt think anything of it at first but then i got to wondering if pell found out where we lived wanting to get even or something i was feeling a little bit spooked even with the squad car out front pell wouldnt hesitate to hurt them of coursehed planned to do sobut the timing was off pell was already at morton nagles house by then or on the way it probably wasnt him mustve been a cat or the perkins dog they have to learn to keep it inside ill talk to them she knew her mother would do just that dance rounded up the children and herded them into the family pathfinder where the dogs awaited she hugged her father and they made plans for her to pick her parents up for his birthday party at the marine club on sunday evening dance was the designated driver so they could enjoy themselves and drink as much champagne and pinot noir as they wanted she thought about inviting winston kellogg but decided to wait on that one see how tomorrows afterward date went dance thought about dinner and could summon up zero desire to cook can you guys live with pancakes at bayside woohoo maggie called and began debating aloud what kind of syrup she wanted wes was happy but more restrained when they got to the restaurant and were seated at a booth she reminded her son it was his job to pick their sunday afternoon adventure this week before the birthday party so whats our plan movie hiking i dont know yet wes examined the menu for a long time maggie wanted a togo order for the dogs dance explained that the pancakes werent to celebrate the reunion with the canines it was simply because she wasnt in the mood to cook as the large steaming plates were arriving wes asked oh you hear about that festival thing the boats boats grandpa was telling us about it its a boat parade in the bay and a concert at cannery row dance recalled something about a john steinbeck festival is that on sunday is that what youd like to do its tomorrow night wes said itd be fun can we go dance laughed to herself there was no way he couldve known about her dinner date with kellogg tomorrow or could he she had intuition when it came to the children why couldnt it work the other way dance dressed the pancakes with syrup and allowed herself a pat of butter stalling tomorrow let me think her initial reaction on seeing wess unsmiling face was to call kellogg and postpone or even cancel the date sometimes its just easier she stopped maggie from drowning her pancakes in a frightening avalanche of blueberry and strawberry syrups then turned to wes and said impulsively oh thats right honey i cant i have plans oh but im sure grandpad want to go with you whatre you going to do see connie or martine maybe theyd like to come too we could all go they could bring the twins yeah the twins mom maggie said dance heard her therapists words kathryn you cant look at the substance of what hes saying parents tend to feel that their children raise valid objections about potential stepparents or even casual dates you cant think that way what hes upset with is what he sees as your betrayal of his fathers memory it has nothing to do with the partner himself she made a decision no im going to have dinner with the man ive been working with agent kellogg the boy shot back thats right he has to go back to washington soon and i wanted to thank him for all the work hes done for us she felt a bit cheesy for gratuitously suggesting that because he lived so far away kellogg was no longterm threat though she supposed wess sensitive mind could easily jump to the conclusion that dance was already planning to uproot them from friends and family here on the peninsula and resettle them in the nations capital okay the boy said cutting up the pancakes eating some pensive dance was using his appetite as a barometer of his reaction hey son of mine whats the matter nothing grandpa would love to go to see the boats with you sure then she asked another impulsive question dont you like winston hes okay you can tell me her own interest in food was flagging i dont know hes not like michael no hes not but there arent many people like michael the dear friend who isnt returning my calls at the moment that doesnt mean i cant have dinner with them does it i guess they ate for a few minutes then wes blurted maggie doesnt like him either i didnt say that dont say things i didnt say yeah you did you said hes got a potbelly did not though her blush told dance that she had she smiled put down her fork hey you two listen up whether i have dinner with somebody or not or even go out to the movies with them nothings going to change us our house the dogs our lives nothing thats a promise okay okay wes said it was a bit kneejerk but he didnt seem completely unconvinced but now maggie was troubled arent you ever going to get married again mags what brought that up just wondering i cant even imagine getting married again you didnt say no wes muttered dance laughed at the interrogators perfect response well thats my answer i cant even imagine it i want to be best woman maggie said maid of honor dance corrected no i saw this afterschool special they do it different now differently her mother corrected again but lets not get distracted weve got pancakes and iced tea to polish off and plans to make for sunday youve got to do some thinking i will wes seemed reassured dance ate the rest of her dinner feeling elated at this victory being honest with her son and receiving his acquiescence to the date oddly this tiny step did a huge amount to take away the horror of the days events on a whim she gave in to maggies final plea on behalf of the dogs and ordered one pancake and a side of sausage for each minus the syrup the girl served the food in the back of the pathfinder dylan the shepherd devoured his in several gulps while the ladylike patsy ate the sausage fastidiously then carried the pancake to a space between the backseats impossible to reach and deposited it there for a rainy day at home dance spent the next few hours at domestic chores fielding phone calls including one from morton nagle thanking her again for what shed done for his family winston kellogg did not call which was good meaning the date was still on michael oneil did not call either which wasnt so good rebecca sheffield was in stable condition after extensive surgery shed be in the hospital under guard for the next six or seven days more operations were needed dance talked to martine christensen for some time about the american tunes website then business disposed of it was time for dessert popcorn which made sense after a sweet dinner dance found a wallace and gromit claymation tape cued it up and at the last minute managed to save the redenbacher from the microwave of mass destruction before she set the bag ablaze as she had last week she was pouring the contents into a bowl when her phone croaked yet again mom wes said impatiently im like starving she loved his tone it meant hed snapped out of his unhappy mood its tj she announced opening up her mobile say hi the boy offered shoving a handful of popcorn into his mouth wes says hi back at him oh tell him i got to level eight on zarg is that good you have no idea dance relayed the message and wess eyes glowed eight no way hes impressed so whats up whos getting all the stuff stuff would be evidence reports emails everything the ball of wax remember he meant for the final disposition report it would be massive in this case with the multiple felonies and the interagency paperwork shed run the case and the cbi had primary jurisdiction me well i should say us i liked the first answer better boss oh by the way remember nimue the mystery word what about it i just found another reference to it you want me to follow up think we better leave no t undotted so to speak is tomorrow okay its not much of a date tonight but lucretia might be the woman of my dreams youre going out with somebody named lucretia you may have to concentrate tell you what bring me all the wax and the nimue stuff ill get started on it boss youre the best youre invited to the wedding friday chapter kathryn dance in a black suit and burgundy blousenot the warmest of outfits all things consideredwas sitting outside at the bay view restaurant near fishermans wharf in monterey the place lived up to its name usually offering a postcard image of the coast all the way up to santa cruz which was however invisible at the moment the early morning was a perfect example of june gloom on the peninsula fog like smoke from a damp fire surrounded the wharf the temperature was fiftyfive degrees last night shed been in an elated mood daniel pell had been stopped linda whitfield would be all right nagle and his family had survived she and winston kellogg had made their plans for afterward today though things were different a darkness hung over her she couldnt shake it and the mood had nothing to do with the weather many things were contributing to it not the least of which was planning the memorial services and funerals for the guards killed at the courthouse the deputies at the point lobos inn yesterday and juan millar too she sipped her coffee then blinked in surprise as a hummingbird appeared from nowhere and dipped its beak into the feeder hanging on the side of the restaurant near a spill of gardenias another bird strafed in and drove the first away they were pretty creatures jewels but could be mean as scrapyard dogs then she heard hello winston kellogg came up behind her slipped his arm around her shoulders and kissed her on the cheek not too close to the mouth not too far away she smiled and hugged him he sat down dance waved to the waitress who refilled her cup and poured one for kellogg so i was doing some research about the area kellogg said i thought we could go down to big sur tonight some place called ventana its beautiful i havent been for years the restaurants wonderful its a bit of a drive im game highway one right which would take them right past point lobos she flashed back to the gunshots the blood daniel pell lying on his back dull blue eyes staring unseeing at a dark blue sky thanks for getting up so early dance said breakfast and dinner with you the pleasures mine she gave him another smile heres the situation tj finally found the answer to nimue i think kellogg nodded what pell was searching for in capitola at first i thought it was a screen name then i was thinking it might have to do with this computer game nimue with an x the popular one the agent shook his head apparently its hot i should have consulted the expertsmy kids anyway i was toying with the idea that pell and jimmy went to the croytons to steal some valuable software and i remembered reynolds told me that croyton gave away all this computer research and software to cal statemonterey bay i thought maybe there was something in the college archives that pell planned to steal but no it turns out that nimues something else what were not exactly sure thats what i need your help on tj found a folder on jennie marstons computer the name was dance found a slip of paper and read quote nimuecult suicide in la what was inside thats the problem he tried to open it but its passwordprotected well have to send it to cbi headquarters in sacramento to crack but frankly thatll take weeks it might not be important but id like to find out what its all about i was hoping youd have somebody in the bureau who could decrypt it faster kellogg told her he knew of a computer wiz in the fbis san jose field officein the heart of silicon valley if anybody can break it they can ill get it to him today she thanked him and handed over the dell in a plastic bag and with a chainofcustody tag attached he signed the card and set the bag beside him dance waved for the waitress toast was about all she could manage this morning but kellogg ordered a full breakfast he said now tell me about big sur its supposed to be pretty breathtaking she said one of the most romantic places youll ever see kathryn dance was in her office when winston kellogg came to collect her at five thirty for their date he was in formal casual he and dance came close to matchingbrown jackets light shirts and jeans his blue hers black ventana was an upscale inn restaurant and winery but this was after all california you needed a suit and tie only in san francisco la and sacramento for funerals too of course dance couldnt help but think first lets get work out of the way he opened his attaché case and handed her the plastic evidence bag containing the computer found in the butterfly inn oh youve got it already she asked the mystery of nimue is about to be solved he grimaced afraid not sorry nothing she asked the file was either intentionally written as gibberish or it had a wipe bomb on it the bureau tech guys said wipe bomb like a digital booby trap when tj tried to open it it got turned to mush that was their term too by the way mush just random characters no way to reconstruct it nope and believe me theyre the best in the business not that it matters that much i suppose dance said shrugging it was just a loose end he smiled im the same way hate it when there are danglers thats what i call them danglers i like that so are you ready to go just a second or two she rose and walked to the door albert stemple was standing in the hallway tj too she glanced at them sighed and nodded the massive shavedhead agent stepped into the office with tj right behind him both men drew their weaponsdance just didnt have the heartand in a few seconds winston kellogg was disarmed cuffs on his hands what the hells going on he raged dance provided the answer surprised at how serene her voice sounded as she said winston kellogg youre under arrest for the murder of daniel pell chapter they were in room one of the interrogation rooms in cbis monterey office and it was dances favorite this was a little bigger than the other which was room there being no number and the oneway mirror was a little shinier it also had a small window and if the curtains were open you could see a tree outside sometimes during her interrogations shed use the view to distract or draw out the interviewees today the curtain was closed dance and kellogg were alone behind the sparkling mirror the video camera was set up and running tj was there along with charles overby both unseen though the mirror of course implied observers winston kellogg had declined an attorney and was willing to talk which he did in an eerily calm voice very much the same tone as daniel pells in his interrogation she reflected unsettled at the thought kathryn lets just step back here can we is that all right i dont know what you think is going on but this isnt the way to handle it believe me the subtext of these words was arroganceand the corollary betrayal she tried to push the pain away as she replied simply lets get started she slipped her blackframed glasses on her predator specs maybe youve gotten some bad information why dont you tell me what you think the problem is and well see whats really going on as if he were talking to a child she looked winston kellogg over closely its an interrogation just like any other dance told herself though it wasnt of course here was a man shed felt romantic toward and who had lied to her someone who had used her like daniel pell had usedwell everyone then she forced aside her own emotion hard though that was and concentrated on the task in front of her she was going to break him nothing would stop her because she knew him well by now the analysis unfolded quickly in her mind first how should he be categorized in the context of the crime a suspect in a homicide second does he have a motive to lie yes third whats his personality type extroverted thinking judging she could be as tough with him as she needed to be fourth what is his liars personality a high machiavellian hes intelligent has a good memory is adept at the techniques of deception and will use all those skills to create lies that work to his advantage hell give up lying if hes caught and use other weapons to shift the blame threaten or attack hell demean and patronize trying to unnerve her and exploit her own emotional responses a dark mirror image of her own mission as an interrogator hell try to get information to use against me later she reminded herself you had to be very careful with high machs the next step in her kinesic analysis would be to determine what stress response state he fell into when lyinganger denial depression or bargainingand to probe his story when she recognized one but here was the problem she was one of the best kinesics analysts in the country yet she hadnt spotted kelloggs lies which hed dished up right in front of and to her largely his behavior was not outright lying but evasionwithholding information is the hardest type of deception to detect still dance was skilled at spotting evasion more significant kellogg was she decided in that rare class of individuals virtually immune to kinesic analysts and polygraph operators excluded subjects like the mentally ill and serial killers the category also includes zealots which was what she now believed winston kellogg was not the leader of a cult but someone just as fanatical and just as dangerous a man convinced of his own righteousness still she needed to break him she needed to get to the truth and to do that dance had to spot stress flags within him to know where to probe so she attacked hard fast from her purse dance took a digital audiotape recorder and set it on the table between them she hit play the sounds of a phone ringing then tech resource rick adams speaking my names kellogg from ninth street mvcc sure agent kellogg what can i do for you im in the area and have a problem on my computer ive got a protected file and the guy who sent it to me cant remember the password its a windows xp operating system sure thats a piece of cake i can handle it rather not use you guys for a personal job theyre cracking down on that back at hq well theres a good outfit in cupertino we farm stuff out to theyre not cheap are they fast oh for that sure great give me their number she shut the recorder off you lied to me you said the bureau tech guys cracked it they didnt i winston pell didnt write anything about nimue or suicides i created that file last night he could only stare at her she said nimue was a red herring there was nothing on jennies computer until i put it there tj did find a reference to nimue but it was a newspaper story about a woman named alison sharpe an interview in a local paper in montanamy month with daniel pell something like that they met in san francisco about twelve years ago when she was living in a group like the family and going by the name nimue the leader named everyone after arthurian characters she and pell hitchhiked around the state but she left him after he was picked up in redding on that murder charge pell probably didnt know her surname and searched the only two names he knewalison and nimueto find her and kill her because she knew where his mountaintop was so you faked this file and asked me to help you crack it why the masquerade kathryn ill tell you why body language isnt limited to the living you know you can read a lot into a corpses posture too last night tj brought me all the files in the case for the final disposition report i was looking over the crimescene pictures from point lobos something didnt seem right pell wasnt hiding behind the rocks he was out in the open on his back his legs were bent and there were water and sand stains on his knees both knees not just one that was curious people crouch when theyre fighting or at least keep one foot planted on the ground i saw exactly the same posture in a case involving a man whod been killed in a gang hit forced on his knees to beg before he was shot why would pell leave cover get down on both knees and shoot at you i dont know what youre talking about no emotion whatsoever and the coroners report said that from the downward angle of the bullets through his body you were standing full height not crouching if it was a real firefight you wouldve been in a defensive stance crouching yourself and i remembered the sequence of the sounds the flashbang went off and then i heard the shots after a delay no i think that you saw where he was tossed the flashbang and moved in fast disarmed him then had him kneel and you tossed your cuffs on the ground for him to put on when he was reaching for them you shot him ridiculous she continued unfazed and the flashbang after the assault at the sea view you were supposed to check all the ordnance back in thats standard procedure why keep it because you were waiting for a chance to move in and kill him and i checked the timing of your call for backup you didnt make it from the inn like you pretended you made it later to give you a chance to get pell alone she held up a hand silencing another protest but whether my theory was ridiculous or not his death raised questions i thought i should check further i wanted to know more about you i got your file from a friend of my husbands on ninth street i found some interesting facts youd been involved in the shooting deaths of several suspected cult leaders during attempts to apprehend and two cult leaders died of suicides under suspicious circumstances when you were consulting with local law enforcement agencies in their investigations the suicide in la was the most troubling a woman who ran a cult committed suicide by jumping out of her sixthstory window two days after you arrived to help out the lapd but it was curiousno one had ever heard her talk about suicide before that there was no note and yes she was being investigated but only for civil tax fraud no reason to kill herself so i had to test you winston i wrote the document in that file it was a fake email that suggested a girl with the name of nimue was in the suicide victims cult and had information that the womans death was suspicious i got a tap warrant on your phone put a simple windows password on the file and handed over the computer to see what youd do if youd told me youd read the file and what it contained that wouldve been the end of the matter you and id be on our way to big sur right now but no you made your phone call to the tech had the private company crack the code and you read the file there was no wipe bomb no mush you destroyed it yourself you had to of course you were afraid wed catch on to the fact that your life for the past six years has been traveling around the country and murdering people like daniel pell kellogg gave a laugh now faint kinesic deviation the tone was different an excluded subject yes but he was feeling the stress shed touched close to home please kathryn why on earth would i do that because of your daughter she said this not without some sympathy and the fact that he gave no response merely held her eye as if he were in great pain was an indicationthough a tiny onethat she was narrowing in on the truth it takes a lot to fool me winston and youre very very good the only variation from your baseline behavior i ever noticed was when it came to children and family but i didnt think much of it at first i supposed that was because of the connection between us and you werent comfortable with children and were wrestling with the idea of having them in your life then i think you saw that i was curious or suspicious and you confessed that youd lied that you had had a daughter you told me about her death of course thats a common trickconfession to one lie to cover up another related one and what was the lie your daughter did die in a car accident yes but it wasnt exactly how you described it you apparently destroyed the police report in seattlenobody could find itbut tj and i made some calls and pieced together the story when she was sixteen your daughter ran away from home because you and your wife were getting divorced she ended up with a group in seattlevery much like the family she was there for about six months then she and three other members of the cult died in a suicide pact because the leader told them to leave they hadnt been loyal enough they drove their car into puget sound theres something terrifying about the idea of being kicked out of your family and then you joined the mvcc and made it your lifes work to stop people like that only sometimes the law didnt cooperate and you had to take it into your own hands i called a friend in chicago pd you were the cult expert on the scene last week assisting them their report said you claimed the perp fired at you and you had to neutralize the threat but i dont think he did shoot i think you killed him and then wounded yourself she tapped her neck indicating his bandage which makes that murder too just like pell she grew angry it hit fast like a flash of hot sunlight as a cloud passed on control it she told herself take a lesson from daniel pell take a lesson from winston kellogg the dead mans family filed a complaint they claimed he was set up he had a long rap sheet sure just like pell but he never touched guns he was afraid of the deadlyweapon count he touched one long enough to shoot me a very faint shift of kelloggs foot almost invisible but it telegraphed stress so he wasnt completely immune to her interrogation his response was a lie well know more after reviewing the files and were checking with other jurisdictions too winston apparently you insisted on helping local police all over the country whenever there was a crime involving a cult charles overby had implied that it was his own idea to bring in a federal specialist on cults last night though shed begun to suspect that this probably wasnt what happened and shed asked her boss pointblank how the fbi agent had come to work the pell case overby hemmed and hawed but ultimately admitted that kellogg had told the bureaus amy grabe he was coming to the peninsula to consult on the manhunt for pell it wasnt up for debate hed been here as soon as the paperwork in chicago was cleaned up i looked back at the pell case michael oneil was upset that you wanted a takedown at the sea view rather than surveillance and i wondered why you wanted to be first through the door the answer is so that youd have a clear shot at pell and yesterday at the beach at point lobos you got him on his knees and then you killed him thats your evidence that i murdered him his posture really kathryn and mcso crime scene found the bullet of the slug you fired at me on the ridge he fell silent at this oh you werent shooting to hit me i understand you just wanted to keep me where i was with samantha and linda so that i wouldnt interfere with your chance to kill pell it was an accidental discharge he said matteroffactly careless of me i shouldve owned up to it but it was embarrassing here i am a professional lie under her gaze his shoulders dipped slightly his lips tightened dance knew thered be no confessionshe wasnt even after thatbut he did shift into a different stress state he wasnt a completely emotionless machine it seemed shed hit him hard and it hurt i dont talk about my past and what happened with my daughter i shouldve shared more with you maybe but you dont talk about your husband much either i notice he fell silent for a moment look around us kathryn look at the world were so fragmented so shattered the familys a dying breed and yet were starving for the comfort of one starvingand what happens along come people like daniel pell and they suck the vulnerable needy ones right in the women in pells familysamantha and linda they were good kids never did anything wrong not really and they got seduced by a killer why because he dangled in front of them the one thing they didnt have a family it was only a matter of time before they or jennie marston or somebody else under his spell started killing or maybe kidnapping children abusing them even in prison pell had his followers how many of them went on to do the same thing hed done after they were releasedthese people have to be stopped im aggressive about it i get results but i dont cross the line you dont cross your line winston but its not your own standards you have to apply thats not how the system works daniel pell never thought he was doing anything wrong either he gave her a smile and a shrug the emblem gesture which she took to mean you see it your way i see it mine and well never agree on this to dance it was as clear as saying im guilty then the smile faded as it had at the beach yesterday one thing us that was real whatever else you think about me that was real kathryn dance recalled walking down the hall with him at cbi when hed made the wistful comment on the family implying gaps in his own life solitude a job substituting for a failed marriage his daughters unspeakably terrible death dance didnt doubt that though he had deceived her about his mission this lonely man had been trying genuinely to make a connection with her and as a kinesic analyst she could see that his commentthat was realwas absolutely honest but it was also irrelevant to the interrogation and not worth the breath to respond to then a faint v formed between his brows and the faux smile was back really kathryn this is isnt a good idea itll be a nightmare running a case like this for the cbifor you personally too me kellogg pursed his lips for a moment i seem to recall some questions were raised about your conduct in the handling of the interrogation at the courthouse in salinas maybe something was said or done that helped pell escape i dont know the details maybe it was nothing but i did hear amy grabe has a note or two on it he shrugged lifting his palms the cuffs jingled overbys asscovering comment to the fbi coming back to haunt dance was seething at kelloggs threat but she offered no affect displays whatsoever her shrug was even more dismissive than his if that issue comes up i guess well just have to look at the facts i suppose so i just hope it doesnt affect your career long term taking off her glasses she eased forward into a more personal proxemic zone winston im curious tell me what did daniel say to you before you killed him hed dropped the gun and he was on his knees reaching for the cuffs then he looked up and he knew didnt he he wasnt a stupid man he knew he was dead did he say anything kellogg gave an involuntary recognition response though he said nothing her outburst was inappropriate of course and she knew it marked the end of the interrogation but that didnt matter she had her answers she had the truthor at least an approximation of it which according to the elusive science of kinesic analysis and interrogation is usually enough chapter dance and tj were in charles overbys office the cbi chief sat behind his desk nodding and looking at a picture of himself and his son catching a salmon or she couldnt tell for sure looking at his desk clock it was pm two straight nights the agent in charge had been working late a record i saw the whole interview you got some good stuff absolutely but he was pretty slick didnt really admit anything hardly a confession hes a high mach with an antisocial personality charles hes not the sort to confess i was just probing to see what his defenses would be and how hed structure the denials he destroyed computer files when he thought they implicated him in a suspicious suicide in la he used unauthorized ordnance his gun went off accidentally in my direction a juryd laugh all the way to a guilty verdict for him the interrogation was a disaster really he looked pretty confident he did and hell be a good defendant on the standif he takes the stand but tactically his case is hopeless he was arresting an armed killer and youre claiming that his motive is that his daughter died because of some cult thing thats not compelling i never worry too much about motive if a man kills his wife it doesnt really matter to the jury if it was because she served him a burned steak or he wants her insurance money murders murder itll become a lot less soap opera when we link kellogg to the others whove been killed dance told him about the other deaths the suspicious takedown in chicago last week and others in fort worth and new york the suicide in la and one in oregon one particularly troubling case was in florida where kellogg had gone to assist dade county deputies investigating charges of kidnapping earlier in the year a miami man had a communal house on the outskirts of the city the latino certainly had a devoted following some of them quite fanatical kellogg shot him when hed apparently lunged for a weapon during a raid but it was later discovered that the commune also ran a soup kitchen and a respected bible study class and was raising funds for a daycare center for children of working single parents in the neighborhood the kidnapping charges turned out to be bogus leveled by his exwife the local papers were still questioning the circumstances of his death interesting but im not sure any of that would be admissible her boss offered what about forensics from the beach dance felt a pang that michael oneil wasnt here to go through the technical side of the case why wasnt he calling back they found the slug that kellogg fired at kathryn tj said it conclusively matches his sig overby grunted accidental dischargerelax kathryn somebodys got to be the devils advocate here the shell casings from pells gun on the beach were found closer to kelloggs position than pells kellogg probably fired pells weapon himself to make it look like selfdefense oh and the lab found sand in kelloggs handcuffs that means kellogg suggests overby corrected suggests that kellogg disarmed pell got him into the open tossed the cuffs down and when pell went to pick them up killed him dance said look charles im not saying itll be a shooin but sandoval can win it i can testify that pell wasnt a threat when he was shot the pose of the bodys clear overbys eyes scanned his desk and settled on yet another framed fish picture motive hadnt he paid attention earlier probably not well his daughter hes killing anybody whos connected the cbi chief looked up and his eyes were sharp and probing no not kelloggs motive for killing him our motive for bringing the case ah right he meant of course her motive was it retribution because shed been betrayed by kellogg itll come up you know well need a response her boss was on a roll today but so was she because winston kellogg murdered someone within our jurisdiction overbys phone rang he stared at it for four trills then answered tj whispered thats a good motive better than he served you a lousy steak the cbi chief hung up staring at the picture of the salmon weve got visitors he straightened his tie the fbis here charles kathryn amy grabe took the coffee cup that was offered by overbys assistant and sat she gave a nod to tj dance chose an upright chair near the attractive but nononsense special agent in charge of the san francisco field office dance didnt go for the more comfortable but lower couch across from the woman sitting even an inch below someone puts you at a psychological disadvantage dance proceeded to tell the fbi agent the latest details about kellogg and nimue grabe knew some but not all of the tale she frowned as she listened motionless unlike fidgety overby her right hand rested on the opposite sleeve of her stylish burgundy suit dance made her case hes an active duty agent killing these people amy he lied to us he staged a dynamic entry when there was no need to he nearly got a dozen people hurt some couldve been killed overbys pen bounced like a drumstick and tjs kinesics read okay now this is an awkward moment grabes eyes beneath perfect brows scanned everyone in the room as she said its all very complicated and difficult i understand that but whatever happened ive gotten a call theyd like him released theyninth street she nodded and higher kelloggs a star great collar record saved hundreds of people from these cults and hes going to be taking on fundamentalist cases i mean terrorists now if it makes you feel any better i talked to them and theyll have an inquiry look into the takedowns see if he used excessive force the most powerful handgun known to man tj recited then fell silent under his bosss withering glance look into it dance asked her voice incredulous were talking questionable deathsfake suicides amy oh please its a vendetta pure and simple jesus even pell was above revenge and who knows what else kelloggs done kathryn her boss warned the fbi agent said the fact is hes a federal agent investigating crimes in which the perps are particularly dangerous and smart in some instances theyve been killed resisting happens all the time pell wasnt resisting i can testify to thatas an expert witness he was murdered overby was tapping a pencil on his immaculate blotter the man was a knotted ball of stress kellogg has arrestedhe has arrested you knowa lot of dangerous individuals a few have been killed fine amy we can go on and on about this for hours my concern isnt anything other than presenting a single homicide case to sandy sandoval whether washington likes it or not federalism at work tj said tap tap the pencil bounced and overby cleared his throat its not even a great case the sac pointed out shed apparently read all the details on the trip to the peninsula it doesnt have to be a slam dunk sandy can still win it grabe put the coffee down she turned her placid face to overby and leveled hard eyes at him charles theyve asked that you dont pursue it dance wasnt going to let them dump the case and all right some of her goddamn motive was because the man whod asked her out whod won a bit of her heart had betrayed her afterward how does that sound overbys eyes took in more pictures and mementos on his desk its a tough situation you know what oliver wendell holmes said he said that tough cases make bad law or maybe hard cases make bad law i dont remember what does that mean she wondered grabe said in a soft tone kathryn daniel pell was a dangerous man he killed law enforcers he killed people you know and he killed innocents youve done a great job in an impossible situation you stopped a really bad doer and kellogg contributed to that its a gold star for everybody absolutely overby said he set down the bouncing writing implement you know what this reminds me of amy jack ruby killing kennedys assassin remember i dont think anybody had a problem with what ruby did gunning oswald down dances jaw closed her teeth pressing together firmly she flicked her thumb against her forefinger just as hed reassured grabe of dances innocence in contributing to pells escape her boss was going to sell her out again by declining to submit the case to sandy sandoval overby wasnt just covering his ass he was as guilty of murder as kellogg himself dance sat back her shoulders slumping slightly she saw tjs grimace from the corner of her eye exactly grabe said so then overby held up a hand but a funny thing about that case what case the fbi agent asked the ruby case texas arrested him for murder and guess what jack ruby got convicted and sent to jail a shrug ill have to say no amy im submitting the kellogg case to the monterey county prosecutor im going to recommend indictment for murder lesser included offensell be manslaughter oh and aggravated assault on a cbi agent kellogg did take a shot at kathryn after all dance felt her heart thud had she heard this right tj glanced at her with a raised eyebrow overby was looking at dance he said and i think we should go for misuse of legal process too and lying to an investigative agent what do you think kathryn those hadnt occurred to her excellent she noticed tjs thumb subtly point upward grabe rubbed her cheek with a short pinkpolished nail do you really think this is a good idea charles oh i do absolutely saturday chapter tears pooling in her eyes a woman lay on the bed of the cheap transient hotel off del monte near highway listening to the hiss of traffic she was staring at the ceiling she wished she could stop crying but she couldnt because he was dead her daniel was gone jennie marston touched her head under the bandage which stung furiously she kept replaying the last few hours of their time together thursday standing on the beach south of carmel as he held the rock in the shape of jasmine her mothers cat the one thing her mother would never hurt recalling how daniel held the rock turning it over and over thats exactly what i was thinking lovely it looks just like a cat then hed held her tighter and whispered i was watching the news oh back at the motel thats right lovely the police found out about you about your name they know who you are they do she whispered in horror yes oh nodaniel sweetheart im sorry shed started shaking you left something in the room right then she remembered the email it was in her jeans in a weak voice she said it was the first one where you said you loved me i couldnt throw it out you told me to but i just couldnt im so sorry i its okay lovely but now we have to talk sure sweetheart shed said resigned to the worst she caressed her bumpy nose and no silent recitations of angel songs angel songs were going to help he was going to leave her make her go away but things were more complicated than that it seemed that one of the women in the family was working with him rebecca they were going to get another family together and go to his mountaintop live by themselves you werent supposed to be part of it lovely but when i got to know you i changed my mind i knew i couldnt live without you ill talk to rebecca itll take a little while shesdifficult but eventually shell do what i say youll become friends i dont know you and me lovely well be the team she and i never had that connection it was about something else if he meant they just had sex that was okay jennie wasnt jealous about that not too much she was jealous about him loving someone else sharing laughs and stories someone else being his lovely hed continued but now we have to be careful the police know you and theyll be able to find you easily so youve got to disappear disappear for a while a month or two oh i dont like it either ill miss you and she could see that he would dont worry everythingll work out i wont let you go really were going to pretend that i killed you the police will stop looking for you im going to have to cut you a little well put some blood on that rock and purse theyll think i hit you with the rock and threw you into the ocean itll hurt if it means we can be together though thinking not my hair not again what would she look like now id rather cut myself lovely but theres no way around it its okay come on over here sit down hold my leg squeeze my leg tight itll hurt less that way the pain was terrible but she bit down on her sleeve and squeezed his leg hard and managed not to scream as the knife cut and the blood flowed the bloody purse the bloody statue of jasmine theyd driven to where hed hidden the blue ford focus stolen at moss landing and he gave her the keys theyd said goodbye and shed gotten another room in this cheap hotel just as shed entered the room and turned on the tv lying back and cradling the agonizing wound on her head shed seen on the news that her daniel had been shot dead at point lobos shed screamed into the pillow beaten the mattress with her bony hands finally shed sobbed herself into a tortured sleep then shed wakened and lain in bed staring at the ceiling her eyes flicking from one corner to the other endlessly the compulsive gazing it reminded her of the endless hours lying in the bedroom when she was married head back waiting for the nosebleed to stop the pain to go away and tims bedroom and a dozen others lying on her back waiting waiting waiting jennie knew she had to get up get moving the police were looking for hershed seen her drivers license picture on tv unsmiling and her nose huge her face burned with horror at the image so get off your ass yet for the past few hours as shed lain on the cheap bed swayback and with coils ridging through the skimpy cover shed felt something curious within her a change like the first frost of autumn she wondered what the feeling was then she understood anger this was an emotion rare to jennie marston oh she was great at feeling bad great at being afraid great at scurrying great at waiting for the pain to go away or waiting for the pain to begin but now she was angry her hands shook and her breath came fast and then though the fury remained she found herself completely calm it was just like making candyyou cook the sugar for a long time until it reaches the hardboil stage bubbling and dangerous it would stick to your skin like burning glue and then you poured it onto a piece of marble and it cooled into a brittle sheet thats what jennie felt within her now cold anger within her heart hard teeth set heart pounding she walked into the bathroom and took a shower she sat at the cheap desk in front of a mirror and put on her makeup she spent nearly a halfhour doing this then looked at herself in the mirror and she liked what she saw angel songs she was thinking back to last thursday as theyd stood beside the ford focus jennie crying hugging daniel hard ill miss you so much sweetie she said then his voice had lowered now lovely ive got to go take care of something make sure our mountaintop is safe but theres one thing you need to do what daniel remember that night on the beach when i needed you to help me with that woman in the trunk she nodded youyou want me to help you do something like that again his blue eyes staring into hers i dont want you to help i need you to do it yourself me hed leaned close and gazed into her eyes yes if you dont well never have any peace well never be together she slowly nodded hed then handed her the pistol hed taken from the deputy guarding james reynoldss house he showed her how to use it jennie was surprised at how easy it was now feeling the anger within her splintery as hard candy jennie walked to the bed of the cheap motel and shook out the contents of the small shopping bag she was using as a purse the gun half of her remaining money some personal effects and the other thing daniel had given her a slip of paper jennie now opened the note and stared at what it contained the names kathryn dance stuart and edie dance and several addresses she heard her lovers voice as hed slipped the gun into the bag and handed it to her be patient lovely take your time and whats the most important thing ive taught you to stay in control shed recited you get an aplus lovely and he delivered what turned out to be their last kiss chapter leaving headquarters dance headed down to the point lobos inn to see about transferring the bill from kelloggs credit card to the cbis own account charles overby wasnt happy about the expenditure of course but there was an inherent conflict of interest in having a criminal defendant pay for expenses to help out the very institution that had arrested him so overby had agreed to swallow the cost of the inn his shining moment of supporting kelloggs prosecution didnt extend to other aspects of his personality though he whined mightily about the bill jordan cabernet who drank the jordan and two bottles dance didnt tell him that shed volunteered to let samantha mccoy stay there for an extra few days as she was driving she listened to some music by altan the celtic group green grow the rushes o was the song the melody was haunting which seemed appropriate under the circumstances since she was en route to the location where people had died she was thinking of the trip to southern california next weekend the kids and dogs in tow she was going to record a group of mexican musicians near ojai they were fans of the website and had emailed martine some samples of their music dance wanted to get some live recordings the rhythms were fascinating she was looking forward to the trip the roads here werent crowded the bad weather had returned dance saw only one car behind her on the entire road a blue sedan trailing behind her a halfmile dance turned off the road and headed to the point lobos inn she glanced at her phone still no message from oneil she was troubled to learn dance could call him on the pretense of a case and hed call her back immediately but she couldnt do that besides probably better to keep some distance its a fine line when youre friends with a married man she turned down the inns driveway and parked listened to the end of the elegiac song dance recalled her own husbands funeral it was logical that bill with a wife two children and a home in pacific grove should be buried nearby his headstrong mother though had wanted him buried in san francisco a city hed fled when he was eighteen returning only on holidays and not a lot of them mrs swenson had been strident when discussing her sons resting place dance had prevailed though she felt bad to see her motherinlaws tears and had paid for the victory in small ways for a year afterward bill was now on a hillside where you could see plenty of trees a stretch of pacific ocean and a sliver of the ninth hole at pebble beacha gravesite for which thousands of golfers would have paid dearly she recalled that though neither she nor her husband played theyd planned on taking lessons at some point maybe when we retire hed said retire whats that mean again she now parked and walked into the point lobos inn office then took care of the paperwork we already had some calls the clerk said reporters wanting to get pictures of the cabin and somebodys planning to give tours of where pell got shot thats sick yep it was morton nagle would not have approved perhaps the tactless entrepreneur would appear as a footnote in the sleeping doll as dance was walking back to the car she was aware of a woman nearby looking out into the mists toward the ocean her jacket fluttering in the breeze as dance continued on the woman turned away from the view and fell into a pace that matched the agents not far behind she also noticed that a blue car was parked nearby it was familiar was this the driver whod been behind her then she noticed that it was a ford focus and recalled that the vehicle stolen at moss landing had never been recovered it too was blue were there any other loose ends that at that moment the woman walked up to her quickly and called a harsh voice over the wind are you kathryn dance surprised the agent stopped and turned thats right do i know you the woman continued until she was a few feet away she took off her sunglasses revealing a familiar face though dance couldnt place it weve never met but we kind of know each other im daniel pells girlfriend youre dance gasped jennie marston dances hand dropped to her pistol but before she touched the weapons grip jennie said i want to turn myself in she held her wrists out apparently for the handcuffs a considerate gesture dance had never seen in all her years as a lawenforcement agent i was supposed to kill you this news didnt alarm her as much as it might considering that daniel pell was dead jennies hands were cuffed and dance had found no weapons on her or in the car he gave me a gun but its back at the motel really id never hurt you she didnt seem capable of it true he said no policeman had ever gotten into his mind like you had he was afraid of you threats have to be eliminated so he faked your death he cut me jennie showed her a bandage on the back of her head some skin and hair and blood your head bleeds a lot she sighed then he gave me your address and your parents i was supposed to kill you he knew youd never let him get away you agreed i didnt really say anything one way or the other she shook her head he was so hard to say no to he just assumed i would because id always done what he wanted he wanted me to kill you and then come live with him and rebecca in the woods somewhere wed start a new family you knew about rebecca he told me in a wisp of a voice did she write the emails to me pretending to be him yes her lips pressed together tightly they didnt sound like the way he talked i thought somebody else wrote them but i didnt want to ask sometimes you just dont want to know the truth amen thought kathryn dance how did you get here did you follow me thats right i wanted to talk to you in person i thought if i just turned myself in theyd take me right to jail but i had to ask were you there when he was shot did he say anything no im sorry oh i was just wondering her lips tightened a kinesic clue to remorse then a glance at dance i didnt mean to scare you ive had worse scares lately dance told her why didnt you run though maybe in a few weeks when your body didnt wash up on shore wedve wondered but you couldve gotten to mexico or canada by the time we started searching i guess i just got out from underneath his spell i thought thingsd be different with daniel i got to know him firstyou know not just the physical stuffand we developed this real connection or i thought it was but then i figured that was all a lie rebecca probably told him everything about me so he could hook me in you know just like my husband and boyfriends i used to get picked up in bars or at catering jobs daniel did the same thing only he was just a lot smarter about it all my life i thought i needed a man id have this idea i was like a flashlight and men were the batteries i couldnt shine without one in my life but then after daniel was killed i was in this motel room and all of a sudden i felt different i got mad it was weird i could taste it i was so mad that like never happened to me before and i knew i had to do something about it but not moaning about daniel not going out and finding a new man which i always would do in the past no i wanted to do something for me and whats the best thing i could do get arrested she gave a laugh sounds stupid but its all my decision nobody elses i think thats a good one well see so i guess thats it it pretty much was dance decided she escorted jennie back to the taurus as they drove to salinas dance mentally tallied up the charges arson felony murder conspiracy harboring a fugitive several others still the woman had surrendered voluntarily and appeared as contrite as they came dance would interview her later if she agreed and if jennie was as sincere as she seemed the agent would go to bat for her with sandoval at the lockup in the courthouse dance processed her into the system is there anybody you want me to call dance asked she started to say something then stopped and gave a soft laugh no i think its best you know just to start over im fine theyll get you a lawyer then maybe you and i could spend some more time talking sure and she was led down the very hallway her lover had escaped from almost one week before chapter it was perhaps a spectacularly bright saturday afternoon two or three hundred feet up but the grounds of monterey bay hospital were leached gray by the dense fog the mist carried with it the fragrance of pine eucalyptus and flowersgardenia kathryn dance believed but wasnt sure she liked plants but like meals she preferred to purchase them fully functional from those in the know rather than try her own hand and risk destruction standing beside one of the gardens dance watched linda whitfield being wheeled out of the front door by her brother roger was a slim austere man whose age could have been anywhere from thirtyfive to fiftyfive he fit dances expectations quiet and conservative wearing pressed jeans a dress shirt starched and ironed and a striped tie held in place with a bar that had a cross on it hed greeted dance with a very firm handshake and no smile whatsoever ill get the truck excuse me please are you up for the drive dance asked the woman after hed gone well see we know some people in mendocino who used to be in our church roger called them we might stop there for the night lindas eyes were unfocused and shed been giving giddy laughs at nothing in particular dance deduced that the painkiller shed taken was really really good id vote for stopping take it easy be coddled coddled she laughed at the word hows rebecca i havent asked about her still in intensive care a nod at the hospital probably not too far from where you were is she going to be okay they think so ill pray for her another laugh it reminded dance of morton nagles signature chuckle dance crouched down beside the chair i cant thank you enough for what you did i know it was hard and im so sorry you were hurt but we couldntve stopped him without you god does his work life goes on its all for the good dance didnt follow it was like one of charles overbys nonsequiturs linda blinked where will daniel be buried we called his aunt in bakersfield but she doesnt even remember her own name his brotherrichard hes not interested hell be buried here after the autopsy in monterey county for indigent funerals the bodys cremated theres a public cemetery is it consecrated i dont know id suppose so if not could you find a place for him a proper resting place ill pay the man whod tried to kill her ill make sure thank you it was then that a dark blue acura careened recklessly up the driveway and skidded to a stop nearby the cars arrival was so abrupt that dance crouched in alarm and her hand dropped to her pistol but the agent relaxed immediately seeing samantha mccoy emerging from the drivers seat the woman joined dance and linda she asked howre you feeling im on pills right now i think ill be pretty sore tomorrow well probably for the next month you were leaving without saying goodbye my why would you think that i was going to call the deception was easily spotted by dance probably by samantha as well you look good another slurred chuckle was the response silence deep silence the fog swallowed up whole any ambient noise with her hands on her hips samantha looked down at linda strange few days huh the woman gave a curious laugh both groggy and cautious linda i want to call you we could get together why to psychoanalyze me to save me from the clutches of the church bitterness bled from the words i just want to see you it doesnt have to be about more than that with some mental effort linda offered sam we were different people eight nine years ago you and me were even more different now we have nothing in common nothing in common well thats not true we went through hell together yeah we did and god helped us through it and then sent us in different directions samantha crouched and carefully took the womans arm mindful of the wound she was well within lindas personal proxemic zone listen to me you listening what impatient there was a man once a man listen this man was in his house and there was a bad flood really bad the river filled his first floor and a boat came by to rescue him but he said no go on godll save me he ran to the second floor but the water rose up there too another rescue boat came by but he said no go on godll save me then the river kept rising and he climbed to the roof and a helicopter came by but he said no go on godll save me and the helicopter flew away words slurred from the medication linda asked whatre you talking about sam continued unfazed then the water sweeps him off the roof and he drowns next thing hes in heaven and he sees god and he says god why didnt you save me and god shakes his head and says funny i dont understand what went wrong i sent you two boats and a helicopter dance chuckled linda blinked at the punch line and the agent thought wanted to smile but forced herself not to come on lindawere each others helicopters admit it the woman said nothing sam thrust a card into the womans hand heres my number linda said nothing for a long moment staring at the card sarah starkey thats your name samantha smiled i cant change it back at this point but i am going to tell my husband everything hes on his way here now with our son were going to spend a few days in the area thats what im hoping but after i tell him he might just get back in the car and head home linda gave no response she flicked the card with her thumb slipped it into her purse and looked up the driveway as a battered silver pickup truck approached it stopped and roger whitfield climbed out samantha introduced herself to lindas brother using her original name not sarah the man greeted her with a raised eyebrow and another formal handshake then he and dance helped linda into the car and the agent closed the door samantha stepped up on the running board linda remember helicopters the woman said goodbye sam ill pray for you with no other words or gestures the brother and sister drove off samantha and dance watched them ease down the winding drive as the taillights glowing orbs in the fog grew fainter after they were gone dance asked whens your husband getting here he left san jose an hour ago pretty soon id guess sam nodded after the pickup truck think shes going to call me all of kathryn dances skill as an investigator all of her talent as a reader of body language couldnt answer that question the best she could come up with was she didnt throw your card away did she not yet samantha said offered a weak smile and walked back to her car the evening sky was clear the fog busy elsewhere kathryn dance was on the deck alone though patsy and dylan were nearby roaming the backyard engaged in dog intrigue shed finished the preparations for her fathers big birthday party tomorrow night and was sipping a german beer while listening to a prairie home companion garrison keillors variety radio show shed been a fan of for years when the program concluded she shut off the stereo and heard in its stead the distant sound track of maggie playing scales and the faint bass of wess stereo listening to the boys musicshe thought it was coldplaykathryn dance debated a moment then impulsively pulled out her cell phone found a number in the samsung and pushed send well hi there brian gunderson said answering the phone caller id has created a whole new response mechanism she thought hedve had three full seconds to figure out a game plan for the conversation tailored specifically to kathryn dance hi she responded hey sorry i havent gotten back to you i know you called a few times brian gave a laugh and she remembered the times theyd spent together dinner walking on the beach he had a nice laugh and he kissed well id say if anybody has an excuse its you ive been watching the news whos overby my boss oh the crazy one you told me about yep dance wondered how indiscreet shed been i saw a press conference and he mentioned you he said you were his assistant in capturing pell she laughed if tj had heard it was only a matter of time until she got a message for assistant dance so you got him hes got and then some howve you been she asked good up in san fran for a few days wheedling money out of people who were wheedling money out of other people and i wheedled a fee worked out for everybody he added that hed had a flat tire on the returning home an amateur barbershop quartet coming back from a gig had stopped directed traffic and changed the tire for him they sing while they changed it sadly no but im going to one of their shows in burlingame was this an invitation she wondered how are the kids he asked fine being kids she paused wondering if she should ask him out for drinks first or go right for dinner she figured dinner was safe given that they had a history brian said anyway thanks for calling back sure but never mind never mind the reason i called a friend and ire going down to la jolla this week friend what a marvelously diverse word that is thats great you going to snorkel you said you wanted to i remember there was a huge underwater wildlife refuge there she and brian had talked about going oh yeah weve got that planned i just called to see if i could pick up that book i lent you the one about backpacking trails down near san diego oh im sorry not a problem i bought another one keep it im sure youll get down there some day she gave a laugha morton nagle chuckle sure everything else going well real well yeah ill call you when im back in town kathryn dance kinesics analyst and seasoned interrogator knew that people often lie expectingeven hopingthat the listener spots the deception usually in contexts just like this one thatd be great brian she guessed theyd never share another word together in their lives dance folded up the phone and walked into her bedroom she pushed aside the sea of shoes and found her old martin guitar with a mahogany back and sides and a spruce top aged the color of taffy she carried it out to the deck sat down and with fingers clumsy from the chilland lack of practicetuned up and started to play first some scales and arpeggios then the bob dylan song tomorrow is a long time her thoughts were meandering from brian gunderson to the front seat of the cbi taurus and winston kellogg tasting mint smelling skin and aftershave as she played she noticed motion inside the house dance saw her son beeline to the refrigerator and cart a cookie and glass of milk back into his room the raid took all of thirty seconds she found herself thinking that shed been treating wess attitude all along as an aberration a flaw to be fixed parents tend to feel that their children raise valid objections about potential stepparents or even casual dates you cant think that way but now dance wasnt so sure maybe they do raise real concerns at times maybe we should listen to them and as carefully and with as open a mind as if interviewing witnesses in a criminal investigation maybe shed been taking him for granted all along sure wes was a child not a partner but he still should have a vote here i am she thought a kinesic expert establishing baselines and looking for deviations as signals that somethings not right with winston kellogg was i deviating from my own baseline maybe the boys reaction was a clue that she had something to think about dance was halfway through a paul simon song humming the melody not sure of the lyrics when she heard the creak of the gate below the deck the instrument went silent as she glanced over to see michael oneil breach the stairs he was wearing the gray and maroon sweater shed bought for him when shed been skiing in colorado a year ago hey he said intruding never annes got an opening in an hour but i thought id stop by here first say hi glad you did he pulled a beer from the fridge and when she nodded got another for her too he sat down next to her the becks snapped open crisply they both sipped long she started playing an instrumental transcribed for guitar an old celtic tune by turlough ocarolan the blind itinerant irish harpist oneil said nothing just drank the beer and nodded with the rhythm his eyes she noticed were turned toward the oceanthough he couldnt see it the view was obscured by lush pines she remembered that once after seeing the old spencer tracy movie about hemingways obsessed fisherman wes had called oneil the old man of the sea he and dance had laughed hard at that when she finished playing he said theres a problem with the juan situation did you hear juan millar no what the autopsy report came in the coroners division found secondary causes labeled them suspicious weve got a file started at mcso what happened it wasnt infection or shock he died of which is usually what happens in a bad burn it was from an interaction of morphine and diphenhydraminethats an antihistamine the morphine drip was open wider than it shouldve been and none of the doctors had prescribed an antihistamine its dangerous to mix with morphine intentional looks like it he couldnt do it himself were probably looking at murder dance heard her mothers whispered report of millars words kill me she wondered who mightve been behind the death mercy killings were among the most difficult and emotional cases to investigate dance shook her head and after all his familys been through whatever we can do let me know they sat in silence for a moment dance smelling woodfire smokeand another dose of oneils aftershave she enjoyed the combination she started to play once again elizabeth cottens fingerpicking version of freight train as infectious a melody as ever existed it would rattle around in her brain for days oneil said heard about winston kellogg never wouldve called that one word travels fast yep tj gave me all the gruesome details he shook his head and gestured for dylan and patsy the dogs bounded over to him he handed out milk bones from a cookie jar that sat beside a bottle of dubious tequila they took the treats and raced off he said sounds like itll be a tough case pressure from washington to drop it ill bet oh yeah uphill all the way if youve interested we might want to make some calls chicago miami or la oneil blinked then gave a laugh youve been considering it too hm whats the strongest dance replied id go with the suspicious suicide in la its in state so cbis got jurisdiction and kellogg cant claim that the cult leader died during a takedown and thats the file that kellogg destroyed why else would he do that if he wasnt guilty shed decided that if kellogg got off the hook on the pell killing which was a possibility she wouldnt let the matter rest there shed pursue the case against him in other venues and apparently she wasnt going to do it alone good oneil said lets get together tomorrow and look over the evidence she nodded the detective finished the beer and got another one i dont suppose overbyd spring for a trip to la believe it or not i think he would really if we fly coach and standby oneil added they laughed any requests she tapped the old martin which resounded like a crisp drum nope he leaned back and stretched his scuffed shoes out in front of him whatever youre in the mood for kathryn dance thought for a moment and began to play authors note the california bureau of investigation within the states attorney generals office does indeed exist and i hope the dedicated men and women of that fine organization will forgive me for taking the liberty of reorganizing it some and creating an office on the picturesque monterey peninsula ive tinkered a bit too with the excellent monterey county sheriffs office similarly i trust the residents of capitola near santa cruz will forgive my plopping a fictional superprison down in their midst those interested in the topics of kinesics and interrogation and wishing to read further might enjoy the books ive found extremely helpful and which sit prominently on kathryn dances and my bookshelves principles of
