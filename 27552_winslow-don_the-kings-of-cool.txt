don winslow the kings of cool fuck me laguna beach california is what o is thinking as she sits between chon and ben on a bench at main beach and picks out potential mates for them that one she asks pointing at a classic bb basically baywatch strolling down the boardwalk chon shakes his head a little dismissively o thinks chon is pretty choosy for a guy who spends most of his time in afghanistan or iraq and doesnt see much in the way of anything outside cammies or a burqa actually she can see how the burqa thing could be pretty hot if you played it off right did you know the harem thing yeah no the burqa aint gonna work for o you dont want to hide that blonde hair you dont want those bright eyes peeking out from behind a niqab o was made for sunshine california gurl chon he aint small but hes thin o thinks he looks even thinner than usual hes always been cut but now it looks like hes been carved with a scalpel and she likes the short almost shaved hair that one she asks jutting her chin at a touristtype brunette with really big tits and a retrousse nose chon shakes his head ben remains silent sphinxlike which is a role reversal because ben is usually the more verbal of the two this isnt a high bar to jump as chon doesnt talk a lot except when he goes off on a rant then its like you pulled the plug from a fire hose while ben is the more verbal o considers now hes also the less promiscuous ben is more consecutive monogamy while chon is more women are to be served concurrently although o knows for a fact that both of themalbeit chon more than bentake full advantage of the tourist chicks who watch them play volleyball here at the beach just a few convenient paces from the hotel lagunaencounters she refers to as frso fuckroom serviceshowerout that pretty much sums it up chon has admitted although at times he skips the room service never the shower basic rule of survival in the greater cross v crescent sandbox tournament if theres a shower take it he cant shake off the habit at home anyway chon admits to doing matinees at the hotel laguna the ritz the st regis and the montage with not only tourist women but also orange county trophy wives and divorceesthe difference between the two being strictly temporary thats the thing about chonhes totally honest no pretensions no evasions no apologies o cant decide if thats because hes so ethical or because he just doesnt give a fuck now he turns to her and says you have one strike left choose carefully its a game they playodboffline dating baseball predicting each others sexual preferences and hitting for a single a double a triple or a home run its a really good game when youre high which they are now on some of ben and chons supremo weed which is not weed at all but a topoftheline hydro blend they call saturday in the park because if you take a hit of this stuff any day is saturday and any place is the park o is usually the sammy sosa of odb but now with runners on first and third shes striking out well chon asks her im waiting for a good pitch she says scanning the beach chons been in iraq hes been in afghanistan go exotic she points to a beautiful south asian girl with shimmering black hair setting off her white beach dress her strikeout chon answers not my type what is your type o asks frustrated tan chon answers thinsweet facebig brown eyes long lashes o turns to ben ben chon wants to fuck bambi bens a little distracted sort of following the game but not really because his mind is on something that happened this morning this morning like most mornings ben eased into his day at the coyote grill he got a table on the open deck near the fireplace and ordered his usual pot of black coffee and the crazygood eggs machaca for those in the benighted regions east of i thats scrambled eggs with chicken and salsa a side of black beans fried potatoes and either corn or flour tortillas which might be the best thing in the history of the universe opened his laptop and read the gray lady to see what bush and his coconspirators were doing on that particular day to render the world uninhabitable this is his routine bens partner chon has warned him against habits its not a habit ben answered its a routine a habit is a matter of compulsion a routine a matter of choice the fact that its the same choice every day is irrelevant whatever chon answered break it up cross the pch to the heidelberg cafe or drive down to dana point harbor check out the yummymummies jogging with their strollers make a freaking pot of coffee at home for chrissakes but do not do not do not do the same thing every day at the same time its how we nail some of these aq clowns chon said you shoot aq guys while they eat eggs machaca at the coyote grill ben asked who knew funny asshole yeah it was sort of funny but not really funny because chon has smudged more than a few al qaeda taliban and their assorted affiliates precisely because they fell into the bad habit of having a habit he either pulled the trigger himself or did it remote control by calling in a drone strike from some warmaster prodigy sitting in a bunker in nevada knocking back mountain dew while he smoked some unsuspecting muj with a keystroke the problem with contemporary warfare is that it has become a video game unless youre on the actual ground and get shot in which case it is most definitely not whether direct from chon or run through the gamer it had the same effect hemingwayesque blood and sand without the bullshit all true but nevertheless ben isnt going to get into this whole subterfuge thing any more than he has to hes in the dope business to increase his freedom not to limit it make his life bigger not smaller what do you want me to do he asked chon live in a bunker while im gone chon answered yeah okay yeah not okay ben sticks to his routine this particular morning kari the waitress of eurasian persuasion and almost realitydefying beautygolden skin almond eyes sable hair legs longer than a wisconsin winterpoured his coffee hey ben hey kari ben is seriously trying to get with her so fuck you chon kari brought the food ben dug into the machaca and the times then he felt this guy sit down across from him burly guy big sloping shoulders sandy receding hair combed straight back kind of old school in fact he was wearing one of those old guys rule tshirts which totally miss the obvious point that if old guys really ruled they wouldnt have to proclaim it on a cheap tshirt theyd just you know rule these are guys who cant figure out social media technology so ben figures their days of rule have gone the way of the compact disc anyway this guy who looked to be in his fifties sat there staring at ben very high creepiness rating ben was like do i know you am i supposed to know you is this some sort of weird earlymorning gay thing or is this guy just one of those im a people person tools who thinks its his human duty to strike up conversations with people sitting alone at restaurants ben is not iliketomeetnewpeople guy hes imreadingmyfrea kingnewspaperandflirtingwiththewaitresssoleavemethefuckalo ne guy so he said bro no offense but im kind of into what im reading like there are five empty tables why dont you sit down at one of them the guy said ill only take a minute of your time son im not your son ben said unless my mother has been deceiving me all these years shut your smartass mouth and listen the guy said quietly we didnt mind when you were selling a little custom shit to your friends but when it starts showing up in albertsons its a problem its a free market ben answered thinking he sounded like a republican all of a sudden seeing as how ben is generally to the left of trotsky this came as an unpleasant epiphany there is no such thing as a free market old guys rule said the market coststhere are expenses you want to sell up in la compete with our little brown and black brothers be our guest orange county san diego riversideyou pay a licensing fee are you paying attention im riveted are you clowning me no because i wouldnt like that and i wouldnt blame you ben said so for the sake of discussion what happens if i dont pay this licensing fee you dont want to find out okay but just for the sake of discussion old guys rule looked at him like he was wondering if this kid was fucking with him and then said we put you out of business whos we ben asked he saw the look on the guys face and said i knowi dont want to find out and if i do pay this fee ogr held out his hands and said welcome to the market got it so we have an understanding we do ben said ogr smiled satisfied until ben added we have an understanding youre an asshole because its also bens understanding that no one controls the marijuana market cocaineyes that would be the mexican cartels heroinditto meththe biker gangs more recently the mexicans prescription pillsthe pharmaceutical industry but the free market which is excellent because it runs by market rulesprice point quality distribution the customer is king so ben pretty much dismissed this guy as some whackjob trying to jerk his chain still its a little troubling ben thoughthow does the guy know who i am and who is this guy whoever he is he gave ben one of those oldschool stares until ben actually had to laugh ogr stood up and said you motherfuckers think youre the kings of cool right you know everything no one can tell you anything well let me tell you somethingyou dont know shit ogr gave ben one more bobby badass look and then walked out the kings of cool ben thought he kind of liked it now he turns his attention back to the game im pretty sure thats illegal ben says lacing his fingers behind his head and tilting his face to the sun to have sex with a deer or with a cartoon character chon asks both ben says and may i point out that bambi is an underage animated ungulate not to mention a male bambi is a boy o asks again bambi is a deer ben clarifies but yes hes a boy deer then why are so many girls in playboy named bambi o asks she likes playboy and is grateful that stepfather number four keeps them in his home office desk drawer so paqu paqu is what o calls her mother the passive aggressive queen of the universe doesnt see them and get pissy because she is an older version of the centerfolds who is constantly attempting to airbrush herself via expensive cosmetics and more expensive cosmetic surgery o is pretty sure that the national geographic channel is going to do an archaeological dig on her mother in a futile quest to find a single original body part a private joke that explains why o gave four a pith helmet for his last birthday why thank you ophelia a puzzled four said youre welcome whats it for paqu asked icily to keep the sun off your vagina o answered girls are named bambi ben says now because we are culturally ignorant of even pop culture and because we crave the archetype of childlike innocence combined with adult sexuality his parents are both psychotherapists ben oh ben o thinks hard body soft heart long brown hair warm brown eyes but thats me o tells him childlike innocence combined with adult sexuality short blonde hair thin hips no rack to speak of tiny butt on her petite frame and yes big eyesalbeit blue not brown no ben says youre more adult innocence combined with childlike sexuality he has a point o thinks she does view sex mostly as playa fun thingnot a job to be performed to prove ones love this is why she has opined theyre called sex toys instead of sex tools bambi is a protofascist piece of work chon snarls it might as well have been shot by leni riefenstahl chon reads bookschon reads the dictionary and also hits the foreign filmsclassics section of netflix he could explain to you except he wont speaking of gender ambiguity o says i told paqu that im thinking of becoming bisexual what did she say ben asks she said what o answers then i wussed out and said i think i want a bicycle to pedal to your girlfriends house ben asks to pedal to your girlfriends house o counters she could play for either or both teams and would be heavily recruited because at nineteen shes dropdead gorgeous but she doesnt know that yet o describes herself as polysexual like pollyanna only way happier she explains she would consider going ltg lesbian till graduation except she isnt in school a fact that paqu points out to her on a near daily basis she tried junior college for a semester okay the first three weeks of a semester but it was well junior college right now shes just glad to have her guys here as for odb they can have any women they want as long as one of them is her check that she thinks they can have any woman they want as long as im the one they love the pain of it is the pain of it is chon flies out tonight this is his last day on the beach specifically laguna beach california the brightest pearl in the socal necklace of coastal towns that stretches down that lovely neck from newport beach to mexico going along the strand pun intended newport beach corona del mar laguna beach capistrano beach san clemente interrupt for camp pendleton oceanside carlsbad leucadia encinitas cardiffbythesea solana beach del mar torrey pines la jolla shores la jolla pacific beach mission beach ocean beach coronado silver strand imperial beach all beautiful all fine but the best one is lagoona which was the name officially given to the town by the state of california until someone explained that there was no actual lagoon but that the name derived from canada de las lagunas which in spanish means canyon of the lakes there are two lakes up in the hills above said canyon but laguna isnt known for its lakes its known for its beaches and its beauty about which ben chon and o are a little blase because they grew up here and take it for granted yeah except chon doesnt right now because his leave is up and hes about to go back to afghanistan aka stanland or in the spirit of things afgoonistan chon tells ben and o that he literally has to get packing he goes back to his efficiency apartment on glenneyre and packs a baseball bat into his green mustang in honor of steve mcqueen the king of cool and drives down to san clemente not far from richard nixons version of elba and hence known in the latter half of the s as sans clemency nixon poor nixon the only truly tragic hero in the american political theater the only recent president more aeschylus than rodgers and hammerstein first there was camelot then the best little whorehouse in texas then richard chon drives not to the old western white house the real name of which was with presumably unintended irony la casa pacifica peaceful house there was nixon in exile prowling around the peaceful house chatting with paintings while down on the actual pacific secret service agents chased surfers away from the nearby famous break at upper trestles lest they organize an assassination attempt which is it should be noted probably the first time that the words surfers and organize have been used in the same paragraph surfers an assassination attempt surfers california surfers okay lets coordinate our watches uhhhhhh watches anyway chon drives to the hospital who did this to you chon asks sam casey one of their best sales partners lies in bed with a broken jaw a concussion his right arm fractured in three places and internal bleeding someone beat the holy hell out of sam brian hennessy and three of his surfer buddies sam says through his wired jaw i was selling them a lousy qp and they ripped me off youve sold to them before right chon asks one of ben and chons cardinal rules never sell to anyone you dont know maybe only chon would know that cardinal rule doesnt come from the catholic religious official but from the latin cardo which means hinge so a cardinal rule is something that everything else hinges upon everything hinges upon not selling dope to people you dont know and know well ive sold to them a dozen times sam says never any trouble okay so look the bills are covered chon says ben has set up a shell corporation through which he offers health insurance to sales partners who are fully vested ill take care of brian do me a favor though dont mention this to ben because ben doesnt believe in violence chon does its an ageold debate not to be rehashed here but basically ben believes that to answer violence with violence only begets more violence while chon believes that to answer violence with nonviolence only begets more violence his evidence being the entire history of humanity oddly enough they both believe in karmawhat goes around comes aroundexcept with chon it comes around in a freaking hurry and usually with ill intent what chon calls microwave karma together ben and chon make up a collective pacifist ben is the paci chon is the fist rule of life okay more of a strong suggestion if you absolutely have to be an asshole make yourself a little hard to find go do your assholian bullshit and then lock yourself in your mothers basement and put a towel over the xbox to block the light but dont beat someone up and then go surfing in your usual spot just dont do it asshole first of all try not being a dick for a change and see how that works out but in any case dont park your van where you usually stick the piece of shit while youre out for one of your sessions bra because someone like chon or in this case chon might take a baseball bat to it chon smashes out the headlights the taillights the windshield and all the windows baseball in the steroid era then leans on the horn until brian and his three buddies madly paddle in like natives in one of those old tarzan movies brian who is a big freaking dude comes out of the water first screaming dude what the fuck chon slides out of the car drops the bat and asks are you brian yeah bad answer seriously bad answer billy jack youve seen it you know what im talking about dont even try to pretend that okay fine chons sweeping inside roundhouse kick breaks brians jaw and gives him a concussion before he even hits the dirt unconscious little pound signs in his eyes like its a cartoon chon steps over brians prone body and drives his fist into the solar plexus of buddy one bending him over chon grabs the back of buddy ones head and pulls it down as he drives his knee up into buddy ones face then throws him away and moves on to buddy two who lifts his fists up beside his face which does no good at all as chon sweepkicks him in the lower right leg knocking him off his feet the back of buddy twos head hits the ground hard but not as hard as the two sideblade kicks that chon delivers to his face shattering his nose and rendering him as they say unconscious as buddy three buddy three ahhh buddy three sad fact of life smart people sometimes get stupid but stupid people never get smart never ever you can come down the evolutionary ladder chon has observed to ben and o you cant climb up okay theres always that yayo in the mall trying to run up the down escalator but that just proves the point so buddy three having witnessed the utter destruction of his three pals in a matter of singledigit seconds flees to the inside of the van where if he were smart he would remain and emerges see with a pistol and says to chon now what are you going to do asshole the prosecution rests god is god darwin is darwin ext beach parking lot day an unconscious surfer with a pistol with the safety on jammed in his mouth lies slumped out of the sliding door of a van two other surfers lie in fetal positions on the ground in their wet suits they look like baby seals in a peta clip chon roots around in the console of the van and comes up with a plasticwrapped quarter pound of dope which he jams into his jacket pocket then he steps over to a fourth surfer brian who is on all fours trying unsuccessfully to get to his feet chon kicks him in the ribs several times then grabs him by the collar and drags him over to the van chon brian let the word go forth from this time and place it is not okay to steal our product it is especially not okay to lay hands on our people and one other thing chon stretches brians right arm over the edge of the vans bumper then picks up the baseball bat and crack brian screams chon next time ill kill you time to go os trying to get out of the fucking house very expensive house in the exclusive gated community of monarch bay except paqu is like on it what are you going to do with your life she asks i dunno are you going back to school i dunno are you going to get a job i dunno check paqu out blonde hair perfectly coiffed chiseled not metaphorically features makeup perrrfect a couple of gr worth of clothing on her perrrfectly toned sculpted body that features ttdf tits to die for many male ships have been wrecked on those cliffs my friend crashed and broken apart y chromosomes flailing the crazybad whitewater waiting for a jet ski that aint coming now she turns her formidable tits and formidabler eyes on o well you have to do something i dunno o answers wilting under the fourpoint gaze you have thirty days paqu says to get a job or go back to school paqu answers cutting up strawberries and putting the pieces into a blender with two scoops of protein powder shes been into power smoothies lately oh god o answers have you been to one of those tough love seminars again dvd paqu answers did four put you up to this o asks she knows that four put her up to it because he doesnt want an adult child cluttering up the house he thinks is his just because he nails paqu in it i was in this house before you were o thinks come to think of it i was in paqu before you were nobody put me up to it paqu yells over the whirl of the blender i have a mind of my own you know and if you go back to school you have to take it seriously o had a gpa at saddleback before she gave up the charade entirely and just stopped going what if i dont she asks dont what will you shut that fucking thing off paqu turns off the blender and pours her power smoothie into a glass o knows that in a half hour shell go to the gym to work with her personal trainer for two hours then drink a meal replacement shake then go to yoga before coming home for a power nap then shell spend two hours getting herself ready for when four comes home and she thinks im a useless cunt o thinks you have a powersmoothie mustache o tells her if you dont get a job or go back to school paqu says wiping her upper lip with the back of her index finger you cant live here anymore youll have to find your own place i dont have money for my own place that is not my problem paqu saysobviously practiced from the dvd but they both know that it is paqus problem that is shell forget about it o thinks cognizant of paqus bipolar approach to parenting paqu has wide swings between absent neglectful mother and smothering controlling mother so like paqu will take off on a european vacation rehab spiritual retreat or just another affair and totally forget about o then shell come back feel guilty and go in the complete other direction micromanaging os life down to the tiniest details of clothing friends education or lack thereof career see education and proteincarbohydrate balance and was literally up her ass during a truly unfortunate colonic phase its eitheror there is no middle ground and it has been ever thus the worst is when paqu comes back from rehab or a spiritual retreat having fixed herself she sets out to fix o im not broken o argued one time oh darling paqu answered were all broken indeed o thought paqu does spend a lot of time in the body shop anyhoo after a long discussion about os denial regarding her brokenness it was decided that selfrealization was a river that simply couldnt be pushed and that o would have to remain in the eddy of her own delusion which was just fine with o although she was pretty sure that delusional eddy was a guy paqu briefly dated but now this thirtyday thing o heads for the door where are you going to join the peace corps o answers or go see chon which is the exact opposite actually it was the fact that o had no freaking idea what she was going to do with her life that led ben and chon into the marijuana business two years ago because it engendered a discussion of vocation and wordsmith chon observed that vocation is merely one vowel removed from vacation yet could be considered an antonym that is vocation n from the latin verb to call an occupation to which a person is specially drawn or for which he or she is suited trained or qualified vacation n freedom from occupation but ben asked do you want freedom from something to which youre especially drawn probably not so on his next deployment chon came home with a purple heart a new set of nightmares and a seed the white widow a particularly fine thcladen breed of cannabis when the seed of an idea meets the actual physical seed it is seminal seminal adj pertaining to containing or consisting of semen uhhhh no botany of or pertaining to seed obviously having possibilities of future development oh hell yes highly original and influencing the development of future events well lets hope so ben took this seminal seed and actualizing the potential for future development developed the hell out of it in highly original ways that would influence future events ben started to breed a new plant first he separated the male plants from the female plants awww o said thats kind of sad we dont want accidental fertilization couldnt we just put tiny little condoms on the male plants o asked ben told her that they couldnt o asked how can you tell the male from the female plants the stamens look like balls ben said well there you go we choose a male plant ben explained take its pollen and pollinate the female plant i might need a few minutes to myself here o said o found it highly amusing that ben created an isle of lesbosa virtual womens prison moviemarijuana farm she also took a certain neofeminist pride that the most powerful juicy thcladen buds came from the females anyway ben used the seed produced by the pollinated female to create what is known in genetics as the f hybrid then he grew that plant took its seed and bred it back with the parent plant with the parent o asked yup iiiiiccck o answered thats like incest not like is cue the banjo she came to refer to bens marijuana crop as la not los angeles lesbian appalachia ben kept inbreeding like a european royal family generation after generation until he produced not a tea party member or a drooling pinkeyed idiot but a female plant whose fecund buds veritably dripped okay not really with thc tetrahydrocannabinol aka deltatetrahydrocannabinol aka dronabinol the main psychoactive substance in marijuana for the blazers out thereits why youre too high right now to understand psychoactive substance ben the mad botanist didnt produce a porsche he produced a lamborghini not a rolex but a patek if bens blend were a horse it would be secretariat a mountain everest michael jordan tiger woods before the max the ult cherry garcia hydroponic cannabis hydro of course means water and there are many advantages to growing cannabis in water instead of in soil for those of you paying close attentionits tetra hydro cannabinol remember you get higher faster yields because hydroponic cultivation bypasses the root web a crop is usually ready in twelve weeksfour harvests a yearand you control your own sunshine and weather therefore you can rotate your cultivation from grow house to grow house so as to have a continuous yield you dont have soilborne pests and parasites you dont have to worry that youre going to wake up one morning and find that three months of work is being eaten or dying of a communicable disease ergo youre not going to spray your plants with toxic pesticides and other shit because its more automated hydroponic cultivation requires less labor the greater automation requires a higher startup cost but it can be amortized over several years and the higher yield more than makes up for the initial outlay ben also had a philosophical reason for going hydro human beings are mostly water he told chon and o so its like the hydro is going home thats sweet o said or stupid chon added in any case it took a lot more than just water to get the business started it took money and a lot of it startup costs they already had the bigticket itemthe primo plantso then it was a matter of hardware the biggest item was a house the selection of which was tricky because its not so much the house its what they had to put in the house marijuana yes thank youbut to grow the marijuana required among other things grow lamps metal halide for the vegetative stage o assured them she could achieve a vegetative state without a grow lamp although one of those sun reflectors was always nice highpressure sodium for the flowering phase each lamp took a thousandwatt bulb each bulb could light fifteen to twenty plants during the vegetative stage those lamps were going to be on sixteen to eighteen hours a day so they were going to produce in addition to light a hell of a lot of heat which unless youre intending to do bikram yoga in there is a problem i tried bikram yoga o told the boys and i didnt like it because they yelled at me she said if i wanted to get yelled at in high humidity id just leave the shower on and wait for paqu to show up you cant have that kind of heat in a grow room because a people have to work in there and b its bad for the plants primo marijuana grows best in a controlled temperature of f so what they needed in addition toin fact because ofall those lamps was airconditioning every one of those lamps required btus british thermal units of cooling and a fan to circulate the cooled air so a fiftylight grow roomthats one thousand plantsneeded btus add to that the power needed to run the lamps and the fans and youre talking kilowatts of power your average residential living room is wired to handle a single thousandwatt bulb sothey had to not only rewire the house they had to find more power and do it off the grid because the utility companies in addition to being rapacious conscienceless sociopaths are also snitches if they notice an electric bill that is say twenty times what a normal house would use they inform the police oh theyll take the money natch but theyll also drop a dime the only dime to slip through their grasping grubby greedy fingers anyway the grow house would need more power and would need that power secretly so there were two ways to get it steal itwhich is a matter of drilling little holes in the meter google it but the gambino family is safer to steal from than the electric company and ben had a moral objection to theft you cant steal from thieves chon argued they are responsible for their karma ben countered i for mine can we get ice cream o asked so the alternative was a generator this was not cheapthe generator needed to power a thousandplant grow room cost between k and k and it made noise a lot of freaking noise it practically screamed hey theres a grow house in here hey hey so if they put that generator in the backyard the neighbors were going to come overand not to invite them to a cookout they might have been able to assuage one or two of them with some homegrown product but it was a dropdead guarantee that one of the neighbors was going to make the call not to mention some blackandwhite happening to cruise by and hearing that thing rumbling probable cause no they had to put that generator down in the basement and how many basements were there in southern california some not many ben and chon went house hunting for a rental not a purchase apologies to tom waits for one thing houses in socalwith or without basementsare expensive but the other thing the other thing the other thing is under the tangled bowl of dayold schizophrenic spaghetti that is the drug laws if the cops bust your grow house and you own it they can confiscate that investment so not only do you lose your dope and your freedom you lose your down payment and every mortgage payment youve already made and you still owe the bank the balance of the loan but if you rent the house and the landlord can reasonably claim he didnt know you were using it to cultivate a felony he gets to keep his property and you go to jail free of that karma anyway so ben and chon went looking to rent a house that had a basement wasnt too close to neighbors wasnt anywhere near a school or a playground maximum sentencing under the guidelines or a police station could be rewired and where the landlord wouldnt be coming around every twentyeight minutes or ever this narrowed down the possibilities you cant just put an ad in the paper stating your requirements because the police will be happy to rent to youthey have some of these houses in stock you aint gonna find it on craigslist well not that craigslistsee below you need a realtor fortunately this was orange county before the real estate market flopped like a european soccer player back in those halcyon finance and flip days you could walk into any upscale oc hotel the ritz st regis or montage and drop somethinganythingin the lobby chances are whoever picked it up would have been a real estate agent or you could drive up or down didnt matter the pch and rearend your ride into any bmw mercedes lexus audi porsche land rover land cruiseractually any vehicle not a mexican gardening truck just prisonshower that ride and the odds were that the person who got out of the other vehicle would have handed you a business card before the insurance information everybody in the oc had a real estate license everybody every oc trophy wife who required a career for her selfesteem got a license every surf bum who needed a source of income ie all of them got a license dogs cats gerbils had real estate licenses if they werent actually selling property they were financing the mortgage doing the title or the assessment consulting on getting the property ready to show others were involved in creative financing aka fraud the entire economy then was based on swapping real estate around boosting the price with every pass everyone was living off the ginormous ponzi scheme that was the real estate market in those days hoping they wouldnt get caught with the hot potato in their hands when the whistle blew people were using trash financing to buy three four five houses that they hoped to flip so people had houses they needed to rent and there were real estate agents who specialized in rentals so finding a realtor was no problem finding the right realtor was because generally speaking realtors hate dope growers you see most dope growers dont have bens social conscience they trash a property out they rip it open and put in cheap dangerous wiring that often sets the place on fire their power needs cause neighborhood brownouts they tape plastic sheets over the windows to hide their nefarious activities they have people coming and going all hours of the day and night their generators make noise their dope smells they not only take the value of a particular property down they lower the value of the whole neighborhood theyre dirtbags rental realtors and property managers properly shun them so ben and chon had to find one who was blissfully unaware the oc wife category was problematic because chon had slept with probably half of them this is what chon did between deploymentshe read books played volleyball and fucked trophy wives many of them of course real estate agents so he ben and o went through the listings of realtors mary ingram ben read chonned o said susan janakowski chonned terri madison ben and o looked at chon you dont know ben asked im thinking my man o said they gave up on the oc wives and moved on to the surfer category heres our boy ben said he pointed to an ad for craig vetter is he a surfer chon asked look at him sunbleached blond hair deep tan wide shoulders vaguely vacant look in the eyes hes been hit in the head a few times o concluded they called him craig assumed that they were a respectable gay couple a little younger than the usual laguna beach life partners but craig was your basic whatever floats your boat dude dude dude duuuuuude we need a basement ben told him a basement a basement chon affirmed craig took a look at chon and figured this was a dungeon sort of thing soundproof he asked that would be good ben said whatever floats your boat dude craig showed them five houses with basements the gay guys rejected all of themthe neighbors were too close the living room too small there was a school nearby at this last thing craig got suspicious you guys arent on one of those lists are you what lists ben asked you know craig said sex offender lists hed hauled these two guys all over laguna dana point mission viejo and laguna niguel and they couldnt find a place they liked he almost didnt care if he lost them now besides the last thing he needed was neighbors picketing one of his properties no ben said we just hate kids chon added helpfully you dont have something more rural do you ben asked rural craig asked like farms and shit like maybe out in the east county ben suggested modjeska canyon modjeska canyon craig repeated the lightbulb came on you guys are looking for a grow house they smoked up on the ride to modjeska canyon ben and chon of course would not confirm that they were looking for a grow house but now they and craig had an understanding he showed them a fixerupper on a culdesac neighbors separated on each side by small strips of trees and brush no sight lines single level with a basement belowmarket rent because the place was kind of a mess will the landlord be coming around ben asked not for five to ten craig answered drugs ben asked he didnt want to start his operation in a secondgeneration drug house that the cops already knew about come on craig he robbed a bank craig answered okay in arkansas perfecto there was a lot to do to get the house ready especially if you were ben solar panels chon asked do you know how much energy were going to be using ben asked solar energy would supplement the generator and therefore use less natural gas do you know how much solar panels cost chon countered do you no good because they cost a lot worth it to benconvictions are easy if theyre cheap also ben wasnt going to trash out the house or the neighborhood on this topic ben and chon had your vulcan mind meld ben had ethical concerns chon had security concerns but they came to the same conclusiondo not make the grow house look like a grow house chon did his due diligence as to what cops look for condensation on the windows or the windows covered with black plastic or newspaper sounds of an electric hum or constant fans bright interior lights left on for long hours local power failures you cause a brownout while the wife next door is tivoing the bachelorette shes going to turn your ass in i would o affirmed smella thousand marijuana plants smell like a bard college dorm on a friday night residents in the home only occasionally people coming in and out at odd hours and staying only a few minutes this is all handleable ben said first they put in the solar panels to supplement the energy then they soundproofed the walls in the basement to cover the noise from the generator then they went cge this came from bens research and it meant closed growing environment i like the closed part chon said indeed what cge does is basically control the flow of air in and out of the grow room it aint cheapthey had to install aluminum and sheet metal vent pipes connected to a fiveton airconditioning system fitted to fortygallon coconut carbon charcoal filters so the neighborhood is going to smell like coconuts o asked it wont smell like anything ben said o was a little disappointed she thought it would be fun to have a neighborhood that smelled like suntan lotion and drinks with umbrellas in them its an article of faith with ben that problems generate solutions which generate more problems which generate more solutions and he labels this endless cycle progress in this case the fiveton ac unit solved the cooling and odor problem but created another ac units are cooled by either air or water and a lot of it if its the former its pulling the air out of well the air and it makes a lot of noise if its water the water bill goes way up and you have the same utilitycompanyassnitch problem the boys pondered this a swimming pool o suggested put in one of those aboveground pools genius a swimming pool is full of water justifies the water bill and besides we could collect the condensation pump it back into the pool and recycle added ben of course plus we could go swimming o said in addition to the house renovation and they hadnt even gotten to the rewiring they had to buy metal halide lamps highpressure sodium lamps thousandwatt bulbs sixteeninch oscillating fans grow trays reservoir trays for the nutrient mixture the nutrient mixture hundreds of feet of piping and tubing pumps timers for the pumps and pool toys o said cant have a pool without toys they hadnt sold an eighth yet and they were already looking at a outlay for startup costs that was for one house but they did it took bens savings chons combatpay bonuses and then hit the volleyball courts in search of suckers to hustle fortunately p t barnum was right and they raised the money in a few months of game set and match grew primo product and reinvested the small profit into another house then another and another making craig vetter a very happy surfing realtor now they have five grow houses and are working on a sixth it costs money which is why chon doesnt let people rip them off much less lay a violent hand on their people now chon consumed with selfloathing because he feels a little winded after trashing four guys gets back in the mustang and drives home grabs the bat gets out of his car and runs smack into his father it happens every once in a while laguna is a small town and you run into people people you want to people you dont chons dad falls into the latter category and the feeling is mutual theres a seminal connection see above but thats about it big john was for a lot of chons childhood and when he wasnt chon wished he was ben and o both know that chons father is a subject not to be discussed ever theyre aware of course that big john was once a bigtime laguna dope dealer a member of the storied association that he went to prison and now is some kind of roofing contractor but thats about it big john looks startled to see his son and not very happy its awkward big john heavy shoulders brown hair receding a little jowly now breaks the silence first hey hey hows it going okay you okay big john looks at the bat smirks and asks you playing softball now or something hardball thats it they stand there looking at each other for a second then big john says well okay and walks away duane crowe finds a seat at the bar at tgi fridays thank god its fridays and takes it tgi fridays is practically a club for fortysomething divorced guys you get a burger a beer i dont know some nachos and kill time trying to find a fortysomething divorced woman whos as lonely and horny as you are which is a dubious proposition to begin with it aint a great life but its the one hes got hes scoping the place out for possibilities when he sees boland squeeze his way into the crowded bar squeeze because bill boland is built like a refrigerator and is one of the reasons that hour fitness is open twentyfour hours boland takes the stool next to crowe and says nice tshirt old guys rule my niece gave it to me for my birthday crowe says you get hennessy straightened out he wont be waltzing through tsa anytime soon boland says they put a pin in his arm guy did a number on him they had worked dumbass brian and his crew into ripping off one of leonards dealers to see what hed do now they knew something else they know before they make another move on leonard the other guy has to go you get an id crowe asks working on it boland says word is hes some kind of special forces stud seals or green berets or something green berets they still got them i think the other reason they meet in tgi fridays is because its crowded and loud television up high people yappingyou get a mike on this place all youre going to pick up is noise and if someones wearing a wire its more likely to get some guy lying to a chick about his job than something a grand jury is going to get geeked about what do the powers that be say boland asks what they always say crowe answers deal with it deal with it and send us our fucking money the powers that be dont eat in franchises they own them this leonard kid crowe says hes a piece of worka real cocky asshole get on him see if he slips on the banana peel boland looks at the menu you had the burgers here crowe surveys the line of divorcees at the bar ive had everything here when chon gets to his apartment o is there she has a key because she looks after the place when hes gone waters the single plant no not that kind of plant some innocuous plant like a ficus or something i hope its okay i let myself in o says sure she gives him this weird unolike vulnerable look chon o dont you think im sort of bambiesque o chon says buying time theyre pals buddies weve known each other since we were kids maybe that will make it better o says and im nineteen now not a kid anymore o look if you think im like hideous or something its not that chon says o is the opposite of hideouswhatever that is i think youre beautiful he means it and you love me she says he nods and i love you so he shakes his head smiles stupidly o i dont know chon she says youre going away and i dont know if and its my fault no it isnt os first conscious memory was of a boy pissing on marigolds ophelia thenit would be years before she dropped the phelia and became just osat in the playground of the little school and watched the older boy water the plants the school in laguna canyon was one of those neooneroom schoolhouseskindergarten through eighth gradethat operated under the theory that children learn best when not arbitrarily separated into rigid grade groups but allowed to find their own levels among kids of various ages this was during one of paqus progressive phases so every day she hauled her fouryearold daughter from their sevendigit home in gated emerald bay to the funkier environs of the canyon the house and the money for the private school came from her settlement with os father who divorced her in the sixth month of her pregnancy even the teachers at the school thought that ophelia was too young to start kindergarten shes precocious her mother answered but still four the principal said shes an old soul the mother countered her psychic had told her that her daughter had had many previous incarnations and that her astral age wasnt four but four thousand which made her older than her mother by a good seven hundred years in very real ways im actually her daughter the principal decided that ophelia would probably benefit from getting out of the house for a few hours a day and besides the little girl was such a darling already so beautiful and so smart i think we made a huge mistake sending you to that school paqu would say years later when o was flunking virtually every class at laguna high by that time paqu was in one of her conservative phases and by that time ophelia had changed her name to o and had started calling her mother paqu but that was all later and right then o was watching the boy water the flowers at first she thought it was just like the gardener at home but then she observed that the boy wasnt holding a hose but something else then she heard a short sharp shriek and a teacher ran over and grabbed the boy john the teacher said our private parts are what john didnt answer private the teacher answered for him now zip up your jeans and go play i was just watering the flowers john said o thought that was very fun that this magical boy could water the plants all by himself whats that boys name she asked when the teacher came over to her thats john chon o mispronounced and then got up to go look for the magical boy who penis safely returned to his jeans had wandered around toward the back fence searching for an escape route chon chon chon o hollered wandering around in search of him chon play with me the other kids quickly picked up the chant chon chon chon the name stuck o became his shadow followed him around like a baby duckling a real pest but it wasnt long before chon learned to put up with her to become her protector even to like her a little chon wasnt particularly social he didnt play well with others preferred to be alone so the teachers were glad to see him make a connection o adored him the problem was that he disappeared from time to timesometimes for a day sometimes for a weekand then hed be back at school again where you been chon shed ask him chon would make up fantastic stories for her he was out fishing and had been captured by pirates elves who lived in the canyon took him for a trip to their secret world aliens from another galaxy flew him into outer space and back again chon took the girl to china to africa to mars and the mountains of the moon and he was her magic boy then one day he disappeared for good when she realized that he wasnt coming back o cried all night her mother consoled her with the words men dont stay o already knew that so youre saying what she asks chon now no no im saying not now what a totally wussy answer she says im a total wuss she backs off okay she says you missed your chance chonny boy that was it chon smiles got it its funny chon doesnt talk much because he loves words and word origins he even knows the etymology of the word etymology google it but o gets that you protect what you love and hold it close defending his reticence one day chon posited a question to them words he said are a a means of communication b a means of mis communication c tools d weapons e all of the above ben answered a o answered d she is her mothers daughter chon answered f it doesnt matter because there are things he will not talk about things he has seen things he has done in iraqandafghanistan things you dont burden other people with memories that you try to prevent from overwhelming your brain and your nervous system but that you can still feel on your skin movies that your mind privately screens on the inside of your eyelids these are things that you do not put into words they are ineffable therefore to fill the sad silence underscored by os chant of i hate this trip i hate this trip i hate this trip on the ride to john wayneorange county airport you cannot make this shit up chon goes neospiro agnew on the subject of neohippies chon thinks that neohippies are grungy pastyfacedfromvegandiets eat a fucking cheeseburger casper patchoulioilstinking birkenstockwearing clogging up sidewalks playing hacky sack why dont they save syllables and just call it a dirtbag leaning their crappy singlegear bicycles against the doors of starbucks where they order tazo green tea and borrow other peoples laptops to check their email sitting there for hours and never leave a freaking tip doing seminaked yoga in parks so other people have to look at their pale emaciated bodies parasites chon wishes southern california would secede from the rest of the state so it could pass a law sending any white guy with dreadlocks to a concentration camp where would the camp be ben asks him this is known as egging him on i dont know chon mutters still pissed somewhere off the fifteen the problem okay one problem with building concentration camps in southern california ben thinks is that contractors would trip all over each other trying to rig the barbedwire bid also that you have a governor whose accent is well uhhhh of course chon mumbles i suppose liberals would block it chon also hates liberals the only liberal he doesnt hate is ben this is known as the ben exemption liberals chon will opine when hes on a rantand hes on one now are people who love their enemies more than their friends prefer anyone elses culture to their own are guilty of success but unashamed of failure despise profit and punish achievement the men are dickless sackless selfcastrated eunuchs cowed into shame of their own masculinity by joyless angerfilled shrews consumed with bitter envy at the material possessions not to mention multiple orgasms of their conservative sisters you should have stopped him buying the fountainhead ben tells o who knew he was in the fiction section liberals took a pretty decent country and fucked it up to the point where kids cant read huckleberry finn or play dodgeball dodgeball that perfectly darwinian game meant to ensure the survival of the fittest because the others are too perpetually concussed to propagate and any dune surfer with a grudge feels he can fly planes into our buildings without fear of the big one being dropped on mecca like it should have been five seconds after the towers came down nancy reagan would have pressed her husbands finger on the button for him and turned the saudi peninsula into the glass factory it deserves to be except that liberals want to be loved ben disagrees the liberals in the california state legislature would not block a bill creating concentration camps as long as they got campaign contributions from the concrete manufacturers the drivers hauling the inmates through the gates were unionized and their trucks had the requisite minimum mpg standards and used the commuter lanes ben knows california would be zapping guys at the pace of the texas versus florida bush brothers sibling rivalry if the electric chair were solar powered they dont use sparky anymore chon tells him its lethal injection right narcotics are illegal so we use them to execute people for crimes anyway this is all well and good verbal fun and games but what matters isnt what ben and chon say to each other its what they dont chon doesnt tell ben about sam casey getting ripped off and beaten up and his response to said provocation because ben wouldnt approve and hed get all bummed out about the necessity of force in a world thats supposed to be about love and peace blah blah ben doesnt tell chon about the weird interaction with ogr because well its just weird and random and probably nothing and besides whats chon supposed to do about it hes on his way to the stan he has enough to worry about like staying alive so ben doesnt want to bother him and so they miss this critical junction this intersection of events this opportunity to put one and one together and get one one same problem theyre not stupid they would have put it together but would have is just another way of saying didnt they walk chon as far as the security line where o hugs him and wont let go i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you she says unable to stop the tears i love you too ben pries her off hugs chon himself and says dont be a hero bro as if ben thinks chons on his third deployment with a fucking seal team he is a fucking hero and he cant be anything but always has always will ill be cowering at the bottom of the deepest foxhole chon says yeah they watch him go through the line boland gets on the phone good news he says leonard is putting the hard case on an airplane looks like hes deploying you sure its him he meets hennessys description of the guy who trashed him boland answers that is good news crowe thinks very good news well not for leonard ben doesnt see the car that follows him out of john wayneorange county airport and stays behind him all the way to laguna why should he that isnt his world hes bummed about chon leaving and then o drops this bombshell i threw myself at him who chon boom hes not jealousjealousy isnt in bens makeupbut chon and o its huge but ben is cool ben is always cool and i bounced off the wall of chon oh rejected spurned un requited you never hear about requited love ben says because he doesnt know what else to say i dont anyway pouting doesnt look good on you really o says because i thought it did a few seconds later she says i hate this fucking war she was fourteen watching tv that morning stalling going to school when she saw what she thought was cheesy cgi come across the screen an airliner a building it didnt seem real and still doesnt but chon was already in the service by then a fact for which she blames herself ben knows what shes thinking dont he says cant help it she cant because she doesnt know it isnt her fault it goes back generations laguna beach california said im going down to yasgurs farm going to join in a rockandroll band joni mitchell woodstock john mcalister rolls his skateboard down ocean avenue then puts the board under his arm and walks along main beach up to the taco bell because sometimes guys get their food then go into the mens room and leave their tacos on the table the tacos and johnny are both gone when they come out dig young johnny mac tall for his fourteen years wide shoulders long brown hair that looks like it was cut with hedge clippers your classic gremtshirt and board shorts huaraches shell necklace when he makes it up to taco bell theres a crowd standing around big guy with long blond hair is buying food for everybody handing out tacos and those little plastic packets of hot sauce to a bunch of surfers hippies homeless drug casualties runaways and those skinny girls with headbands and long straight hair who all look alike to john the guy looks like some kind of socal surfer version of a sea god john wouldnt know neptune or poseidon from scoobydoo but he recognizes the look of local royaltythe deep tan the sunbleached hair the ropy muscles of a guy who can spend all day every day surfing and who has money anyway not a surf bum a surf god now this god looks down on him with a friendly smile and warm blue eyes and asks you want a taco i dont have any money john answers you dont need money the guy answers his face breaking into a grin i have money okay john says hes hungry guy hands him two tacos and a packet of hot sauce thanks john says im doc john doesnt say anything you have a name doc asks john hi john doc says peace then doc moves along handing out tacos like fishes and loaves like jesus except jesus walked on water and doc rides on it john takes his tacos before doc changes his mind or anyone there makes him as the kid who filches food off tables goes out into the parking lot and sits down at the curb beside a girl who looks like shes nineteen or twenty shes carefully picking the beef out of her taco and laying it on the curb the cow is sacred to the hindus she says to john are you a hindu john asks he doesnt know what a hindu is no the girl says like his question makes no sense then she adds my name is starshine no it isnt john thinks hes talked with plenty of hippie runaways beforelaguna is crawling with themand they always call themselves starshine or moonbeam or rainbow and theyre always really rebecca or karen or susan maybe a holly but thats about as crazy as it gets hippie runaway girls annoy the shit out of john they all think theyre joni mitchell and he hates joni mitchell john listens to the stones the who the moody blues now he just wants to finish his tacos and get out of there then starshine says after you finish eating id like to suck you off john doesnt go home ever ka boom stans head explodes its like the sun rises in his skull and the warmth of the rays spreads to the smile on his face he looks at diane and says holy shit she knowsthe blotter acid just melted on her tongue too not holy shit holy communion across the pch taco jesus is holding his daily service beyond that the ocean rises in a blue so blue it outblues all other blues in this universe of blues look at the blue she says to stan stan turns to look and starts to cry its so bluetiful stan and diane this is a little ditty about stan and diane two american kids growing up in ah fuck it stan isnt your tall stringy hippiehes your shorter plumper hostess cupcakes and twinkies hippie with a fat nose jewfro full black beard and beatific smile diane does have the skinny thing goingplus long straight black hair that frizzes in the humidity hips that hint at the earthmother thing and breasts that are at least partially responsible for stans beatific smile now cranked out of their minds they stand on the porch of the decrepit building they want to turn into a bookstore recent immigrants from haightashbury they knew that the scene was disintegrating up there so theyre trying to replicate it down here dont hate themthey never had a motherfucking chance east coast leftie parents the rosenbergs were innocent socialist summer camps the rosenbergs were innocent berkeley in the early sixties free speech movement stop the war ronald reagan the rosenbergs did it is the devil haightashbury summer of love they got married in a field on a farm in the berkshires with garlands of flowers in their hair and some dipshit playing the sitar and they are perfect products of their times baby boomers hippies who came to laguna to create a little utopia in the cheap rents of the canyon and spread the good word about love and peace by building a bookstore that will sell in addition to the tibetan book of the dead the anarchist cookbook and on the road incense sandals psychedelic posters rock albums tiedyed tshirts macrame bracelets again try not to hate them all that happy shit and distribute acid to the turnedon there is a flaw in their plan money more accurately the lack thereof it takes money to buy even a shitty building money to renovate it into even a hippie bookstore and they aint got none which is the problem with socialism no capital enter taco jesus surfing in as a savior like a cowboy on his horse to again fuck it the surfercowboy analogy the end of the american west at the edge of the pacific manifest destiny reversing itself with the incoming tidewho gives a shit suffice it to say that the surfers met the hippies in laguna beach it had to happen the difference between a surfer and a hippie a board theyre the same cat basically the surfer was the original hippie in fact he was the original beatnik years before jack and dean hit the road searching for dharma the surfer was cruising the pch looking for a good wave same thing but were not going to get into all that we could we could were sorely tempted but we have a story to tell and the story is stan diane and the tribe are trying to build their store a block from one of the best breaks on the oc coast brooks street where taco jesus aka doc surfs and distributes free food to any and all socialism so stan asks diane where does taco jesus get the money to be taco jesus trust fund he doesnt look like the trust fund type in this diane is intuitive because raymond doc halliday grew up in a bluecollar bungalow in fontana and did two stretches in juvie for respectively burglary and assault ray sra rooferleft his son with certain skills with a hammer but money no eventually doc migrated down to the south coast where he discovered surfing and marijuana and also discovered that you could make enough money to support the former by selling the latter now stan and diane watch him hand out tacos and decide to ask him where the bread for the loaves comes from crossing the pch which under the influence of blotter acid has become a river and its cars fish they approach doc you want a taco doc asks you want some acid diane replies cue the theme this is a moment the seminal mindfuck that gives birth to the group that will become known as the association and then along came mary heres how it happens doc gives stan and diane tacos stan and diane give doc a tab of blotter acid doc goes back into the water gets into a wave and discovers that the molecules that form the wave are the same molecules that form him so that he does not need to become one with the wave he is already one with the wave in fact we are all the same wave and goes and finds stan and diane and weepingly tells them so i know diane gushes she cant know shes never been on a board but were all on the same wave so i know you do doc says doc comes back with his surfer buddies and they all turn on now you have republican orange countys baddest nightmarethe worst antisocial elements surfers and hippies gathered on one combination plate in a demonic druginduced love fest and planning to institutionalize it because stan and diane share their problemlack of fundswith doc and the boys and doc offers a solution grass he says dope surfing and dope go together like like uhhhh surfing and dope surfers had been hauling grass back up from safaris in mexico for years the plymouth station wagon being the smuggling vehicle of choice because all of its interior panels could be removed the insides stuffed with dope and put back on we can get you the money to fix up this place doc says volunteering not only himself but his surfing buddies a few baja runs and thats all you need doc and the boys make the requisite runs sell the product and donate the proceeds to stan diane et al to spread love peace and acid throughout laguna beach and its environs the bread and marigolds bookstore opens in may of the year it sells the tibetan book of the dead the anarchist cookbook on the road incense sandals psychedelic posters rock albums tiedyed tshirts macrame bracelets you know what go ahead and hate them all that happy shit and distributes acid to the turnedon stan and diane are happy the store opens but the guys keep making runs because enough is a selfcontradictory word enough is never enough finally finally surfers found something they could make money at without getting a job and money they make fuck they make money millions of dollars of the stuff they even buy a yacht to hang out in and sail dope up in from mexico cool and cool but doc doc is a visionary a pioneer an explorer doc hops a plane to germany buys a vw van and drives drives to afghanistan doc has heard stories about the amazing potency of afghan hashish the stories turn out to be true grass is fine but afghan hash synaptic pinball lighting all the lights ringing all the bells winner winner winner so doc loads his van up with hash drives back to europe and ships the van to california throws a few tasting parties gives some samples away and creates a market for his product it isnt long before the other association boys follow docs footsteps to afghanistan and load cars trucks and vans up with hash the most ingenious smuggling vessel though is the surfboard one genius ships a board to kandahar hollows it out and stuffs it with hash because nobody at the airport knows what a surfboard is or critically how much it should weigh and no one even asks what a guy is doing with surfboards in a place where theres no ocean all this shit comes back to laguna pretty soon laguna canyon fills up with houses full of dope and houses full of dopers the canyon is so full of outlaws that the cops dub it dodge city the little girl lives in a cave not metaphoricallynot a rundown house with no natural lighting sourcea cave as in neanderthal the cave is in the hills near the lakes that give laguna its name a cave in laguna in the summer isnt such a bad placeits actually kind of congenial the days are warm the nights are merely cool and the inhabitants of the cave do have some basic amenities they have candles for light and sterno stoves for what little cooking they do they have sleeping bags and blankets rolledup shirts and jeans for pillows they shower and use the toilets at main beach although theyve dug a latrine down a path through the brush outside the cave the little girl kim hates it six years old she already has a sense that theres something better out there kim imagines a room of her own ms woolf with walls pink wallpaper and bedspread dolls lined up neatly along the big pillows and one of those easybake ovens where she can make tiny little cupcakes she wants a real mirror to sit in front of and brush her long blonde hair she wants a bathroom that is immaculate and a house that is perfect none of this is going to happenher mothers name is freaky frederica a year ago freddie ran away from home and abusive husband in redding and found her way to some shelter and a new name with the hippie commune in the cave for her it was the best thing that ever happenedfor her daughter not so much she hates the dirt she hates the lack of privacy she hates the chaos people come in and outthe communes population is transient to say the least one frequent visitor to the cave is doc he owns a house down in dodge city but sometimes he hangs out at the cave smokes dope and talks about the revolution and the counterculture and the revelatory powers of acid and fucks freddie kim lies there still as a doll pretending to sleep as her mother and doc make love beside her she shuts her eyes tight tries to tune out the sounds and imagines her new bedroom no one ever comes into it sometimes the man with her mother isnt doc but someone else sometimes its several people but no one ever comes into kims room ever john likes living in the cave he started bunking with starshine but one night snuggled up with a runaway from new jersey named comet presumably after the celestial phenomenon not the household cleaner and as they were virtually indistinguishable he didnt care its just better than home the commune is a family in its own way something john doesnt have a lot of experience with they sit down to meals together they talk together they do common chores johns parents barely know that he no longer lives at home he comes back every two or three days and leaves little traces of his existence says hello to whichever parent is there at the moment grabs a few clothes maybe some food and then goes back to the cave his father is mostly living up in la now anyway his mother is consumed with the details of the impending divorce and its summertime and the livin is easy john smokes grass partakes in a little hash but the lsd trips scare him you lose control he tells doc you lose it to find it doc says cryptically no thanks john thinks because hes had to talk people down from their trips or sit there during tedious acid sessions while people freak out and doc reads from the tibetan book of the dead other than that theres nothing for a fourteenyearold boy not to love living in the cave that summer he goes down to the beach doc lends him a board to take out he hangs out with the surfers and the hippies and gets high he goes back to the cave and one of the hippie girls cuts him in on the free love buffet it was like summer camp john would say later with blow jobs then summer ends and its time for school john doesnt want to go home you cant live in the cave year round doc says like september through october would probably be fine but then the weather changes and laguna gets cold and damp at night but cold and damp is exactly how john would describe the atmosphere at his house his mother being remote and more often than not drunk what happens is john moves mostly into docs house its a gradual thingjohn comes after school and hangs out stays for the big spaghetti dinners everybody gets stoned john falls asleep on the couch or in one of the three bedrooms with one of the chicks who make up what is basically docs harem after a while john is just there a fixture a mascot docs puppy he goes surfing with doc he helps doc pass out tacos he gradually comes to understand where docs money comes from dope just hanging out john gets an idea what the association is and who they are the boys make thinly veiled references around him to their runs down to mexico and the bigger expeditions to south asia one day john tells doc i want in in on what you know john says doc gives him that charismatic crooked grin and says youre fourteen almost fifteen john says doc looks him over john is your basic grem but theres something special about himthe kid has always been this little adultthe chicks around the place sure as hell treat him like a grownupand hes not so little anymore and doc has a problem maybe john can help him with money doc has too much of it well not too much money per senobody has too much moneybut too much cash in small denominations so now you have to catch this image john skateboarding to banks in laguna dana point and san clemente with a backpack full of singles fives and tens that doc gets from his street sales john walking into the bank and exchanging the small bills for wrapped stacks of fifties and hundreds and john knows which tellers to go to which ones get birthday presents and christmas bonuses from doc and if the cops see a skinny kid with long brown hair a tshirt and board trunks pushing his street board along the sidewalk hes just one of dozens of painintheass skateboarders and it doesnt occur to them that this one has thousands and thousands of dollars slung over his shoulder some kids have paper routesjohn has cash routes doc kicks him fifty bucks a day life is good john puts up with school does his route gets his fifty goes back to the house and slips into bed with girls who are now more often in their twenties than in their late teens and who are giving him an education he cant get in the classroom yeah life is good but it could be better i want to deal my own shit he tells doc one day as theyre sitting out in the lineup waiting for the next set why doc asks youre making money handling your money john answers i want to handle my own money i dont know man i do john says look if you wont supply me ill go to somebody else doc figures that if the kid goes somewhere else he could get burned or ripped off or walk right into a police setup at least if i sell to him doc thinks i know the kid will be safe so now in addition to his cash over his shoulder john has fat joints taped to the bottom of his skateboard and sells them for five bucks each now john is making money he doesnt spend it on albums clothes or taking girls out he saves it not even sixteen he hands doc a pile of money and asks him to buy him a car a beautifully restored plymouth station wagon dig our brother john seventeen years old he rents not one but two houses in dodge city one to live in the other to store his dope in he makes more roundtrips to mexico than the trailways bus and he aint skateboarding fivedollar fingers anymore he has three other grems doing that and happy for the money he is wholesaling now selling in volume to street dealers making real money he has so much grass stashed in that second domicile it becomes known as the shit brick house he has a twentythreeyearold girlfriend named lacey living with him who has a sleek body so flexible because it doesnt have a jealous bone in it he can drive his own car now and has three of them the plymouth a mustang convertible and an old chevy pickup he uses to put his surfboards in he has a quiver of custommade boards he hangs out with the dead when they roll through town he gets high on trips with doc to maui hes still docs puppy but now they say that he runs with the big dogs john is a junior member of the association meanwhile the country is going motherfucking insane while john is on the trajectory from tacogrubbing grem to successful young businessman the united states goes mcmurphy in the cuckoos nest aka the years has anybody here

wallet hands it over and then reaches toward the glove compartment for the registration keep your hands where i can see them the cop says do you want the registration or not ben asks step out of the car sir oh come on ben says because he just cant help himselfits in his freaking dna why did you stop me do you have probable cause i saw marijuana smoke coming out of the driver side window the cop says and i can smell it now ben laughs you saw marijuana smoke from a moving car at night and you dont smell anythingi never smoke in my car step out of the car please sir this is bullshit the cop rips the door open grabs ben by the wrist hauls him out and armbars him to the ground then the kicks start coming ben tries to go fetal but the kicks come into his ribs his shins his kidneys his balls youre resisting arrest the cop yells stop resisting im not resisting two more hard kicks then the cop comes down with his knee on bens neck and ben feels the gun barrel press against the base of his skull now whos the asshole the cop asks its such a weird fucking thing to say but ben isnt focused on that because he hears the hammer click back his breath catches in his throat then the cop pulls the trigger o goes into her bathroom turns on the exhaust fan and lights a roach shell make this small concession to her mothers sensibilities but paqus hypocrisy on the subject of drugs is nothing short of epic almost admirable in its bold twofacedness paqus medicine cabinet behind the mirror mirror on the bathroom wall is a pharmacopoeia of prescribed moodaltering drugs a fact that o despises because its such a cliche and all the more so because she becomes a part of the stereotype hence the stereo if you think about it by consistently running to the shelter of her mothers little helper when the herb just wont do the trick cant you develop a blend she has asked ben called for orange county girls when battlestar galactica isnt enough working on it ben replied but so far to no result so o will occasionally raid cvs paqu for valium oxy xanax or some other antidepressant which makes paqus lectures about her marijuanasmoking more bearable lectures that come with greater frequency in the weeks after paqu returns from rehab with new material and a fresh flock of twelvestep buddies who hang around the patio and talk about their programs and before paqu gets bored with the whole thing and decides that the real answer lies in yoga bicycling jesus or scrapbooking the scrapbooking phase was especially excruciating featuring as it did paqu gluing endless pictures of herself taking pictures of o into volumes arranged by year actually one of paqus lovers was a sadlooking guy from her friday meeting whom a sixteenyearold o asked are you in recovery too i have thirty days the guy said well you aint gonna have forty o said which proved prophetic on about day thirtysix when o came out of her room to find paqu and sadly sober guy slinging empty stoli bottles at each other across the living room before each departed to separate detox facilities leaving o alone in the house to hold epic parties on the rationale that she was thoughtfully cleansing the house of alcohol in anticipation of her mothers return anyway like goaltenders and quarterbacks paqu is blessed with a short memory so none of this history stops her from getting on os case about her marijuana habit os not in the mood tonight so she sits on the toilet under the exhaust fan to get high and if paqu comes nosing around she can just say shes constipated which will engender a suggestion about an organic remedy rather than a ballbusting because she feels like shes already had her balls as it were busted by chons utter rejection of her blatant and admittedly clumsy comeon im sort of bambiesque jesus i wouldnt fuck me either ben hears the dry click his heart slamming the cops laugh he feels something being pressed into his hand then taken away then the cop pulls his arms behind him and cuffs him look what i found the cop says he shows ben a brick of dope thats not mine ben says yeah ive never heard that before the cop says i found it in the trunk of your car bullshit you planted it the cop hauls him to his feet pushes him into the backseat of the unmarked car and reads him his rights like he has the right to remain silent no shit ben doesnt say anything except he wants his other right the right to a lawyer does ben know a lawyer are you fucking kidding ben sells the best dope in orange county ergo some of his best customers are lawyers and doctors as yet no indian chiefs the fucked thing is that he doesnt know any criminal lawyers but he calls an insurance lawyer who calls a buddy of his who hustles over in the middle of the night but not before the cops file charges against ben under california possession with intent to selland resisting arrest a ben learns and throw in a b battery on a peace officer for good measure and chuck him into central holding forget the jail cliches no mexican gang tries to turn him into a jerkoff sock he doesnt have to fight bubba for his bologna sandwich closest thing ben has to an encounter in his oc jail cell is with a rasta dude who asks him what he got busted for possession of marijuana with intent to sell resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer ben tells him a b very cool rasta dude says get up stand up stand up for your rights mostly ben just lies thereaching and angry at detective sergeant william boland of the orange county sheriffs office antidrug task force who put a gun to his head and pulled a dry trigger ben didnt see his life flash in front of his eyes he saw his death flash in front of his eyes how bad can it get ben asks bad the lawyer answers youre looking at maybe twelve grand in fines and up to six years in the state pen six years three on the dope the lawyer explains one on the maybe two more on the he assaulted me your word against his the lawyer says and in a drug case the jury will go with the cop come on ben says you should get this whole thing thrown out he had no probable cause no reason to search my car he planted the fucking dope it had your prints on it the lawyer says he pressed it into my hand unless we can get a few mexicans or blacks on the jury youre fucked the lawyer says my advice is to plead it outill get them to drop the battery because boland didnt seek medical attention can probably get you probation on the resisting charge you get three for the grass serve a year no fucking way ben says the lawyer shrugs you dont want to take this in front of an orange county jury mostly retirees and government workers because they can get out of their jobs who are going to hate ben for being young and arrogant im pleading not guilty i have to advise you plead me not guilty so ben spends a long sleepless night in jail gets arraigned in the morning pleads not guilty and gets remanded for in bail may gray local name for the marine layer of cloud and fog that drapes over the coast this time of year like a thin blanket scaring the hell out of tourists whove plunked down big bucks to spend a week in sunny california and then find out that it isnt you look up at the sky at say nine am its a steaming bowl of soup and you dont believe youre going to see the sun that day ye of little faithby noon the carcinogenic rays are cutting through the fog like laser beams straight to your skin by one its the place you saw in yahoo images by three youre in the drugstore looking for aloe lotion ben has a different theory about may gray a different name he calls it transitional time after the night before ben tells o on the subject people arent ready for the harsh light of day first thing in the morning in its benevolence southern california softens it for them its transitional time you get up in the morning and its nice and soft and gray like your brain you ease into the day its like truthbetter to come into it gradually ben gently lowers himself into his usual seat at the coyotehis back hurts like crazy from bolands shoeand she comes over with the coffee and the evil eye i waited for you last night she says you never showed up yeah ben already knows this it always amazes him how people have to tell you things that you obviously already know you never showed up youre late you have an attitude something happened ben says something or somebody jesus christ ben thinks shes already jealous thats getting a head start on things and by the way isnt there another guy some thing it better have been important it was someone showed me my mortality she softens a little the usual no just coffee he feels too sick and tired to eat kari pours his coffee and the next thing he knows old guys rule shows up and sits down across from him int coyote grill day crowe sits down across from ben crowe look you seem like a good kid nobody wants to hurt you off bens incredulous look crowe contd okay maybe someone got a little carried away adrenaline rush sort of thing if it makes a difference he feels bad about it ben he put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger crowe and you didnt shit your pants people were impressed by the way ben im thrilled crowe lighten upits not like your hands are so clean ben what are you talking about crowe smirking yeah okay ben so what do you want crowe you ready to listen now ben doesnt say anythinghe opens his handsim here crowe contd okay heres what you do ben packs a briefcase with k in cash and drives up to newport beach chad meldruns office is on the seventh floor of a modern building overlooking the greenway and his receptionist is so clearly fucking him that she can barely bother to look up from the magazine shes reading to tell ben to take a seat chad is with another client and is running a little late ten minutes later chad comes out of his office his arm around a grimlooking mexican guy telling him to chill out its going to be okay chads in his late forties but looks younger a result of swapping his services with a cosmetic surgeon in the next building who doles out oxy along with the botox so chad has a virtually undetectable eye tuck and a total absence of worry lines which is appropriate as his nickname in the general drug defense industry is chad no worries meldrun he ushers ben into his office and into a chair then sits behind his big desk and locks his fingers behind his head ben sets the briefcase down by his own feet youre lucky to get an appointment chad begins without small talk im overbooked the war on drugs should be called the defense attorney full employment act thanks for seeing me ben says no worries chad answers he stands back up and says lets go for a ride leave the briefcase they walk back out into the waiting room ill be back in twenty chad tells the receptionist she looks up from people cool ben follows chad out onto the top floor of the parking structure and takes a seat in his mercedes unless its about the lakers chad says as he turns the ignition dont say anything ben doesnt have anything to say about the lakers so he keeps his mouth shut chad drives out of the structure onto macarthur boulevard down to john wayne airport were just going to drive around for a few minutes he says i know my car is clean and if youre wearing a wire the signal is jammed at the airport god bless john wayne and homeland security im not wearing a wire ben says probably not chad answers okay the thirtyfive twentyfive of it goes to assure that the chain of evidence gets fucked up and you walk ten of it stays with me call it a finders fee in addition you pay my feethree hundred a billable hour plus expenses im not just being greedyyou have to pay my fee to assure lawyerclient confidentiality and show that youre not just engaging me to deliver payoffs into the right hands but thats what im doing right ben asks engaging you to deliver payoffs to the oc drug task force thirtyfive k a month kid chad says call it the cost of doing business really you should be setting aside about twenty percent of your income for legal fees anyway thanks for the advice youre lucky this one is state and not federal chad says these federal guys these days if you can touch them they think theyre firstround nfl draft choices now dont even think what youre thinkingwhich is you could go to the state people directly cut out the middleman and save yourself my commission you cant first of all you dont know the right people to approach and if you touch up the wrong people you have bigger problems second even if you did im a frequent flyer if you understand the concept so theyre not going to take your slice at the risk of the whole pie third youre much better off having a longterm relationship with me because if you ever really screw the pooch im a stud monkey in court and i also have jurors and judges in my inventory i wasnt thinking it no worries chad says i just like everything to be up front and out in the open from the start that way there are no misunderstandings later questions you guarantee the charges get dropped locked in chad says you know who doesnt walk on cases like this poor people theyre fucked its a very bad business to go into undercapitalized chad drives back to the office building you park in the structure he asks ben when they get there i did bring the ticket back up to rebecca chad says we validate ben decides to just pay the fourteen bucks cost of doing business duane makes the call to his boss looks like hes playing ball okay good duanes boss is a man of few words the phone rings in bens apartment you went and saw chad duane says did he give you your money already piece of work isnt he piece of work dont sulk consider you got fined for bad behavior heres the thing though ben doesnt consider it a fine he looks at it as tuition for an education they took him to school which is where they messed up they taught him how it works every hero has a tragic flaw that one inner quality that will do him and everyone else around him in with ben its simple you tell ben to do one thing he cant help himself hes going to do exactly the opposite subversive adj likely to subvert or overthrow a government n a person engaged in subversive activities okay thats ben to wit he pays the next months fee on the surface he appears to obey to be chastened to have learned his lesson thats apparent adj open to view visible clear or manifest to the understanding appearing as such but not necessarily so ding because ben has a plan dedo informer in beautiful cursive script made up of mens intestines laid out on the floor dea agent dennis cain stands in the tijuana warehouse with his mexican counterpart a baja state policeman named miguel arroyoaka lado stone coldand looks at the message from the sanchez family that just as easily might have spelled out chingate dennis translation fuck you dennis because it gets very personal this kind of longterm closerange war these guys all know each other no they dont actually know each other but they know each other the sanchez family probably does as much intelligence on the dea as the dea does on them they know where the others live where they eat who they see who they fuck how they work they know their families their friends their enemies their tastes their quirks their dreams their fearsso leaving a message in human entrails is almost a grisly joke between rivals but its also a statement of relative power like look what we can do on our turf that you cant do on yours dennis started his career as a uniformed cop in buffalo one morning in a frigid predawn wind coming off the lake like the swing of a killing sword he saw an old carpet leaning at an odd angle against an alley wall the carpet turned out to contain the frozen corpse of a coke whore and pressed against her cold chest was her frozen baby blue in death he volunteered for the narco squad the next day weeks later he went on his first undercover and busted the dealers took night classes got his degree and applied to dea happiest day of his life when he got accepted although he will say it was his wedding day and later the days his children were born undercovers are great liarstheir lives depend on it dea threw him right back undercoverupstate new york then jersey then the city he was a star a real stud monkey making cases that the federal prosecutors loved then they jerked him up from under and sent him down to colombia then mexico sandyhaired boyish grinhuck finn with an east coast mouth and a killers heartthe targets loved him fell all over themselves to sell him dope and put themselves in the shit undercovers are great con mentheir jobs depend on it a star now he was moved to the front line of the war on drugs the twothousandmile border with mexico they even gave him a choice of assignmentsel paso or san diego hmmm lemme think el paso or san diego el paso or san diego el passhole or sun dog sorry tex no offense pard but come on so dennis cain set up shop in the backyard of the baja cartel just across the fence literally from the sanchez family business and no ones inviting the neighbors over for a cookout its just war day in day out you wanna talk about the war on drugs of course it should be the war against drugs the ambiguity of the on having caused some spectacular hr problems at dea and chon would tell you about a lot of guys who fought their war on drugs this is no mans land all unquiet on the western front dennis and cohorts bust a shipment the sanchezes kill a snitch dennis and company find a tunnel under the border the sanchezes are already digging a new one dennis busts a cartel leader another sanchez steps into the gap to replace him the drugs and the money keep on turnin proud mary juana keeps on burnin now dennis looks down at the eviscerated bodies of three men one of whom was his snitch and the calling card arranged with their intestines what he says they ran out of spray paint lado shrugs o blurts out i want to meet my biofather all paqu would tell odespite her persistent questioning when she was seven or eightwas that her father was a loser and therefore better out of her life o learned not to bring it up now she does to ben bens a little stunned and more than a little distracted with converting his subversive plan into subversive action but ben is ben what do you hope to achieve by meeting the sperm donor thats what were talking about right o lists the potential benefits lay a guilt trip on someone else for a change piss paqu off freak people out by performing hideously inappropriate pda piss paqu off pretend hes actually her sugar daddy piss go back to five ben says youre on to something there what do you mean come on ben says paqu is turning off the tap so youre looking for a new tap thats deeply cynical ben okay a poor little rich girl just wants some paternal love she says and you attribute her motivations to a crass golddigging campaign instead of the profound search for identity that do you even know where he is i know his name she was looting an absent paqus dresser drawers for cash and found something even better a vibrator what she would refer to as paqus smartest boyfriend the bestest stepdad ever ubermann with apologies to chons beloved nietzsche bni batteries not included no first dates no awkward conversations no futile fumbling no messy human relationships just fire that bad boy up find a suitable fantasy and the big o or os plural if you do it right however right next to the rabbit she found something else her birth certificate with the name of the father shed never met paul patterson her fathers identity sitting next to a plastic phallus three months in therapy right there i mean i could track him down couldnt i o asks ben maybe ben says but then what he worries she has this fantasyshes going to meet her dad hes going to be great theyre going to have this relationship i dont know ask him questions ben knows that she already has the answers in her headher father always wanted to be with her paqu is the evil step mother who forced him away like why he left before you were born ben asks like if he loves you whats he going to say o thats going to make your life any better she has the obvious riposte whats he going to say to make my life any worse dennis has a beautiful wife two beautiful little daughters and a beautiful if modest home in a nice suburb of san diego where the neighbors grill steaks and salmon and invite each other over from across the fence he goes to church on sundays one of those nice tame establishment churches that believes in god and jesus but not so much that its inconvenient and comes home and catches the afternoon football game or maybe goes for a walk with the family on the beach he has the sweet life and knows it career going great you get good headlines for the guys who sign your annual reviews you put them between a bunch of cameras and bales of marijuana you let them pose beside mug shots of mexican cartel figures autopsy photos even better your life plan is looking pretty solid its not cynical this you must understand you have to get this or none of it makes sense or has any meaning dennis does work that he loves and believes in scrubbing the scourge of drugs from the american landscape he believes so where does it start you could say it starts that morning as dennis stands in front of the mirror shaving and feels that discomforting little tingle of undefined discontent but maybe the whole concept of omniscient narration is pretty fucked anyway right it doesnt maybe it starts the night before with the discussion of the granite countertops theyre remodeling the kitchen and his wife really wants granite countertops but when you look at the prices in the catalogs its like holy shit maybe it starts because his work is the kind of thing he wants to talk about at home on thursday pizza night when dominos delivers and his oldest girl is already seriously into the idol results show when his wife asks the how was your day question he answers fine and thats it and that wears him down isolates him from the people he loves the most maybe its the cumulative effect of that or maybe its a baby frozen blue in a dark gray dawn twentysomething years ago in a war that never seems to end chons face appears on the screen via the miracle of skype ben angles the lappie so o can see him too she breaks into a huge grin chonny chonny chonny chonny boy hi guys how are you bro ben asks good yeah fine you excellent ben lies wants to tell him cant even when chon asks hows business business is good because it seems cruel to tell someone about a problem he cant do anything about but sit and worry and the last thing ben wants to give chon is a distraction take his mind off what hes doing and chon looks tired worn down so ben commits a lie of omission so instead they make small talk o assures chon that shes taking good care of his plant and then chons time is up and his face disappears from the screen bens lying chon could see it on his face somethings wrong at home something with the business but he pushes the thought aside to focus on the mission the mission is simple hes done it a few dozen times nownight raids on a house chons team isnt involved with complicated counterinsurgency operationsgaining the trust of the people setting up village security building clinics clean water systems schools winning hearts and minds chons team does antiterrorist ops degrade and disrupt the enemys command and control systems put simply find enemy leaders and kill them the theory being that dead people are probably degraded but definitely disrupted death being more or less the maximum kink in someones day the collateral theory being that if you kill enough leaders it discourages middle management from applying for the job vacancy nobody wants that promotion more money more responsibility corner office laser dot most salafist leaders want to go to paradise eventually not immediately generously yielding that privilege to lesser beings otherwise that cocksucker bin laden would be standing on the top of the sears tower waving his arms like come and get me not hiding out anyway over the course of a couple of wars chons unit morphed from counterinsurgency to antiterrorism because the latter is cheaper faster and easier to tabulate bodies especially dead ones being easier to count than hearts fickle and minds transitory so hes used to missions like this theres just so goddamn many of them so many bad guys to kill dennis has put bad guys away to see other bad guys take their places dennis has looked into the dead tortured faces of his sources dennis has seen youve heard the expression truckloads of cash and thought it was a figure of speech dennis has seen literally truckloads of cash headed south for mexico to people who have kitchens with granite countertops and he turns those trucks in to his bosses who pose beside them while he dutifully puts a little money away each month for his kids college educations and his wife clips coupons because while paradise is paradise paradise is also expensive dennis sees his face get a little older hair a little thinner belly no longer taut knows that his reflexes are a little slower memory not quite as acute that there might be more calendar pages behind than in front of him so maybe that little nudge of discontent was fear maybe not maybe it was just discontent as in the winter of in a place that knows no real winter anyway you need to know that dennis hoards information he feels justified in doing so because hes worked hard to develop sourcestheyre his and he doesnt share them because he doesnt want to share the information they develop this does not make dennis particularly popular among his peers but he doesnt give a shitthe life plan isnt to make friends among his peers its to rise above them and then theyre not going to like him anyway so denniss modus operandi is to work his sources to develop information right up to the point of making a bust then dole those busts out for the best possible political and promotioncreating effect thats why when one of his cisthats confidential informants and d has given a whole new meaning to the confidentialtells him about this isolated little ranch house way the fuck out in east county near jamul he goes by himself the lone ranger or the lone stranger as hes known in the office undercovers are natural lonersthey dont trust anybodyparanoia is a survival strategy sans tonto as paqu might say recalling that shes in her french phase to check it out solo surveillance dennis has ballsbig clanging brassso he drives out into the dark desert all by his lonesome parks his vehicle on a ridge overlooking this ranch and trains his nightscope on the house its a cash dump theres a phrase huh whats happening is that the dealers are bringing their cash there to be counted sorted and stacked for the relatively short dash down across the border on any given night theres going to be hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in that house dennis takes one look at this and knows its the bust that could put him over because what he also sees through that scope is filipo sanchez number three in the baja cartel the night is eerie green through chons night goggles monstermovie green he rolls out of the apc armored personnel carrier behind his team and rushes toward the compound of twostory concrete buildings where the cia boys said the aq honchos are holed up pressing the butt of the m rifle to his shoulder he keeps it at firing position as the c charges blow the gate off its hinges and the team goes in chon has a photo of the aq asshole that is target number one burned into his memory pan mahmud elkassani where are you mahmud dennis knows filipohells yes he does he has filipos picture pinned up on the bulletin board in his office he knows the names of filipos wife and kids knows what futbol team he follows knows that filipo subscribes to the padres games on satellite tv this must be an important cash dump for filipo to chance coming over the wire so he must be up there checking up on things making sure that all of the money goes south and none of it gets lost and wanders toward other points on the compass while dennis would normally keep this house under surveillance for a couple of weeks and then turn it over to his superiors so they could get the credit now hes thinking about playing leapfrog the san diego sac is looking at retirement and a pop like this could put denniss ass into his empty chair so this is totally a cowboy move highly discouraged by the powers that be but dennis knows that he has a justificationhe can always say that he had to take the chancewho knew when and if filipo would ever come back be on this side of the border and theres a federal trafficking warrant on the guy anyway so he clips his badge onto his jacket finds his dea cap in the backseat pulls his weapon and goes in chaos in the compound foxes in the henhouse as women shriek children scream goats bleat no chaos for the teamthey know exactly where they are and where theyre going up some stairs to the second floor bullets zip past them as the aq fight back chon moves the rifle around smoothly target shoot target shoot target shoot he makes it to the door and heads up the stairs one of the aq shot out the lightbulbs at the sound of the explosion and its black and tight in there chon feels someone come out of a doorway beside him and he swings the rifle to take him out and sees its a kid cant be twelve in the traditional vest the waskath from which chon knows we got the word waistcoat and skullcap big black eyes shoot every male is the order but chon isnt going to follow that order so he shoves the kid back in the room and moves up the stairs into a room that becomes a charnel house as the team shoots everyone inside and chon sees mahmud who doesnt want to become a martyr this night he puts his hands up to surrender chon drills him twice through the chest because chon wants him to be a martyr paradise is paradise but its also expensive yeah they might try to slug it out with him in which case hes dead more likely theyre just going to bolt in which case most of them will make it but its worth the risk nailing filipo sanchez come on so dennis charges down there in his jeep like a movie cowboy on his horse theres no fence no gate because the narcos dont want to call attention to the house and dennis just drives right up slams the brakes and jumps out badge in one hand pistol in the other and announces dea this is a raid nobody fucking move dennis has balls three gunmen are just standing there openmouthed staring at him clearly trying to figure out what to do and this is the moment when if they were going to shoot him they would in the jerry bruckheimer version they do just thatthey whip out the weaponry and let fly missing almost every shot while dennis guns them all down andhit in the shoulderbursts into the house and has a shootout with filipo roll credits sweep up the popcorn except a multibilliondollar polydrug cartel doesnt get to be a multibilliondollar polydrug cartel because they have a lot of stupid people working for them and while this isnt your typical dea raid with the typical cast of characters its still a dea raid and these guys know that killing a federal agent on american soil is going to cost a lot more money in the long run than is in the house subjects them to the needle instead of fifteen to thirty and even filipo sanchez is expendable thats just the truth thats just life in the vida narco money is just moneythey lose it all the time same with peoplethey go to jail they come outits the chance you take that even applies to filiporoyal family or no royal familyit happens and the family goes on so what happens is they do freeze and dennis strides right past them into the house where filipo sanchez looks up from a folding table stacked with cash and looks mildly surprised and calmly says theres five hundred and fifty thousand dollars on this table for you if i go out that door back down the stairs now mission accomplished everyone gets to go home drink a beer watch a dvd women are already mourning keening ululating but chon no longer hears that white noise hes almost down the stairs when the kid steps out again chon sees the kids innocent black eyes and says oh fuck as the kid reaches inside the waskath and detonates the bomb strapped to his body the green world goes red few people ever have to find out what they would do when their whole life has been based on one thing and then theyre offered the other dennis knows that he can bust filipo and five other filipos will kill each other trying to take the job vacancy knows that the job vacancy will be filled because the money is just too good knows he should bust him anyway cuff him and read him his rights filipo is showing no signs that hes going to resist or run maybe if filipo had been your cineplexstereotype fritobandito mexicowboy in an embroidered black shirt and brightgreen lizardskin boots it might have been a simple choice but filipo wears a tailored gray sports coat over a white buttondown shirt an expensive pair of jeans and black loafers slightly tinted bifocals shortcut black hair with flecks of silver very understated muted softspoken not a trace of threat in his voice or smirk on his face just business an exchange of value for value money for freedom a lot of things go through denniss mind in a hurry things that just the day before probably wouldnt have occurred to him like k is granite countertops is his kids education is fuck the coupons he thinks about his pension down the road how maybe it buys an rv that you stencil some name like buccaneer on and drive across the country every other year k invested wisely over those years buys you a place in costa rica on the water trips to tuscany granite countertops it would be just this once he thinks one time and one time only and never again except dennis knows thats not true even as hes telling it to himself he knows that a soul isnt for rent only for sale but to save face he says this doesnt change anything filipo nods but allows just the suggestion of a smile to show on his face because they both know this changes everything the river of time is tough that way sometimes the current is so strong that you can never go back to who you used to be even for a visit but dennis just nods filipo goes out the door taking a big chunk of dennis with him who knows if faith cracks or erodes the river of time eating away at its banks until it just crumbles looks sudden isnt chon hears the ululations of mourning lying on his back he feels cold air rush over him then nothing don winslow the kings of cool laguna beach cocaine runnin all round my brain red arnall cocaine doc pulls a rabbit out of a hat except it aint no rabbit and it aint no hatdoc pulls a glassine envelope out of johns surfboard magic john just got home from a surfing trip with doc to mexico it wasnt third reef pipeline or anything like that

because they cant see me kim takes the society pages home clips the photos and pins them to the cork bulletin board above the small desk in her room studies them harder than she studies algebra or chemistry or english because those subjects will get her nowhere and one day on her way home from workher pink uniform dress smudged with grease stains and coffee spotsshe stops at a fabric store and buys a dress pattern three weeks later she buys black fabric theres a problem though she doesnt know how to sew and anyway they dont have a sewing machine so the next morning she gets up takes the pattern and the fabric walks across the gravel lawn knocks on the door of mrs silvas trailer and asks can you help me mrs silva is in her early sixties her husband goes back and forth to mexico and is often gone for weeks at a time and kim can hear her sewing machine from inside her room mrs silva smiles at the pretty guera are you going to the prom she asks no can you help me kim shows mrs silva one of the society page photos it needs to look like this sonrisa thats a thousanddollar dress except i want the neckline to be more like she draws her index finger from left to right in a diagonal line across the chest come in well see what we can do for the next two months kim spends every spare moment beside mrs silva at the sewing table her new tia shows her how to cut how to sew its difficult complicated but mrs silva is a good seamstress and a wonderful teacher and kim learns you have an eye for fashion mrs silva tells her i love fashion kim confesses she knows that shell need more than the dress theres a newsstand at the corner of ocean and the pch where the owner likes to look at her legs so hell let her stand there and browse and not buy anything while she goes through vogue and cosmo and wwd and takes notes the makeup she sees is expensive but she saves as much of her pay as she can what doesnt go to help her mother with rent and food and all her tips and she is so careful so careful about her selections so when she takes the bus to the mall and goes to nordstrom she knows exactly what to buyand nothing morefor the effect she wants to achieve the calendar is not her friend as kim crosses off the days to the fundraising event she does the unforgiving mathematics of time her income and what she still needs to buy per hour times twenty hours plus a shift in tips times five minus a week to her mother for household expenses its going to be tight at one of the many dress fittings with mrs silva tia ana now tia ana says the dress is coming along but the dress without the proper foundation is nothing kim doesnt know what she means tia ana is frank you have beautiful breasts but they need the proper bra to make the dress look just so an expensive dress with cheap undergarments it is a beautiful house with a cracked foundation and then there are shoes men look at you from the top down ana says women from the bottom up the first thing those brujas will do is look at your shoes and then they will know who you are so kim starts looking at shoesin the newspaper the magazines in shop windows she sees the perfect pair in the window of a snooty shop on forest avenue charles jourdan out of her reach and while she can make a dress she knows she cant make shoes its a problem then theres jewelry obviously she cant have the real thingdiamonds are as beyond her reach as the starsbut she finds that she has a flair with costume jewelry and tia ana helps her pick out a few piecesa bracelet a necklacethat set off the dress but the shoes kim goes home and looks at the waning days of the calendarthere are more xs than blank squaresdoes the math and realizes that shes not going to make it her mother might have told her so in the few hours between scant sleep and cleaning other peoples houses the former freaky frederica now just freddie her hippie days long behind her sees her daughters activitythe photos on the bulletin board the pattern bag the comingsandgoings from mrs silvas trailer like mrs silva she misinterprets it as something to do with a prom or a dance or even finally a boy but she worries that her daughter is headed for heartbreak because she seems to be overreaching for a social strata in snobby orange county that she cant achieve most of the girls at dana hills high have money have access have above all attitude and will quickly sniff out that kim lives in a trailer and that her mother cleans houses for a living she doesnt want her daughter to feel ashamed and besides shes proud of who they are who she is an independent woman making it just but making it on her own kim is smart kim could go to community college maybe even a fouryear school on a scholarship if shed study but kim is too interested in the fashion magazines and the mirror freddie tries to tell her so but kim doesnt listen what she could tell her mother is that you dont start your journey of upward mobility on the stairs you take the elevator but either way you need the right shoes stan accepts the rolledup dollar bill from dianes hand oh eve leans over the counter at the bread and marigolds bookstore and snorts the line of cocaine doc grins at him and wow diane is already grinning because doc chivalrous gentleman that he is offered her the first line her brain buzzes and the little bees quickly work their way down to her pussy industrious busy as and lascivious flowertoflower creatures that they are doc has a sense of reciprocitystan and diane turned him on to acid now hes returning the favor with coke he and john have come over to the store with a sample fair being fair friendship being friendship and business being business not to mention alliteration being alliteration its good business to turn the owners of the bread and marigolds bookstore on to a free sample of your new product because while the bookstore aint what it used to be its still a nerve center of the counterculture read drug community such as it is anymore the community not the drug its timely stans looking for something new anyway hes tired of selling the hippie stuff worried hes trapped in a fading culture and truth be told hes a little bored with diane too and she with him and the political scene the revolution that they thought they won when nixon the uber villain the evil stepmother be honest the scapegoat they are both conversant enough with their ancestral religion to know that the goat was loaded with all of societys evils and driven from the town fell from power and the war ended its come to jimmy carter jimmy carter jimmuh cahtuh with his lust in his heart diane doesnt want lust in her heart she wants lust in her puss in her yoni if you must and its been a while since shes felt it with stan its all right its pleasant but pleasant funny thing is even in the free love dayswhen people were twisted around each other like worms in a coffee can in the bookstores back roomshe didnt participate neither did stan she out of reticence and he she suspected more from a fear of disease now they both wonder if they missed out on something the other thing they wonder about is money it used to be something you werent supposed to care about bourgeois but now people seem to want it and people seem to have it like doc for instance taco jesus has more than taco money now and he isnt throwing it around or away hes buying thingsclothes cars homesand it looks good on him and diane cant help but wonder are they missing out on something or worse have they missed out on something like theyre standing on the banks of a river watching the future flow away from them and now stan is looking at her as if hes thinking the same thing but she ponders if he is standing on the bank with her or floating away and she also wonders if she cares she turns and watches john do a linein this new vernacular all traces of his adolescent cuteness are gone hes lean muscular and powerful and suddenly she realizes that she is ten yearsa decade older than she was this boy this child who used to sell joints from the bottom of his skateboard is now a young man and rich if you believe the gossip gossip hell she thinkscertainly john owns the house two doors down from the one they still rent and the parade of sleek young women going in and out screams of money and one morning she saw stan his fucking teacup in hand looking out the window watching one of johns girls getting into her car admiringlusting after her long legs her high breasts her charlies angels blonde hair who is the actressthe one with the fake silly name and then he pretended he wasnt staring and she wished he had the honestyokay the ballsto come out and say yes he thought the girl was sexy because she could see him chubbed up against his faded jeans the ridiculous bellbottoms and if hed been that honest she might have given him some relief gone down on her knees and sucked his dick and let him shoot shiksa fantasy into her willing mouth but instead he said some mealymouthed thing about the superficiality of it all so she decided to leave him hanging as it were now john hands her the rolledup billits her turn again feeling a little silly diane pushes a finger against one nostril and inhales with the other and feels the coke blast her brain and then the acrid drip down her throat they each do another line then far too restless to stay in the store decide to go for a ride stan insists on driving and they all pile into their clunky old westfalia van and she finds herself in the back with john as they cruise south on the pch with her head and puss buzzbuzzing and she hears doc talking to stan about a distributorship like its amway or something even if you just buy for yourself doc is saying well give it to you wholesale so youre already ahead then if you decide you want to make a business of it buzz buzz serious money buzz buzz cant be a lot of profit in leather bracelets suddenly she watches herself turn to john and hears herself say kiss me john looks startled what she repeats herself with some urgency with some heat with her husband two feet away she offers her mouth her full lips and john takes them and she sucks his tongue into her mouth and sucks on it like a dick and she feels moist wonderfully wet and then stan pulls off the road into the harbor grill because apparently the men are hungry and as he turns off the engine he turns and looks at her and she knows that he saw the waitress hands them menus i know that girl doc says watching her walk away he turns to john sitting in the booth beside him we know that girl john shrugs they know lots of girls and hes still a little blown away by diane kissing him with her husband right there but if stan is pissed hes not showing it not showing it at all because his hand is under the table stroking his wifes thigh and shes looking across the table straight at john her lips curled into a smile that wants to become a laugh i know that girl doc repeats then gives it up and asks stan so what do you think stan strokes his beard black and bushy i dont know he says studying the menu i dont know dont know what diane asks as if she hadnt overheard the conversation in the van doc has a business proposition stan says you know doc says business oh says diane business should we be talking about this here stan asks diane is surprised that she feels contempt for him the waitress comes back for their orders shes pretty diane thinks a cheerleader they all order omelets diane sees stan sneakily look at the girls tits do we know each other doc asks the girl i dont know she says i dont think so you couldnt describe the girl as bubbly diane thinks but you wouldnt call her cold either shes reserved older than her age i just think i know you from somewhere doc says kim thinks maybe its because you used to sleep with my mother with me there but she doesnt say anything if doc doesnt remember her good if no one remembers her good jesus will you let it go john mutters at doc kim remembers him too the boy who lived in the cave and ignored her stan watches her ass as she walks away then says to doc i dont think we have the money to buy in thats the beauty of it doc says you dont have to you just go down to mexico bring some back with you and keep a piece for yourself sell that piece and youre in business i dont know doc leans over the table and says to stan you could sell right out of the store im telling you this is money i dont know stan answers well have to think about it dont think about it too long doc says cocaine doesnt make you exactly patient diane looks at john as theyre undressing for bed stan asks so what do you think about the cocaine yeah or about me kissing another man diane thinks nothing about that were just going to let it slide she tosses it back at him i dont know what do you think do we want to be drug dealers he asks she knows that they can go on for hours like this answering questions with questions with questions we dealt grass she says is it so different stan unbuttons his denim shirt and hangs it up in the closet shucks off his jeans and hangs them on a hook on the back of the door isnt it i mean grass is naturalthis is a powder that comes from a plant she says so does heroin stan counters would we deal that no she says impatient now naked now sliding into bed but is cocaine addictive i dont know he gets in beside her it would be nice to have some money we could buy the house she says thinking that if he says anything about feminine nesting instincts shell punch him in the face but its drug dealing stan says is that what we started out to be what did we start out to be stan to his credit he laughs at his own pretension revolutionaries volunteers of america the revolution is over diane says who won stan asks diane laughs and then takes him in her arms pulls him close his body is warm and familiar and he gets hard quickly she knows that he wants to slide into her but she rolls over and straddles him he looks up at her his eyes shining and she can see him thinking you saw me kissing him she says he nods did it turn you on he doesnt answer she hovers supports herself on her thin strongsurprisingly strongarms her cunt just on the head of his cock you cant have it until you tell me tell me it turned you on watching your wife kiss another man yes yes what yes it turned me on watching you she lowers herself down on him and he moans she rises and then drops again and then she says ill fuck him and you fuck her who who she mocks the hitler youth waitress you were ogling she leans over rocks on him and whispers im fucking him and youre fucking her youre fucking her sweet little blonde cunt youre feeling her tits her ass stan grabs her by the waist and turns her over pulls her up onto her knees and plunges into her uncharacteristically ungently he pounds her bruises her ass and the back of her thighs thats right she says take her she wants you to just take her thats right thats right thats right thats right then she feels him go soft i just he says i just want you like the sex narcs are watching you she thinks later he says ill talk to doc in the morning diane sips her coffee and looks out the window at johns house she pretends to vacillate but she already knows what shes going to do dianes too honest to fool herself for long too honest not to acknowledge that she now feels justified by jealousy over stans easy acquiescence to her manipulation fantasyfucking the teenage waitress then unable to carry it all the way through setting the cup on the counter she walks out the door warm spring morning knocks on johns door it seems like forever before he answers but then he opens the door his hair is sleeptousled his denim shirt unbuttoned barefoot a cup of coffee in his hand hi he says stan and doc meet at the harbor grill kim is their waitress do you ever go home doc asks her i wanted extra shifts charles jourdans money she isnt going to make no matter how many extra shifts she works she takes their order and goes to the kitchen have you thought it over doc asks diane and i talked about it stan says and stan hesitates hes more than aware of dianes irrational unfair contempt for him she despises him for not wanting to have sex with another woman not even a woman but a teenage girl its crazy but he does feel emasculated he knows that money would make it better money would give him his balls back the kind of money doc is talking about were going to say no stan says thats cool doc says stan can see he thinks its anything but cool he thinks its pussy but stan has weighed the pros and cons the money would be great but you have to weigh it against the risk of getting busted spending years in prison maybe a mexican prison and then there are the ethical issues not that we dont appreciate the offer stan says sure doc says the waitress brings their food and they eat pretty much in silence with forced desultory conversation doc is relieved when stan gets up and says he has to open the store ive got the check doc says no let me nah i got it stan thanks him and leaves the waitress comes over with the check lays it on the table and says ill do it im sorrywhat ill do it kim says just one time but ill do it shes a fucking kid john says you were a fucking kid its different how that was grass john says this is coke thats hard time doc shakes his head its juvenile time worst that can happen is that she does a few months in juvie doc knows this for chrissakeshe did time in the juvenile system he also knows that she may go in a kid but she wont come out one between the girl gangs and the dykes shell be just a piece of white meat she asked me doc says defensively i didnt ask her anyway i remember who she is thats great john says he doesnt ask he doesnt care you remember freaky frederica doc asks no when you were living in a fucking cave hotshot doc prompts that was her little girl john doesnt remember her shell look just like any other teenager with a fake id doc says shell bat those blue eyes and walk right through yeah john asks what if she doesnt doc what if she gets popped you think shes going to keep her mouth shut and do her time shell give us up in a heartbeat worse he thinks is that we wont know it theyll tape that coke back up to her and let her bring it right to us with an escort of narcs docs ahead of him our mexican suppliers will clock her through the border check if she doesnt go right through we go straight to the airport cool out in tahiti for a while and the girl john thinks whats her name kim can cool out in juvie nice kim walks toward the border check like any number of american teenagers who go to tijuana for a day of drinking and then come back to san diego over the pedestrian bridge at the san ysidro crossing medical tape is wrapped around her rib cage holding the bags of cocaine firmly under her breasts slimmer smaller packetsstill valuableare taped to the insides of her thighs she had stood humiliated in her bra and panties inside a house while the mexican abuelas taped the packets to her body mentally she removed herself from the scene trying not to feel their hands on her or the eyes of the drug trafficker who stared at her with undisguised lust i am a princess she told herself being prepared for a ball no im a highfashion model and they are fussing over lastminute details before i go out on the runway and the man is a photographer studying how he can best capture my beauty my essence for his camera and finally they were done and she pulled the loosefitting peasant blouse over her head and slipped back into the jeans and the women stroked and patted her until they were satisfied that the packets could not be seen or even easily felt and then she put on her tennis shoes and hefted the cheap canvas bag over her shoulder doc told her that most kids might slip a couple of joints or a bag of cheap ditch weed into the bottom of their bags and thats what the customs guys will be looking for if they search anything theyll search the bag doc said when they see that its clean they wont do a body search say what you will about doc he makes the kids go to school the leering drug trafficker drove her out near the border crossing and now she walks toward the checkpoint and tries to control her fear the truth is shes terrified despite docs reassurances you wont get caught he said but if you do youll spend a few weeksmaybein juvenile hall now in the pedestrian line at the checkpoint she balances a few weeks in juvenile hall against the pair of charles jourdans and tells herself that she made the right choice but shes still frightened and knows thats a bad thing they look for signs of nerves doc told her sweating fidgeting whatever you do dont touch yourself like to make sure the packets are still in place they will be keep your hands away from your body just act natural doc doesnt know kim doesnt know that shes spent her entire life so far trying not to act natural nature is a cave nature is dirty now there are only two people in front of her she shifts her weight onto one hip posturing a teenagers impatience if you get caught doc said which you wont theyll ask you who gave you the drugs just say that some mexican guys approached you on the street and offered you money and you couldnt resist the temptation how much money kim always pragmatic asked five hundred dollars doc said they were going to meet you at the trolley stop at the main train station in san diego you were going to go into the ladies room stall give the dope to a woman there and get paid now she rehearses the story in her head some mexican men came up to me on avenida revolucion one of them was named miguel he offered me five hundred dollars thats so much moneyim a waitress i went into the bathroom of a restaurant with his girlfriendi think she said her name was ritaand she taped the drugs to me im sorry im so sorry ive never done anything like this ill never do it again i swear ever only one person ahead of her now she feels her heart race she thinks about turning around going back then the customs agent waves her forward doc hangs up the receiver of the pay phone on ocean avenue and walks back into the marine room john sits at the bar nursing a beer and idly watching the baseball game on television shes in line doc says his tone is cool but john can tell that doc is nervous stan and diane sit in their small living room reading he updike she cheever she looks up from her book and says i fucked john mcalister the customs officer tells kim to set her bag on the table and open it he watches her not the bag as she does and sees nothing the girl is totally calm unconcerned aloof detached he looks into the bag and sees the strand of kotex that doc provided her with told her to put on top kim looks at the customs officer coolly as if to say hey you told me to open it he hands her the bag and welcomes her back to the united states she crosses the bridge kim walks into the shop and asks to try on the charles jourdans the clerk looks at her in her pink waitress uniform with that youre wasting my time look but something in kims eyes makes her go find a pair of s and bring them out kim makes her bring out s and s too just to be sure but the s fit perfectly and kim says shell take them the clerk takes the shoes to the counter and asks for a credit card kim pays cash god as my witness ill never be hungry again tia ana dresses her for she knows not what but the girl is beautiful no not beautiful exquisite for a week stan says nothing about dianes announcement hes sly enough to know that this seeming indifference is the best revenge the harshest way to punish her to inflict retaliatory pain to pretend that her infidelity isnt important enough to merit discussion and besides he doesnt know what to say having already confessed that her kissing john turned him on and also the truth of it is hes afraid to talk about it afraid of the confrontation igniting a conflagration that might end in his having to demand a divorce what if she doesnt apologize what if she says shes going to do it again with john with other men what if she demands an open marriage which he doesnt want so stan pretends that his silence is a punishment and diane pretends to believe the same although shes pretty sure that hes actually afraid and it deepens her contempt which tempers her shame not so much that she cheated on her husband but the fact that she bestowed herself on john who didnt seem to think it was such a big deal they did it and it was nice it was good but it was nothing special and afterward he got up and got a beer and offered her one she declined and he didnt ask what now or what next and she just went home and washed him out of herself and couldnt avoid the truth that she betrayed stan for nothing and then stan decided to punish her with silence which was so stupid because couldnt he see that shed done it largely to give them something to talk about but they settled into silence an unspoken agreement to pretend and diane begins to think that maybe its the necessity of marriage to let scar tissue form over the wounds so that you both become literally callous they settled into silence until tonight stan sets his updike down gets up and says that hes going to the store to take inventory kim pauses in the lobby outside the fundraiser cocktail party and experiences a moment of selfdoubt the women are so elegant so beautifully turned out so confident in their wealth and elegance the men are so casual and handsome so well dressed their laughter comes out of the room like a challenge to her saying you dont belong here trailerpark trash waitress your mother cleans our houses and you lived in a cave she stops and stands there thinks as she did at the border check of simply turning around and going home to the trailer where she belongs its her eighteenth birthday stan gets a gun freudian sure but there it is finding a gun in dodge city is like finding sand on the beach all he does is walk over to johns house and let himself in the pistol is under johns bed don winslow the kings of cool she turns heads shes that beautiful exquisite kim walks into the cocktail party uninvited with her head high you might call her bearing regal and no one stops her at the door no one has the nerve to tell this lovely creature that she cant come in even the women although jealous are intrigued they want to see whats going to happen they want to test their husbands and boyfriends and their own attractiveness against this newcomer kim walks through the crowd seemingly unconscious of their starescertainly not selfconsciouswalks to the bar asks for a glass of chablis and gets it she looks twentythree at least no one asks for an id or an invitation and then glass at her lips she coolly turns to survey the crowd as if to determine whether theyre worthy of her interest its a stunning debut kim is certainly not a debutante there was no money for even a sweet sixteen but this is her comingout party johns at a different kind of party what would come to be known as the great laguna blizzard of it snowed like hell inside docs house that night cocaine everywhere and most of the association boys nosedeep in it cocaine on mirrors cocaine on tabletops cocaine on magazine coversdoc hosting like some kind of surferdude mad hatter at the tea party john sits back and watches the circus he doesnt do coke well he did when they brought it up from mexico john took a couple of snorts the way a winemaker might take a couple of sips pronounced it okay and then forgot about it coke is too crazy for him people get too jacked up but this is a comingout party for coke in laguna at least a sort of motivational seminar for the sales force you can only sell what you love is everybody excited so john could give a shit he smokes a j sips a little scotch and lets it snow snow snow and scopes the women shit doc has really stocked the pond on this one sleek longlegged women are everywhere and theyre digging the coke he doesnt even have to get up from the couch andbingo bangoan incredibly gorgeous auburnhaired chick in a miniskirt comes up and sits down next to him im taylor she says john the white smudge under her nose looks cute but john leans over and wipes it off dont waste that she says she holds his wrist and licks the coke off his fingers then says taste of whats to come except he hears you slept with my wife john looks up and stan is standing over him looking stupid in his denim jacket and jeans stupider with this look of rage on his face you slept with my wife he repeats taylor giggles john tries to go the chivalric route stan i dont know what youre she told me john says okay i slept with your wife like now what stan doesnt know he stands there looking confused and uncertain and stupid and john just wishes he would go away so that he can get back to taylor and things to come and is about to tell him so when stan pulls a pistol from his pocket kim is a triumph at the cocktail party think cinderella if you havent already think sabrina see above point is she kills even the orange county bitches who normally would have sliced her up like a gang of benzedrinecrazed chefs at benihana cant touch her its not a matter of kindness god knows but of cowardice not one of them is brave enough to be the first shark to draw blood and start the feeding frenzy and by the time they work themselves into a sufficiently collective indignation at this parvenu to socially gangrape her its too late because one of the young men recognizes himself as a cultural trope and obediently plays prince charming brad donnelly is a scion of oc nobility twentyfive ucla alum doing great things in dads real estate business looks to match im brad he says i dont think weve met im kim she says its working just the way she imagined it a million times just the way she planned it he smiles and walks her onto the broad deck with its stunning view of the beach and the ocean the sun setting like it knows its in her movie who are you brad asks why havent i seen you before i guess you havent been looking im looking now so i see he juts his chin back toward the party inside theyre all talking about us you know i know do you mind i dont care brad answers they make inconsequential chitchat for a few minutes then brad asks you want to get out of here and go to a really cool party i would love to heres how fuckedup coke is this is funny guy pulls a gun and points it in somebodys face and most of the partygoers think its a hoot its even funnier if you know stan because its so totally unstanlike winniethepooh packing heat pretty much johns reaction he doesnt say stan dont or please dont kill me he says stan where did you get that never mind stan says realizing it sounds dumb i should kill you the should is the giveaway he should hes not going to john says i didnt rape her stan doc ever the good host comes over and says come on put that away stan its a party he had sex with diane stan says doc ponders this for a moment and then delivers a response that becomes laguna legend well doc says so have you cocaine logic irrefutable come on man doc says putting his arm around stans shoulder join the party do a few lines stan sets the pistol down on the coffee table and starts to cry my man doc says have you ever done coke before brad asks her no kim says truthfully neglecting to mention that the cocaine on the glass table in front of them had once been taped to her torso brad does a line then kim does a line and it isnt long before she lets him maneuver her into one of the bedrooms as if it were his idea when they shut the door he starts to undress her but she pushes him away and then undresses herself she peels off the black dress and stands in front of him in her black bra and panties knowing that shes a vision she lets him look for a few seconds then reaches behind her and unsnaps her bra brad smiles kicks off his shoes and hurries out of his slacks and jockey shorts he picks her up and then drops her onto the bed then he nudges her legs apart kneels between them and reaches for her panties her hand blocks him she looks into his eyes smiles and says no brad if you want this youll have to marry it no one comes into kims room without paying coked out of his skull stan takes inventory takes a long look at the bread and marigolds store and the merchandise theyre trying to sell to a diminishing customer base and decides that its over sees himself in his shabby denim and feels stupid less than who john doc diane bread and marigolds he thinks jesus the place is a fire trap anyway it only takes a little kerosene and a match the fire this time your boyfriend is pretty ripped doc says to kim she looks over and sees brad slumped on a sofa his eyes glassy from coke and booze hell be out cold any second my fiance she corrects youre going to marry that stiff doc asks for a while she answers come on doc says taking her hands where are we going you know in his bedroom he says take them off kim take what off the pretty clothes she does and stands in front of him pirouettes my god doc says he admires her perfect body for several seconds and then lays her down on the bed look at that he says she puts her hand over herself and says no doc if you want this youll have to he laughs long time coming this rendezvous she wraps her arms around his broad back remembers lying in a cave hearing him with her mother soon its like shes tumbling over a waterfall and she holds him tighter turns her head and sees the charles jourdans her pretty shoes john pulls on his slacks and walks back into the living room hes fucked out taylor wasnt a ride she was the whole amusement park six flags magic mountain knotts pussy farm that girl kim the mule is on the couch next to a lifesize ken doll who looks like he just had his head handed to him shes sitting there like there isnt a drugcrazed orgy going on all around her like theres not a pistol on the coffee table at her demure knees like shes about to answer questions from miss america judges and then twirl fire batons while singing a medley from oklahoma but whatever because speaking of fire there is one outside the sky is on fire the bread and marigolds bookstore is as they say engulfed in flame they all stand across the street and watch as the fire department pretty much lets it go trying only to contain the fire and keep it from spreading to buildings they dont consider a public nuisance their faces red in the reflection of flame they stand and watch doc kim john stan and diane arms around each others shoulders doc asks anyone have marshmallows they laugh even stan they are stardust golden caught in the devils bargain laguna beach the sun comes red over the laguna hills ben strides to chons apartment knocks on the door waits a sleepy o clad in one of chons tshirts opens the door sees the look on bens face and screams nooooooooooooo hes all right ben tells her as he walks her to the bed and makes her sit down

with this so he needs to handle it himself he needs a plan that leaves chon out of it chon hangs up and relishes the thought of o for a few minutes and then moves off it because a real nurse comes with his meds sanitized word for drugs which theres a war on and theres also a war on terrorism and theyre connected chon contemplates as the meds take holdthe politicians either are on drugs or should be a bunch of religious fanatics mostly from saudi arabia fly planes into buildings and we invade iraq its a generational thing chon muses bush sr goes to war against saddam hussein and puts troops in saudi arabia which was bin ladens reason for going to war against america and hussein tries to kill bush sr and then bush jrfaithful son loyal sonuses bin ladens attack as an excuse to get payback for husseins attempted hit on his dad as brando as pacino and featuring saddam hussein as virgil the turk near miss there sollozzo and the usa as a collective credulous diane keaton just this

trying to decide which flatscreen tv to buy debating the relative merits of samsung and sonybut there is no consumer reports on drug cops he knows he has to trump the county level the next obvious choice would be a state cop but ben takes the long viewif he comes up with a state cop he leaves room on the board for ogr to jump him king me so what he needs is a fed not easy not easy for one thing the feds are notoriously honest chon would object to the pairing of notoriously with honest but hes in afghanistan so fuck him two the feds are also notoriously paranoid clears with chon always checking on each other and three ben has no clue how to approach a fed or four which fed to try hes walking on the beach pondering this dilemma when he sees a fisherman jam a small fish on his hook and then cast it deep in the water you can google anything you can even google a federal drug agent what ben does is he goes on google and enters federal drug bustscalifornia and gets three million twenty thousand hits your tax dollars at work he scrolls through rejects most of them and then he hits massive marijuana seizure in jamul sees a photo of triumphant narcs standing beside bales of ditch weed and a story about this being a massive blow against the sanchezlauter cartel the massive blow quote coming from a dea agent named dennis cain who has a particular look of triumphalism mission accomplished on his grille dennis ben decides looks like a candidate ambiguity intentional ben gets on a pay phone and waits for special agent dennis cain to answer when he does ben says simply terra vista in modjeska canyon grow house premium hydro who is this you want it or not can you repeat the information come on the call is recorded ben clicks out then he calls his grower at terra vista in modjeska canyon bail what bail ben repeats take as much of the good shit as you can get into your car and leave the rest do it now kev dennis listens to the recording doesnt recognize the voice hes not big on anonymous sources usually its a practical joke someone trying to harass an exgirlfriend or wife or its a new player tracking the call he finds out it came from a pay phone at john wayne airport he thinks about giving it to the oc task force let them waste their time but its a slow day so he decides its worth a ride up to orange county to check it out always a nice drive along the ocean up through camp pendleton and he feels like getting out of the office so what the hell the anonymous source proves to be pure gold well pure marijuana ben waits for ten days and then hits him again this time from the amtrak station in downtown san diego who are you dennis asks the guy whos going to get you your next promotion ben answers unless you keep asking me who i am lets meet lets not i can guarantee your security dennis says no surveillance no wires trust you you absolutely can you want this tip or you dont dennis does ben mixes it up next time sends dennis a typed

noise going in dennis you know what else makes a lot of noise going in a hollowpoint into your brain which is what youre going to get when these people figure out its you which they probably already have you need protection which i cant offer you unless you give me a meet you need to put these people behind bars im trying to save your life here ben youre trying to make cases dennis so call it a symbiotic relationship symbiosis n a close and often longterm relationship between different biological species for examplenarcs and drug dealers truth is neither can live without the other ben agrees to meet dennis don winslow the kings of cool o comes through the door paqu is in the kitchen have you been out looking for a job paqu asks i want to meet my father ben sets a lot of conditions hes not

ben will never testify never appear in court dennis agrees to all of it because why not end of the day hell do what he wants and the ci cant do shit about it dennis drives slowly back and forth across the cabrillo bridge in san diegos balboa park on his third pass a young man opens the passenger door and gets in this is where gays meet dennis says by way of introduction to suck cock im disturbed you know that ben says drive down to the airport dennis takes laurel street down through little italy to lindbergh field where ben has him park in the cell phone lot so talk ben says he isnt who dennis was expecting most marijuana types are scruffy retrohippiesthis guy looks like he could have stepped out of an up with people rehearsal right up top dennis says if you wont testify i cant offer you immunity this isnt survivor ben answers im not asking for immunity got it im just obligated to tell you you need me to sign a release form maybe down the road dennis answers you have a name ben i need arrests ben ben shakes his head thats not your problem what is my problem selfabsorption ben answers you havent asked me what i need dennis thats fair ben what do you need ben tells him symbiosis wounded chon hates the word wounded simple past tense and past participle of wound suffering from a wound especially one acquired in battle suffering from an emotional injury i am wounded that i am wounded chon thinks he is of course aware that the word comes from the old english wund from the saxon wunda the norse und the norse the vikings who believed that if you died with your sword in your hand you went straight to valhalla to join your fallen brothers in perpetual feasting drinking and fucking which is clearly why they slaughtered the christians so easily come ongrubbing guzzling and boinking versus playing the harp but if you didnt die with your sword in your hand you were basically fucked so chon is a rehab animal the rehab techs have to force him to slow down back off but its a challenge because chon is determined not to be one of the wounded he has a medical board coming up hes going out with his sword in his hand speaking of which he got a card from o her sort of wearing parts of a candy striper uniform sword meet hand int paqus house living room day o and paqu stare at each other o im going to find him paqu i dont want you doing that o i dont care im going to paqus jaws tighten paqu dont do it ophelia o why not just tell me why not don winslow the kings of cool he left when i was pregnant with you paqu tells her thats the kind of man he is thats the man you want to meet ben goes to chads office and leaves a briefcase k in monopoly money don winslow the kings of cool cock sucker duane says when he gets the word from chad decides its time to go see the powers that be the powers that be are powers because theyve figured it out specifically you dont want to be in the drug business you want to be in the turf business you get cops judges lawyers muscle and charge a fee for people to sell drugs on your turf you dont own a stall in the market you own the market and take a percentage of everybody elses stall the marijuana stall the cocaine stall the heroin stall the methamphetamine stall the whateverthefuckaslongasitsillegaltosell stall you get your piece and its not just the dealersyou get a referral fee from the lawyers and money launderers you send them to in the great movie franchise that is the illicit drug trade you arent actors or writers or even directors or producers youre caa look at it this way if you take percent of the top ten dealers in your area you are the biggest dealer in the area without ever touching a drug low profile high profit you cant be busted the actual drug dealers take all the risks and bring in money every day if they dont and at some point you hope they dont because then you lend them the money to make the payments of course this requires no monetary outlay on your part you simply extend their payments while charging interest in the form of late fees dig itnow youre your own credit card company they can never catch upat some point you own their entire business and they become your employeesand you let them make enough money to eke out a living until you bust them out and then somebody else volunteers to take their place the suckers stand in line to take a number and get fucked because even owning percent of themselves they can make a lot of money if they dont fuck it up its a beautiful thing being the powers that be so crowe goes to report that one more idiot is trying to jump off the conveyor belt get him in line is the answer because if one clown thinks he can dance solo theyll all think it then you dont have a business anymore crowe finds ben in his usual spot usual time sipping a latte and reading the new york times online duane pulls out the chair across from him and sits down ben looks over the computer top good morning no it isnt duane answers its going to be a very bad morning monopoly money ben smiles if you didnt have the money this month duane says you should have just said so we could have worked out a payment plan i have a payment plan ben says my plan is not to make any more payments what are you saying im saying ben says im not paying anymore then youre out of business ben shrugs well put you under the jail crowe says all those charges can be reinstated and well just bust you over and over and over again ben says nothing his version of passive resistance he calls it verbal gandhism the other guy cant play tennis ben explained to chon one time if you dont hit the ball back he cant play tennis chon answered if you shoot him in the head either duane stares at ben for a second then gets up and walks out verbal gandhism works so do symbiotic relationships dennis walks into the orange county task force office flashes his fedcreds and demands to see the boss commander roselli looks like he just swallowed hot piss thats how happy he is to have a fed on his turf trodding on the flowers making the dogs bark but he summons boland upstairs and makes the introductions deputy boland special agent dennis cain dea boland nods at the fed to what do we owe the pleasure you have an op going against a benjamin leonard dennis asks boland hesitates looks at roselli roselli says go ahead boss i said go ahead boland turns back to dennis yeah i do no you dont dennis says whatever you had going shitcan it now you cant just walk in here and yeah i can dennis said i did leonard is dealing marijuana in our jurisdiction boland argues he could be selling enriched uranium to osama bin laden outside the teacup ride at disneyland dennis says and you will stay the fuck away from it what boland asks you want the bust for yourselves hes a federal ci idiot dennis snaps you keep fucking around youre going to jeopardize an operation that is so far above you youd need a ladder to sniff its asshole you burn this guy youre going to be on the phone to the agthats the attorney generalof the united states dipshitexplaining why roselli says youre running an op on our turf you should have let us know so it could leak to our target dennis asks fuck you roselli says okay fuck me dennis answers who you dont fuck is leonard dicks out hands off him his friends his family his dog if he has one there is a force field around him that you dont get near unless you want to get zapped do we understand each other they do they dont like it but they understand ben leonard is untouchable no one is untouchable what duane gets told for example what do the following have in common a sonny corleone b bonnie and clyde c filipo sanchez the answer is they should stay the fuck out of cars nevertheless filipo sanchez sits in the back of the black humvee the seat piled high with presents for his daughters birthday elena is going to be angry he thinks she believes he spoils magda but whats a daughter for if her papa cant spoil her elena says they have already spent more than enough on the party itselfand threatened to flay him alive if he was even ten minutes lateand that magda doesnt need more things but a girl can never have too many pretty things hes looking forward to the party to seeing his daughters face light up filipo lives for these moments he glances down at the ridiculous blue lizard boots that his bodyguard insists on wearing filipo keeps trying to tell jilberto that they live in the city now in the very best colonia in tijuana not out on some sinaloan backwater but he wont listen they come to a traffic signal the light is about to turn yellow run it he tells his driver he must not be late for this party and risk elenas wrath but the humvee stops i said jilberto opens the door and gets out the driver flattens onto the seat dios mio three men appear in front of the car aks in their hands filipo reaches for his gun as he starts to get out but jilberto kicks him in the chest sending him back into the car then jilberto raises his uzi and lets loose the three men open fire through the windshield the bullets shred filipo and with him all the presents in their pretty wrappings duane crowe cracks an egg on the side of the cast iron skillet and carefully squeezes it into the hot canola oil he used to cook his eggs in bacon but his doctor busted his balls about his bodyfat percentage so it was either the beer or the bacon and crowe chose the beer he tried turkey bacon but its turkey bacon crowe has one of those onecup coffeemakers that even he sees the sad symbolism of a onecup coffeemaker is what you get when youve had two marriages go south and now even if you have a woman stay the night its easier to take her out for breakfast because that way shes well out last thing in the world he needs is another divorce settlement taking half of what the last two wives left him not to mention child support two kids he rarely sees and brittany is already applying for college shit where does it go and shes a really bright kida great kidwith good grades last time she called she was looking at notre dame crowe gets a percentage from chad meldrun for every client he sends through the door it sounds like a lot of money but he has to kick percent up to the powers that be so every dollar coming in means something and every dollar lost means more he scoops the eggs onto a plate shakes pepper and salt fuck the doctor on them sits down at the breakfast counter and turns on the news the talking head is chirping about drug violence in mexico this is news crowe wonders and then a still photo of filipo sanchez comes on the screen apparently hes now the late filipo sanchez crowe is surprised but not surprised filipo has developed a nasty habit of not paying his fees maybe it was him trying to prove his chops to the lauter family trying to show them that he could do more than just marry elena but filipo was on a campaign to cut the powers that be out of the payment loop always bitching about the money trying to negotiate the rate downward missing payments a real pain in the culo crowe didnt blame himyou do what you can dobut filipos rebellion was unwise given the lauters ongoing war with the berrajanos he just became too much of a pain in the ass and the powers that be decided to switch sides its not that they whacked filipo they just signed off on the berrajanos doing it filipo didnt want to pay the fees the berrajanos did that simple crowe hopes that this ben leonard also saw the news and took a lesson from it he finishes his breakfast and heads out should be an interesting day today a real popcorn movie the empire strikes back ben walks back to his place dennis cain is out front waiting for him uhhh what the fuck dennis in front of my apartment where i live where my wife sleeps and my children play with their toys its time for your monthly contribution to the dennis cain promotion campaign dennis says ben already knows this but you dont want to be seen with me dennis says most of my snitches like to meet on neutral ground but every once in a while i like to show up in their native habitat so they dont get to feeling too secure lets go inside ben says they go inside you want anything ben asks you got diet coke no then i dont want anything dennis sits down on the sofa so what have you got for me and before you answer dont even start with a grow house or a van full of dope ben looks at himthats exactly where he was going to start i know who you are and i know what youve been doing dennis says you grow topgrade hydro and youve been giving me your own factory seconds i look like the outlet mall to you bunkie you pull off the freeway and sell dennis a shirt with one sleeve longer than the other i have a lead on some highgrade you read the papers watch the news sure then you should know im a rock star dennis says and i dont want any green m ampms in my dressing room my last hit on the baja cartel went platinum and the last thing i need is any more boo i get any more marijuana ill have to lay it off on ebay ben is stretched out between the rock and the hard place and he has nowhere else to go dennis likes the situation arrogant ben leonard has his head caught in a vise and filipo sanchez is never going to be in a position where he can testify about making a payoff to a certain federal agent someone el norte gave the nod to filipos assassination and is forming a new partnership with the berrajanos if its true the sanchezlauters are in big trouble not only are the american partners changing sides but filipo was the last male in the royal linetheres no one to head up the family dennis wonders if filipos guts spelled anything as they spilled out of him narco sesame street today is brought to you by the letter f fuck you filipo and fuck you ben leonard so what do you want ben asks weve been over this dennis says arrests of human beings growersbetter yet buyerswholesalers preferably its time for you to name names benny boy thats not going to happen ben says look dennis answers i pulled you out of the shit i can drop you right back in it takes one phone call and i can have an assistant make it you want ben leonard take his ass he isnt producing anymore nice you want nice get into another business dennis says sell teddy bears candygrams puppies kittens theyre nice im in the arrest businessand youre in that business with me youre going to name names youre going to wear a wire youre going to help make cases dennis tells him you want me to keep the heat off you dennis concludes youd better wake up every morning asking yourself the following question what can i do today to make dennis happy dennis aint gonna be happy because ben isnt going to name names he comes from a family for which the mccarthy hearings were living history discussed around the dinner table as if they were in that days news and the worst of his parents scorn was reserved for those witnesses who named names theyre worse than the freaking mafia in that regard stan and diane with their leftie omerta and stan still refuses to watch on the waterfront because kazan named names you were blacklisted back in the day and do the math stan and diane were infants it was a badge of honor you were one of the hollywood ten you were a hero im telling you john gotti is going to name names before ben does he doesnt know the solution to cains demand he just knows what hes not going to do he also knows that hes caught between the grinding wheels of two machinesthe orange county machine and the federal machine big government and bigger government its enough ben thinks to make a republican out of you o goes to the library first she has to find it and is pleasantly surprised to discover that they keep the thing right downtown and shes walked past it like five hundred and fiftyseven thousand times she could get on her computer at home but paqu is on the warpath in high dudgeon o heard that phrase in a movie and always liked it even though she doesnt know what a dudgeon is and chon isnt around to enlighten her and not talking to her which usually comes as an intense relief to o except this time paqu isnt talking to her while coming around every five seconds to glare at her and she also suspects that paqu has implanted spyware on her laptop in the completely justified paranoia that o uses her credit card to access online porn the last thing she wants is paqu tripping over the words paul patterson on her computer and going batshit crazier so o goes to the library to do what most people who go to the library douse the computers she seriously doubts that her paul patterson will be on facebook but gives it a try anyway only to find there are a few zillion paul pattersons on facebook then she googles paul patterson only to get a few hundred zillion hits she thinks of narrowing the search to paul patterson father but doubts that the search engine has her piquant sense of humor so she hits paul pattersonlaguna beach and there are some but none who meet the demographic of her potential daddy so she tries paul pattersondana point no luck she decides to go literally in the other direction with paul pattersonnewport beach this is what its come to she thinks as she scans the results we search for our parents on google crowe swings by brian hennessys place and honks the horn hennessy comes out a second later and gets in the car you ready to do this thing crowe asks him brian looks down at the cast on his arm what ben leonards attack dog did to him yeah hes ready to do this thing scylla and charibdis the rock and the hard place either ben cooperates with cain or cain throws him back to ogr and boland who are going to be shall we say vindictive ben needs a move and he doesnt have one he wishes chon were here to help him think it through but as they say in football there is no play in the book for fourth and twentythree its all so fucking stupid ben thinks in his frustration nixon declared the war on drugs in thirtyplus years later billions of dollars thousands of lives and the war goes on and for what nothing well not nothing ben thinks it makes money the antidrug establishment rakes in billions of dollarsdea customs border patrol ice thousands of state and local antidrug units not to mention prisons seventysomething percent of convicts are behind bars for a drugrelated crime at an average cost of k a year not to mention that most of their families are on welfare and about the only growth industry in america right now is prison construction billions on prisons billions more trying to keep drugs from coming across the border while schools have to hold bake sales to buy books and paper and pencils so i guess the idea is to keep our kids safe from drugs by making them as stupid as the politicians who perpetuate this insanity follow the money the war on drugs the whore on drugs hes in the middle of this happy thought when the doorbell rings o breezes past him into the apartment talking the whole way paul patterson she says newport beach stockbroker appropriate age more money than god exactly the kind of man paqu would fix her bullseye on she lies down on the sofa like shes in some oldfashioned shrinks office ben recognizing his role sits down in a chair and asks are you going to contact him i dunno she moans should i the doorbell rings again hold that thought ben says he gets up and opens the door its chon laguna beach it may be the devil or it may be the lord but youre gonna have to serve somebody bob dylan serve somebody john watches the wave roll toward him first of a set thick bottomheavy he starts to paddle into it then changes his mindlike fuck it its too much workand duckdives through the lip of the wave bobby z sits on the other side bobby zacharias like john one of the younger members of the association ultra laidback ultra cool moves literally tons of maui wowi from the best coast to the least coast lighting up times square like it aint never been lit up before john slides down the backface didnt want it bobby asks him i guess not they didnt come out here to surf they came out to talk away from the eyes and ears of toocozy laguna away from the binocs and microphones of the dea and the local heat and lets face it hard to keep a wire dry in the water not because they dont trust each other but because they dont trust anybody sign o the times the seventies are cooked the silly season is over you dont think so ask jimmy carter you dont believe jimmy ask ronald reagan ronald reagan say it again ronald reagan president ronald reagan and that cowboy was ready to scrub iran off his map like it was mustard on his tie and ayatollahs couldnt wait to give back those hostages when ronnie got the news to them that either the hostages go to germany or germany comes to tehran in the form of the st airborne armed with nucleartipped magnums make my day do you feel lucky khomeini apparently not and out like we aint fuckin around anymore we like dusting people off we dont drink the koolaid we put our boot on your chest and pour the koolaid down your fucking throat reagan like all american trends came out of california the country migrated out to the west coast got closed out by the shore break and now its all backwash dig it it has nowhere else to go but back its business now baby its the eighties its you do not fuck with the money you dont lust in your heartyou lust in your portfolio gordon gecko aint quite there yet but hes on his way he aint heavy hes my brotherbull shit that fat lazy chuckingdownthe quarterpoundersliketheyreneccowafersmotherfucker is heavy hes obese and you aint carrying him anywhere he can drag his own lardass into the gym or not whatever hes oho on his own didnt he listen what did he have cotton in his ears didnt he hear the great communicator communicate that were back to the good old mythical days of rugged individualism you drive your own fortymule team not to be mistaken for forty acres and a mulethats for you know them of borax across the economic desert you stand tall on your own two feet commune commune with my ass and trust i got your trust for you right here motherfucker unless youre talking trust fund keep trust out of your mouth baby trustthe verbis mostly for the past tense as in i trusted him exwife i trusted her exhusband i trusted him guy sitting in the hole after selling dope to a trusted friend who had a mike taped to his shaven chest hence john and bobby meet out in the ocean where neither one of them can wear a wire they let the next wave roll under them then bobby says i heard that doc got busted bullshit john says if doc got popped hed tell me wouldnt he i hear its federal bobby says serious weight serious time john knows that bobbys concern isnt for docs welfare doc wouldnt flip john says even if he would john cant help thinking doc cant trade up hes on the top of the pyramid and the feds dont trade down bobbys ahead of him maybe the cops would go for quantity over quality how many guys could doc give up the answer is a lot but john doesnt care how many he cares who like him if docs looking at fifteen years bobby says maybe he gives us all up instead maybe he gives them the whole association thats not doc thats not the old doc bobby answers the new doc he leaves it hanging doesnt need to finish john knows what he means doc has changed okay who hasnt but doc has changed he isnt the doc you knew in the old days springing for tacos he isnt the this pie is big enough for everybody doches the this pie is big enough for doc doc its coke coke isnt grass grass makes you mellow coke makes you paranoid grass inhibits your ambition coke makes you want to be king of everything which is what doc seems to want more and more john hears doc using the firstperson possessive pronounsingularmore and more he hears him use my instead of our its woodstock to altamontthis aint our stage asshole its my stage and you dont come on my stage and doc is starting to treat the association like its his stage to be fair other guys are getting weird too mike glen duane ron bobbyall the association guys are getting hinky with each other starting to quarrel over territory customers suppliers guys who used to share the same wave cant share the coke business and narcs love that they exist on the divideandconquer its their bread and butter and now theyve busted doc we dont know if its true john says can we take the chance bobby asks look even if it isnt true this time its going to be true the next the way docs going its not if its when and you know that john john doesnt answer the last wave of the set rolls through being a shrink in laguna is like being a fisherman at seaworld what chon would later come to call a targetrich environment you dip your line in those waters your net is going to be full of thrashing flopping gasping creatures faster than you can say and how does that make you feel which is what diane now asks the woman sitting not lying on the sofa across from her after the viking funeral of the bread and marigolds bookstore stan and diane decided that societys ills were more likely to be cured by reich and lowen than by marx and chomsky so they went back to school uc irvine and if that aint irony for you you havent been to irvine and became psychotherapists stan and diane soon developed a clientele of sixties refugees acid casualties strident feminists confused men manicdepressives not bipolar yet drug addicts see sixties casualties supra alcoholics and people whose mothers really didnt love them its easy to make fun but stan and diane turn out to be really good at what they do and they help people except maybe not so much the young woman in dianes office right now working through her lets face it probably first divorce i dont know if you can help her stan said over dinner last night that kind of narcissistic personality disorder is almost impossible to treat there is no pharmacological protocol and schema therapy has its own problems ive been working more with cognitive techniques diane answered sipping the excellent red that stan brought home theyve built a nice tidy life since she went a little crazy with john mcalister and stan responded by burning down the store they made enough money from the insurance settlement to buy the house in what was formerly known as dodge city and use it as both a home and an office theyve made new couple friends exchange gourmet dinner parties and now stan has become quite the oenophile with a small but sophisticated cellar if this life lacks excitement it also lacks chaos have your cognitive techniques had any effect stan asked drily in regard to her difficult client not yet she answered now she sits and tries to focus on kims umpteenth and constantly changing repetition of her storyher upbringing in a wealthy albeit emotionally unavailable family which provoked her young marriage to a white knight savior who was just another version of her remote father and who doesnt understand or appreciate her and how she cannot seem to relate sexually no matter how hard she tries and what diane is thinking is i want a baby john takes a carpet cutter and methodically slashes the tires of the bmw then he turns to taylor and says now go thats my car she says a new silver i i bought it for you john answers that doesnt mean you can just mutilate it john shrugsapparently it does he bought the beamer he bought the porsche that sits next to it bought the threecar garage that also holds the plymouth wagon bought the house on moss bay cocaine been bery bery good to me now youre just going to have to pay for new tires taylor says which means she isnt leaving john thinks with mixed feelings she says shes going to leave she threatens to leave she even starts to leave but she doesnt leave the coke is too good the sex is too good the house is too good shes not about to move back into some efficiency apartment in west hollywood and blow producers for oneline roles on shitty tv shows john loves her in his own way which is sort of detached shes so fucking beautiful will do anything in bed looks good on his arm when they go out and can actually be pretty nice when she doesnt want to fight but the girl does like to fight john doesnt know how this latest one started he doesnt even know what its about because she hasnt told him yet all he knows is that he came home from surfing with bobby and she was waiting with a head of steam worked up i have enough problems today john said hoping to hold it off nah i want to talk about the c word she snapped cunt he asked because hes not a big believer in argument foreplay might as well just get into the fucking fight yeah next thing john knew shit was flying around the kitchen like the amityville horror when she figured shed broken enough expensive glassware she went upstairs to pack john stood in their bedroom doorway and watched her jam things into suitcases dresses he bought her shoes he bought her jewelry he bought her suitcases he bought her this time youre really leaving right he asked thats right she stormed down into the garage and thats when he slashed the tires now she stands there looking at him god she is fucking gorgeous john thinks he grabs her by the waist and sets her on the hood of the car spreads her legs tears off her panties and does her right there only thing that could have made it better is if he could have started the engine first he pulls out tucks himself in looks at her and says now ill have to get it detailed too she says im pregnant kim thanks god that among the long list of things at which brad did not succeed one of them was knocking her up he didnt succeed at taking over his fathers car dealership didnt succeed at investments didnt succeed at the club didnt succeed in the bedroom he did succeed at getting blow jobs from his receptionist that was one thing my god if he had failed at that he did succeed at being her starter husband providing her with a good divorce settlement and enough income to live as they say the life to which she had become accustomed and on which she wants an upgrade she thinks now of quitting therapy it doesnt seem to be doing her any good and she sniffs a scent of condescension in dianes tone these days as if kims problems are not sufficiently compelling to warrant her full attention no she decides the money would be better spent on improving her nose which lets be honest is somewhat less than perfect twentythree now the body requires maintenance as it will soon be reentering a very competitive market the next husband will have to be a stockbroker real estate developer better yet old money and for that the nose must be perfect the boobs perfect the stomach flat and taut and thank god again no stretch marks sometimes terror strikes her like a blow to the chest she feels like she cant breathe this existential fear of the nothingness of herself john arranges to meet doc down at dana point marina doc shows up in a bloodred lamborghini countach and pulls up beside johns porsche it bothers john because cops hate this kind of flash the straight cops think youre rubbing it in their noses and go after you all the harder the guys on the arm dont like you flaunting it because the honest citizens see what they think are drug dealers tooling around openly and wonder why if they can see it the cops cant plus the cops on your payroll see you riding a sled and think maybe youre not paying them enough its just a bad idea doc sees the look of disapproval on johns puss and says hey we take the risks we should enjoy the rewards right otherwise we might as well be selling insurance there are limits doc thats not exactly a toyota doc answers pointing at the porsche john sees that theres no point in arguingdoc is tooted up its becoming a problem doc hoovering his own product it makes him irrational unpredictable prone to mistakes maybe one of those mistakes got him popped john thinks maybe its true its a problem john and doc arent just in the dope business togetherthey have a restaurant together a bar a couple of apartment buildings john gets popped and the feds could take it all they walk through the marina then across the bridge out toward the long narrow jetty taylors pregnant john says doc says they know what causes that now you know she was on the pill thats what she told you youre saying she got knocked up intentionally you saying she didnt doc says come on what grow up john gets what hes saying another word for baby is income a fat check once a month for the next eighteen years taylor wouldnt be the first woman to palm the pill for a payday no john says shes getting an abortion she wants you to stop her doc says you dont know taylor i have my career to think about taylor said i cant audition if im all fat and blotchy and shit john wanted to answer what fucking career six seconds on mannix and you havent been to an audition in a year but he didnt need another fight quit while youre ahead right anyway she already called the clinic and made an appointment she only told him because a she needed the money to pay for it and b it would be nice if he took her and brought her home which hes not real keen about doing but will okay doc smiles they walk onto the jetty it gives them a long viewthey can see anyone following them and the cops would need a hell of a microphone to pick up anything at this distance so whats really up doc asks it isnt just your girlfriend getting knocked up johns surprised he feels nervous has to suck it up to ask you have something you want to tell me doc like what like you got busted the fuck you talking about doc laughs suddenly he looks sneaky to

you junior he says but save the beatles songs for somebody else im fine yeah where are you getting this shit doc asks who you been talking to ron bobby john doesnt answer but doc knows the answer look he says those assholes wouldnt have known coke from cocacola if it wasnt for me i was first at the party shit i started the party now the guests want my house it makes some sense john thinks if the other guys contaminate doc he goes into the dope version of quarantinepeople wont deal with himand they can move in on his market share theyre working you j doc says trying to drive a wedge between you and me that also makes sense doc and john are fucking batman and robin you cant fight them together but split them up ill deal with bobby john says no dont doc says then he does a terrible godfather imitation keep your friends close your enemies closer stay close to them get the lay of the land feel them out find out whos with me whos against me can you do that johnny can you do that

pendleton in a bloodred lamborghini you havent had the full california experience its a rush especially with doc steering with one hand and snorting coke off the dashboard with the other nevertheless they make it to san diego alive and pull off on india street in little italy you develop a sudden craving for meatballs john asks they walk into a sandwich shopa few booths and a long counter with red stools doc sits down on one of the stools orders two sausiche sandwiches with peppers and onions and asks is chris around yeah somewhere do me a favor tell him docs here doc thats me doc grins what

of earshot john says what the fuck doc the mafia the amateur hour is over doc says these people can give us national distributionchicago detroit vegas i thought they worked with the mexicans chris says theyd rather work with white people doc says the truth is that the mexicans are bypassing them dealing directly with la and the san diego mob wants its own source jesus christ doc john says once you let these people in you never get them out thats all the movies doc says theyre businessmen same as us i dont know what do you want to do doc asks just stand around with our thumbs up our asses let bobby and them steamroll us fuck that fuck the association that shits over we gotta look out for ourselves he waves to chris chris comes back out on the sidewalk we all on the same page now totally chris looks at john yeah yeah they get down to detailsprice per ounce based on volume delivery methods who talks to whom when and howthe nittygritty logistics of the dope trade then doc says chris i have one other thing tell me some people arent going to be happy about this doc says they might try to do something about it chris says no problem no your turn to get coffee chris says let me make a phone call twenty minutes later chris and another guy walk into the coffee shop the guy is middleaged professionally dressed built like a refrigerator doc john chris says this is frank machianno hes going to move up to laguna for a while keep an eye on things frank offers his hand to each of them its a pleasure to meet you he says very quiet voice competent john doesnt miss it franks a stone killer johns coming out of papas tacos in south lagoo when bobby z rolls up on him in his pickup hop in bobby says we need to talk johns not so sure they need to talk but then he remembers docs request to stay close feel bobby out so he gets in you give any thought to what we talked about bobby asks i dont believe that doc would flip on us bobby says someone i want you to meet they drive back north up into the canyon and pull over in the parking lot where hikers leave their cars a white ford falcons sitting there with a guy in it and both the car and the man have narc written all over them the cop rolls down the window when the truck pulls up bobby doesnt waste any time tell this guy what you told us he says hallidays under indictment in the san diego federal district the cop says i dont have details because its sealed but i know its a class a felony fifteen to thirty theyve had him under surveillance for two years tell him the rest bobby says theyve got

shakes his head the narc rolls up his window and pulls out horses mouth bobby says hes dago dea i get it do you bobby asks i mean the rest of the guys are going to want to know where you come out on this thing what thing were not just going to sit back and let doc give us up one by one bobby says johns reeling first proof that doc is ratting them out shit he could have been wearing a wire while they were talking in dana point while they were meeting with the people down in dago then theres what bobby seems to be saying are you talking about what i think youre talking about john asks you wearing a wire too come on open your shirt fuck you open your fucking shirt john opens his shirt and shows bobby his chest happy yeah john thinks aint nobody happy about anything these days but bobby seems satisfied that johns not miked up so where are you at with this thing bobby asks im neutral no such gear on this bus bobby says not to traffic in cliches but youre either with us or against us john gets it like the man said youre gonna have to serve somebody sitting back in his chair stan puts his fingers together in a prayerful gesture in front of his chin and asks how can i help you this man slept with my wife stan thinks and now hes coming to me for help it will be a pleasure to turn him down cite ethical reasons and refer him elsewhere its doc john says what about him hes out of control john says i dont think that doc would agree to come in and im not asking you to treat him john says in a tone that makes it clear what he thinks about psychotherapy then he tells him about the possibility that doc has been arrested and might be making a deal with the feds i dont see how thats my business stan says you dont no let me explain it to you john answers if doc talks hes not just going to give them dealers and customershes going to name investors stan goes a little pale and they both know why he and diane had taken some of the insurance money from the bread and marigolds bookstore settlement and invested it in the association stan figured hed missed the big coke train once he wasnt going to let it pull out of the station without him again the money from the coke paid for the house the nice little life the modest wine cellar he and diane are shareholders theyre not involved in the daytoday even the yeartoyear but on major decisions they have to be consulted and killing the king is kind of a major decision what are you asking me to do stan asks sign off on john just stares at him oh stan says getting it john mocks him oh stan sits there staring at the neat row of books on the shelves books that are supposed to have the answers no ones asking you to do anything john says just give your okay and if i dont you take your chances john says stan looks stricken i never thought what stan fumbles i never thought id ever have to be involved in something like this who did stan john asks if you want to talk to diane about it no stan says quickly we dont need to bring her into this john shrugs then so do what you need to do john john nods and gets up love and peace he thinks hes in the doorway when he hears stan say when you had sex with my wife did she like it i had sex with diane john asks must have been stoned it was the seventies stan kim is surprised to see him john she says what a delightful surprise in a voice to make sure he knows that it is a surprise but by no means a delight that she isnt the girl he knew from the cave or the drug mule with cocaine strapped to her body or the wannabe debutante performing fellatio at a party shes a wealthy young divorcee long separated and well insulated from that life the fact that she has invested some of her divorce settlement into a common business does not make them peers he is a dope dealer she is a businessperson i wont keep you long john says it made him laugh he had to go through a security kiosk to get to her house on emerald bay now she stands outside her front door looking cool blonde and beautiful in a summer dress and jewelry princess fucking grace come off it he thinks i sold coke to buy my place you sold your gash in the words of lenny brucewere all the same cat what can i do for you she asks its about doc doc you remember doche used to fuck your mother in a cave while you lay there humming he strapped cocaine next to your precious twat and then boosted you onto the first step of the social ladder he turned your little investment into a small fortune that doc is he unwell she asks apparently recovering her memory i guess you could say that john answers he runs through the whole thing again kims quicker on the uptake than stan and more decisive i dont owe doc anything she says bending over to inspect the job that the mexican gardeners did on the flower bed in fact i barely remember him but like stan she has to get in a parting shot as he walks away john yeah dont ever come here again she says and if we should ever run into each other in public got it john says its the eighties yeah okay so he has the signoffs but so what getting permission is one thing doing it another theyre surfers slash dope dealers not killers not gangbangers not one of themnot ron not bobby none of them has ever walked up to another human being and pulled the trigger one thing to see it in the movies something else to do it and none of them can even contemplate it so theyll have to sub it out yeah but to who again it seems to be an automatic in the movieseveryone seems to know someone who kills peoplebut in real life laguna to the extent it replicates real life you have what respectably married middleaged gay guys who run art galleries and do hits on the side murder followed by brie wine spritzers and a soak in the tub you have some gangs up in the northern part of the county mexicans in santa ana vietnamese in garden grove but how do you approach them how do you go to them and say we want you to kill this guy our old friend doc it doesnt matter john explains to bz out behind the break at brooks street hes mobbed up now john says they sent a guard dog named frankie machine even if we could find someone to you cant get near him hire this job out to some gangbanger all youre going to get is a dead gangbanger only one who can get next to doc these days is a close trusted friend john drives back down to dago has a need for sausiche my appointments tomorrow taylor reminds john okay youre still taking me right right and bringing me back roundtrip taylor where are you going johns slipping into a light jacket out its two in the morning yeah i know what time it is taylor the lights are pretty down in the harbor bobbing gently with the boats moored in their slips john eases the pistol from his jacket pocket and holds it low beside the seat doc pulls a vial of coke out of his pocket and pours two lines out on the dash leans down and snorts them right into his nose john pulls the hammer back doc shakes his head to knock the coke down looks at john and says i did all right huh snorting blow from a lamborghini countach doesnt get much better than that does it hey doc john says remember when you used to buy me tacos yeah i remember doc says seems like a long time ago now he looks out the window down at the pretty lights goodbye doc guys out fishing on the stone jetty will later say that they saw the muzzle flash they didnt see john get out of the car and get into a black lincoln that pulled up the job get done frankie machine asks him yeah john answers the job got done frankie drops him a block from the house i want the baby what taylor asks shes sleepy its three oclock in the morning and john woke her up i want the baby john says its not a baby she says its a fetus its a human being what are you like catholic all of a sudden she asks we cant have a baby johnwe are babies you have to hand it to taylor john thinks she aint honest often she aint real often but when she is bang she gets the job done thats what i mean he says if we had a kid wed have to grow up right i dont know she says i mean ive never pictured myself as a you know mother can you really see yourself as a father funny fucking thing is all of a sudden he can with doc gone hes not the kid anymore maybe hes ready to be the father lets get married he says what its what real people do isnt it john asks they grow up they get married they start families its what they do isnt always what they should but its what they do stan cant sleep macbeth hath murdered sleep the guilt is ferocious and yet he has to admit that he feels a little titillated powerful giving if not the order the permission he rolls to his side and pushes against dianes warm ass reaches around and strokes her until she stirs and wiggles back into him shes wet enough and he pushes into her into it now she cooperates and rolls her hips hes harder than usual and she feels it baby she says its the best sex theyve had in years she arches her neck and pushes her ass back against his hips youre so deep she murmurs i know she comes before he does reaches back and touches his face when he comes deep inside her a seminal fuck john paddles out with whats left of docs friends at brooks street paddles out and joins the circle they form with their boards the guys look at each other guiltily not wanting to read each others eyes because they know what theyre going to see there relief pretty much the same emotion that permeated the funeral everyone sat there on wooden folding chairs and stared at a closed casket with this smiling photo of doc staring back at them while some minister intoned some bullshit that doc didnt believe in and felt guilty relief that a they didnt have to deal with doc anymore and b they didnt have to do what they were thinking about doing because c doc did it for them i just cant believe that doc killed himself diane said at one point hard not to believe thoughthe cops found doc in his car with a pistol in his hand and most of his brains on the window did he leave a note diane asked give a reason cocaine is its own reason stan said but as they were leaving he pulled john aside and asked did he really kill himself dont ask questions you dont want to know the answers to john said he killed himself leave it at that everyone will feel better if we leave it at that especially me same thing at the paddleout some surfercumminister says some lame shit and then they each float wreaths out onto the tide aloha doc surf on dude john looks back to the shore and theres cops standing on the stairway cops taking pictures like its the godfather wedding or something an association family portrait thanks doc time to shut it down for a while john thinks let the cops get bored and move on to the next thing he has enough money stored up enough investments to go into hibernation for a while manage the rental properties sell the restaurant live the life of a quiet successful young businessman let the rest of these boys figure out whos going to be the next king the crown is a cop magnet three weeks after the paddleout john and taylor have a small service at the gazebo overlooking divers cove a few friendsmost of them taylorscome and they have a reception back at the house before flying off to honeymoon in tahiti they stay for a month and when they come back john sells the house on moss bay and moves to more modest but still comfortable digs up in bluebird canyon he keeps the porsches in the garage and drives a bmw instead good thing he does it takes the cops about six months before they roll up the association like an old carpet turns out doc gave them a lot of names before he couldnt take the guilt and killed himself bobby always the smartest one took off and vanished leaving behind only a legend but mike duane ronone by one they go off to doubledigit sentences in federal lockups not stan not diane not kim john and taylor clean up their act taylor gets off the blow and their baby is born healthy they name him john hes three months old when the feds indict john for drug trafficking laguna beach i watched the world float to the dark side of the moon after all i knew it had to be

an ied going off or the whistling of a mortar round coming in doesnt have to wash a buddys blood off his hands doesnt have to kill anyone tonight tonight he can close his eyes theres no war here scott munson drives to the pulloff on the ortega highway that winds through the hills east of san juan capistrano the customers already there for three pounds of ben and chons best boo hes a new customer and delivering this kind of weight to a newbie is a violation of ben and chons rules but three pounds is a profit of and if the newbie turns into a regularwhich he will once his customers get a taste of this shitscott is looking at a new income stream which he needs because he wants to give traci a ring for her birthdayspeaking of violations of ben and chons rules traci is a ridealong on this delivery strictly verboten another word for passenger chon has lectured the sales force is witness another synonym is snitch you dont want to put your friends and loved ones in a morally impossible situation ben added in which they have to choose between their loyalty to you and their freedom just dont do it yeah fair enough but you try to tell traci she isnt coming for a ride shoulderlength auburn hair tight rack almond eyes and the sweetest personality in south orange county let chon tell her she has to sit at home while you drive out to east jesus more b ampc rules your customers never

battery on so she can listen to the radio and gets out theres a chick in the car brian says bad luck answers duane maybe we should call it off you got twelve grand on you he opens the car door and gets out scott bends over to take the bags from the trunk duane pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans and shoots him in the back of the head the muzzle flashes light up the car duane walks around and opens the passenger door the pretty girls hands grip the dashboard she stares straight ahead her mouth wide open in terror im not going to hurt you duane whispers in her ear her hair smells nice like she just washed it with some expensive shampoo just close your eyes while we get back into the car dont open them until youve heard us drive away okay she nods unable to speak then she closes her eyes tight like a child trying not to remember a bad dream duane strokes her hair with the back of his hand then he steps back and shoots her i want to do it chon says go for it ben says smiling chon leans out the window and talks into the speaker two doubledoubles he says with everything and a chocolate shake hes been waiting a long time to say that good to be home in california the name california is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradisewikipedia too bad about the chick brian says youd rather what duane answers as they drive away she flashes those beautiful browns to a jury while she points at you not that theres much chance of that theyll chuck the gun into the ocean and the car they boosted down in dago so if the cops do the csi tiretread thing theyll come up with some clueless beaner gangbangers still you dont leave witnesses not even ones youd like to fuck im just saying brian mutters im just saying chon finishes his burgers and smiles better than sex o asks no chon says but close but as the saying goes close only counts in horseshoes hand grenades and certain presidential elections chon lies in bed in his apartmentfighting jet lag and residual painwhen the door opens and o comes in he watches her slip out of her clothes her body pale in the moonlight that comes through the window she gets onto the bed and carefully straddles him dont think ive missed you or i love you she says or that im not pissed at you for turning me down the last time this is just a mercy fuck for a wounded vet got it a patriotic gesture she says bending down amazingly supple for a girl for whom exercise is anathema like tying a yellow ribbon around something she takes him in her mouth makes him harder then straightens up and hovers over him just lie there and let me do all the work she says o chon dont hurt me but she does small as she is slight as she is she hurts him as she rocks on him tries to be gentle tries to be soft but it feels so fucking good she cant stop and she sees hell trade the pain for the pleasure as he grabs her hips and starts to move not slower but faster not softer but harder and she thinks chon is in me and she grips him tighter and sinks into it with a poem and a prayer your skin is my skin your scars mine your hurts mine ill heal them with my cunt silvery slippery warm take you inside where there is no pain or fear you can cry when you come come in me a chalice for you my friend my lover my magic boy holy fuck chon says she runs a finger up and down his chest who knew he asks i did she thinks always have since the night you rescued me the night that started all this that night she was fourteen and the quarterback was really agg aggressive and he wanted to fuck o not even subtle about itthe boys idea of technique of charm was to get her down the beach away from the party and say i want to fuck you yeah no o would come to a time in her life when she was profuckingher friend ash would say that o handled more packages than upsbut not with this jerk not like ten minutes after he handed her a beer and thought that was his ticket to the show and plus she was fourteen years old im going back she said meaning back to the beach party they walked away from the party paqu didnt want her to go to after quarterback insisted he was seventeen and next years starting quarterback and they were already talking usc and the nfl draft so he was getting used to getting what he wanted he grabbed her by the wrist o was like small petite her mother called her gamine whatever the fuck that meant because paqu was in a french phase probably because she was doing this wine importer from newport beach and kept yapping about moving to lyon because paris would be cliche nestce pas yeah right o thoughtpaqu is going to leave orange county about the time michelle kwan or some other analretentive anorexics do their triple axels in hell paqu is never going to get more than a tenminute drive from her gyms her spas her plastic surgeons shrinks gardeners or her oc thats orange county but yes obsessive compulsive works too pals not even for marcel or michel or whatever the hell he appelles himself it just aint gonna happen but what really had o angry about the situation she was currently in is that it was exactly the situation paqu warned her about if she went to parties with boys she didnt know do you know what happens to girls who go to parties with boys they dont know paqu asked they get knocked up and have daughters like me o answered who go to parties with boys they dont know and get knocked up and have daughters like me its le circle de la vie paqu was nonplussed then again it is very hard to pluss paqu i married your father she said briefly o thought anyway she argued i know him hes a junior and hes going to be the starting quarterback next year paqu heard thatshe understood status still ophelia was only a freshman and the boy was a junior she forbade o to go to the party but then went to a party of her own and o simply left the house and went down to the beach where she found the party around a bonfire and also found quarterback who soon took her away from the party and down the beach where they could be alone anyway o was small and quarterback was big and all weight room protein powder supplements maybe testosterone the way he was actinganyway he was strong and wouldnt let go and she couldnt rip her wrist away so she was thinking fuck me not like wanting him to like wanting him not to quarterback offered her an alternative at least blow me he started to push her down to her knees your nuts cant lift weights okay maybe they can maybe youre that guru who nutlifts fivepound stones from the ganges or youre that guy who wins the darwin award on youtube and becomes an eroom legend but as a rule there are no reps you can do to strengthen your junk against a wellplaced knee delivered with bad intent which o had which o did she just cocked that knee back and let fly and then quarterback was on the sand on his knees and o should have walked away right there but she paused to admire her handiwork and quarterback lunged and cracked her one in the side of the face o was stunned he grabbed her by the front of her shirt took her down and fell on top of her his junk was hurting way too much for him to focus on his original intent but now he was in a rageall he wanted to do was hurt her and he pressed her down into the sand and pummeled her ribs she could hardly breathe her head was still whirling and she knew she was in big trouble except not because suddenly she felt the weight literally being lifted off her and this one guy had qb by the neck and another was pulling her to her feet ben asked are you okay do i look okay o answered ben said that she didnt did this guy hit you chon asked they didnt recognize each other it had been years since the school in the canyon o just vaguely recognized them as seniors yeah chon shook his head at qb and said not cool qb was jacked up and a little overconfident from the gym and the fact that five of his boys rolled in just now to back him up so he actually said mind your own fucking business asshole then he grabbed o by the front of her shirt like he was going to haul his property away chons kick came up and snapped qbs elbow like a popsicle stick qb went down screaming none of his boys wanted any piece of chon after that so they picked qb up and carried him down the beach chon stood there breathing coming down from the adrenaline do you have a name ben asked the girl o o its really ophelia o admitted im ben this is chon yes o thought yes it is my magic boy yeah except the magic boy was fucked not enough voodoo in the world to pull him out of this shit the starting quarterback wasnt gonna startnot next season maybe not ever with that broken wingand his family had considerable swag in orange county you put that up against the son of a dope dealer with a bad track record of his own and chon was going to jail maybe prison because hed just turned eighteen o wanted to stick up for him said shed press charges against qbfor sexual assault battery her mom knew lawyers who would help him but chon told her not to a survivor of the high school experience he knew what she couldntas a freshman her high school life was already going to be miserable if she took his side in this thing the whole school was going to make her into the slut the cocktease who got the star qb injured who ruined the season it was going to be bad enough as it was there was no sense in making it worse he told her to let it go as just a fight on the beach ben talked him into going to see his dad heres why this was maybe not bens best idea heres a story about chon and his dad chons mom took off the day john came home from prison but she came back a few days later on the pretext of picking up her juicer but really just to bust balls bad timing because john was coked up and pissed off and the two of them got into a fight not an argumenta fight and john pushed her up against the wall and raised his hand fourteenyearold chon stepped in shoved his dad aside and yelled leave my mom alone john smirked what you a man now you the man chon stood his ground which was a mistake because john hit him with a closed fist right in the face chons head snapped back with the impact chon put his hands up and rushed forward but as taylor screamed john beat the uncouth piss out of his kid pushed him backward over the arm of the sofa and punched him in the face the head and the body rolled him onto the floor and kicked him a few times and when taylor tried to pull him off he turned on her chon tried to get up off the floor but couldnt and finally his mom ran out the door john came back loomed over chon and said dont you ever raise your hand to me again you give me respect chon didnt call the cops or child protective services what he did was he waited for his old man to pass out that night then quietly opened his fathers bureau drawer found his and pressed the barrel into johns temple big johns eyes opened you touch me again chon said ill wait until youre asleep and splatter your brains all over the wall big john blinked chon pulled back the hammer unless you want me to do it right now he offered big john slowly shook his head chon eased the hammer down put the gun back in the drawer and went to his room his father never laid a hand on him again so john smirked when he heard chons story about snapping the quarterbacks arm still defending damsels in distress he said so what do you want from me you have lawyers i do john asked smiling why would you think i have lawyers chon looked him straight in the eyes because youre a drug dealer was john corrected i was a drug dealer i paid my debt to society as they say now i put roofs on peoples houses right john got himself a beer and offered one to chon who refused john shrugged and said if youre man enough to get yourself in this kind of trouble chon youre man enough to get yourself out you want some advice about how to get by in the joint i can give you that never accept a favor or a gift because youll end up paying with your ass personal experience chon asked john said heres what you do kidyou go join the navy get your ass out of town there i helped you chon left and found ben ben drove him down to san diego now in bed o tells chon all about her plan to find her father chon listens to the whole thing then asks what good will it do what do you mean chon shrugs i know my father and i wish i didnt the call comes in the morning ben detaches his arm from beneath karis brown shoulder and picks up the phone hears you reading the new york times ben sleepy not yet well try the orange county register instead mr untouchable ben doesnt get the register too republican runs down the street to a news rack inserts his quarters and pulls out a paper front page above the fold two found dead in mission viejo theres a photo of a bloodstained car a volvo frantically ben readsnames are being withheld pending notification but he thinks he recognizes the car he gets his phone out and hits scott munsons number it rings six times then scotts voice comes on you know the drill leave a message later scott for the first time in his life ben feels absolutely terrified worse he feels helpless he doesnt leave a message just clicks off his phone rings again scott ben asks thats sweet what did you do no ogr says what you should be asking your self iswhat did you do good question then ogr posits an even better question to him what are you going to do why didnt you tell me about this before chon asks after ben has laid it all out for him what were you supposed to do about it from afghanistan ben asks then from a hospital bed weve always told each other everything chon says that was the deal i know im sorry yeah well im guilty too he tells ben about brian and the boys that guy was testing us seeing how wed react the second i left he moved in on you ben is worked two people dead because of him its wrong ben says just flatout fucking wrong to let them literally get away with murder ben just cant let it happen and wont let it happen glad to hear you say it chon says youre not going to be glad to hear me say this ben answers were not going drug war no eye for an eye so what do you suggest im going to the cops which cops chon asks theirs not every cop is dirty what ben cant seem to get through his head chon thinks is that the justice system is set up for the system not the justice the drug laws make us out laws outside the protection of the law the only protection we have is self protection and you cannot go gandhi on that you just cant lie down in the street because the other side will be happy to run you over and then throw it in reverse and do it again im not asking you to do it chon says im just asking you to step aside and let me do it no the power of no is absolute ben has

in my own way chon which is what exactly ben gets on the phone and says you win perhaps elenas greatest sorrow is that magda will always associate her birthday with her fathers death a harsh fact for a girl who loved her papa so much elena sits and looks at the closed casket white draped in flowers armed men stand in the back of the room and at the doors waiting for an attack that could very well come she had to tell magda that she could not attend her own fathers funeral tomorrow too dangerous in a world bereft of decency are the armed men sentries or vultures she wonders ready to pounce on the carcass of the sanchezlauter family they are all wondering what she is going to do still beautiful still relatively young she could go away to europe find a new husband a new life certainly the option is attractiveshe has enough money to live well forever and raise her children in peace and comfort or will she step into her dead brothers and husbands shoes and take charge of the family a woman there is already grumbling about it she has heard it how they will not serve under a woman do you have a choice she thinks a woman is all thats left she lifts a blackgloved hand and lado appears at her side lado the policeman now openly in her employ a killerhis black eyes as cold as the obsidian blades the aztec priests used to disembowel their sacrificial victims lado she says i have a job for you si madrone shes decided chon tosses his cane on the sand and limps toward the water swimming is the best exercise to get him back in shape stretches his muscles breaks up his scar tissue improves his cardio but puts no weight on the wounds the water is cold but he doesnt wear a wetsuit not sure he could even pull one on and anyway he likes the pain of the sharp cold he starts swimming with easy overhead strokes not pushing it rhythmic strong peace lasted exactly one night now its back to war ext staircase table rock beach day ben and duane stand on a landing halfway down the long set of stairs waves smash against table rock duane pats ben down to make sure hes not wearing a wire satisfied duane what do we have to talk about ben i need to have a goingoutofbusiness sale duane you just dont fucking learn do you ben look i have all this inventory duane your problems are your problems ben my problems are your opportunity duane speak ben ill sell cheap fifty cents on the dollar to you duane why the fuck would you do that ben i wouldnt except what choice do i have i cant find a fucking buyer theyre all too scared theyre going to end up dead in their cars duane smiling i wouldnt know anything about that ben yeah okay look the point isyou win just give me a chance to get some of my money out ben watches anxiously as duane considers this duane let me think about it ben think quick im dying here chon follows old guys rule away from the meeting ogr gets into his fourdoor dodge charger and heads north on the pch back up toward laguna turns south onto arroyo and then onto lewis up into canyon acres eventually he pulls into a driveway i could do him now chon thinks the vss vintorez sniper riflewith a scope he doesnt need and a sound suppressor he doesrests under a blanket on the passenger seat it would be a simple matter of rolling down the window waiting until ogr gets out of the car and putting two in his head yeah except it doesnt necessarily solve anything chon thinks it does get justice for the murders and it definitely sends a message that were not to be fucked with but ogr is more the gofer type not the boss ogr gets out of the car and goes in its a nice housecalifornia bungalowsmall and well maintained but nothing about it says kingpin nothing about it says the owner is taking a licensing fee from every successful dope dealer in the oc and san diego unless ben thinks ogr is just a guy who has a cop buddy and they thought theyd do a shakedown on a gullible pot grower the other possibility is that ogr is a big player whos smart enough to lie low live under the radar until he has enough stowed away to pull out and go to some island paradise dont get ahead of yourself he thinks just take the next step like get ogrs name he puts in a call to an old buddy from the stan ben answers his phone hears ogr say well take your shit off your hands but at thirty cents on the dollar you sure you dont want to fuck me in the ass too ben asks while youre at it you say one more word its twentyfive thirtyfive ben says come on dont be a dickyoure making huge money on this what kind of weight we talking ogr asks jesus on the phone im clean ogr says hey if youre not one twenty give or take pounds no gallons dickwad watch your fucking mouth we on or not ill get back to you with a time and place ogr says bring cash ben says chons buddylate of the seals now with the oceanside pdcalls him back i ran the address his name is duane alan crowe fortyeight years old occupation roofing contractor you want me to ask around chons buddy asks see if hes on anyones radar chon tells him no thanks last thing he wants is to let anyone in oc know theres interest in crowe hey i owe you chon pulled him out of the shit in helmand one time you owe me nothing friends look out for friends way it is chon watches crowe come out of his house a big briefcase in his hand and get into his car at night about fucking time chon is used to sitting still waiting to spring ambushes but that doesnt mean he enjoys it he follows crowe as he drives off guy is standing out front waiting for ogr to pick him up brian hennessy is wearing a short jacket and chon can see the gun bulge underneath sloppy prick he thinks brian gets into crowes car chon follows them out to the californians can have entire conversations using mostly numbers the to the to the to the being fairly typical crowe turns east on the and drives up into the range of hills that flank the coastal plain nomansland surprisingly rural for this part of the world lots of switchbacks dirt roads little meadows hidden in oak groves thats where crowes headed now and it freaks chon out if hes going to meet ben which is a real possibility to do whatever the fuck it is that ben thinks hes doing chon thinks he knows the place theyre headeda little picnic area theyve used to make exchanges before he pulls his car over grabs the rifle gets out and starts trotting through the oak trees hoping he can get there in time miguel arroyo also known as lado leads a caravan of suburbans through the streets of tijuana and pulls up outside of the nightclub his blackclad men pour out of the trucks their ms carried at high port and surround the concrete block building a hangout of the sanchezlauter faction that went over to the berrajanos then lado leads a squad through the front door police lado yells there are about a dozen men in the club with their girlfriends or their segunderas police lado yells again a few of the men start for their weapons but quickly realize theyre outgunned and raise their hands lados men relieve them of their weapons and line them up against the wall then they step back and at lados curt nod open fire ben pulls the van into the picnic area and waits the back of the van holds one hundred and twenty pounds of his best hydro plasticwrapped into quarterpound packages in twentypound bales k at normal street value but this is a fire sale at k cocksuckers he also has a couple of little surprises wrapped up in two of the bales finally a car pulls into the parking lot after a few seconds ogr and another guy get out ben does the same ogr shines a big flashlight onto the van you come alone he asks like you said open the back ben opens the sliding door as he does the guy with ogr reaches to his waist chon sees it and switches his aim from crowe to brian scifigreen in the nightscope fifty yards away in the trees prone position rifle on a bipod if brian goes for the gun its over two shots into him swing back two shots into crowe chon puts pressure on the trigger its okay ogr says brians hand relaxes chons doesnt take your clothes off what i want to make sure were not podcasting on the dea network ogr says you and your little buddy agent cain fuck him take them off you take yours off im not the one who wants the deal bullshityoure here off ben takes his shoes off then his shirt and his jeans holds his hands up like you satisfied all of it come on you could have a wire taped to your dick or under your balls ogr says ive seen it done i could have it up my ass ben says you want to check that too i might you keep talking ben steps out of his shorts chon doesnt like it on several counts first its humiliating and he hates to see ben humiliated second they might want to shoot him like that really send a message like the mexican cartels do his finger tightens so does his head saying do it now do them both get it over with sooner rather than later remembering what an officer in the stan once told him ive never regretted killing a terroristive only regretted not killing him sooner you let the villager go one day next day he comes back with a bomb do it now do them both check the van ogr tells brian mikes wires what the fuck brian gets into the van can i get dressed ben asks please not that youre not a goodlooking guy ben gets dressed hears brian digging around in the van with all the subtlety of an orangutan on crank then brian comes out of the van says it looks clean it looks clean ogr asks i dont care what it looks like i care what it is its clean brian says better be ogr says can we do this now ben says did you bring the money first things first ogr says he pulls a knife from his waistband lado bends over slices the dead mans stomach open pulls out his intestines and carefully forms them into the letter s the last letter in the word traidores traitors crowe doesnt know how close he is to dying as he slices one of the bales chon eases off the trigger heart rate drops crowe takes out a qp package cuts it open and smells the dope turns to ben smiles says jesus christ to coin a phrase crowe shines his flashlight on the dopesees red hairs and crystals runs some through his fingers nice and dry no excess moisture weight very nice ben shrugswhat did you expect you want to smoke up go for it no need crowe says you want to be a grower for us maybe we can talk pass crowe tosses the bale to the ground then another one and grabs the next bale he slices into it and pulls out another handful of dope smells it and nods approvingly just wanted to make sure the rest wasnt ditch weed your trust in me is touching aint nothing about this business that has anything to do with trust crowe says he turns to brian load it up whoa ben says my money i almost forgot good thing im here then get the money crowe tells brian brian goes to the car comes back with a briefcase and hands it to crowe chon shrugs his shoulders to make sure theyre relaxed and recalibrates his aim if this is a rip this is when it goes down the briefcase is empty or crowe pulls a gun from it or they pop ben while hes counting except they wont because theyll both be dead before they can point their guns at him ogr hands ben the case count it if you want yeah i will turning his back on them oh ben chon thinks he sets the case down on a bale of dope and counts the wrapped stacks of bills its all there k he closes the case back up and nods at the dope go for it brian starts to load the packages into the trunk of their car how about the equipment you want that ben asks hold a yard sale ogr says brian finishes loading the dope i guess this is goodbye ben says it better be ogr says we hear anything more about youyou sell as much as a nickel bag to a college kidyou end up with your head on a steering wheel you got that got it good ogr takes a second to fix him with one more badguy glare and then gets into the car ben watches them drive away thinking fuck you dennis watches the little gps light blink red on the monitor when do you want to take them the other agent asks this is when dennis has a flash of inspiration he looks at the map with the little red dot pushes a couple of buttons points to the screen and says lets wait until theyre by that high school genius vicious duane and brian are cruising past laguna high when the world explodes flashing lights sirens cop cars coming from all compass points duane thinks about trying to run for it but sees its futile so he says quick throw the gun out what throw the fucking gun out the window duane yells the presence of a gun on a drug charge doubles the sentence and he also doesnt want to give the cops an excuse to vaporize them brian throws the gun out and duane pulls over the cops do the whole dramatic getoutofthecarandwalkbackwardtowardthesoundofmyvoice thing and then the putyourhandsbehindyourback thing and duane gets to stand there handcuffed while dennis opens the trunk and does the whole wellwhathavewehere thing and then walks over to duane and does the whole youhavetherighttoremainsilentanythingyousaycanandwill thing while another cop works on brian with the whole wesawyouthrow somethingoutthewindowifitsagundotherightthingandtellus sosomeschoolkiddoesntfinditandgethurt thing then dennis gets cute with it he says sb allows you eight ounces of dried processed cannabis im guessing youre about a hundred and nineteen pounds over the limit here chief duane says nothing then dennis slices open one of the packages and pulls out a bag of heroin uhoh dennis says to which duane responds tell leonard hes a dead man leonard knows ben sits in his apartment and thinks it isnt exactly justice for the murders but it will do part of the deal was that dennis promised federal instead of state prosecution which he can do because of the quantity involved so ten to twenty years on that quantity of marijuana a twentyyear minimum on the heroin proximity to a school possession of a firearm and theres no good time on a federal sentence you serve the full sentence the likelihood is that crowe dies in prison brian comes out an old man and theyll try to kill me but the tradeoff is worth it for a little justice thing is dennis isnt so interested in justice more in promotion its like a tv game show you work your way up the pyramid to the big prize he explains this concept to crowe but starts off in biblical terms i am the way the truth and the life he says to crowe who sits on the other side of the metal table no one comes to the fatherin this case uncle samexcept through me what the fuck are you talking about in my fathers house are many rooms dennis says and you can occupy one of them for many many years or what let me put this in profane terms dennis says you are totally completely utterly fucked you are more fucked than two teenage virgins on their wedding night you are more fucked than the volunteer subject at a viagra test you are more fucked than okay okay duane dennis says this is a winwin for me i can get out of the game now and win or i can stay in the game and win if i get out of the game now you lose big but if you can persuade me to stay in the game a little longer you might lose less are you following along here no now dennis gets into the pyramid bit its a pyramid dennis says in my game we try to go to the top of the pyramid right now i have you somewhere about middlehigh pyramid now we can stop there collect our money and you go to federal prison for the next thirty or forty years or you can give me the people at the top of the pyramid and then we have a new game ie lets make a deal theyll kill me duane says we can work on that dennis says depending on what you can give me we can talk sending you to a very safe facility we can talk about the witness protection programnote the key word witness duanewe might even be able to talk about you walking away from all of this but first i need names and i need to hear you say youre willing to wear a wire i want a lawyer duane says im going to pretend i didnt hear that dennis says for your sake think about it you call that lawyer youre thinking about the first thing he does when he leaves here is he goes to the guys at the top of the pyramid and tells them that youve been busted then your options are severely limited because those guys arent going to talk to you anymore and i cant reward you for conversations you cant have but you have the right to an attorney and by all means you can ill hold off a little bit duane says to think dennis says exactly so while youre thinking think about this one youre not the only player in the game dennis says im going to talk to mr hennessy now and if he rings the bell first fuck you so dont take too long to think but do think about twoa question to wit are the guys you want to be loyal to going to be loyal to you dennis asks or if and when they do find out youre looking at thirty to life are they going to decide its not worth the risk and have you clipped anyway in which case your loyalty to them is moot and so i return to my original theme i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me dennis i dont want to go to jail for the rest of my life brian says dennis laughs at him who gives a flying fuck about what you want this is only about what i want and youd better start thinking real hard about what it is that i want one two three go its painful watching brian try to string his thoughts together to form one line of cause and effect dennis runs out of patience let me be the local news he says and tell you whats happening in your world you think you dont want to spend the rest of your life behind bars your buddy crowe really doesnt in fact i just left him because i needed to get a new box of kleenex hes been crying and snuffling and sniffling so much in there are you ready for this hes trying to give me you for the munson murders because for all his corruption dennis is a man of his word he promised ben leonard that hed try and one look at brians eyes dennis knows its true he and crowe killed the munson kid and the girl what brian yelps yup dennis pushes he says you pulled the trigger hes got the needle pointed right at your fucking arm no way he brian stops short we know it was one of you dennis says the question is which neglecting to mention that it doesnt fucking matter who actually pulled the trigger but if brian doesnt know that tough shit ignorance has its costs if youre going to be a criminalknow the fucking law asshole i dont think it was you dennis says you dont strike me as the type whod kill a girl you just dont i think it was duane but hes in there sobbing that he watched you do it he has nightmares brian just blew her brains out he was laughing as he did it juries love that shit brian brian gets this look of feral cunning on his face wouldnt i be guilty anyway though he asks even if i was just there which i wasnt but if i was goddamn it dennis thinks if theres anything he hates its a halfintelligent skell with a little information law amp order has totally fucked up the interview room true dennis says but there are distinctions in terms of sentencing one of you gets life the other gets the cocktail which youre not going to think is a big distinction until they strap you down and then youre going to think it is because duane will still be eating meals and taking shits and jerking off and you well they say its painless but they say a lot of things dont they brian toughens up i dont know anything about those killings thats too bad dennis says because now you cant give me what i want he starts out the door then stops and turns if you havent already figured this out dennis says duane and the boys cant risk keeping you around youre saying theyre going to kill me no theyre going to give you a pony dennis says what the fuck you think theyre gonna do dipshit lado has kept one of them alive to watch the dissection of his friends and learn the man is naked and chained to a wall and now lado takes the point of the bloody knife and presses it into the mans stomach just enough to draw blood tell me now lado says anything the man sobs which guero what lado presses the knife a little harder which american agreed to the assassination of filipo sanchez the man gives it up raised in the slums of tijuana lado found many of his childhood meals in the garbage dumps that rose in his barrio like mayan temples when his father had work it was as a carnicero a butcher and when the family got meat it was usually a cabra a goat so he knows the sound of a goat when you slash its belly and thats what the man sounds like as lado lifts the knife through his guts int holding cell night crowe sits at the table as dennis comes in duane i want a lawyer dennis bad call but yours to make duane right dennis i know who youre going to calli think i have him on speed dialbut before you do you need to know that evidence isnt going to disappear the chain of custody isnt going to get fucked up maybe this guy can get ten years chopped off but so what duane i want a lawyer dennis then lets get you a phone loser what did you give them chad meldrun asks sitting across the table nothing crowe says dont jerk me chad says i need to know yeahduane knows who needs to know its been the deal forever you get busted with serious weight youre allowed to play certain cardsyou can give up locations of stashes safe houses you just tell the lawyer who tells the boys so they can move the stuff what you cant use to trade your way out are people you do that its a problem i gave them shit duane says go ahead and give them something chad says duane shakes his head they dont want it they just want the guys and you didnt do that how many times you need to hear it okay were good chad says no youre good duane says im fucked this was a setup the fucking fed is in bed with leonard leonard set us up if you knew that why did you do the deal i fucked up duane says i thought he was you know cowed and thirtyfive cents on the dollar shit okay okay chad says what about hennessy will he hold up duane shrugs we have another lawyer coming for him chad says hell get hennessy out on bail fuck him crowe says get me the fuck out of here im going to do my best cowboy im not a cowboy duane says irritably you see boots and a dumbass hat cowboy fuck your honor given the potential severity of the likely sentence assistant da kelsey ryan says the defendant is most definitely a flight risk we ask that bail not be set the da is a looker pretty blonde blueeyed and a killer verrrry ambitious dennis would like some of that chad meldrun stands up very interesting that chad showed up dennis thinks either duanes bosses are backing him up bigtime or they want him out of lockup where they can kill him your honor chad says smiling like hes about to say that night tends to be darker than day mr crowe has no prior drug arrests never mind convictions he has ties to the community and he owns a business you and i both know that this case doesnt even belong in federal courtthis is the government throwing its weight aroundand in fact im preparing a motion to have the case removed to the jurisdiction of the state of california where it belongs as we both know that motion has an excellent chance of success im going to request that you do grant bail and set it at a reasonable amount so that my client can continue to make a living and also fully participate in his own defense and hes going to do that from where costa rica ryan snaps that will be enough of that judge giannini says hes a flight risk your honor ryan repeats and may i remind the court that these charges include possession of a firearm while in the commission of a drug felony mr crowe is a danger to the public the gun was not in mr crowes possession chad argues it was found in the vicinity of mr crowes vehicle and had mr hennessys fingerprints on it mr hennessy is not mr crowe meldrun says ryan says may i also remind the court the court does not have alzheimers giannini snaps shes in a pissy mood dennis thinks good ryan keeps pressing this is not only a marijuana charge heroina schedule two narcoticis involved and in the vicinity of a school at one in the morning chad says throwing his arms in the air no jury is going to believe that mr crowe was attempting to sell to schoolchildren the law does not specify intent ryan answers proximity is sufficient chad turns and looks directly at dennis we have seen these shenanigans from agent cain before this is an old dog doing old tricks its an outrageous abuse of authority dennis smiles at him your honor ryan says agent cain is not on trial here he should be chad snaps this whole case is a setup from jump street your honor and i will argue entrapment the government has used a sofarunidentified ci to lure an otherwise innocent well produce the witness at trial ryan says giannini says lets get back to the point here i tend to agree that the weapons allegation will probably not survive judicial scrutiny as to mr crowe i also tend to agree that while the severity of possible penalties is an inducement toward flight mr crowes standing in the community and the fact that he owns a business are mitigating factors therefore im inclined to grant bail would the government like to suggest a figure ms ryan ten million dollars look at my face giannini says do i look like im in the mood for jokes ms ryan may i suggest or chad asks same answer chad but nice try giannini says im certainly not inclined to release mr crowe on his own recognizance but i do see a need for a serious deterrent toward flight you want to come down on your bid ms ryan one million bail is set at five hundred thousand dollars giannini says with mr crowes residence and business as security can you post the ten percent today mr crowe he can your honor chad says ill bet he can dennis thinks the boys want him out no question question is who are the boys you cut them loose ben asks theyre sitting in denniss car in the parking lot of albertsons in laguna we cant hold them on the murder dennis explains unless one flips on the other we have nothing ill go in ben says if thats the problem ill it wont do any good dennis says you cant put them on the scene and they have alibis if i go in and swear out a complaint against crowe for extortion the most you have on him is making a threat dennis answers you cant even tie him to the beating boland gave you never mind the murders so now what run what run ben because these guys are out and theyre going to kill you because as chon points out the justice system is more about the system than the justice maybe crowe and hennessy jump bail maybe they roll the dice with a trial on the drug charges maybe they take a chance on each others holding firm but the point is they have problems of their own now and so do the higherups someone paid a lot of money to spring crowe and hennessy for fear they might flip in the interview room but duane and brian still have good reasondoubledigit prison sentencesto trade up so the question is did they get them out to get them out chon asks ben or to get them out of the way the latter of which leaves two options crowe and hennessy jump bail and disappear or someone disappears them in either case the plan workeddrop crowe into the shit and see who throws a line but how do we track the line back one of ben and chons favorite movies is all the presidents men they can practically quote it well not practically actually driving back from bens meet with dennis they go into the routine hunts come in from the cold supposedly hes got a lawyer with in a brown paper bag the prices have gone up bob follow the money follow the lawyer who brought the money ben says somebody sent chad to bail crowe out hes going to report back to that somebody and he isnt going to do it over the phone can you do it bro chon asks follow him without getting seen without getting killed i think so ben says ill take the other line crowe and hennessy have to be freaking they know theyre on thin ice theyre going to reach out and up its a good situation chon thinks if crowe and hennessy had flipped on each other ben would have gotten his justice but it would still have left the higherups out there and they would have him killed better this way ben yeah keep your head down you too always recent evidence to the contrary notwithstanding duane crowe goes home long enough to pack a few things because this could go either way he folds his old guys rule shirt into the duffel bag and thinks about the phone conversation that was less than reassuring yeah we have judges but this is federal duane that makes it tough say you get twelveyou serve twelve you can do twelve ive done it youre still a young man when you get out im not a young man now duane thinks he grabs a couple of pairs of jeans out of a dresser drawer and throws them in the bag i have a daughter going to college i have tuition to pay i cant do one year never mind the cost of the trial the defense and thats just the drug charge the other thing is a problem if the other guy gets weak in the knees you fucked up you know with the girl its a problem yeah thanks a fucking heap tell me something i dont know just like the powers that be you work your ass off for them make them money and then when theres a problem they leave you on an island but duane gets the message the powers that be will take a chance on the drug charge but the homicides if i dont do something about brian theyre going to do something about me theyre going to clean housebrian leonard me if theyre not on their way already he puts the revolver in his pocket and heads out ben sits in his car and calls chad meldrun the bored toocoolforschool receptionist puts him on hold comes back on a few seconds later and says chad said to say he cant represent you anymore did he say why not conflicted you or him she hangs up but ben knows what he wanted to knowchad is in the office which works out because ben is in the parking structure all the presidents men o is conflicted as to what to wear she walks into her closet surveys the hangers full of clothes and tries to decide how to go sartorially speaking i mean what does the styleconscious south orange county princess wear to meet her father for the first time dress it up or caj it down go older or younger she thinks about a polkadot dress and pigtails but decides its waaaay too creepy because maybe paul patterson doesnt have a sense of satire or irony she looks at your basic little black dresslike look at what a lovely lady the daughter you threw away turned out to bebut worries about crossing the paperthin line between sophisticated and sexy she thinks about not going at all this is a girl who has stood in front of a vending machinetorn between f peanut m ampms and d famous amos chocolatechip cookiesfor fifteen minutes and then walked away with nothing rather than make a choice o knows she doesnt have that luxury here she has to wear something she cant just go naked as the day she was born as symbolically appropriate as that might be you might be able to walk naked in laguna without raising alarmor an eyebrowbut newport beach they dont get undressed to have sex you could get arrested in newport for wearing white after labor day okay this is getting you nowhere o thinks but maybe thats just where you should go maybe you should lie down fire up a blunt and forget it chon pulls over near crowes place up laguna canyon and looks at the driveway crowes car isnt there chon gets out slips his pistol into his waistband and goes to the front door its locked the man has taken off chon doesnt blame him but its a problem not a big problem but a problem chad no worries meldrun comes into the parking structure like he has a problem worries has that places to go people to see look on his face as he strides to his benz gets in and peels out ben follows him west on jamboree north on the pch all the way to the newport beach yacht club which figures ben thinks money is a pigeon it always finds its way home this is like republican central the party could hold its california convention right here and ben feels like he should have a visa to even get in a twenty slipped into the doormans palm are you a member sir no but he is is sufficient documentation but ben feels out of place and a little hostile as he makes his way through the lobby and watches meldrun go out onto the patio overlooking the harbor overlooking the yachts where on this late friday afternoon the elite are there to have a drink and to see and be seen bens working hard at being joe detective trying to blend into the crowd and still keep an eye on meldrun without being seen when he hears ben its a womans voice ben ophelias friend is that you ben panics momentarily because a he doesnt want to lose sight of chad and b he cant think of her actual name only paqu oh hi mrs he damn near says four its bennett now she says in a tone that manages to combine selfdeprecating charm with a warning not to push the subject indeed shes here cruising for his replacement four is about to become four mer mrs bennett shes statuesque sexy beautiful with all the genuine human warmth of an ice sculpture except ben remembers o swears that she will not melt o has watched the wizard of oz like twelve thousand times to get tips what brings you here paqu looks a little surprised as if she either cant understand why a friend of her daughters would be at the club or forgot that they let jews in now ben catches sight of chads back oh you knowfriday the patio paqu glances at his left hand yes it can be quite the place to meet eligible young ladies subtext youd better not be doing my daughter is o with you ben asks aware that if she is shes in handcuffs and leg irons because o would rather sip cat urine straight from the cat than iced tea with her mother on the patio paqu lets the o reference slide no i believe shes out seeking employment and i believe ben thinks that bin laden is hitting openmike night at the west akron holiday inn he watches meldrun go up to someoneben cant make out his facealong the railing bar what do you do paqu asks sorry what do you do ben paqu asks for a living im an environmental consultant ben says still unable to get a good look at who chad is talking to what does that mean it means i have to tell the irs something ben thinks when a big building or a complex is going up i advise the landscape architects what kinds of trees plants and grasses to put in that sounds fascinating paqu says very green is that the word thats one of them whats another she asks thats when ben realizes shes a little drunk bullshit ben tells her its all bullshit mrs b she looks him straight in the eyes aint that the goddamn truth ben yeah it is because some people move out of the way and ben sees who meldrun is talking to stan owearing a blue kneelength dresswalks up to the distinguished older home on balboa island and rings the bell when the man comes to the door she says hi would you be my sperm donor the man blinks and says could i just take three boxes of thin mints please brian hennessy opens the door of his apartment to a nasty surprise chon who lays a shotgun stock into the base of brians skull places ben would expect to see his father before he would expect to see him on the patio a republican national committee fundraiser dollywood wines r us a monster truck show rush limbaughs small intestine anywhere ben fucking reels turns and walks away the truth always comes home but not to his home when brian comes to hes ducttaped to a chair chon sits across from him what did i tell you chon says what did i tell you id do if you laid another hand on one of our people brian remembers the answer dont please say itwhat did i tell you that youd kill me did you think i was kidding no do you think im kidding now no please jesus im going to give you one motherfucking chance chon says one to tell me the truth if

in the canyon gets out of the car walks up to the door takes a deep breath and rings the bell what the fuck do they have to do with all this ben wonders for all their goofy reconstructedhippie bullshit theyre essentially kind loving people caring therapists good if overbearing parents it feels like it takes forever but his mother finally answers the door she looks shaken ben stan walks up behind her puts his hands on her shoulders and says ben what are you involved in what am i involved in ben asks what are you involved in they pull into the parking lot a warehouse complex in the canyon old c trains scattered around empty quiet crowes charger is already there chon lies on the floor of the van behind brian he pushes the shotgun barrel into the back of the seat you feel that brian it will go right through this seat into your spine the best you can hope for is a helper monkey i feel it pull up beside him and get out chon feels the van slow and then stop the door opens brian gets out crowe rolls down his window and shoots brian in the head i was aware patterson says that your mother married me for my money i was in my forties she was in her twenties and beautiful i

the middleaged father trying to keep up with a toddler but there was more to it i knew the marriage would never last and as a child of divorce myself i didnt want to inflict that on another child but you did o thinks i knew that she was unfaithful patterson says she would be gone for long unexplained hours she would take little trips i knew but i didnt want to know so i never pressed the issue until she informed me that she was pregnant with me o says patterson nods ben follows them into the study the walls lined with bookshelves filled with psychology texts sociological studies economic histories evidence of their belief that the truth of the world is contained in books if only you could read enough of them and the right ones now ben wants a truth that cant be found in books and says please i need to know we came here in the fresh bloom of our idealism diane explains we thought we would change the world bens about to object to the whole diamonds and rust monologue he senses is coming but then his mother starts talking about a guy giving away tacos chon watches crowe get out of the car and stand over brians body making sure theres not a lot of doubt brians lifeless eyes stare up at the moon and a pool of blood forms beneath his head chon slides the van door open and drops to the ground bellycrawls around until he sees crowe swinging his gun at the sound crowe sees him and fires but chon has already dropped into a low crouch cant shoot the man cant take a chance on killing him so he drops the shotgun lunges and tackles crowe at the waist driving him into the sand fiftyeight thousand fucking times he practiced on the sand south of here down on silver strand but hes weak now and rusty so he lets crowes gun hand come around as he tries to jam the gun barrel into chons head and the shot is deafening a roar like a big wave going off and chon feels the burn and his head roaring as he gets his knee up and drives crowes arm to the sand and traps it there but crowe is big and strong and he pounds his left fist into chons ribs then the side of his head bangs his hips up and bridges his back trying to buck chon off but chon slides up and gets his other knee on crowes left forearm and now he kneels on the mans arms feels the blood running hot down his face his pulse slamming in his neck and he takes his thumbs and presses them into crowes eyes chons forearms quiver with exertion hes trying to hold it until crowe screams and drops the gun and yells enough chon grabs crowes pistol and gets off him holding the gun on him crowe rolls onto his stomach presses his palms into his eyes and moans i cant see i cant see chon walks over to his shotgun and picks it up he feels blood seeping out of his left leg where the wounds have opened up from the fight when he comes back crowe is on his knees trying to get up chon kicks him back down presses the shotgun barrel into his neck who do you work for theyll kill me theyre not your worry right now chon says i am who do you work for crowe shakes his head chons out of wind and his leg starts to throb he says they wouldnt die for you crowe gives him a name it hits chon like a blow to the chest he leans over and says tell me the truth did you kill those two kids crowe nods chon pulls the trigger sorry ben he drags crowes body over by hennessys then puts the shotgun in hennessys hands and lays the pistol by crowes justice or revenge either way taking his knife chon cuts a strip off his shirt and presses it against the open wound on his leg then he notices that its raining what happened ben asks when diane finishes her story chon starts to run a steady disciplined trot its only six or seven miles nothing to it the rain grows heavier now thick heavy drops fall on his shoulders run down his side and his leg the blood mixes with the water john in my fathers house there are many mansionsif it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you what happened stan repeats to us to the country what happened when childhood ends in dealey plaza in memphis in the kitchen of the ambassador your belief your hope your trust lying in a pool of blood again fiftyfive thousand of your brothers dead in vietnam a million vietnamese photos of naked napalmed children running down a dirt road kent state soviet tanks roll into prague so you turn on drop out you know you cant reinvent the country but maybe you reimagine yourself you believe you really believe that you can that you can create a world of your own and then you lower that expectation to just a piece of ground to make a stand on but then you learn that piece of ground costs money that you dont have what happened altamont charlie manson sharon tate son of sam mark chapman we saw a dream turn into a nightmare we saw love and peace turn into endless war and violence our idealism into realism our realism into cynicism our cynicism into apathy our apathy into selfishness our selfishness into greed and then greed was good and we had babies ben we had you and we had hopes but we also had fears we created nests that became bunkers we made our houses babysafe and we bought car seats and organic apple juice and hired multilingual nannies and paid tuition to private schools out of love but also out of fear what happened you start by trying to create a new world and then you find yourself just wanting to add a bottle to your cellar a few extra feet to the sunroom you see yourself aging and wonder if youve put enough away for that and suddenly you realize that youre frightened of the years ahead of you what happened watergate irangate contragate scandals and corruption all around you and you never think youll become corrupt but time corrupts you corrupts as surely as gravity and erosion wears you down wears you out i think son that the country was like that just tired just worn out by assassinations wars scandals by ronald reagan bush the first selling cocaine to fund terrorists a war to protect cheap gas bill clinton and realpolitik and jism on dresses while insane fanatics plotted and bush the second and his handlers a frat boy run by evil old men and then you turn on the tv one morning and those towers are coming down and the war has come home what happened afghanistan and iraq the sheer madness the killing the bombing the missiles the death you are back in vietnam again and i could blame it all on that but at the end of the day at the end of the day we are responsible for ourselves what happened we got tired we got old we gave up our dreams we taught ourselves to scorn ourselves to despise our youthful idealism we sold ourselves cheap we arent who we wanted to be paqu lies on the sofa bottle of gin bottle of pills on the coffee table the effects on her face in her eyes she sees o come in and says you look uncharacteristically nice wheres four thats very amusing paqu says her words a little slurred four is gone i went and saw paul i told you not to i know but you did it

the double helix fates twisted around each other inseparable inextricable he knows his father would not have come unprepared to this feast because he wouldnt knows that his father cannot let it end here because he couldnt knows that he now has to do the one thing that will cost him more than he can pay and that he would never do for anyone not even himself but will do for ben go to his fathers house and ask for mercy int paqus living room night paqu takes a long sip of her drink and looks over the glass at o who stands there furious and determined paqu look at you my little girl all

courtyard where she still expects filipo to pull up in his car and twirl her in his arms buen viaje she says have a nice trip this guy john ben asks what did he look like why diane asks i need to know she rummages around until she finds a scrapbook opens it up and the results are almost comicalhis mom and dad as hippieslong hair leather fringesalmost as if theyre at a costume party diane turns to a picture of a bunch of people on the front steps of an old bookstore and points to a young man barechested and in jeans thats john she says i have to go his name was halliday paqu says and they called him doc and when he found out i was pregnant with you he put a gun to his head pulled the trigger and ruined the interior of a very expensive car i dont know if my pregnancy was the causal factor but

hennessy if hes succeeded the line leads to his own father ben cant let him do it he lets the phone ring and ring chon doesnt answer don winslow the kings of cool chons gassed out blood flows freely down his leg as he lumbers up the hill to johns house he stops down the street to catch his breath and recon the scene theres a car parked in the driveway and he can make out three men insidetwo in

almost amused crowe and hennessy are both dead you did us a favor john says they had to go anyway i thought you were out of the business and i didnt know you were in it john says he holds a hand up

halliday why ben tells him looong drive down through tijuana short on conversation whats there to talk about really old memories good times chon is more focused on something his father said back at the house i cant do what youre asking me to do i dont mean i wont i mean i cant why not pops down the old highway into baja past rosarito ensenada the old surfers run south into the empty country moonlit night sagebrush and the eyes of coyotes glowing green in the headlights they could do it anywhere here chon thinks by the side of the road in any ditch a seminal fuck and a terminal shot two bursts in the back of the head the lord giveth and he taketh away the old bill cosby jokei brought you into this world and i can damn well take you out of it you just disappear and thats all the crows take your eyes and the peasants take your shoes and commend your soul to god but who can say with any certainty that crows dont pray over carrion flesh they are the smartest of birds perhaps sensitivity comes with intelligence maybe they feel for the dead that sustain them hes trained for this moment of course escape and evade school a name so redolent with irony it makes him want to weep the second they open the door to take him out his muscle memory will take over but he knows that hes still weak from his wounds freshly injured by his fight with crowehis chances are bad but hell take the chancethe opportunityto bring more meat with him to the crows i can damn well take you with me the car turns off the highway onto a dirt road and chon feels his muscles stiffen and forces them to relax the old man has a gun which will be mine in the half second it takes to grab it shoot the gunman through the back of the seat then the driver then john he runs this film clip through his mind until its smooth and perfected and his body has memorized the sequence the car pulls off onto a narrower road and chon sees the glow of lights that must come from a house as they bounce up the rocky road to the top of a hill he sees that its more accurately a compound a high adobe wall snakes up and down the hillside shards of broken glass on top of the wall reflect off the spotlights two armed guards machine pistols slung over their shoulders stop the car in front of a wooden gate the driver says something to one of the guards in what sounds to chon like an eastern european language and the car goes through into the compound the house is large twostory of very basic rectangular mediterranean design the west windows look out over the bluff onto the ocean john gets out of the car dont try any of your special forces chopsake bullshit he says to chon its mexico you dont have anywhere to go chon isnt so sure about that he isnt so sure he couldnt kill the two guys in the car make it over the wall and walk the hundred or so miles through the baja desert the bigger problem is ben effectively a hostage maybe o too if shes with him he watches his father walk into the house leonard dennis says does your boy chon have a cell phone ben doesnt answer jesus christ dennis says for once in your life trust somebodyeven a narc does he have a cell phone ben doesnt name names he names numbers another guard opens the door for john john steps into the foyer as doc comes down the stairs yeah doc laguna beach john walks down ocean avenue toward the beach and feels strange strange to see the ocean strange to walk outside and not see coils of barbed wire and guard towers strange to not think about who is walking behind him and what they might want ten years in the federal lockup in indiana and now hes back in laguna a free man ten years of a fourteenyear sentence before the pardon came through but now hes outno parole officer bullshit no one to report to every time he wants to drain a beer or take a dump he walks over to the lifeguard tower then up the boardwalk roger bartlett is already there hi john roger says welcome home yeah and thanks for meeting me here roger says instead of

tenyearold stranger sitting on the couch taylor tosses him the keys says hes your kid now and walks out the door hasnt been back since and its been two weeks he looked at the kid and said hello john kid answered my name is chon fuckin little asshole and thanks for all the cards and letters and visits chon of course he puts that on taylor divorced him eighteen months into his stretch he signed the

john you dont want to cash me out john moves to a smaller house and puts chon into public school then he looks up an old buddy and goes back into the marijuana business and reaches out to another former associate to leverage thirty grand into three hundred g worth of product it takes time to lay that much off though time to get back in the market john was back in the dope trade for about three weeks when chon was walking down brooks street a car rolled up and a guy told him to get in they drove him to an old ranch out in hemet and kept him there until john paid what he owed three hundred k chon was out there for a month having a pretty good time looking at penthouse magazines sneaking roaches and driving an atv around the place then big john came to pick him up personally see how much i love you big john asked when they were in the car see how much i care chon answered holding up his middle finger big john slapped him across the face hard chon didnt fucking flinch a week later johns walking down the street when a car pulls up they tell him to get in and they drive him down to mexico way the fuck down past tj rosarito and ensenada down along the baja peninsula john is thinking hes going to get a bullet in the back of the head but then they pull up this hill then over the top and theres a big house surrounded by an adobe wall and they pull through the gate into the compound doc comes out the door no shirt baggy khaki cargo shorts huaraches hugs john like his longlost son you could have just called me john says would you have come no thats what i thought doc looks good for a dead man a few strands of white in the hair which has retreated off his forehead a few inches john hasnt seen him in over ten years not since the faked suicide and docs disappearance into the program

bruce springsteen independence day the room is big and perched on a bluff overlooking the ocean spotlights illuminate the beach and the breakers a foot trail runs from the compound down to the beach and john sees a quiver of longboards leaning against the wall of the deck doc wears a hawaiian shirt over an old pair of khaki shorts and huaraches a ball cap even though its night hes vain john thinks covering up the receding hairline hows life john asks life is the same doc says luxurious exile i surf i fish i grill the fish i watch shitty mexican tv i go to bed i get up at least once in the night to piss im not going to ask how life is with you things have gotten a little out of hand no shit doc asks doc has a deep tan that looks darker against his snowwhite hair it hangs down to his

he gets up im not even that sure hes my kid he walks out the door of all the corkers god pulled off in the old testament the real howler was abraham and isaac had the angels rolling on the floor moaning stop my ribs stop john opens the passenger door and says someone wants to talk to you see if we can work something out he takes chon into the house boland goes in with them to chon doc

turns to john shrugs and says maybe youre right maybe he isnt your kid no he is he pulls the pistol and shoots doc square in the forehead don winslow the kings of cool in the words of lenny bruce into the toiletfor good this time don winslow the kings of cool doc totters for a second a statue pushed off a plinth then falls and as he topples boland swings his glock up to blow john off the earth and would except the room goes suddenly black and there is only darkness and chaos chaos n from the greek kaos the formless or void state preceding the creation of the universe highly trained baja state policemen who know their work lados men blow the generator plunging the compound into darkness the only light now coming from the lamps on their helmets and the nightvision scopes on their rifles as their teammates blast a hole in the compound wall then they make small tight leapfrogging rushes toward the house one team covering the other as they move this is not a war in which prisoners are taken this is a war in which prisoners entrails are used as message boards so while the berrajano men defending the compound couldnt give a shit about doc they do give a shit about their own lives and so they fight like hell and theyre good all are veterans of mexicos long drug wars and some fought in bosnia congo chechnya they are in short survivors and now they fight to survive to get through another night to eat another breakfast smoke another cigarette fuck another woman hug their children drink a beer watch a futbol match feel the sun on their faces just get out of this dark cold night lado has other ideas other orders kill the man called doc who approved the assassination of filipo slaughter the berrajanos who guard him leave a message he gives terse commands but knows they are superfluoushis men know their job they have performed dozens of these missions they move forward in small knots firing short efficient bursts and the trained ear can distinguish the two sides by the firing patterns as some of the berrajanos fire from the wall and slip over to the outside to try to make their way through the chaparral to safety while others retreat into the house and fire from the windows hoping to make the house a fort where they can make a stand lado has no intention of allowing that hell take no unnecessary casualties but he will take necessary ones and now he sends men rushing to the main door with a satchel charge two fall in the exposed space in front of the door but one makes it leaves the satchel and crabscuffles away flattening himself to the ground as the charge goes off and shatters the heavy wooden door it hangs on its hinges like a drunk man leaning in the doorway as lados next team surges forward into the house don winslow the kings of cool schneider and perez come up the stairs at brooks street and find bens apartment perez sends schneider around the back and then goes to the door holding his pistol behind his back he rings the bell don winslow the kings of cool chon bellycrawls across the floor focusing his eyes fifteen degrees to the left cuts off the cones that try to distinguish colors and lets him see a little better in the dark just well enough to make out the form of boland lying on the floor his hands on his machine pistol chon reaches him throws one leg over the man as if mounting a horse and then rolls so that hes lying on his back with boland on his back on top of him chon gets his forearm across bolands throat his other hand locked behind his neck he wraps his feet around bolands ankles like a snake then arches his own back stretching boland out as if on a rack then he chokes him chons muscles strain and quickly tire as boland bucks and thrashes and tries to tear his arms away but chon holds on until bolands sphincter and bladder let loose and what was a man becomes a corpse chon takes the glock and feels better now that hes armed but armed against what against whom bullets zip over his head he hears them thunk into wood and plaster he hears shouts and groans and its all so familiar but hes used to being on the other end of this lethal equation on the outside coming in not on the inside trapped like a civilian a collateral casualty in a war between unknown adversaries he doesnt know a berrajano from a lauter theyre all mexicans to him hes in the dark figuratively as well as literally he only knows that this darkness gives him the chance to get the fuck out of there except he remembers that he isnt alone in this chaos and he makes out his father lying facefirst on the floor his forearms covering his head against the splinters of wood shards of glass flying around the pistol still in his right hand his finger reflexively tightening pulling the trigger shots going off at random the muzzle flashes bolts of red lightning chon thinks for a second his old man might kill him after all accidentally and he crawls over wrenches the gun from his hand sticks the barrel into the side of his fathers head and says call it off john fumbles in his pocket and pulls out his phone funny these days how life or death can come down to cell phone service ben opens the door and a guy is standing there with a cell phone in his hand hi ben says hey the guy says i must have the wrong place im looking for jerry howard i think you do have the wrong place sorry to bother you no worries chon yells over the din time to go do what i do and he starts to crawl his old man crawling behind him the general rule being if you can stay low you have a chance and the truth is we didnt walk out of the formless primordial ooze we crawled in the dark of course there is not sight but sound so follow the fight from the rhythm of its fire like most battles it doesnt end in a thundering crescendo but in sporadic spurts then desultory single shots then silence there is no climax just anticlimax or more properly speaking nonclimax lados men work their way through the house hallway by hallway door by door room by room methodically killing just as methodically dying and then its over chon makes it out into the courtyard his father crawling behind him there is a chance just a chance that they can get to the car and make a break through the chaos although chon hears the firefight dying down and knows that the confusion will quickly end and the window is closing but theres still a chance and hes just about to gather his legs under him and lunge for the car when the hears the chompchompchomp of the helicopter rotors and then the light hits him from above the searchlight from a helicopter hovering illuminating the scene of slaughter the light is blinding chon can barely see chokes on dust as the rotors whip up the dry dirt around him and he hears the amplified command in english freeze drop your weapons and stand up with your hands over your heads chon does it struggles through the wash to his feet drops his gun and raises his arms above his head sees john do the same looks around at a scene of execution as blackclad men dispatch the wounded with shots to the back of the head while others work on their own wounded the helicopter lands kicking up a whirlwind of dust a man gets out bending low beneath the rotors straightens up and walks toward them holding a badge ahead of him special agent dennis cain dea come with me please they follow him into the helicopter lado stands over docs body then bends over slices the dead mans stomach open pulls out his intestines and carefully forms them into the word papa magdas request sitting in the chopper before it takes off chon
