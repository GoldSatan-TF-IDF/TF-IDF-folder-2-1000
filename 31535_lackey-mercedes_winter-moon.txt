mercedes lackey dedicated to my fellow lunatics at wwwlunabookscom without whom i would be a great deal less sane dear reader the world i created for the five hundred kingdoms stories is a place where fairy tales can come truewhich is not always a good thing but it is important to remember that most people living in this world go about their lives blissfully unaware of the force that i call the tradition and its blind drive to send certain lives down predestined paths as long as their lives are not touched by the tradition as long as they do not find themselves replicating the story of some tale song or myth most people go about their business never even guessing that such a force exists such are the characters in this story moontide there is no mention of the tradition nor of fairy godmothers these folks have magic indeed but it is small magic for the most part do not underestimate the small magics however a great deal can be done with a very little magic at the right time and place and even more can be done with a heart full of courage and someone you can trust at your side mercedes lackey lady reanna watched with interest as moira na ferson took her chainmail shirt pooled it like glittery liquid on the bed and slipped it into a grey velvet bag lined with chamois it was an exquisitely made shirt the links were tiny and immensely strong moira only wished it was as featherlight as it looked your father doesnt know what hes getting back reanna observed cupping her round chin with one deceptively soft hand and flicking aside a golden curl with the other my father didnt know what he sent away moira countered just as her heavy coiled braid came loose and dropped down her back for the third time with a sigh she repositioned it again picked up the silver bodkin that had dropped to the floor and skewered it in place he looked at me and saw a cipher a nonentity he saw what i hoped he would see because i wanted him to send me far far away from that wretched place maybe i have my mothers moonmagic maybe im just good at playacting he saw a little bit of uninteresting girlflesh not worth keeping and by getting rid of it he did what i wanted candle and firelight glinted on the fine embroidered trim of an indigocolored gown and gleamed on the steel of the bodice knife she slipped into the sheath that the embroidery concealed but to send you here reanna shook her head what was he thinking exactly nothing i expect moira hid her leather gauntlets inside a linen chemise and inserted a pair of stiletto blades inside the stays of a corset im sure he fully expected to have a halfdozen male heirs by now and wanted only to find somewhere to be rid of me at worst and to polish me up into a marriage token at best he looked about for someone to foist me off onwhich would have to be some relation of my mothers since hes not on speaking terms with most of his houseand picked the one most likely to turn me into something he could use for an alliance you have to admit the countess has a reputation for taking troublesome young hoydens and turning out lovely women the ironic smile with which she delivered those last words was not lost on her best friend reanna choked and her pink cheeks turned pinker lovely women who use bodkins to put up their hair she exclaimed lovely women who peace moira cautioned perhaps the moonmagic had a hand in that too if it did well all to the good an entire matched set of ornate silver bodkins joined the gauntlets in the pack bundled with comb brush and hand mirror there can be only one reason why father wants me home now he plans to wed me to some handpicked suitor perhaps its for an alliance perhaps its to someone he is grooming as his successor in either case though he knows it not he is going to find himself thwarted i intend to marry no one not of my own choosing reanna rested her chin on her hands and looked up at moira with deceptively limpid blue eyes i dont know how youll manage that youll be one young woman in a keep full of your fathers men and the law in highclere says that no woman can be wed against her will not even the heir to a seakeep and the keep will be mine whether he likes it or not for i am the only child moira rolled wool stockings into balls and stuffed them in odd places in the pack she was going to miss this cozy room the seakeep was not noted for comfort i will admit i do not know yet what i will do when he proposes such a match but the countess has not taught me in vain i will think of something and it will be something clever reanna murmured and you will make your father think it was all his idea moira tossed her head like a restive horse of course she replied am i not one of her grey ladies moiras midnightblack braid came down again and she coiled it up automatically casting a look at herself in the mirror as she did so as she was nowwithout the arts of paint and brush she had learned from countess vrenableno man would look twice at her this was a good thing for a beauty had a hard time making herself plain and unnoticed but one who possessed a certain cast of pale features that might be called plain had the potential to be either ignored or to make herself by art into a beauty strange that she and reanna should have become such fast friends from the very moment she had entered the gates of viridian manor she so dark and pale and reanna so golden and rosyyet beneath the surface they were very much two of a kind both had been sent here by parents who had no use for them daughters who must be dowered were a liability but girls schooled by countess vrenable had a certain cachet as brides and often the king could be coaxed into providing an addition to an otherwise meager dower especially when the king himself was using the bride as the bond of an alliance which had also been known to happen to girls schooled by the countess both moira and reanna were the same age and when it came to their interests and skills unlikely as it might seem they were a perfectly matched set and both had two years ago been taken into the especial schooling that made them something more than the countesss fosterlings both had been invited to become grey ladies it sometimes occurred to moira that the difference between girls fostered with countess vrenable and those fostered elsewhere was that the other girls went through their lives assuming that no matter what happened no matter what terrible thing befell them there would be a rescue and a rescuer the grey ladies knew very well that if there was a rescue to be had they would be doing the rescuing themselves there was a great deal to be said for not relying on anyone but yourself youre not a grey lady yet reanna reminded her from her perch on the bolster of the bed thats for the countess to decide a polite cough beside them made them both turn toward the door in fact my dear the countess is about to make that decision right now no one took countess vrenable first cousin to the king for granted and it was not only because of her nearness in blood to the throne she was not tall yet she gave the impression of being stately she was no beauty yet she caused the eyes of men to turn away from those who were mere beauties it was said that there was no skill she had not mastered she danced with elegance conversed with wit sang played embroideredhad all of the accomplishments any wellborn woman could need and several more besides her hair was pure white yet her finely chiseled face was ageless some said her hair had been white for the past thirty years that it had turned white the day her husband the count died in her arms you are a little young to be one of my ladies child the countess said in a tone that suggested otherwise however this move on your fathers part holdspotential the older woman turned with a practiced grace that moira envied and began pacing back and forth in the confined space of the small room she shared with reanna i should tell you a key fact my dear i created the grey ladies after my dear husband died because it was lack of information that caused his death she paused in her pacing to look at both girls reanna blinked looking puzzled but too polite to say anything the countess smiled yes my children to most he died because he threw himself between an assassin and the king but the king and i realized even as he was dying that the moment of his death began long before the knife struck him we know that if we had had the proper information the assassin would never have gotten that far assassins feuds even warsall can be averted with the right information at the right time she passed a hand along a fold of her sable gown my cousin has kept peace within our borders and without because he values cunning over force but it is a neverending struggle and in that struggle information is the most powerful weapon he has as reannas mouth formed a silent o the countess turned to moira here is the dilemma i face there is information that i need to know in and about the seakeep of highclere and its lord but conflicting loyalties moira raised an eyebrow my lady i have not seen my father for more than a handful of days in all my life i know well that although my mother loved him he wedded her only to have her dower and it was her desperate attempt to give him the male heir he craved that killed her he cast me off like an outworn glove and now he calls me back when he at last has need of me i have had more loving kindness from you in a single day than i have had from him in all my life if he works against the king it is my duty to thwart him she met the countesss intensely blue eyes with her own pale grey ones there are no conflicting loyalties my lady i owe my birth to himbut to you i owe all that i am now what she did not and would not say was a memory held tight within her of the night her mother had died trying to give birth to the male child her father had so desperately wanted how her mother lay dying and calling out for him while he had eyes only for the son born dead how he had mourned that halfformed infant the full seven days and had it buried with great ceremony while his wife went unattended to her grave but for moira and a single maidservant she had never forgiven him for that and never would the countess held herself very still and her eyes grew dark with sadness my dear child i understand you and i am sorry for it reanna sighed not all of us are blessed with loving parents my lady she said the countesss lips thinned if you had loving parents child i would be the last person to remove you from their care she replied briskly and moira suddenly understood why she felt she had joined some sort of sisterhood when she came to foster under the countesss care none of them had been considered anything other than burdens at worst and tokens of negotiation at best by their parents which makes us apt to trust the first hand that offers kindness instead of a blow she thought which was of course a thought born of the countesss own training the countess taught them all to look for weaknesses and strengths and to never accept anything at its face value even the girls who were not recruited into the ranks of the grey ladies but then her mind added and it is a very good thing for all of us that milady is truly kind and truly cares because she had no doubt of that the countess cared deeply about her fosterlings whether they were grey ladies or not but it did make her wonder what someone with less scruples could accomplish with the same material to work on would that i had a year further training of you moira the countess said frowning just a little i am loath to throw you into what may be a lions den with less than a full quiver of arrows i am thrown there anyway moira replied logically my father will have me home and you cannot withhold me i would as soon be of some use and then something occurred to her which made the corners of her mouth turn up but i shall want my reward my lady oh so the countess did not take affront at this one fine eyebrow rose that was all should i find my father in treason his estates are confiscated to the crown are they not she asked well then as we both know your word is as good as the kings so should information i lay be the cause of such a finding i wish your hand and seal upon it that the seakeep of highclere my mothers dower remains with me slowly the countess smiled it was moira thought a smile that some men might have killed for because it was a smile full of warmth and approval i have taught you well she said at last better than i had thought well enough my hand and seal on it and if you can think thus straightly i believe you may serve your king and she took pen and parchment from the desk and wrote it out and you reannayou may hold this in surety for your friend she continued handing the parchment to reanna who waved it in the air to dry i think it best that you moira not be found with any such thing on your person moira and reanna both nodded moira because she knew that no one would be able to part reanna from the paper if reanna didnt wish to give it up reannawell perhaps because reanna knew that the countess would never attempt to take it from her all right child the countess said then i am going to steal you away from your packing long enough to try and cram a years worth of teaching into an afternoon in the end the countess took more than an afternoon and even then moira felt as if her head had been packed too full for her to really think about what she had learned the escort that her father had sent had been forced to cool its collective heels until the countess saw fit to deliver moira into their hands there was not a great deal they could do about that the countess vrenable outranked the mere lord of highclere seakeep the countess was not completely without a heart she did see that they were properly fed and housed but she wanted it made exquisitely clear that affairs would proceed at her pace and convenience not those of some upstart from the costal provinces but there was more here than the countess establishing her ascendancy for the lady never did anything without having at least three reasons behind her action the countess was also goading lord ferson of highclere seakeep seeing if he could be prodded into rash behavior holding on to moira a day or two more would be a minor irritation for most fathers especially since his men had turned up unheralded and unannounced in fact a reasonable man would only think that the countess was fond of his daughter and loath to lose her but an unreasonable man or a man hovering on the edge of rebellion might see this as provocation and he might then act before he thought as a consequence moira had more than enough time to pack and she had some additions courtesy of the countess to her baggage when she was done in the dawn of the fourth day after her fathers men arrived with their summons she took her leave of viridian manor as the eastern sky began to lighten she mounted a gentle mule amid her escort of guards and the maidservant they had brought with them she took the aid offered by the chief of the guardsmen not that she needed it for she could have leaped astride the mule without even touching foot to stirrup had she chosen to do sobut from this moment on she would be painting a portrait of a very different moira from the one that the countess had trained this moira was quiet speaking only when spoken to and in all ways acting as an ordinary well schooled maiden with no extra skills the rest of her personality would be decided when moira herself had more information to work with the reason for her abrupt recall had still not been voiced aloud so until moira was told facetoface why her father had summoned her it was best to reveal as little as possible that said it was as well that the maid was a stranger to her indeed it was as well that the entire escort was composed of strangers the fewer who remembered her the better this was hardly surprising she had been a mere child when she left and at that time she hadnt known more than a handful of her fathers menatarms by sight she had known more of the maidservants but who knew if any of them were still serving two wives her father had wed since the death of her mother neither had lasted more than four years before the harsh winters of highclere claimed them and neither had produced another heir of course fathers penchant for delicate little flowers did make it difficult for them tiny smallboned creatures scarcely out of girlhood were his choice companions timid and shy big eyed and frail as a glass bird moiras mother had looked like thatin fact if she hadnt wed so young too young moira now thought she might have matured into what moira was nowethereal in appearance but tough as whipcord inside she felt obscurely sorry for those dead wives she hadnt been there and she didnt know them but she could imagine their shock and horror when confronted by the winter storms that coated the cliffs and the walls of the keep with ice a palmlength deep she was sturdier stuff fifteen generations born and bred on the cliffs of highclere like those who had come before her pale and slender she might be but she was tough enough to ride the day through and dance half the night afterward so her mother still would be if shed had more care for herself the maidservant was up on pillion behind one of the guards there were seven of them three to ride before and three to ride behind with the seventh taking the maid and moira on her mule beside him they seemed competent well armed well mounted not friendly but that would have been presumptuous she looked up at the sky above the manor walls as they loaded her baggage onto the pack mule and sniffed the air a few weeks ago it had still been false summer the last golden breath of autumn but nownow there was that bitter scent of dying leaves and branches already leafless which told her the season had turned it would be colder in highclere and in another month at most or a week or two at worst the winter storms would begin it was a strange time for a wedding if that was what she was being summoned to are you ready my lady she glanced down at the guard at her stirrup who did not wait for an answer he swung up onto his horse and signaled to the rest of the group and they rode out without a backward glance not even moira looked back she had said her farewells last night if her fathers men were watching let them think she rode away from here with no regret in her heart they thought she rode with her eyes modestly down but she was watching watching everything it was a pity she could not simply enjoy the ride for the weather was brisk without being harsh and the breeze full of the pleasant scents of frost wood smoke and occasionally apples being pressed for cider the countesss lands were well situated and protected from the worst of all weathers and even in midwinter travel was not unduly difficult the mule had a comfortable gait to sit and if only she had had good company to enjoy it all with the trip would have been enchanting the guards were disciplined but not happy they rode without banter without conversation all morning long and it was not as if the weather oppressed them because it was a glorious day with only the first hints of winter in the air as they rode through the lands belonging to viridian manor there were workers out harvesting the last of the nuts cutting deadfall herding sheep and cattle into their winter pastures mostly singing as they worked the air was cold without being frigid the sky cloudless the sun bright and the leaves that littered the ground still carried their vivid colors so that the group rode on a carpet of gold and red there could not possibly have been a more glorious day and yet the guards all rode as if they were traveling under leaden skies through a lifeless landscape they stopped at about noon and rode on again until dark in all that time the guards exchanged perhaps a dozen words with her and less than a hundred among one another but when camp was made for the evening the maid at least was a little more talkative lord ferson had provided a pavilion for moira to share with the maid if it had been up to moira she would have been perfectly content to sleep under the moon and stars she felt a pang as she stepped into the shelter of the tent wishing she did not have to be shut away for the night she let the maid help her out of her overgown and sat down on the folding stool provided for her comfort while the maid finished her ministrations i have not seen highclere seakeep in many years moira said in a neutral tone as the maid brought her a bowl of the same stew and hard bread the men were eating have you served the lord long eight years milady the maid said she was as neutral a creature as could be imagined with opaque brown eyes like two watersmoothed pebbles that gave away nothing she was like nearly every other inhabitant of the lands in and around highclere very lean very rangy dark haired and dark eyed the seakeep had always provided its servants with clothing hers was the usual garb of an upper maidservant in winterdark woolen skirt laced leather tunic and undyed woolen chemiseand not the finer woolen overgown and bleached lambs wool chemise that moira recalled her mothers personal maidservant wearing so her father had sent an upper maid but not a truly superior handmaiden this was not necessarily a slight handmaidens tended to be young were often pretty and could be a temptation to the guards this woman old enough to be moiras mother plain and commonplace and entirely in control of herself and her situation was a better choice for a journey has the keep changed much in that time moira asked as she finished her meal and set the bowl aside it was a natural question and a neutral one the woman shrugged as she took moiras braid down from its coil and began brushing it needless to say the pins holding it in place were simple silver with polished heads not bodkins the keep never changes she replied my lady has fine hair it is my one beauty moira replied and my lord my noble father is well i am told he is never ill said the maid concentrating on rebraiding moiras plaits moira nodded this woman might not be a superior ladys maid but she was not rough handed he is a strong man the seakeeps need strong hands to rule them bit by bit she drew tiny scraps of information from the maid it wasnt a great deal but by the time she slipped beneath the blankets of her sleeping roll she began to have the idea that the people of highclere seakeep were not encouraged to speak much among themselves and even less encouraged to speak to outsiders about what befell the keep and that could be a sign that the lord of the seakeep was holding a dark secret if so then this was precisely what the countess vrenable of viridian manor wished to find out highclere seakeep was less than impressive from the road in fact very little of it was visible from the road the road led through what the local people called forest these were not the tall trees that surrounded viridian manor the growth here was windswept permanently bent from the prevailing wind from the sea and stunted by the salt the forest didnt change much no matter what the season it was mostly a dark nearly black evergreen she had never seen anywhere else but on the coast though the trees werent tall this forest hid the landwall and gatehouse of the seakeep right up until the point where the road made an abrupt turn and dropped them all on the doorstep and there was a welcome waiting which moira to be frank had not expected she had not forgotten what her home looked like and at least here on the cliff it had not changed a thick protective granite wall with never less than four men patrolling the top ran right up to the cliffs edge making it unlikely anyone could attack the keep from above there was a gatehouse spanning both sides of the gate which was provided with both a dropdown iron portcullis and a set of heavy wooden doors above the gate was a watch room connected with both gatehouses which could be manned even when the worst of storms battered the cliff both the portcullis and the wooden doors stood open and arranged in front of them was a guard of honor eight men all in her fathers livery of blue and silver with the highclere seakeep device of a breaking wave on their surcoats moira dismounted from her mulebut only after waiting for the leader of the honor guard to help her he bowed after handing her down from the saddle as the sea wind swept over all of them making the pennants on either tower of the gatehouse snap and blowing her heavy skirts flat against her legs there was ice in that wind and the promise that winter here was coming early a promise echoed by the fact that the trees that were not evergreens already stretched skeletal bare limbs to the sky welcome home lady moira the leader of the guard said bowing a second time the lord ferson awaits you in the hall below then take me to him immediately she said dropping her eyes and nodding her headbut not curtsying the head of the honor guard a knight by his white belt was below her in status she should be modest but not give him deference this was one of the many things she should have learnedand of course hadunder anyones fosterage she had no doubt that this knight would be reporting everything he saw to her father later the knight offered her his arm and she took it most ladies would need such help on the rest of the journey she and the knight led the way through the gates with the honor guard falling in behind the maid and her journey escort brought up the rear just inside the gates stood the stables and the upper guard barracks these were the only buildings visible just past them was the edge of the cliff and the sea she took in a deep breath of the tangy salt air for once there was no more than a light wind blowing this was home and despite everything she felt an odd sense of contentment settle over her as the knight led her courteously toward the cliff edge and the set of stairs only visible when you were right atop them that were cut into the living rock of the cliff and only when you looked down from that vantage did you see the seakeep itself it was built both on a terrace jutting out over the ocean and into the cliff itself the side facing the sea was six feet thick and needed to be for when the winter storms came those walls would shake with the force of the waves crashing against them and only walls that thick could prevent the keep from tumbling down into the foam today with the sun shining and the wind moderate the spray from the waves beating against the base of the cliff far below was nowhere near the lowest level of the terraceswhich in a storm would be awash from the highest terrace at either side were two walkways leading along the cliff these led in turn to the second reason for the existence of the seakeepsthe beacons it was the duty of the lord of each seakeep to man the beacons and keep them alight from dusk to dawn and during all times of fog and storm they warned ships away from the rocks and provided a guide to navigators in return because even the beacons could not protect every ship from grief the lords had salvage right to anything washed ashore it was from this salvage right that the lords obtained their wealth ships could and did sink even far out to sea ambergris and sea coal came ashore and also here at highclere true amber and jet seaweed and kelp were burned forwell here moira had to admit she didnt know precisely what they were burned for but apparently the ash was quite valuable and there were some types of kelp that were edible by people and animals shed had kelp soup hundreds of times it was one of her favorites other kinds made jelly superior to that made with calves feet when the tide went out the scavengers came out to scour the shingle and half of what they found was the property of the lord if a typical keep were to be set on its side its entrance facing upward that is how the seakeeps were built the stair led downward to the entrance a kind of hatchway with two enormous double doors which now were open to the sky and laid flat against the roof of the topmost tower with her knightly escort holding to her arm and walking on the outside of the stair moira descended the stair to the tower top and then passed into the keep itself inside the stair broadened and continued descending into the great hall there was only one set of windows in the great hallbecause the glass had to be very thick recessed into the stone and protected by an overhang on the sea side that set of windows stood in back of the lords dais so that the lord of the seakeep was haloed by light he had a fine view of whoever entered his hallbut to those who came down that stair or stood in the hall below he was nothing more than a silhouette moira was prepared for this of course she took only a glance to assure herself that her father was standing on the dais as she had anticipated then paid careful attention to her footing i suppose it must be father anyway i cant think who else would dare to stand there every step echoed in the vast hall and she was glad of her cloak because it was nearly as cold here as it was on the cliff with the sea wind blowing during a winter storm there were rooms in the keep that were nearly uninhabitable they were so damp and cold and even with a roaring fire in the fireplace more heat was sucked up the chimney than went into the room at last she reached the floor and her escort immediately let go of her arm he released her so quickly in fact that it was rather funny was he afraid her father would be offended if he held to her arm a heartbeat longer than absolutely necessary moira kept her expression sober however lord ferson would not find it that amusing she walked with her head up and her eyes on the dais between two of the long rough wooden tables that would hold anyone of any consequence here in the keep at meals well except for the kitchen staff but everyone else except for the very lowest of bound serfs ate in the great hall lord ferson liked it that way he wanted his people under his eye three times a day moira wasnt quite sure why that was perhaps he thought it would be harder for anyone to foment rebellion undetected with the lord of the keep keeping a sharp eye out for the signs perhaps it was only because he enjoyed all the trappings of his position and those trappings included having his underlings arrayed before him on a regular basis she had been very young and entirely unschooled in reading men when she had left and memory as she had come to understand was a most imprecise tool when it was untrained but except for those times when lord ferson had shared his position with a spouse he had never in her memory had another person on the dais with him and as her eyes adjusted to the light just before she sank into a deep curtsy she realized with a sense of slight shock that he had someone up there with him now standing deferentially behind him there was something odd about the second persons silhouette as if he was standing slightly askew and what do you make of the wench kedric shes learned some graces at least her fathers voice hadnt changed much except perhaps to take on a touch of roughness probably from all the years of shouting orders over a roaring ocean it was still deep still resonant and still layered with hints of impatience and contempt moira remained where she was deep in her curtsy head down comely my lord and graceful obedient and respectful this was a new voice presumably that of the man who sat at her fathers feet not much higher but smoother and definitely softer a much more pleasant voice to listen to graceful that ill grant and its as well since i sent her away an awkward halffledged thing obedient and respectful so it seems but comely stand up girl look at me girl can it be that he doesnt remember my name moira raised her eyes and stood up lord ferson had thickened a bitnot that he was fat but he no longer had a discernible waistline there was grey in his black hair and beard and lines in his face he peered down at her with a faint frown hands on hips comely no properly groomed neat seemly but pale as the belly of a dead fish so girl what have you to say to your father of that i am as god made me my lord she replied in an utterly neutral tone of voice oh a properly modest maidenly and pious response lord ferson barked what might have been a laugh had it possessed any humor at all and i suppose you wonder why i brought you home dont you girl my lord will tell me when he feels it is needful for me to know she said dropping her eyes as much to keep him from reading her dislike of him as to feign maiden modesty another proper answer youve been taught well that ill grant lord ferson snorted you menreport back to your captain go on kedric escort the lady to her chambers youll be joining us at dinner as is the custom daughter yes my lord she replied and dropped another curtsythis one not nearly as deepas the man dressed in fools patchwork motley though oddly enough it was patterned in blackandwhite rather than colors descended from the dais at her fathers orders he offered her his arm and she took it examining him through her eyelashes he was just as pale as she though she couldnt tell what color his hair was under the fools hood that covered his head for a fool he had a strange air of dignity and of melancholy though one didnt have to look much past the hunched shoulder to understand the reason for the latter he also was not very talljust about her heightand quite slender with long sensitivelooking hands there did seem to be something wrong with his shoulder he wasnt a hunchback but it did seem to be slightly twisted upward perhaps an old injury if you will come with me my lady moira he said with a slight tug on her hand he truly had a very pleasant voice low and warm certainly though i know the way she replied as he guided her to the door beneath the stair that led deeper into the keep but he shook his head you are not to be quartered in your old chamber my lady he said directing her down another stair this one a spiraling stone stair cut into the rock of the cliff that she knew well lit by oil lamps fastened to the wall just above head height at intervals you have been given new quarters from those you remember the old nursery chamber would not suit your new stature she bit off the question she was going to askand what is my stature it was best to remember that she needed to tread as carefully here as if she was in an enemy stronghold because if the king and the countesss suspicions were correct she might be what is my disposition to be then she asked instead you are to have the keep ladys suite for now came the interesting reply interesting because as long as lord ferson had evidenced any intention of remarrying he had kept those rooms vacant so if he was putting her in them now did it mean that he was giving up the notion of taking another wife or was it simply that the keep ladys suite was the most secure almost impossible for anyone to break into or out of it had one window which provided light to the inaptly named solar and that one was tucked into a curve of the keep so that all one could see from it was the cliff face and a tiny slice of ocean from the window it was a sheer drop six stories down to jagged rocks and the water the rest of the suite like this stair was carved into the rock of the cliff and never saw daylight moira had once overheard fersons second wife tell the handmaiden she had brought with her that it was like living in a cave at least it was not as drafty in a storm as some of the rest of the rooms and the chimney always drew well no matter what the weather i regret that no handmaidens have been selected for my lady as yet kedric was saying as he gestured that she should precede him through the narrow door at the bottom of the stair i fear my lady will be attending to the disposition of her own possessions lady violettas handmaiden departed upon lady violettas death and no suitable person has been found for my lady moira interesting that he would know that the comings and goings of servants were not usually part of a fools purview i hardly think i will fall into a decline because i need to unpack for myself she said drily the countesss fosterlings usually took care of each other however if no one objects i would not be averse to having the woman who attended me on my journey as my servant i will inform the seneschal who will be greatly relieved my lady kedric replied my lord is reluctant to bring in outsiders nearly as reluctant as they are to serve here life in a seakeep is not an easy one she said automatically as they traversed the long corridor of hewn stone that would end in the keep ladys rooms their steps thank heavens did not echo here the corridors and private rooms were carpeted with thick pads of woven sea grass or no one would ever have gotten any sleep in this place there was an entire room and four serf women devoted to weaving seagrass squares and sewing them into carpets which were replaced monthly in the areas inhabited by the lord and his immediate family and whatever guests he might have not that the carpets so replaced went to wastethere was a steady migration of the carpets from one area of the keep to another until at last they ended up in the kennels and the stables as bedding for hounds and horses and as kedric courteously opened the massive wooden door into the keep ladys quarters for her she saw that one or another of her fathers wives had made still another improvement for the sake of comfort there were woolen carpets and fur skins atop the seagrass carpets and hangings on all of the stone walls the windowone of the few besides the one in the great hall that had glass in it a construction of panes as thick as her thumb and about the size of her hand leaded together into a frame that could be opened to let in a breeze when the weather was fairwas closed and moira went immediately to open it the hinges protested and she raised an eyebrow evidently lady violetta hadnt cared for sea air i should like those oiled as soon as possible please she said briskly if kedric wasas he seemed to betaking responsibility for her for now then he might as well get someone in here to do that too do you know if my things have been brought down yet i presume so my lady kedric replied if my lady will excuse me i will see that the seneschal sends the servant you require something in his tone of voice made her turn and smile at him impulsively thank you kedric yours is the first kindly face and voice i have seen or heard since i left viridian manor he blinked as if taken entirely by surprise and suddenly smiled back at her you are welcome my lady he hesitated a moment then went on i have fond memories of countess vrenable she is a gracious lady interesting how is it that you came into my fathers service she asked now that there was no one to overhear when i knew him he was not the sort of man to employ your sort of fool he raised a sardonic eyebrow at her wry twist of the lips and by this you imply that i am not the usual sort of fool you would be correct i was in the kings service until your father entertained him a year or so ago your father remarked on myusefulness as well as my talents i believe he found my manner of jesting to his liking and what manner of jests are those she asked she knew her father foolery did not amuse him the feebleminded infuriated him but witat the expense of others the king was wont to say that my wit was sharper than any of his knights swords and employed far more frequently the corner of his mouth twitched perhaps he tired of it more likely his knights did and he wearied of their complaints my lord ferson finds it to his liking he shrugged at any rate when he admired my talents the king offered him my services and he accepted like many another who serves a fool cannot pick and choose his master now here moira had to school herself carefully for she had never ever known the king to dispose of anyone in his retinue in such a cavalier fashion so either kedric the fool had egregiously overstepped both the bounds of his profession and the kings tolerance or or the king had carefully planned all of this in order to plant the fool in her fathers household someone had certainly sent the information that had led to countess vrenable asking moira to spy on her own father could that someone have been kedric when you say talents i assume this means you exercise more than your wit she asked carefully if he was indeed an agent of the king he was not about to give himself awayyet i am a passable musician and your father did not have a household musician i have a wide fund of tales and at need i can play the scribe and secretary and i am useful for delivering messages to his underlings since there are no pages here either he shrugged as you see i am about to do for you if my lady will excuse me she tried not to allow a chill to enter her voice after all even if he was an agent of the king why should he trust her he could not yet have heard from his master that she was the countesss eyes and ears so far as he knew she was no more than what she seemed to be a girl schooled in fosterage who had no notion of what the grey ladies were and if in fact it was difficult for him to send and receive information he might not learn this for weeks or even months not to mention that if he was not the kings manif in fact he had been dismissed from the kings service to enter lord fersonsthere was no reason on earth why he should have responded to that little opening with anything other than the statements hed made she needed to remember to walk cautiously i do indeed excuse you kedric and i thank you for your help she smiled again though this time it was with a touch of sadness i hope you will not decide to exercise your wit at my expense though i am certain my father would enjoy the results he had begun to turn away but he turned back at that and his expression had darkened my lady he said with what she was certain was carefully controlled anger can be absolutely certain that i will not abuse my talent in such a way and then he was gone leaving her to stand dumbfounded staring at the closed door what could have brought that particular comment on it was very nearly an outburst there was only one thing she was sure of now lord ferson might enjoy the wit and company of his fool but his fool did not care in the least for lord ferson she was actually rather pleased that the maid did not turn up until after she had put her own things away one of the countesss lessons for all her girls and not just wouldbe grey ladies was in how to contrive hiding places for things one did not want found it didnt take a great deal of work just a very sharp and exceedingly strong knife most chests were never moved from where they were set working at the bottom one could remove one or more of the boards and create a hiding place between the bottom and the floor the backs of wardrobes could often be removed as well and often enough there were panels that had not been intended to conceal but which could usually be removed and objects put behind them by the time the maid appeared her chain mail sword and knives were all carefully hidden away as were a few things that the countess had entrusted her with when the woman turned up at her door there was nothing visible that should not have been in the luggage of a wellborn and proper young woman my lady has been busy the maid said blinking a little in surprise i am well used to tending to my own things she told the woman i suppose it is not fitting that i should do so now that i am grown but i saw no need to sit with folded hands and wait for someone to come to deal with my belongings i will tend to all such matters from now on my lady the woman replied though moira thought she saw a brief glimmer of approval you are correctit is not meet that you should be doing the work of a servant now that you are a lady and as if to emphasize that she proceeded to bustle about the room checking the contents of every chest and the wooden wardrobes this made moira doubly glad that she had taken the precaution of stowing away anything she didnt want the woman to find that did not take long and perhaps it was only that the maid wanted to be sure where moira had put things in order to understand where they were to be kept soon the maid was helping her out of her traveling gown and chemise wrapping her in a woolen robe and tending to her hair do you know if lady violetta left any finework stores behind she asked as the maid made a better job of combing out her hair than had been possible in a tent lit by a single small lantern i can find out the maid said shall i bring anything of the sort here for your use please and you do have a name dont you she added feeling impatient all at once with this nonsense of treating a servant like a nonentity that might do for her father but it did not suit her she had known the names of every servant she came into contact with at viridian manor it was one of the little niceties that the countess had insisted on anatha the maid responded sounding surprised milady then anatha if you would be so kind as to find whatever fancywork and supplies any and all of my fathers wives might have left behind and bring them to my solar i would be most appreciative she turned her head slightly so as to meet the maids eyes as you know i brought nothing of the sort with me such finework as we did was done for the countess and her household i wish my lord father to be aware that i am not idle and i am well schooled very well my lady anatha nodded if i may suggest the blue wool for dinner my lady so shes not entirely unfamiliar with what a ladys maid is supposed to do good the blue wool it is she replied anatha was entirely at a loss when it came to selecting jewelry and accessories however it was moira who selected the silver circlet for her hair the silverandchalcedony torque and rings and the silverplaque belt but her cosmetic box was hidden away and she was not going to get it out until she knew what her father was up to she had no intention of doing anything to enhance her looks the jewelry however she felt she needed to wear similar sets had come regular as the turning of the year every birthday and every christmastide although she had seldom worn any of it at viridian manor the chest that it was all contained in made for a substantial weight for these were not insignificant pieces and she had the feeling that her father assumed she was wearing it all as a kind of display and reminder of his wealth and importance the fact that it had probably all come to him as gleanings from wrecks was something she had preferred not to think too much about clasping the necklets torques and necklaces around her throat sometimes made her shiver as at the touch of dead mens fingers there but lord ferson would expect her to wear it now and might be considerably angered if she failed to do so this was not the time to anger him twilight was already falling and the torches and lanterns had been lit by the time she went up to the great hall there was no signal to announce dinner as there was at viridian manor but she took her cue from anathas behavior as to when to leave the moment the maid began to look a bit restless and just a touch apprehensive she had asked for a lantern to light the waynot all the halls were well lit and even when they were when storms blew up torches and lamps blew out the lamps in the seakeeps burned a highly flammable and smokeless fish oil from the little ones of the sort anatha carried to the huge beacons above the rocks it didnt matter how the beacons smelled but at least the lamp oil was scented with ambergris and had a pleasant perfume shell plates thinner than paper and nearly as transparent as glass sheltered the flame from drafts anatha followed her holding the lantern high and moiras shadow stretched out in front of both of them moira took a light mantle remembering how cold some of the hallways and the hall itself got and as she made her way upward the nowsilent maid a few paces behind she was glad that she had the wind had picked up and many of the staircases as she well recalled acted like chimneys with a whistling wind streaming up them the great hall was halffull a fire roared in the fireplace and an entire deer roasted on a spit above it that alone told her that however little her father seemed to regard her this evening was significant meat for the entire company was a rarity the usual fare at dinner here was shellfish chowder and fish baked in salt for the common folk they tasted meat three or four times a year at most moira was used to the order and discipline that held in the great hall at highclere and the same was true of viridian manor it had come as something of a surprise to her to hear of brawling and quarreling at the lower tables of other great houses that discipline still held as she entered the hall there was no great change in the sound level the steady murmuring continued and those who were already here kept to their seats though most craned their necks to look at her those who were still on their feet bowed with respect toward her before taking their seats on the long benches strict precedence was kept there were choice seats at the tablesnearest the fire for the lowly and nearest the high table for those with some pretension to rank but the one thing that struck her after her long absence was that beneath the sound of restrained voices there was no music the countess had musicians and her own fool to entertain during meals and sometimes the services of traveling minstrels and entertainers that had never been the case at highclere since her father had taken over on occasion lord ferson would call for a wrestling contest or the like at the final course or when the women retired and the men sat over wine and ale but traveling entertainers were few and only appeared in summer and he had kept no entertainers of his own until now and it was quite clear as she approached the dais and the high table that he had not much changed his habits he might have a fool but the man was not making merry for the company nor was there precisely entertainment to be shared by high and lowborn alike kedric was sitting on a stool on the dais to one side of the table fingering a lute but not singing it wouldnt be possible for anyone more than ten paces from the table to hear the soft music lord ferson was already in his seat though nothing had been served as yet moira approached the table and went into a deep curtsy in front of his seat but this time she kept her head up and her eyes on him and rose at his gesture take the keep ladys seat girl he said we have guests but theyve not yet come up she did as she was told moving around the side of the table that kedric was sitting atbut before she sat down she took the pitcher of wine from the table and poured her fathers cup full she waited until he took it with a raised brow for the courtesy then filled her own and sat in her chair there were chairs at the high table another touch that showed the difference between the low and the high the high need not rub elbows and jostle for room at their dinner serving the keep lord his wine was of course the keep ladys duty unless he had a page which ferson did notand it had also been a test she suspected to see just how well schooled she was if so she had passed it guests my lord she said in an inquiring tone this was a surprise and not a particularly pleasant one on the whole she really would rather not have the duty of being a hostess thrust on her so soon and she could not help but feel that these guests might well have something to do with a marriage probably hers youll see he replied simply and a moment later there was a bit of a stir at the door and she did indeed see and as soon as she did she had to fight to keep herself from stiffening up all over striding into the hall as if he were the right and proper lord here was a tall lanky saturnine man with a neat trimmed beard and a long face the trouble was that even if moira had not recognized the emblem embroidered on his oddly cut and brilliantly scarlet quilted silk surcoatwhich she didshe would have known by the styling of the garment by the voluminous ochre silk breeches and wrapped ochre sash instead of a belt the pointedtoed boots and by the matching ochre scarf tied about his head ornamented at the front with a topaz brooch that was worth if not a kings at least a princes ransom that he was from the khaleemate of jendara and by the sigh of the phoenix rising from the flames embroidered on his surcoat he was the eldest son of the khaleem himself there was just one small problem with this scenario not to put too fine a point on it the khaleem was a pirate his ships had been preying on this kingdoms merchants and navy for the past two hundred years at least and the only reason that outright war had never been declared between the two countries was that the khaleem always disavowed any knowledge of the piracy and would on occasion make a show of attempting to root out the problem raids would cease for a few seasons then it was business as usual she had been expecting many possibilities this was not one of them and as kedric fumbled three notes of the song he was playing the fool was just as surprised and shocked at the identity of their guest behind the khaleems son came three more men all of them were as richly dressed as he in blue ochre and green but their surcoats told those who had eyes to read them that these three were great captainshigh of rank to be sure but barely more than servants when compared to their leaders son lord ferson was standing moira remained seated which was perfectly proper no jendaran would pay the least bit of attention to a mere female anyway so it hardly mattered what she did welcome to my hall and table massid her father said in that booming voice as the man stopped at virtually the same place moira had and made a slight bow of his head with his wrists crossed over his chest it did not escape moiras attention that heavy gold cuff bracelets adorned those wrists lord ferson gestured to a servant who brought a plate with half a loaf and a small bowl on it he offered it to massid who tore off a small piece dipped it in the salt and ate it then offered it to the other three jendarans who did the same the ceremony of bread and salt sosuddenly my father and these people have a truce that truce would not bind anyone but massid and the three captains with him of course and if the khaleem chose to attack the seakeep at this very moment by his way of thinking he would be violating no pledge but he would be mad to try only a fool who wanted very much to die would attack a seakeep with less than a hundred ships and even then it would take a moon maybe two to conquer it unless of course a storm blew up at which point the battle would be over and anyone not inside the walls would be dead moira cast her eyes down to her empty plate but watched all this through her lashes so stunned for the moment that she fell back on the default expedient of appearing quiet and withdrawn massid of jendara here what could it mean whatever was toward her father was acting as if this pirate was an old and trusted ally he gestured to the chairs on his left the opposite side to which moira was sitting and the four men took their places with massid sitting closest to lord ferson this seemed to be the signal for service for servants came hurrying through the doors from the kitchens laden with the serving stones this was an innovation moira had never seen anywhere else nor heard of being used except in the seakeeps it was a long way through cold hallways from the kitchens of highclere seakeep and a very long time ago the lords of the keep had gotten decidedly weary of eating their food stone cold so what came through the doors first at each meal were teams of men carrying boxes full of round stones from the beaches below those stones had been heating in and around the ovens all day once the boxes were in place around the perimeter of the hall the food came in baskets of bread huge kettles of shellfish soup and stewed kelp roasted vegetables all the courses needed for a full formal dinner all of these were placed on the hot stones to keep them warm throughout the meal and only then did the actual serving begin anywhere else smaller bowls and platters of food would be brought to the tables from the kitchens here those smaller platters were served from the food left warming in the stone boxes at the sides of the hall the trencher bread was served first to act as a plateand as part of the mealfor those who were not of the high table then bowls of shellfish soup were brought to the tableswooden bowls for those at the low tables silver for those at the high lord ferson had never stinted the appetites of his people until the kettles were empty anyone could have as much of the common food as he wished and after a long day of work in the cold appetites were always hearty this was one of moiras favorite foods but she had little taste for it tonight and this is what lord ferson asked massid with interest as the bowl was placed before him without waiting for an answer he dipped his spoon in it and tasted it of course he wasnt worried about poisonhed seen himself that everyone was served from the same common kettles interesting he said after the first cautious taste it could do with saffron but he dipped for another spoonful quite tasty i shall have spices sent to your kitchen with instruction to their use saffron among them i believe you will find it improves an already excellent dish most gracious of you prince ferson replied managing to sound gracious himself given that he had no interest whatsoever in what he was given to eat so long as it wasnt raw or burned instructions would be wise i have never heard of nor tasted this saffron and i fear my cook would be at a loss to deal with it more precious than gold i promise you moira could not see massid from where he sat though she had the uneasy feeling that he was staring in her direction though not so precious asother things without a doubt that was intended to be a compliment directed at her and although she wished profoundly that she could call it a clumsy one in all truth it was courtly and elegant and she only wished she could appreciate it massid was not uncomely he was courteous and if only he wasnt the prince of jendara but he was and the king could never have approved of this or she would have been informed so this was all happening without the kings knowledge treason very probably why else keep the knowledge of this little visitand what moira could only assume was going to be a marriage proposal and alliance with lord ferson of highclere seakeepfrom the king this was bad this was very very bad and she had absolutely no idea what to do about it whatever curiosity those at the lower tables had about the visitor was completely overshadowed by the slices of venison laid on their trenchers the high table had a full haunch which ferson himself carved but even the least and lowest got some bit of meat and the drippings that had been thriftily saved during the cooking poured over his bread nothing in the conversation of their superiors could possibly compete with that her father and the prince continued to make polite conversation throughout the rest of the meal which moira ate without tasting it was no more than polite conversation however with no hints of what was being planned there was talk of how the weather had affected shipping this past summer and how soon the storms would start massid spoke largely of falconry her father of coursing hounds against stag and boar and if there was a code in any of that she couldnt decipher it by the time the sweet course came in and the betrothal announcement she had dreaded throughout the entire meal never materialized she felt a little of her tension ebbing only a little but evidently there was going to be some negotiation going on before she was handed over which was going to give her the chance to think calmly about her situation and perhaps do something about it or at least so she hoped when the wine came in after the sweet course and all but the highestranked men in the keep departed for their duties or their beds moira rose as her father had probably expected her to do and made the formal request to retire with her ladies she didnt have any ladies of course but that was the traditional phrase and her father deep in some conversation with massid and his captains about horses absently waved his permission she left the hall without a backward glance although once again she felt massids eyes on her until the moment she left the room and it was all she could do not to run back in her chambers after anatha had helped her disrobe and she had gotten into bed she stared up at the darkness beneath the canopy of the huge bed with only the firelight winking through the places where the bed curtains hadnt quite closed for illumination she needed to calm her mind or she wouldnt be able to think she heard the distant sounds of walking but nothing nearby so at least there wasnt a guard on her door obviously her father didnt expect her to do anything that an ordinary lady of the sort hed been marrying wouldnt dosuch as go roaming the halls seeing what she could overhear not yet i want to save that for when i need to do it first above all else she needed to get word to the countessand thus the kingof massids presence here that wouldnt be as difficult as getting detailed information out she did have a way to do that immediately though shed hoped not to have to use it unfortunately the communication would be strictly oneway unless the countess in her turn found a way to get a messenger to physically contact moira there would be no way that she could get any advice from her mentor she closed her eyes and tried to reckon how likely that would be and could only arrive at one conclusion swine would be swooping among the gulls first with the prince of jendara here lord ferson would be making very sure that no one traveled into or out of his realm without his express knowledge and permission and that would only be given to those whose loyalty he could either trust or compel in past years once past all hallows eveand that night had come and gone while she was en routethere had never been so much as a hint of traveling entertainers or peddlers it wasnt just that the winter weather along the coast was harshwhich it was once winter truly closed in the forest between the seakeep and the rest of civilization became dangerous with storms and hungry wild animals it wasnt worth the risk for an uncertain welcome at a place where if you were truly unfortunate you could be trapped until spring came any socalled minstrel or peddler who showed his face now would simply not be permitted past the gates at the top of the cliff because her father would be sure he was a spy so she was on her own here given that what were her possible choices it had been a long time since she had lived here but some knowledge never completely faded there was a sound in the waves below that warned that sheand the princehad only just arrived ahead of the bad weather storms far out to sea sent echoes of their anger racing ahead of them in the form of surging waves and anyone who lived at a seakeep learned to read those waves so the prince would be here till spring whether or not he had planned to be the first of her options that came to mind was the most obvious marry the prince she ignored the finger of cold that traced its way down her spine at that thought and she looked that choice squarely in the face she could marry the prince in obedience to her father then what well the jendarans did not have a very good reputation when it came to treating women like anything other than property to be sequestered away from the eyes of all other men if he regarded her in the same light as a jendaran bride shed find herself confined to these rooms with a guard on the door never seeing anyone but her maid except during massidsconjugal visits not that she was particularly afraid of those but being confined to two rooms with no company but a maid would drive her mad although the traditional guard is a eunuch i dont think he brought one with him and i dont foresee anyone of the keep men volunteering for the operation it would also leave massid and her father free to do whatever it was they were planning without anyone at all able to discern what it was then when spring came and the sea calmed enough to travel on massid would probably send her back to jendara which would be even worse shed be a captive among his flock of wives and concubines none of whom would speak her language all of whom would probably be hostile if she wasnt driven to insanity by such imprisonment one or more of them would probably try to poison her out of jealousy if massid showed the slightest bit of preference for her travelers tales of war among the women of a jendaran chareen might be partially apocryphal but where there was smoke there was usually flame somewhere about not a good option for herself or her king next choicetry to escape she wouldnt get more than a single chance at that and she would need to be very careful about the timing i wont get a chance at all once theres a wedding so it will have to be before then if i try it that much she was sure ofor at least she wouldnt get a chance unless something completely catastrophic happened that threw the entire keep into an uproar and removed the probable guard from her door so any attempt would have to take place after she learned as much as she could but before a wedding the autumn and winter storms were on their way and both ferson and massid must be as aware of that as she was so whatever her father and the prince were planning was probably intended to take advantage of the storms but those same storms would also make getting to and from the keep from the landward side quite difficult not impossible but it took a very determined traveler to brave the wind snow and above all the ice storms that pounded the coastline by winter if she was to escape shed have to plan things to a nicety and she would have to have a great deal of luck the closest place likely to take her in was one of the two nearest seakeeps but there was no telling whether or not ferson was including the lord of lornetel and the lord of mandeles in his plans if she fled to either of them she might find herself handed back over so the safest direction to flee would be inland and it would take her at least twice as long to get to another inland keep as it would to get to the nearest seakeeps escape was not a good option it might be the only one but it was not much better than going through with the wedding whatever the king and countess suspected it was nothing like this or surely theyd have given her more warningsand more of the sort of arcane aid that resided beneath the floor of the wardrobe nevertheless there had been a lot of thought put into this plot whatever it was he must have been planning this for a whilebut not for too long or he would have summoned me earlier this scheme could not have been hatched before this time last year the moment she realized that she was certain of something else this had not been lord fersons idea or at least it didnt originate with him it wasnt that her father wasnt intelligent because he was he wasnt clever he wasnt good at coming up with cunning plans but he was intelligent he knew how to read men to the point where some of his underlings thought he could see what was in a mans mind he was also cautious living in a seakeep tended to make you cautious the sea was temperamental and unforgiving slip once and she tended to kill you for your carelessness he also hated risk he always measured risk against gain but he wasnt creative and he never initiated anything if he could help it any overtures would have to have come from the khaleem and the promises of reward would have had to be quite substantial before he would even have considered answering the initial contact whatever lord ferson had been promised it had to have been something big enough to override that intelligence and native caution and whatever was afoot it had to be something that lord ferson was quite sure of bringing to fruition without being caught this was probably the khaleems idea he had promised her father a great dealand might even have already paid him some of what was promised as a gesture of good faith until this moment there would not have been a great deal that anyone could point to as evidence of treason even nowwell entertaining massid for the winter was a dubious move but not precisely treasonable it could even be said and likely ferson would if he was caught that he had been trying to open negotiations to end the khaleems piracy only if he made some more overt move such as pledging his daughter to massid would he enter the realm of treason and he had timed things so word of that was unlikely to escape before the greater plan came to fruition now something about that tickled her mind but she couldnt put a finger on it mentally she set it aside in the back of her mind and continued pursuing her original train of thought jumping a little as the fire popped nevertheless even with powerful incentives and a strong likelihood of success there was something missing from this equation there were too many things that could go wrong too many uncertainties the khaleems were not known for fidelity to their promises in the past lord ferson had never been noted for being a risk taker something in his life must have changed in the past year to make him even consider such an overture much less follow through on it she took in a shuddering breath this was getting more complicated by the moment she was going to have to watch every step she took every word she spoke so far her options were marriage and escape both were fraught with the potential to go wrong there was a third optionto delaybut she didnt think that she would get very far with thatexcept hmm there was a narrow path through all of this perhaps she had boldly told the countess there was no way her father could force her into a marriage against her will legally that is and when she had claimed that she had assumed any such marriage would be to a fellow countryman who would be bound by the law and custom of the seakeeps but that assumed there would be someone here to oppose her fathers will she had also assumed that no actual marriage could take place before spring and that such a wedding would involve the invitations to the other lords of the seakeeps at least one of them would have answered to an appeal from her especially since all of them were very jealous of their equality in power and would resent anything that made the lord of highclere the most powerful of the lot the arrival of massid put rest to all of those assumptions however part of what had been tickling the back of her thoughts finally bloomed into an idea she couldnt depend on the lawbut she could use it she closed her eyes briefly and said a little prayer of thanks that she had managed to keep her father from knowing precisely what kind of person he had welcomed back into his keep the good god must have been in the back of her mind keeping her from betraying her intelligence this whole time from the moment she had left viridian manor to this moment because using the law to delay was going to depend entirely on lord fersons impression that she was passive ordinary and above all stupid stupid enough not to realize why massid was here and stupid enough to believe the law would actually protect her from a marriage to anyone she didnt wish to wed stupid enough to blurt out her rights in public thus reminding the rest of the freedmen of the keep that those rights existed and make them feel unease that those ancient rightsas ancient as the ones that kept them free rather than serfswere being threatened she was under no illusion that any of them would leap to her defense oh no those that werent blindly loyal to fersonand there would be some perhaps manywere also smart enough to know that opposing him in this could mean an unfortunate slip on an icy parapet in the middle of a storm however that was not what she was aiming at fully half of those who served ferson were freedmen they were jealous of those rights that kept them free and though they were not quick to anger their anger burned long and sullen when it was aroused it would be a mistake to arouse their suspicions of the motives of their lord at any time but to do so when the winter storms were coming and everyone was confined here for monthsthat was dangerous it had not happened in recent times but there were tales and plenty of them of winters when one man ruled a seakeep but at the arrival of spring another pledged fealty to the king in his place unfortunate slips on icy parapets in the middle of winter storms did not happen to only the lowborn those who dwelled in the seakeeps were isolated from the rest of the land at the best of times the king was a far and distant figure their lords and ladies stood with them through the storm as well as the zephyr it was hard to give loyalty to one who was only a profile on a coin easier by far to tell oneself that loyalty should go to those whom one knew they might soothe their consciences by telling themselves that the king did not matter that he cared nothing for them so they were not obliged to care for him but if they thought that their own lord threatened their rightsthen they would begin to doubt and every doubt served her purposes it was a thin plan but at least it was a plan first before she did anything else she needed to get word to the countess of what she knew and she would have to be as hard to read as the stones of highclere seakeep her best hope of success lay with her father expecting one thing from her and getting something quite quite different anatha woke her in the morning the first morning in a very long time that she had not awakened by herself part of it was the sound of the sea beneath the walls of the keep it had been her lullaby as a child and the familiar sound at once wild and rhythmic was strangely soothing even the warning of storm to come in the waves below her window was not enough to keep the waves from lulling her part of it was the darkness of her rooms not even in the long nights and dull days of winter were the rooms at viridian manor this dark but the sound of footsteps in the outer room did finally penetrate her slumber and the sound was unfamiliar enough to bring her to full wakefulness in the time it took to draw a breath anatha did not speak but as soon as moira was awake she recognized the sounds of someone tending the fire and assumed it could only be her new maid she pulled back the bed curtains herself in time to see anatha flinging back the shutters in the solar to let in the daylight my lady the woman said turning at the sound of the fabric being pulled back what gown do you wish the brown wool please anatha she said quietly and the amber torque and carnelian bracelet not ostentatious but enough ornament that her father would find nothing to fault in her appearanceand she had a use for the carnelian bracelet have you found the finework you told me of i now know where it is stored my lady the maid replied removing the gown from the wardrobe and a chemise from the chest i shall fetch it for you when you are dressed i have been dressing myself since i was a child anatha she replied i think i can do so now and i should like to have the finework here as soon as may be it is dull here without other ladies to speak to i shall need something besides my duties to occupy me there let anatha carry the tale that she was interested only in womanly things and that there was some womanly vanity involved probably the gowns she had brought with her were plain and mostly unornamented any embroidery to make herself fine she would have to do with her own two hands if you will be so kind as to deal with the finework moira continued i shall attend to myself she smiled at the maids hesitation i doubt anyone will question your diligence so long as i do not anatha bowed her head slightly very well my lady she replied as moira pulled the chemise over her head the door was closing behind her as moiras head emerged from the folds of fabric which was precisely what moira had hoped for quickly she removed the bottom from the wardrobe and removed a small box from the box she took a metal capsule fastened to a leather band and a slip of paper as light and thin as silk there were only a half dozen of those capsules but she doubted very much that she would get many chances to use them all with storms coming she took both and the quill and ink from her desk to the window she needed all the light she could get to write the tiniest letters she could manage prince massid son of khaleem of jendara here she wrote fersons guest purpose unknown possible alliance and marriage she nibbled the end of the quill and added kings fool kedric also here it was all she could fit in it would have to do she waved the paper until the ink was dry then rolled it until it would fit inside the tiny capsule and screwed the capsule up tight she picked up her favorite bracelet silver with a carnelian cabochon the metal backing the cabochon on the inside of the bracelet was hinged the capsule fit snugly inside it with the thin leather tucked in around it then she hastily pulled on the brown woolen gown clasped the necklet around her neck restored the wardrobe and returned the ink and quill to their proper places by the time anatha returned with two servants carrying wooden chests she was sitting quietly on a stool brushing out her own hair ill do that my lady the maid said with faint disapproval putting the casket she herself held down on the chest at the foot of the bed you two put those chests down next to my ladys tapestry frame in the solar and go moira surrendered the brush to anatha and allowed the maid to brush and braid her hair with brown silk ribbons she sat quietly during the whole process only allowing her fingers to rub the surface of the carnelian was there a faint warmth there well the first and easiest part was done with now she had to find an excuse to go up to the top of the cliff this afternoon prince massid was nowhere to be seen when she went down to the hall to break her fast but she didnt expect him to be there princes of jendara did not eat with common folk and only the evening meal was held in state at highclere seakeep there was food set out in the morning and again at noontide and one was expected to help oneself though of course anyone with rank to command a servant could have food brought to her room and i may just do that the less father sees of me the better bread and butter small beer and an apple all taken from the side tables had served her well enough this morning she was apparently keep lady now and she should take up her duties as such an inspection of the kitchen and kitchen staff was definitely in order they needed to see her she needed to see them in all likelihood absolutely nothing would change except that the order of responsibility would have been established and this too was something she would haveand indeed hadlearned under countess vrenables tutelage lord ferson was not the sort to allow his staff to be left to their own devices even though there was no keep lady he must have established strong superior servants in place when his second wife proved unequal to the challenge of truly running the daily business of the keep the head cook was a formidable man muscled like a fisherman used to hauling in heavy nets and the housekeeper his equally formidable wife whose build nearly matched his they came after the time when moira had been sent off to fosterage but she found nothing to fault with either of them she did however take charge of the keys to the spice cupboard and the wine cellar not that there probably wasnt another set and perhaps two but the keep lady was supposed to be at least nominally in charge of the spices and fine drink and appearances had to be maintained she spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon inspecting the rest of the household stores with anatha in tow then had exactly the excuse she needed to go up to the top of the cliff when the cook came to her with the evenings menu for her approval which included a dove pie for the high table and asked if she would also care to see the chicken pens and dovecote above indeed moira said promptly and i will take the opportunity to see the stables and the kennels as well there are storms coming and i do not think there will be another good chance soon my lady has the sea sense the cook rumbled with approval and sent her up with two of the sturdiest kitchen maids as escort fish was a staple and plentiful at the seakeeps but those who sat at the high table had the benefit of a more varied diet there would be game laid away as soon as the first storm brought real cold but the two things that could be depended on to supply a change in menu were the chicken yard and the dovecote both were in the lee of the seaward wall to keep the worst of the storms off them there was nothing to distinguish either from every other dovecote and chicken yard she had ever seenthough both were impeccably keptbut she went through the motions of inspecting them then while the maids selected doves for the pie she picked a brighteyed strong young dove on a perch and calmly reached toward it with the hand bearing the carnelian bracelet the dove stared at the stone transfixed and she picked him up as casually as selecting an egg the maids didnt even notice she took him outside made sure that there was no one near to see what she was doing then took off the bracelet she had practiced this a hundred times under the countesss sharp eye it was a matter of moments to extract the capsule containing her message tie it to the birds leg securely slip the bracelet back on and toss the dove in the air the capsule of course had been enchanted while it was touching her it would freeze a bird in a kind of sleep the moment it left her hand it told the bird that home was not here home was in the little dovecote where the countess kept her pets in the solar of viridian manor pigeons were wellknown for swift flight and homing ability this one would be with the countess by tomorrow at the latest where saved from becoming pie he would live out his life as a pampered pet and perhaps go on to sire more doves from the lines of highclere but the spell was strictly one way nor would it have been wise for her to be looking for messages among her fathers doves she could never be sure when a message would arrive and for one to fall into anyone elses hands but hers would be a disaster with the dove away she turned her attention to the chicken yard then the kennel and stables all were immaculate but she expected nothing less from her father firstly he was a man with a powerful sense of order and secondly there were visitors to impress perhaps the prince of jendara was unlikely to venture up here to look at ordinary hounds and horses but in case he did lord ferson would want stables and kennels to be ready for him there was no mews here the lords of the seakeeps generally kept no birds of prey the ducks that swam in the sea coots and scups and the like tasted like the worst of fish and fowl combined not much in the way of game birds populated lord fersons lands and even if they had they didnt vary greatly enough in taste from dove pigeon and chicken for him to care to bother and at highclere no one hunted for pleasure this was a working quasimilitary keep there were no highborn fellows idling about hunts were purposeful for meat and conducted with the intention of spending as little time on them as possible boar and deer were tracked netted and if deemed fair game quickly dispatched rabbits and hares were snared the gamekeepers brought the catch in to be stored and that was the end of it lord ferson himself rarely participated so the kennels here were nothing like those at viridian manor there were coursing hounds calm and purposeful but aloof nor were the stables full of anything but sturdy workhorses still moira had enough of seakeep blood in her that she had never really enjoyed hunting and riding the way most of the other girls fostered with the countess had riding was a way to get from here to there quickly and as for hunting why spend all day pursuing something your gamekeeper could take down in an hour the only thing she had really enjoyed was falconry and then it was in watching the swift and agile birds riding the winds like the embodiment of wind itself she followed the kitchen maids with their burdens back down into the keep noting as the door to the upper stairs closed behind her that the sound of the waves had intensified the storm would arrive soon possibly around dinnertime she wondered how the prince of jendara would like it the khaleemate was not noted for weather the storm broke over the keep as she was descending into the great hall for dinner she had spent the remainder of her afternoon going over the contents of the chests her maid had hunted up out of storage and they had been surprising her own mother had not been noted for her needlework preferring to cut bands of fine work from old outworn garments and stitch them with nearly invisible stitches to new ones rather than embroider anything of her own sometimes when the sea brought salvage in the way of clothing or fabric she would use the ornaments from those or carefully cut long strips of brocade to hem into trim but lord fersons next wives it appeared had been expert needlewomen the chests contained fine linen and silk hemmed strips of frieze for covering with counted stitches and skeins of fine beautifully dyed wool for tapestry and the heavy embroidery called crewel the smaller casket held embroidery silks and gold and silver bullion meant for a truly skilled worker with the needleand golden needles the latter were not for showa needle made of gold would never snag on even the thinnest of silk but pass through it smoothly and easily in this moira was not like her mother she enjoyed needlework and had brought her skills up to a level where even the countess admired her work she smiled with pleasure at the sight of such riches there was even a halffinished neck placket for a gown there and she wasted no time in mounting it to the frame by the window and setting out what she would use to complete it before the sky began to darken with clouds racing before the storm the next few days would be so dark that she would not be able to discern colors well she would have to know what was where in her holder in order to work in the dim light the nearer the time came to dinner the more her stomach knotted surely tonight the announcement would comeand she had no idea what to do yet by the time she paced into the hall as the first bolts of lightning flashed outside the windows and the storm winds screamed at the stones she was as taut as a harp string with tension but there was no one on the dais and she took her seat with as much outward calm as she could manage already it was much colder in the hall than last night and servants had set shields made of paperthin slices of mica around any open lamp not that there were many of those the one thing highclere never ran short of was drafts and most lamps were shielded the onset of the storm made no difference to the folk of the keep except for those who would be manning the storm beacons in this sort of weather they would not be taking the path that clung to the cliffthat would be courting death there were ways out to the two nearer beacons which cut through the cliff itself from the keep the passages were narrow and claustrophobic but better than trying to inch along the path with rain and wave striving to tear you from it those two near beacons marked the site of dangerous current and rocks and were the reason the seakeep had been built where it was the further beacons showing only where the coastline was were built on the top of the cliff much like watchtowers and the men manning them stayed there for a week at a time moira felt the stone of the keep shiver under her feet as the storm waves outside began to pound against the cliff side and the keep itself now the roar of the waves penetrated even the thick stone it would be a hard night and the storm might last two or three days altogether then a bolt of lightning flashed down somewhere very nearby for the crash of thunder that shook the entire keep came simultaneously with the flash that lit up the hall more brightly than daylight moira was not ashamed that she jumped and smothered an involuntary scream half of the people in the hall did the same and the other half started and clutched at something her heart was pounding and one hand was at her throat as she forced calm onto herself just as the prince of jendara and her father came in she had barely gotten her heart under control kedric followed a few paces behind moira was secretly pleased that massid was visibly shaken wideeyed and she thought a little pale under his tan her father seemed to be assessing the prince as they took their seats and moira thought he made up his mind about something as he gave the signal to begin the serving you told me your weather wasformidable lord ferson massid said to his credit his voice was steady i did not grasp quite what you meant this is an order of magnitude greater than i had thought moira looked down at her soup but concentrated on every word and especially the nuances of expression in their voices i have never known an outsider who had any grasp of what a winter storm could be like before he came to a seakeep prince massid her father replied and there was an interesting inflection in his voice something moira could not quite grasp nevertheless this is an unusually strong storm even for this time of year i think it is a very good thing that your ship is safe in the harbor the prince of jendara and her father exchanged a wordless glance moira could not see her fathers expression but massid looked like someone who was harboring a very satisfying secret she felt the back of her neck prickle as my father told you my lord we have never lost a ship to a storm though our enemies haveoften he smiled then a smile that called to mind the grin of a shark with a seal in its jaws depending on who was caught in this weather what kind of ship and pilot they have we may be gathering our winter harvest when the storm ends lord ferson replied and he did not trouble to hide the satisfaction in his voice moira shivered fortunately her fathers attention was on his guest and to a man from jendara a woman was too unimportant to take note of she knew very well what he meant at a seakeep the winter harvest meant the salvage cast up on the rocks after a wreck in a storm this strong her father continued any ship thats been hugging the coastline had better have a sharp pilot and a good lookout to avoid the rocks or shell be driven straight onto them even with the beacons you need luck on your side when the winter witch comes in because if you dont make your turn youre on the teeth and theres an end to you he was gloating she knew itshe knew that tone he was gloating and she didnt know why so unfortunate massid shook his head and added silkily and i suppose that turning out to sea and beating away from the coast is no better youd better be provisioned for a double fortnight the winter witch can take you a long way from where you ought to be if she catches you away from the coast and then of course theres pirates fersons voice took on a sly note yes and you both should know about pirates moira thought ah pirates a terrible scourge i am told they often follow along behind one of these storms as if they knew where it was going massid repliedbut out of the corner of her eye moira saw him straighten and abruptly his tone took on a lighter cast with no shades of meaning ah what is this fish baked in a salt crust my lord replied ferson as if they had been discussing no more than food the moment before it is one of my cooks specialties this fish baked in this way leaves no bones in the meat and the herbs it is stuffed with permeate the flesh while the flesh itself remains moist we make a virtue of necessity having plenty of fish and no lack of salt the salt sticks to the skin and never touches the flesh interesting as the server laid a portion before the guest he leaned over and sniffed it thyme bay and basil i think how very pleasant moira knew some sort of secret dialogue had been passing between the two of them but she simply did not have the key to understanding what was going on under the surface it was exceedingly frustrating kedric played quietly throughout the meal though his presence was not in the least soothing at least she didnt find it so the time or two she took her attention off massid and her father she found the fool staring at her with a strange intensity which was as unnerving as the unspoken conversation going on between ferson and his guest once again the announcement she had dreaded never came and she excused herself as soon as she could she didnt feel completely easy until she was in the semidarkness of the passage and out of sight of the high table as a child during storms she used to run through the passages as quickly as she could because the lamps would snuff out seemingly by themselves strange currents of air would whisper or whine in corners and all she could think about were the stories of how all those who had drowned when their ships ran up on the teeth of highclere followed the wind and the sea into the keep when the winter witch blew now as an adult she knew that strange behavior of wind and sound was usual in a storm no matter how well shielded the lanterns were not all remained lit drafts were so unpredictable that servants went through every passage at intervals relighting the lamps that had blown out and there was no way to keep drafts out of a place like this in storm season she felt sorry for anyone who had to take the passages to the beacons there was no hope of doing anything except making your way in the darkness no lamp flame could survive the blast that traveled along that tunnel which was the source of the uncanny moan that signaled the beginning of a storm and didnt end until it was over as she neared her chambers she paused for a moment then prompted by a feeling that she ought to she abruptly took a different turn going down the corridor that led to her old childhood nursery the nursery had a window and one of the best views in the entire keep this wasnt an accident the idea was that the children of a seakeep should get used to the worst that storms could throw at the keep at an early age and the cradle was not considered too early moira remembered many many gloomy afternoons when it was too dark to have lessons or read or do needlework lying in her bed on her stomach peeking out through the curtains at the foot of her bed and watching rain lash the window the curtained bed had seemed very safe when she was small a good place to retreat to if the storm became so fierce the walls shook and she remembered nights too when lightning flashed through the cracks of the shutters while thunder vibrated the whole keep storms had never frightened her once she had gotten past a certain age in fact shed found them exciting exhilarating though in the dark of the night with witch fire dancing on the points of pikes the tips of towers and the tops of flagpoles and the wind keening a death cry the idea that those drowned souls might come looking for the warmth of the living could still make her skin crawl at least they werent looking for revenge it was the honor and the duty of the seakeeps to prevent them from coming aground yes but why was father saying those things to the prince of jendara then she shivered opened the door to the nursery and wrinkled her nose at the cold dusty smell of the place clearly no one had been in here since she had left she felt her way along the wall huddling into her warm shawl the stone was like ice the room itself as cold as a snow cave but she wanted to see the storm over the ocean for herself it was a sight she hadnt had since shed left the storms at viridian manor were impressive but nothing like the winter witch riding the waves she came to the shutters and flipped the worn wooden latch opening them just as a bolt of lightning struck the sea outside in the brief flash of light she could see that the waves were already washing over the stone terrace of the lowest level of the keep as usual water would be running in under the door there and down the stairs no matter there was a drain for it at the foot of the stairs and no one would go out that door until the storm was over so it didnt matter if the stairs were slippery shed gone down there once or twice daring herself to touch that footthick door as it trembled visibly under the full fury of the storm all the keep children did it was a rite of passage to prove that you dared the witch to take you and you were brave enough to face her down this was definitely one of the worst storms in her memory especially for one so early she sat down on the chest just beneath the window propped her elbows on the sill with her chin in both hands and peered through the darkness looking for the northern beacon that marked the beginning of the teethand frowned she should see it clearly from here no matter how terrible the storm she should be seeing the beacon nothing could blow it out and never in all the history of the seakeep had anyone failed to light it in darkness or storm and keep it lit this was not tiny lantern flame to be blown outit was a great roaring oilfed conflagration shielded in a large bubble of greenish glass as thick as a thumb and surrounded by polished brass mirrors that reflected all the landward light out to sea then turning her head a little she saw it breathed a sigh of reliefthen frowned more deeply it wasnt where it should be it should be much farther away along the cliff face it wasnt where she remembered and she had very vivid physical memories of planting both elbows on this windowsill in little depressions that countless other elbows had worn into the wood and looking straight out through the center pane to see it not through the pane that was left of center but im older and much taller no that wasnt the problem it couldnt be the problem taller would make no difference in where the beacon appeared to be from the view through this window but i cant be sure she stared at the warm yellow light it was of course much dimmer from the land side the reflectors that sent as much light out to sea as possible saw to that but the more she stared and the more she positioned herself within the window frame the more certain she was that it was not her memory that was at fault here but there was a way to be absolutely certain and as she sucked on her lower lip anxiously she decided she was going to make that test for herself because if something was wrong she wanted to know and she wasnt going to go to her father to try to find out he had after all brought the prince of jendara here and she was certain that it was without the kings knowledge or permission quietlyin fact on tiptoe though she could not have said why she felt the need for stealthshe slipped back to her rooms anatha was not there she was probably still enjoying her own dinner with the rest of the servants for moira had made it quite clear that she did not require her maid to dance attendance on her at every waking hour there was no reason to leave the hall the banks of hot stones that kept the food warm more than made up for the winds whistling in the rafters and stealing the warmth of the fires up the chimneys and if she was in particularly good graces with the cook and the housekeeper anatha would be invited afterward to the warm room backing onto the baking oven which the superior servants used as a parlor in winter thank heavens anathas absence made this much easierno need to conjure up excuses for going back to the nursery she opened her jewelry casket underneath the lamp and found the ring she was looking for slipping it onto her middle finger she stole back down the hall to the nursery carefully closing the door behind her this time she positioned herself at the window with her eyes mere inches from the center pane and making a fist rubbed a little scratch in the glass right where the beacon shone through the storm with the diamond in the ring there when the storm broke she could come back here in daylight and see if the scratch lined up with the beacon if it did she had been anxious over nothing if it didnt if it didnt there was something very very strange going on at highclere seakeep and she would have to find out what it wasand more important why it was happening when anatha returned to moiras rooms she found her mistress with her feet resting on a stone warmed on the hearth with a fur rug covering her lap sitting beside the fire knitting knitting was a very plebian pastime and most ladies didnt even bother to learn but moira found it soothing it was one of the few tasks that could be done by the uncertain light of a flickering fire and guttering lamps during a storm and it certainly did no harm to have extra soft lambswool hose on hand in a seakeep winter a wild night my lady was all anatha said the winter witch has come early i thought as muchbut i also wondered if my memory had been at fault moira replied well what are the canny old sailors saying thatthat it isnt natural my lady anatha replied looking over her shoulder first as if she expected to see someone spying on them from a corner the witch has never flown before all the leaves are gone not in anyones memory once again moira felt an odd little sense of warning the leaves will certainly not outlast this storm she replied and yawned are they saying this means a bad winter anatha looked over her shoulder and this time she leaned very close to moira and whispered theyre saying this storm was sent once again that touch of warning that sense as if a single icecold fingertip had been touched to the back of her neck she thought about her father and prince massid exchanging cryptic comments and glances full of meaning about the winter storms but no one could control the weather even the greatest of magicians couldnt control the weatherthe one who could would have a great and terrible weapon at his disposal such a magician wouldnt be content to serve a greater master he himself would use that power to become a powerful ruler not that moira had any great acquaintance with magicians they were few and far between the genuine ones anyway the countess had her wizard lady amaranth but she had never performed any magic more powerful than the spell that allowed the grey ladies to use pigeonmail and lady amaranth was supposed to be the most powerful wizard in the kingdom except for those that served the king how could such a storm be sent she replied keeping her tone light and disbelieving and more to the point why this is a seakeepwe are used to such storms at most it is an inconvenience the menatarms wont be able to hunt until its over and we might run a bit short of fresh meat but the high table will not suffer the beacons will have to be tended and the poor fellows who have to do the tending will spend a miserable time of it soon or late it doesnt matter when the winter witch flies shell have no effect on highclere and i hope you arent going to tell me that god has sent the storms early for our sins i shall be quite cross with you anatha laughed at that no my lady youre right of course it was all just kitchen talk then i count on you to be sensible moira replied with a nod when that sort of talk begins again make sure you are the one who keeps her head she yawned and set aside her work and i believe that i will be sensible and go to bed tucked up in bed with the curtains closed tightly all around to prevent icy drafts from waking her moira did not feel in the least sleepy she turned on her side to think if someone was a powerful magician and could control the weather at least in parthed use that power to make himself a king wouldnt he but what if he already was a king or say a khaleem which was basically the same thing massid had said that the khaleemate had never lost a ship to storms maybe that wasnt just good luck maybe the khaleems of jendara had power over the weather if that was their only power it was a cursed useful one especially for a nation that fielded an enormous navy and unofficially fielded a second enormous force of pirates but why would that be attractive to her father it was true that bad storms could bring a few more ships to grief on the teeth of highclere and that in turn would certainly increase the coffers of the lord of highclere seakeep but the gain would be offset by some loss the worse the storms were the less hunting there would be the less fishing and the more likely that one of those unfortunate accidents would befall whoever was supposed to be working outside she vividly recalled a particularly wretched winter when frequent though not violent storms had kept everyone pent up within the walls right up until late spring the number of fights had been appalling feuds had begun that were probably still being played out to this day ferson had lost a dozen men to accidents and to fights it had been hard to replace them and the keep had been shorthanded for nearly a year so what possible use could ferson make of such a power that would outweigh the disadvantages she couldnt think of anything so whatever had brought the prince of jendara here it probably wasnt that she fell asleep still trying to figure out what had after four days of wind and storm the morning of the fifth day broke over calm seas and a cloudlessif icysky immediately the scavengers went out to comb the shores for whatever the sea had cast up heaps of extremely useful kelp was always thrown upon the rocks of course but there were other things amber jet sea coal and sometimes the sea in her fickle nature elected to toss back things that had gone to the bottom in previous wrecks by the time moira went down to breakfast the keep was practically empty everyone who could be spared was out combing the shore and everyone who could hunt was up in the forest doing so the cook would make only one hot meal today as most of his helpers would be elsewhere it seemed as good a time as any to send the countess another message but what moira still had no idea why massid was here no marriage had yet been proposed and yet frustrated she essentially repeated her previous warning with the addition of the rumor about the storm being sent adding only that massid was spending all his time in her fathers company she released the dove with a sense of futility and carried a basket of eggs down to the cook as her excuse for being up there in the first place with nothing much to do she went into the great hall before returning to her rooms and stood at the window brooding down at the ocean pining for a beloved my lady kedrics dry voice came from behind her if you know anything at all about the women schooled by the countess you know we dont pine for anything she replied without turning and as for a beloved you would know that we also are aware that our lives are not our own to give ah yes you are well schooled in obedience the bitterness in his voice made her turn and regard him with a lifted brow perhaps kedric you are insufficiently acquainted with the meaning of the phrase noblesse oblige she replied keeping her tone cool and just on the polite side of sarcastic it means that those who are born into a position of power inherit obligations and responsibilities far in excess of the benefits of privilege it means that we are obligated to protect those who give us their loyalty and service sometimes that protection comes at the cost of a life sometimes the cost is only freedom but we owe them that this is what noblesse oblige means she could not read kedrics face so she continued men she said with some bitterness of her own think that being willing to lay down their lives is difficult they have no conception of what it means to be willing to lay down your life as a woman doesnot for a moment of sacrifice but for years decades of sacrifice to surrender it in that way so that the people you have sworn to protect are protected and so you lie down and let yourself kedric began she interrupted him a cold fury in her voice that she could not entirely repress is that what you think that this is mere passive obedience weak and weak willed i thought you wiser than your motley kedric it is hard hard to subdue the will to force aside i want for i must but you mistake me even in the most loveless and calculated of marriages there are children to love and be loved by i refer to the hardest sacrifice of all for a woman to steel her will to live alone and unwedded not because she wishes to but because for the sake of her people she mustto look down the long years ahead and see nothing at the end of them but an empty bed and a lonely singleness he made a little strangling sound and she sniffed interpreting his odd expression she thought correctly what you thought the countess remained single because she wished to or because she does not care for men oh she mourns the count her husband and she truly loved him but she stays a single widow because it is her cousin the kings will so that she can be the stalking horse be dangled like a prize at a fair for all to see but ultimately never be won by any and she takes no lovers for she is the kings cousin and like caesars wife she must be above reproach she knows that has always known it and she makes sure her grher ladies know that there is more than one way in which the king may ask for their obedience and what the cost may be isee he managed that had not occurred to me and to protect my people if i thought it would protect them yes i would give myself over to be locked away in a seraglio in jendara she added turning back to the window but i do not think it would protect them i think the opposite and i think the king would agree i think he would too my lady kedrics tone was firm again well there it was the unspoken message and alliance she had been hoping to hear kedric was the kings man and he was here to be the kings eyes and ears the trouble is i do not know how to prevent it she said sadly short of throwing myself into the sea you are the heir to a seakeep my lady and as such you can wed any of the kings subjects you choose without his leave kedric said slowly as if he was thinking aloud but by the law of the land and the charter by which a seakeep is held you cannot wed someone who is not one of his subjects without his leave and there it washer escape or at least a way to stall for time her father would have to pretend that he was sending for the kings permission probably he would forge such a message but she had been schooled by the countess and she had seen and learned how to recognize the kings hand and seal she didnt think there was anyone here with sufficient talent to successfully forge a royal decree that she said aloud is quite true and it is exceedingly useful to keep in mind i am pleased to have given you something useful my lady he replied as she turned back to look down at the ocean a movement along the cliff face caught her eye it was the work crew going out to replenish the fuel for the beaconand that reminded her suddenly of the mark she had made on the window of the nursery a mark which might give her some information though what use she could make of it she was not yet sure youll excuse me i hope she said after a momentbut then abruptly added unless you would care to accompany me to the old nursery i think i might have left something there that might interest you he looked at her askance but nodded if you wish my lady and you think i may be of service she smiled without humor say rather it might be instructive to you to see how a seakeep child begins its life we are not sheltered that the minstrel said raising his eyebrows i can truly believe he followed her to the nursery and did not voice any objections to the chill stale air as she opened the door it was dark as she had expected as far as she could tell no one had opened the shutters on the window since she herself had closed them she went straight to the window and opened themshe didnt fling them open she moved them quietly to make as little noise as possible what are you kedric began she held up a cautioning hand this you see is the view every child of the lord of a seakeep gets from the time it leaves the cradle she said as she leaned down to scrutinize the windowpanes finally she resorted to finding the scratch she had made by touch rather than by sight somewhat to her surprise it wasnt standing out the way she had thought it would perhaps too many fantastic tales of lovelorn maidens or tragically imprisoned heroes inscribing poems on the windows of their rooms had given her the mistaken impression that all it would take was a little rubbing with a diamond to leave a visible mark at length she found it sat down on the window seat and tried to make the mark line up with the beacon just visible from where she sat it did nothing of the sort the trouble was it didnt line up with any place that people would be able to get to while she could certainly imagine that her father would have the cleverness to construct a false beacon this one was apparently somewhere beyond the cliff itself out in the water which wasodd its a bit of a harrowing view for a child i would think kedric said then he whispered what exactly are you doing my lady i hope you didnt bring me here to reminisce during the storm i made a scratch on the glass to line up with the beacon she whispered back because it seemed to me that it was in the wrong place and the only way to know for sure was to see if the mark lined up with the structure when the storm cleared here take my seat and see for yourself she said louder relinquishing her spot on the window seat generations of seakeep children grew up on this view come storm or sunshine he replaced her while she spoke in conversational tones about the beacon the storms and the beachcombers down on the rocks and what they might find he lined himself up with her mark and peered through the window frowning what keeps the beacon alight he asked still frowning sea coal but somethings done to it magically she replied a little of it burns with a tall bright flame there are reflectors behind the flame to send as much of the light as possible out to sea we have to get the special coal from the king and store it he sends it to us by packhorse it must be very hard to make because we have to account for every bit burned and if we use more than weve been allotted we have to say why with his back to her she could see that one of his shoulders was significantly higher than the other and his spine was slightly twisted it looked very painful perhaps that accounted for his sourness the beacon and your scratch do not match up my lady he said softly is there any significance to the position where it does match up of course the beacon is meant to show sailors where the coast is when there are storms and fog she said aloud during times like those ships hug the coastline so they navigate by the beacons in order to avoid being lost at sea but also a beacon has to be placed precisely because at the spot where it has been built there are generally shoals or rocks where ships can run aground he nodded so if say something were to destroy this beacon the new one would have to be built on exactly the same spot oh more than that even if this one were destroyed some sort of temporary beacon would have to be put there immediately she replied its just too vital she watched his lips compress and his eyes narrow only at that moment realizing that they were a dark grey that seemed to darken even as she watched he knew something that she didnt i wish my lady that we could discover just where along your coastline this scratch does line up he whispered there is no way to tell and i wouldnt care to go outside in a storm to try to find out she whispered back then she said in a normal tone if it were not for the beacons of course it would not be possible for trade ships to sail in the winter nor for the coastal patrols to keep enemies from our shores fishermen have no need of them of course for when the weather is foul they wisely do not put out to sea indeed well this has been very enlightening my lady and i thank you for your hospitality he stood up abruptly forcing her to step back with some haste he sketched a bow there is a great deal more about this seakeep and its daughter than meets the eye he held the door open for her courteously and she stepped through they parted at the intersection of the two corridors and she returned to her room feeling irritated and uneasy she had shared her information with him but he had given her nothing her irritation only increased when she returned to the great hall intending if nothing else to watch the beachcombers and her fathers overseer below from the vantage point of the great window behind the high table on the dais thinking perhaps she might be able also to guess where the displaced beacon had been though she could not for a moment imagine how the light had been displaced as far as she could tell though she was far from certain about this it had been moved several hundred yards down the coastline and a bit farther out to sea which if she was correct would mean that any boat using it as a guide would think the promontory and rocks that the beacon stood over were there and that once past it would be safe to cut in closer to shore which would of course depending on the accuracy of the beacon put a ship directly on the rocks was it just greed that had driven her father to stormassisted piracy that didnt make a great deal of sense in summer when storms never lasted more than a day yes but winter storms lasted several days and it wouldnt do her father a great deal of good if the ship he wanted was wrecked on the first or second day of a storm you couldnt go out on the rocks for salvage in the teeth of a winter gale and anything washed up after a wreck would soon be taken away by the sea and tides again if he was colluding with the khaleem to bring in invaders well that made no sense either you would want the beacon where it actually was if you were bringing in strangers to this coast and anyway where would they land the docks for the keep were small nowhere near big enough for an invasion force and anyway the khaleemate ran to pirates not soldiers it was one thing to turn them loose on the high seas and tax them on their booty when they returned to port it was quite another to expect them to come in to land and act like soldiers so why shift the beacon and who had done it the only thing she could think of was that it had been done by magic and aside from massid and kedric there were no obvious strangers here and surely massid could not be a magician as rare as magicians were surely the khaleem would not allow a son who was also a magician so far away from home she brooded down on the waves crashing over the rocks in torrents of white foam and felt a chill steal over her that left kedric kedric who she not that long ago had told almost everything so now if he was her fathers man her father knew everythingfrom her own reluctance to be handed off in marriage to massid to the fact that she knew about the beacon after all he hadnt said he was the kings man she had merely read it into what he had said blessed god i have been a fool she stared sightlessly down into the water feeling her heart slowly going numb and her mind with it she had showed himshe had told him what asked an impatient and surprisingly rational voice inside her you told him that you would do your duty and marry massid if you thought it would protect your people but that you didnt think it would do any such thing you made it clear you were unhappy about the idea and who wouldnt be you told him a few choice things about the countess but nothing thats not common knowledge and you didnt reveal that you are a grey lady you pointed out what your duty was to your people and how much that duty could cost you you showed him the scratch on the glass and told him why youd made it but so far as he knows you have no way of telling anyone else all that was true certainly but but if hes your fathers man now he has all the arguments your father needsor so he thinksto persuade you to marry massid when he proposes it theres no harm in that he knows you are more intelligent than you appear but theres no harm in that either he doesnt know about the birds or your weapons or any of your other skills the only thing you showed him is that you are an intelligent young woman who suspects her father is up to no good but who certainly cant tell anyone and cant do anything about the knowledge she recognized that little voice in her mind it was the one that coolly analyzed and put fears to rest no matter how panicked the rest of her mind was it was seldom wrong and that only in degree she sometimes wondered if it was the voice of some guardian angel sometimes the voice sounded exactly like the countess though and while she admired the countess greatly she would have been the first to say that the countess vrenable was no angel she unclenched her fists and closed her eyes a moment to clear her mind if kedric was the kings man he had information he might be able to use if he was her fathers man he had nothing he could use to harm herexcept that heand her fatherwould now know that she was intelligent enough and quick enough to suspect something was wrong sonot no harm done though she was not an immediate danger to any plans they had in train she could reveal them now or later so she had done herself harm enough that her father might move a little faster to put her where she could do him no harmwhich was probably with massid time to send another bird and more than time to resume her training when the time came she might need every bit of strength she had but two weeks and another storm passed with nothing changing in the keep or out of it so far as appearances went every day moira tended to the affairs of the keep as the keep lady should every evening she spent dining in the great hall with her father and massid afternoons were spent at her embroidery she quickly finished the halffinished placket had anatha stitch it to one of her gowns and started another but there was one change that no one was aware of the seakeep was carved into and out of the rock of the cliff with that sort of construction it was difficult to create secret passages and hidden rooms such as viridian manor with its woodandstone construction it was after all much much easier to build something of that sort into the walls than it was to carve it out of rock then try to hide it but there was one place in highclere seakeep that almost no one ever went to this time of year even a place built out of stone has need of timber not firewood but properly seasoned lumber for repairs paneling cabinetry furniture and boats so when a particularly fine tree was cut downor when the lord of the seakeep was moved to trade for one with an inland lord whose forests were not subject to nearconstant windcut and planed planks of every possible thickness were laid down to dry and season in what was called the timber room it wasnt a room at all it was a cave but a peculiarly dry cave and one which allowed the planks to cure and dry naturally the oldest bits of woodvery expensive stuff it was of fantastical grains and coloringwere three generations old there wasnt a great deal of that and it was generally used for inlay work the rest wasnt more than ten years old twenty at most although there were some heavy oak beams that had been seasoning since moiras grandfather laid them down before he died in summer and early fall this place was a hive of activity in winter though no one bothered to look in in itself it was valuable but no one was likely to steal a load of wood layers of planks laid down in soft sand made a floor that didnt shift much there wasnt much light and the noise from the ocean far below drowned out any sounds that might be made up here in short it made a perfect place for moira to practice there was a great advantage to being a modest maiden in winter the loose longsleeved highnecked gowns and wimples she wore allowed her to wear her fighting clothing mail and all and no one noticed heavy winter fabrics did not betray so much as a hint of chain mail she didnt bring her sword and dagger up to the timber room but there were plenty of pieces of wood of the right size and shape there already so once a dayand a different time of day each time if she could manage itshe would over the course of an hour first get back to her room and put on her mail and armor then find a way to get to the timber room where she would doff her dress and begin her stretching exercises moving into the fighting exercises as soon as her muscles were limber it was frustrating not having a partner to practice with but at least it was practice and she always tried to push herself a little more each day in speed and accuracy when she was tired but before she was winded she would go back to her room take off the armor and hide it again and go on about her business it was particularly interesting to be up there during a storm only one lantern could be made to stay alight and the shifting shadows made footwork and bladework a challenge the wind howled through here the place was like a chimney she was exceptionally careful about the lantern under these conditions if a fire actually started up here without first being blown out it would be uncontrollable in an instant destroying decades worth of valuable wood though of course with the wind howling through the place it was unlikely that a fire could catch strongly enough to avoid being extinguished and still nothing happened except that massid and her father began to play chess every night after the remains of supper were cleared away after the first night she remained to watch out of curiosity their play reflected she thought their personalities her father played without speaking during his own turn fiercely intent and intense and scowling whenever he lost a piece the prince of jendara was a complete contrast outwardly relaxed a smile on his bearded lips apparently listening to kedrics playing and occasionally commenting on it or the game but as she watched him she became aware of a predatory glitter in his eyes just before he was about to swoop down on an opposing piece and a little smile of satisfaction when he knew he was going to win or more rarely his smile grew icy and his speech less easy and more punctiliously polite when he knew he was about to lose and when that happened there was a flash of pure rage for just the barest fraction of a moment that made her shiver it was particularly frightening the second night of the second storm when the wind and waves were crashing against the rocks below with such force that the stones of the keep groaned and there was enough lightning they hardly needed lanterns chess was one game she had not mastered so she couldnt really tell what was happening on the board but her father was grinding his teeth in frustration and massids eyes had that satisfied glitter as he toyed with his goblet and then all in an instant her fathers face went from angry desperation to utter triumph he swooped down on the board and moved a piece slamming it down in front of massids king check and mate he shouted and for a moment massids face went black with rage now that was a phrase that moira had often heard before but she had never actually seen it happen and had often thought it a picturesque fabrication now she knew better it wasnt that his face physically darkenedit was that his whole demeanor changed and his expression for that instant was so suffused with the bitterest of hatred that it seemed to go black it only lasted a moment it was gone so quickly that if she hadnt felt that shaken by what she had seen she might have doubted the expression was there at all but she had seen it and it was there and she knew that if in that instant massid could have gotten away with it he would have killed her father and possibly everyone else who had witnessed his defeat but by the time her father looked up massid was wearing an expression of rueful amusement i did not see that coming my lord he said graciously a most unorthodox move i congratulate you her father was not a gracious winner but at least he didnt gloat too long massids mask slipped a trifle but he managed to maintain it long enough to excuse himself and retire for the night moira went to bed feeling her insides quivering if there was such a thing as a spirit of pure ruthlessnesstoo impersonal to be evilthat spirit dwelled within the prince of jendara and woe betide whoever crossed him in something he really wanted she had seen the face of the enemy it frightened her in a way she had not expected to be frightened it was one thing to face the possibility of having to deal with a forced marriage it was another thing entirely to see what she had seen behind the pleasant mask the thought kept her in a restless half sleep that night and she woke early to the sound that told her another storm was on the way her mind was preternaturally clear and the first thing that came to her was that this storm would probably arrive on or about midwinter moonthe longest night of the year and the highest tide until midsummer moon not a good time to be having a winter storm as well any ships out at sea on that night would be better off well away from the coast in fact if the waters surged in too high parts of the keep would have to be temporarily abandoned that hadnt happened in decades certainly not while moira had been alive but the keep had probably weathered a hundred such storms and would weather a hundred more whatever was in the lowest levels would be taken elsewhere probably not much actually or at least nothing much worth saving theyd been dug as hiding places and escape routes and there was always sea water getting in well when the storm came theyd be flooded two days she thought listening to the waves outside three at the most part of her was still exhausted from the restless night but the rest of her could not lie still a moment more she rose from her bed and dressed herself before anatha could arrive there was a tension in the air today or at least it felt that way to her and yet when she ascended to the great hall no one else seemed aware of it everyone could read the signs of the impending storm however and it didnt take a sage to figure out that a storm combined with midwinter moon meant trouble small boats needed to not only be pulled into the sea caves but winched up above the highest highwater mark large boats were manned with skeleton crews and sailed to the nearest safe harbor the flotsam and jetsam that had collected since the last bad storm down in the lower keep levels was dragged out and sorted through with anything deemed worth keeping packed properly away and what was left over taken off to the rubbish pile for the next high tide to wash away farther down the coastline the sea doors were checked and reinforced supplies hauled down from storage places above the heaviest of shutters locked in place over the most vulnerable windows with all this activity moira did not dare to slip away to the timber room to practice with every ablebodied person scurrying on or about the keep making preparations the cook was not bothering to lay out regular meals food was left in the great hall for people to snatch in passing this left her with nothing to do staying in the keep ladys rooms in order to remain out of the way even anatha was busy somewhere she tried to sit at her embroidery and could not manage to set more than a stitch or two at length she rose and began pacing back and forth in front of the window she had measured the space in steps at least twenty times when a light tap made her jerk her head toward the door like a startled deer i have been told in no uncertain terms that i am in the way my lady said kedric pushing the door open with one hand the other clasping the neck of his lute as am i she admitted i am too much the lady to be permitted to work with my hands and not enough of one it seems to be allowed to direct the work then we should obey lord fersons directive and stay out from underfoot kedric replied lightly and shut the door behind him his expression went from moderately amused to dead sober all in an instant lady moira is there anyone among your fathers people who is a magician or a wizard he asked urgently she started but covered it swiftly why do you ask she replied cautiously wondering if he had some way of detecting the spell on her bracelet and the little message capsules because i have several times been to the old nursery at night during calm times and during storm he replied and during calm nights when someone walking guard or otherwise outside the keep might take notice the light from the beacon is where it should be but on nights of storm it again comes from the wrong place if the cause was some freakish reflection it would not behave in such a manner and the only way i know of to make such a thing happen is by he hesitated by magic should she trust him that was a good question and she too hesitated before she answered she still did not know who he served lady moira he said as if reading her thoughts you must trust me i have had word from the king and his cousin concerning you the countess vrenable has identified you as one of her grey ladies i serve the king in a similar capacity the countess was not aware of my presence here until after you had left viridian manor or perhaps she would not have been so ready to send you here he grimaced i know that you have been sending the countess information using the doves at the top of the cliff i also know that you have no means of getting information back in return except by some visitor and your father has arranged for the road to highclere to be closed since your arrival she eyed him dubiously then how are you getting word from my mistress and the king she demanded he laughed mirthlessly and shrugged his good shoulder my lady i am the kings wizard or one of them anyway i am an alchemyst see here he pushed up his sleeve and tattooed around his wrist was the image of the serpent of wisdom the great snake that eats its own tail the symbol of the alchemysts it was the same side of his body as his hunched shoulder and she wonderedhad he always been so crippled or had that deformity been inflicted upon him in the service of magic when i think it safe i speak to my own master who also serves the king in the fire but since you showed me the moving beacon i have been extremely careful because anyone who suspects that i am an alchemyst will know i can do this if there is another magician about he will have the power to duplicate what i do and can intercept my messages in his own fire and i ask you if there are any magicians among your fathers people because the only way that i know of for the beacon to change its apparent position is by magic she shook her head to his obvious disappointment never not since my mother died and even she had only the touch of moon and sea magic she needed to be invested as keep lady she was pregnant with me at that time so both of us were bound to the service of the keep at the same time it was her turn to laugh mirthlessly trust father to manage things so that he didnt have to bring a sage in for a second investment ceremony he hates magic she hesitated kedric crossed the room to stare into her eyes as if trying to wrest the thoughts from her head what he demanded perhaps i should have said he hated magic i do not know that he still does and perhaps the only reason he hated it once was because he could find no way to make it serve his demands only those of the king and the keep so if he has found a magician to answer to his willhe might have lost his distaste for the arts magical kedric hazarded his eyes narrowing maybe she shook her head but she hesitated again all i have is speculation the speculations of a grey lady are as informed as many a mans certain facts he told her speak i have only bits of things massids presencei thought it was to secure an alliance but father hasnt even hinted at a betrothal much less a marriage and massid has made no real effort at courtship she shook her head the thing is ah he said holding up his finger for a moment here is the other reason for my being here your father wishes to persuade you to an alliance with massid as you have assumed i believe he intends to find a way to force you to it and only the certainty that he cannot do so publicly has prevented him from having you bound over already he has asked my advice on the subject he has even toyed with allowing massid to abduct you by the way and it was with great difficulty i persuaded him that this was a bad idea i finally pointed out that the king would probably send the corsairs in pursuit despite the season since you are his cousins fosterling i believe he wants this dealt with before the midwinter moon and i believe that he intends to find a way to trick you or coerce you into agreeing within the next few days she turned an indignant and appalled face to him surely you are in jest he shook his head but i have a plan well daughter lord fersons voice was low but strong enough to carry to the heads of the nearest tables i believe you may have divined my will by now with regards to a marriage with prince massid moiras head came up abruptly and as she turned to face her father she allowed her real feelings to show on her face yes i have she said clearly and more than loudly enough for most of the room to hear her it was something of a relief to be able to drop her mask at last enough to show her anger and her resentment and i find it difficult to believe my lord that you are so willing to flout the law and the will of the king in this matter if she had not been warned she might have tried to dissemble as it was though her father was not aware of it his wine had been mingled with a much more potent distilled spirit all evening courtesy of kedric and she had her response ready hoping to push him into acting without thinking exactly as she had expected her fathers face darkened with the flush of anger and the liquor seething in his veins spoke for him i find it difficult to believe that my own daughter who owes me her life and her obedience is so willing to flout my will she stood up and felt her hands trembling she did not bother to try to hide her agitation it would serve her purpose i am an obedient daughter my lord but the kings will supercedes my will and yours anything less is treason nothing supercedes my will in this keep ferson roared rising to his feet although massid placed a restraining hand on his shoulder forget that my girl and you will learn the truth of it to your sorrow sorrow she uttered a brittle laugh if that is all you can threaten me withi have rights my lord and not even you can take those from me and i say i will not agree to this treasonous marriage by now every eye was on the dais there would be no keeping this secret from even the lowest scullery boy and by the looks on the nearest faces fersons words were not going down well one did not threaten the keep lady she embodied the luck of the keep when she was contented the storms were few and the storm harvest rich moira could tell that people were beginning to think about the tooearly and toofrequent storms of this winter they were also thinking that ferson was talking about marrying the luck of the keep to an enemy and that when the king got wind of it there would be hell to pay her father was oblivious to the sideways glances the unease in the hall he was too consumed with rage his face nearly purple i tell you she continued passionately in the words kedric had chosen for her to speak i would rather wed your fool than allow this massid this foreigner to touch the smallest finger of my hand for one moment she was afraid she had overreached herselfthat she had gone just a little too far that her father who was so much more practiced in deception than she would see through her but her father seized the bait like a ravenous shark his head came up and his eyes flashed with rage oh you would would you he turned to the rest of the room and thrust his fist in the air you have heard it you are all my witnesses she will not take my choice of husband but wishes to marry the fool he turned back toward her and seized her hand expecting this she did not resist him as he dragged her to where kedric sat on a stool at the back of the dais with a wrench he flung her at kedrics feet kedric moved with amazing swiftness somehow managing to put his lute aside and catch her before she fell take the ungrateful wretch fool her father bellowed she would rather be wed to you well i declare it here and now and before witnesses in an ugly parody of the peasant fisherfolks wedding rite he pulled off his own belt and bound their right hands together then poured the remains of his wine on the floor in front of them following that with the entire contents of the saltcellar wed and bound i declare you wed and bound you two are by fruit of the land and the fruit of the sea and the power of the lord of the keep even though this was exactly what she had wanted moira felt her knees start to buckle and with surprising strength kedric held her up and know that if you dare to touch her carnally fool ferson growled under his breath ill have your stones for fish bait i understand my lord kedric murmured back now take her away from my sight and keep her out of it until shes ready to obey ferson shouted take her and teach her curse you both kedric stopped only long enough to pull fersons belt from their joined hands and scoop up his lute then with one hand cupped under her elbow he hurried her off the dais and across the nowsilent great hall moira felt the eyes of every person there on the two of themand with a prickling of her skin she looked back over her shoulder to see that massids eyes black and cold bored across the expanse of the hall with that same terrible inhuman anger she had glimpsed once before she was glad to have kedrics hand at her arm and gladder still to slip into the shadowed hallway where massid could no longer see her youll have to keep out of his sight for now kedric murmured as they hurried down the hall to the keep ladys rooms a cold draft chased them down the hall blowing out lamps in their wake ill have food brought to you he opened the door to her rooms and they stumbled inside as the last of the lamps blew out in the hall behind them and if you want to avoid accident i think that you had better stay out of sight of massid she retorted feeling her spirits return as she closed the door of her rooms behind him hurriedly i know i felt his eyes burning into my back and it was not just with rage kedric replied catching hold of both her arms my ladymoirathose words your father saidi did not plan for a marriage she laughed weakly we plotted better than we knew we are well and truly wedded my dear fool not merely betrothed as was the intention it is no sham that is a legal and binding ceremony by the traditions of the fishing folk hereabouts it will take the king himself to undo the knot although i do not think my father intends you to enjoy your wedded state i think he means for you to berate me torment me with your sharp tongue and humiliate me until i would take even massid to get away from you i believe you he put his back to the door and looked at her soberly my lady i fear i may have overstepped myself with my own socalled cleverness if massid is indeed the magician here as you think then he is still at dinner trying to undo the damage my father has done and very much occupied with repairing the situation she replied which means that you are free to speak to your master i very much doubt that my servant will return here before morning so we will not be disturbed his somber gaze brightened so i am and perhaps he will have some better news fishing in the bag hanging from his belt he brought out a piece of chalk from one of the cliffs and bent to mark out a diagram on her hearth it seemed to consist of six interlocking triangles and when he had finished it the thing seemed to pull at her eyes in a way that made her feel very uneasy she didnt have to look at it for long however no sooner had he finished it than he slapped his right hand palm down into the middle of it obscuring the center the chalked lines suddenly flared with light she looked away for a moment and when she looked back she had to stifle a little scream of alarm there was a disembodied head made entirely of fire suspended above the flames of her hearth it was the head of a balding man with a thick fringe of hair at about ear level encircling his pate and a pointed chin the eyes looked like holes in the flames of the face master kedric began be still the head said i havent much time have you learned massids purpose there not the chief purpose though ferson attempted to push through a marriage to his daughter tonight kedric said but i have learned that someone here is performing magic to create a false beacon during storms that will decoy ships onto the rocks the head interrupted him the beacon have you countered the magic that is changing the beacon have you even discovered what it is kedric shook his head and the head in the fireplace swore listen the king has been forced by a crisis to sail this very day for linessa with most of the fleet his convoy must pass by highclere to reach it you must make certain no one there learns of this if the beacon is wrong master you must warn him impossible no birds could reach him from the shore and there are no magicians with him that can speak at a distanceit is combative magics he needs and those are the magicians he took kedric at all costs you must see to it that no one learns that the fleet has sailed and if a storm comes up you must counter the false beacon at all costs the head turned as if looking elsewhere i must go heed me counter that magic the head vanished the fireplace held nothing more than glowing coals with a furtive flame hovering above them kedric sagged you wont want to hear this moira said hesitantly but it isnt a question of if a storm is coming one is on the way it will be here by midwinter moon and there will be a high tide at the same time kedric groaned i suppose theres no chance you could be wrong if the king sailed today hell be just off this shore by midwinter moon she shook her head and her hair fell out of its pinning the long braid tumbling down her back she didnt trouble to pin it back up its partly the moon magic and partly sea knowledge and no i wont be wrong she stopped then and stared at the dark glass of the window for a moment why would the king sail now what kind of crisis could put him and the fleet on the water in such haste he sat back on his heels and looked up at her i dont know it would have to be something very serious its risky enough sailing in this season as it is but linessa is the key to the daenae river if it was taken for instance you could sail your invasion force all the way up the daenae and into the heart of the kingdom without anyone stopping you and linessa is another seakeep like this one its next to impossible to reach during winter storms so theres no point trying to bring the army to reinforce it she clenched her jaw and what are the odds do you think that the message that sends the king and his navy in such haste was false and that in fact it came from here i am not the only person who can read the wind and the waves whats more i am not certain but that massid can summon up storms at his will when the conditions are right kedrics jaw dropped as he stared up at her god in heaven a man sent by massid one messengerno one looks very closely at a messenger the man wearing linessa livery gallops in on an exhausted horse gasps out his message then throws himself back on a fresh horse to take the kings reply no one would think twice about it theyve planned this all along with one storm they eliminate the king and his navy she nodded this marriage my father plans was probably never more than a distraction for the rest of the keep folk they will keep their tongues on that and pay no attention to my father and the prince there i must differ with you kedric replied getting slowly to his feet there is a deeper game being played here if massid is to somehow gain control of the coast which is i believe his plan he must have some way to appease the lords of the seakeeps you my dear are that means he will probably play the besotted groom believing he can deceive them and you together they will think they can control him through you you are meant to think the same until it is too late and the khaleems men are in command of all the keeps and the coastline she ground her teeth in anger and frustration but nodded so what do we do what can we do we have a few days yet he replied i will try to find the key to the magic that controls the false beacon and you i am pent up here like a fish in a trap she snarled no you are not you are supposedly isolated here and yet anyone who cares to can seek you out here virtually unobserved i will search for some sort of answer and you he actually smiled thinly you will remain here in state and see if allies come to us the lord may be the head of the keep my lady but i think you will find that you reign over the hands and the heart and kedric she found as soon as the first light of dawn greyed the horizon was right aided by anatha by ones and twos the servants and workers began to come to her or send messages via their friends it was true enough that massid and his men had not thus far exercised any of the cruelty or arrogance for which the men of the khaleemates were notedbut they had not made any friends here either she got the sense that if she had given any sign that she welcomed this marriage the people of the keep would have bitten their lips and kept their tongues still but since she had very vocally and publicly voiced her objection to it not to mention pointing out the treasonous aspectswell it seemed that she had more help here than she would have thought however that help brought disquieting word down in the shelter of the boathouse lay the princes ship that had brought him here no more than a handful of men were here in the keep itself but the servants told her that a great deal of food went down to the boathouse three times a dayand nothing came back up again the prince it seemed might not be taking the cooperation of his ally for granted meanwhile the wind and the waves increased and by midafternoon with dark grey clouds scudding across the hard blue sky she was getting the sense that this might be one of the worst storms the keep had ever weathered massid might not need the false beacon to lure the kings ships onto the rocks if they didnt keep well out to sea and risk being lost or delayed the storm might do all of massids work for him but the wind and the storm might be her allies too that night she huddled at the fire with two of the men who worked the docks and one of the carpenters a set of blocks and a toy boat from the nursery stood duty as massids boat and the boathouse where it was being kept she had spent the better part of an hour being made acquainted with how the boathouse was put together now she was going to use that knowledge to take it apart first you need to make sure that all the ropes are untied or at least loose if you can saw through the roof ties here and here she said tapping the crude model with her finger and then at the right moment fling open the door to the boathouse so the roof will fly off and the walls will be blown out kedric stared at her how do you know that he demanded she shrugged because that is what always happened to my model boathouses in a good breeze if we can collapse the boathouse and turn the ship loose massids men wont be able to get off it before its at the mercy of the storm well let me deal with the roof ties and the ropes he said firmly we dont want massids little army to know what were up to i can make potions that will dryrot both wood and hemp creating in hours the damage of centuries she blinked you are a dangerous man she said in astonishment can you do the same with iron fittings he nodded childs play she turned back to the servants in that case none of you need be on that dock at all once youve used kedrics alchemical potions weaken the roof ties the hinges and hasp of the door the ropes and anchor chain of the boat itself and every crossbeam supporting that dock or at least as many as you have potion for well let the wind do our work for us she watched as the men looked solemnly at her little model then slowly gravely smiled as they realized what was going to happen because the moment that the doors wentand taking the brunt of the wind as they would they would be the first of the weakened components to gothe roof would fly off the walls collapse and then the whole dock itself would fall apart even if massids men realized that something was wrong they would be too late to escape their boat some would certainly be crushed beneath a cascade of heavy lumber or knocked into the icy ocean the boat itself if it was not sunk immediately would be hit by the storm full force and driven up on the rocks below the keep no one could survive that kedric frowned i dont he began the dockmen explained it to him moira held her tongue no need for her to say a word at this point the men were already turning the plan over in their minds until they could take credit for everything but the idea in the first place and that harmed her not at all they left after making arrangements to have their several gallons of potions waiting at the kitchen door anatha would bring them down as dirty slop water and complain how much moira was making her clean the metalrotting ones would go firstthey took longer to work then the ones that did for wood and hemp you are a dangerous woman kedric said his eyes narrowed ive heard worse and less coldblooded plans out of seasoned soldiers she tightened her jaw is it coldblooded to want to keep my people from having to fight massids beasts in the halls of their own keep she demanded his expression softened a trifle put that wayno he sighed but you may be the death of me as well before this is over buckets of potions and trying to find what magic massid is doing on that beacon i will be worn to a shred at least there will be something of you left when this is over she retorted but despite her sharp words she couldnt help but cast a worried eye over him he was looking worn and tired and if he had slept more than an hour or two she would be surprised yet when she yawned or blinked to stay awake it was he who urged her to her bed if there was nothing for her to door brewed her some strange herbal concoction to help her stay awake if there was and she resolutely turned her mind away from what massid would do to both of them if they lost this hidden war likely he would not even consider the notion that she could have been the author of at least half of the mischief none of his kind gave women the credit for having intelligence but kedricshe remembered all too clearly the cold ire in massids eyes as they escaped the great hall no massid had likely planned something devilishly ingenious diabolically painful and excruciatingly prolonged for kedric that he would have proved himself a true kings man would only make massid the more determined to inflict as much suffering as possible compared to that well there wouldnt be much comparison with what massid planned for her she pulled her mind away from those unpleasant thoughts to find that kedric was staring at her with a most peculiar expression on his face she blinked what she demanded have i got a smudge on my nose i was just thinking thatnever mind he shook his head kedric if you believe any woman would let you begin a sentence like i was just thinking and end it with never mind you truly are a fool she snapped her brows furrowing with irritation all right he held up his hands i was just thinking thatthis is going to sound very stupidi was just thinking that i owe your countess a great apology as well as a debt of gratitude she raised an eyebrow and regarded him expectantly i owe her the debt of gratitude for sending you he elaborated although i confess that when i was told you a mere slip of a child was supposedly a grey lady i was very angry and sure you would be less than useless so i suppose i owe you an apology as well i could never have hoped to stop this without youi was never meant to be an assassin and i cannot think of any other way of removing massid she smiled grimly thinking of her own training and the weapons still hidden in her chest you would never have gotten past his bodyguards she replied firmly they are trained as assassins the khaleems require such since treachery is so much a part of their lives not unless you could conjure up some subtle poison and the means to deliver it that they had never seen before alchemysts make poor poisoners he murmured we do not meddle much with physic and medicine we leave that to the healers and doctors she tilted her head to one side curiously why did you choose to become an alchemyst she asked he laughed bitterly trying to transmute this he tapped his hunched shoulder since healers and doctors had so little success at it then well i was apt to it and alchemysts do make good spies the more so when they have other talents to disguise their true nature does it cause you pain she asked regarding him steadily he gaped at her not surprising it was a surpassingly rude question but she had a reason for her bluntness no he replied clearly without thinking then why bother she retorted with a shrug it makes you neither more nor less intelligent nor healthy nor any other thing that matters have you looked at the faces the bodies the hands of my people she continued really looked or because they are merely underlings have your eyes slid right by them i will confess before the countess trained my eyes i would have done the same he shook his head then when this is over do take the time to look see how many of them are scarred twisted missing fingers or toes or hands or feet she nodded as his eyes widened the sea is a harsh mistress and a harsher teacher she often claims a tithe of flesh and blood especially to pay for a mistake but they carry themselves proudly and find ways to do their dutyor find a different duty they do not think overmuch of what they are not and neither should you she had intended to leave it there but her mind was tired and what she had intended to keep to herself slipped out before she could stop it what you are is a clever and kindly man a skilled and wise man more noble in heart than most are by bloodaltogether the sort of man i wish was my husband in truth he stared at her blankly for the first time in a very long time she felt herself flushing blushing so hotly she was sure that her cheeks rivaled the coals of the fire i have said too much more than i ought i was tired more tired than i thought forgive my rudeness my foolishness and forget what i she blurted and got up stumbling out of the room and into the bedroom to hide herself behind the bed curtains and curse herself until she unaccountably fell asleep the transition from dusk to full dark on the evening of midsummer moon passed in the blink of an eye as moira watched from her window she had seen the edge of the coming storm itself just before the sun set and as the light was sucked out of the sky watched as it scurried across the waves toward them on a hundred legs of bluewhite lightning then the storm came down on the keep like a shark on a herring it roared across waves already washing over the lower terraces and hit the walls with an initial blast that shook the entire building she strained her ears for the one sound she was waiting for over the screaming wind the thunder and the howling wavesand she strained her eyes during the lightning flashes for a glimpse of there a tumble of planks and posts slammed up onto the rocks beneath the cliff face and there for just one moment farther out than she would have guessed a glimpse of a slim fighting ship masts stowed and sails safely stowed away belowdecks tossing on the crest of the waves like a childs toy whirling rudderless and out of control she bit her lip in grim satisfaction and turned at the sound of a familiar step a familiar tap upon the door its said kedric he looked at her in shock yes it is she agreed shifting her sword belt a little its quite gone boathouse ship and private army now it is up to us he continued to stare in disbelief so she had managed to keep one secret from him at any rate massid knows that the king is out there somewhere she said waving a hand vaguely in the direction of the window and i have questioned every servant that has ever been around him when a storm has struck i know where he goes and i know he goes alone i am going to stop him strange irony that where he went was the timber room she must have just missed encountering him there dozens of times you but if i am to succeed i desperately need you to deal with my father and massids men she continued i dont know how but you must keep them occupied keep them from learning what just happened to massids ship and keep them from going to fetch massid she threw a mantle on over her armor it looked enough like one of the loose gowns she favored particularly in the uncertain light that he might not notice what she wore beneath it for a few crucial moments you said yourself that you are not trained as an assassin well i am the look on his face might have been funny under any other circumstances she hoped that she would survive to laugh about it later to laugh about it with him later please god he wont be expecting a female assassin she continued staring into his dark stricken eyes willing him to believe her im going to pretend i followed him to beg his forgiveness and ask for him to take me as his wife that should let me get close enough perhaps if you went to my father and told him you had persuaded me he swallowed hard that might suffice my lady he said his normally melodious voice gone harsh i will do that she ducked her head to avoid the pain and the fearfor herin his eyes thank you she murmured and started to push past him but he seized her before she could get out the door and pulled her to him holding her in an embrace that probably hurt him given the armor she was wearing he cupped one hand behind her head and crushed his mouth down on hers in a kiss that felt as if one of those lightning bolts outside the window had struck her on the lips she couldnt breathecouldnt thinkdidnt want it to end he let her go and she stood wideeyed and swaying staring at him you will return to me wife he grated his eyes wild you will come back to me whole and unhurt for grey lady or not i shall not give you or myself up to the service of any other nor shall i let anyone part us even if he be the king himself and if you do not come back to me then by the signs and the seal i will follow you though it be to the gates of heaven or hell with that he whirled and was gone his footsteps halfrunning echoing down the hall amid the noise of the storm she stood swaying a moment more somehow managed to get some sort of control over herself and walked with swift but uncertain steps to the first servants stair that would take her where she needed to go it was a good thing she knew the way by heart because most of the lanterns were out and she fumbled her way through the darkness in a kind of daze half of her wanted to shout with elation and the other half was frozen with fear for despite her brave words she was not even remotely certain that her ruse would work women were used as assassins all the time in the khaleemates though usually it was poison in the festive cup or a knife in the dark the pillow over the face or the serpent in the bath but there was no guarantee and no guarantee that massid himself was not an assassin and had already recognized her for what she was she stumbled out into the open space of the timber room looking every bit the confused and distressed maiden she was sure though it was not by design the cavern echoed with the storm below and all around strange drafts whipped her clothing tightly to her body and the flickering and uncertain light made bewildering shadows everywhere she could not see massid massid she croaked her voice not even carrying a foot from where she stood she coughed and cleared her throat my lord prince she tried again massid my lord a movement that was not shadow warned her and she half turned as massid clad from head to toe in black rose up from behind a pile of masts she could not see his face but there was anger in his voice what do you want woman he growled this is no time for the idiocy of females begone she stumbled toward him deliberately trying to make it look as if she could not make out her footing but she knew every stick and plank in this room where it was and how steady or unsteady it was underfoot her stumbles at least were feigned my lord she said plaintively my lord i have sinned against you and my father i was evil disobedient my mind polluted by that wicked woman with whom i have lodged all these years i know i was wrong to say what i did i know that i never deserved the honor of being made your wife and in spurning you i enough the unmistakable sound of a sword being unsheathed made her freeze where she stood do you think i do not know about the countess vrenable and her grey ladies do you think i had not guessed that you were one of that detestable creatures polluted assassins he took a step closer and it was all she could do to keep from shrinking backward how like that weakling king of yours to hide behind skirts and send little girls to do his work well there is no dishonor to a blade in using it to spit a viperand there will be no dishonor in using mine to rid the world of one more poisontongued witch he leaped and that was enough to shock her into dodging not backward but to the sideto fling off her mantle and throw it at him in the hopes of entangling his blade while she unsheathed hers dagger and rapier together a gust of wind caught it as she got her sword clear and threw it over his head her body recognized her one chance even though her mind went blank her body acted as she had trained throwing her forward in a long low lunge under his flailing blade flinging her arm out in a swift strike her body followed up the hit as the blade instead of encountering the resistance of armor and a blunted tip slid into his gut as a fish slid through water her arm wrenched upward of itself driving the blade in and up until it grated against bone and hot wetness gushed against her hand and her body drove home the dagger into his throat as he flailed at her head with the hilt of his sword in blows already weakening until he dropped to the floor of the cavern taking her weapons with him his eyes stared up sightlessly at the ceiling she turned and stumbled away a few paces and fell to her knees heaving and retching until there was nothing left in her stomachand weeping hysterically between each bout of gutwrenching sickness then out of the darkness a voice and hands on her shoulders moira moira by god if he has harmed one hair she turned into his embrace laughing and weeping at the same time the taste of bile bitter in her mouth and her throat raw youll do what bring him back to life so that you can beat him fiat lux came the unexpected words and the cavern blazed with light from a globe that appeared just over kedrics head oh my love he wiped her mouth and chin with his soft linen sleeve then dabbed at her eyes with the napkin someone behind him handed to him he took her chin and tilted it up youll have a black eye in the morning he said with calm matteroffactness that belied the fading fear in his eyes and a sore stomach yes well ive never she made herself say the words ive never killed anyone before i supposei she started to relax in his embrace then pushed him away in alarm father she exclaimed lord ferson has met with an accident said kedric i dont know the details your cook tells me i do not want to know the details there was some little todo in the great hall when one of massids men came up with the news that the ship the boathouse and the dock were all gone unaccountably they blamed meand your loyal retainers rushed to my defense she took in his own battered face now for the first time kedric she exclaimed anger replacing the sick sourness in her stomach are you hurt did they and you will do what send out men with nets to haul in what was thrown out the window with some difficulty he curved his swollen lips in a smile i think we should both save our energy to deal with the king he is not going to be very happy about losing his fool and his grey lady she brought up her chin at that covering her winceshe thoughtrather well he will not have a choice she said i am the keep lady and you are sealed and bound to me by the keep lord and my own will if he does not wish to begin a revolt of the seakeeps he had better keep his opinions on the matter to himself well said my lady crowed someone behind kedric and the fool began to laugh shaking his head oh you are a terrible woman moira of highclere he said tears leaking out of his swelling eyes i fear for my sanity if not my life but the arms that held her did not release her in fact he pulled her closer as some of the men behind him began to chuckle come along with you he pulled her to her feet though his own balance was none too steady do you think it is possible in this howling gale to manage a bath for your lady he called over the storm eh trust a fool to want a bath at a time like this someone shouted mockingly and everyone laughed as they parted for the two of them to pick their way across the lumber and down into the heart of the keep again yes she thought with warmth and a sudden feeling of contentment trust a fool i shall certainly trust a fool with all my heart for all my life the heart of the moon tanith lee dear reader the heart of the moon is of course the heart of a cool strong and selfcontrolled woman in this case clirando she wears a mask because shes been hurt and because she is tough she challenges what hurt her and drives it off but most of us know there are things that discard or deny them as we may leave their marks on us like the scratches of a lion some fade some scar the scars are still there to be looked at long long after i wanted very much to find a way to free my character from her hurt she deserved that but like most of the ones i write about she or others in this tale told me how her freedom would come about she needed not only new light but the means to confront the shadows when zemetrios entered the story and showed his worth the core of the narrative began to flamethe fireheart was being refueled in fact i first saw the heroines name in a dream written across a white moon above a dark isle its a kind of play on words too i believe clirando clear and do prologue lightning the moons face is cold but her heart is full of firehow else could she give such light the night that lightning struck the temple of the maidenthat was the night she found them clirando would never have suspected the warrior goddess parna of such harsh melodrama though justice of course was partly her province it seemed she had wanted clirando to see and to know perhaps she had expected clirando to behave differently after it had happened the narrow streets of amnos were moonandtorch lit and people were shouting and running up toward the sacred mount where stood the temples of the father and parna the maiden smoke and a thin flame still sizzled from her roof and the seawashed air was full of the reek of scorching stone but by the time clirando reached the lower terrace men were already on the tiles girls too from the various female warrior bands clirando saw two of her own command oani and erma busy there she shouted to them are you safe yes safe cliro but come up one of the men no less than the architect pholis swathed in his bed gown called down use the stairs no more swarming on ropes here the roof is damaged so clirando and several others ran up the final terrace and in from the side court there were guest rooms off the court priests and others used them if they were on duty that night at the temple almost everybody had come out they stood around the tank of crystal water under the fig tree talking shaking their heads some offering prayers two people were late however leaving a room as clirando walked into the courtyawning she afterward recalled for the levinbolt had woken her from sleep like most of the townshe saw them one was araitha her closest friend the other darkhaired thestus clirando knew them both so well that for a long moment it did not startle her to see them there she was pleased very probably her best friend as well as her lover thestus both of whom would be excellent at assisting on the roof even with his hand slipping from araithas shouldereven with the way araitha suddenly drew aside from him her eyes blank with far too many emotions to show and his rasp of guilty laugh hacliro are you going up too that was a strike and no mistake a wonder the temple withstood behind the two of them the curtain of the little room had been drawn back to show a disheveled bed narrow but still wide enough for the pair of slender and hardmuscled figures who had chosen to couch there together a flagon of wine stood on the floor in the greyred moonandtorch mixing of the light it gleamed in a horrible way blinking and winking at clirando like the center of an evil eye didnt you guess girl it seemed to say didnt you know clirando walked past the water tank and met thestus and araitha at the door of the cell and pushed them both back inside they let her do this not resisting thestus was taller than she but araitha was her own height araitha with her beerbrown eyes and long dark golden hair thestus had always honestly praised that hair and other things araithas warrior skills her musical gift with lyra and tabor clirando araithas sisterfriend since they had been six years old in the training courts of the temple was always happy when others praised araitha as for thestus he had come to the father temple a warrior with his own band of twenty men only two years before he had singled clirando out inside three days as she had him since the spring festival they had been lovers parna never minded such liaisons her warriors were also allowed love and to make children if they wished clirando shook her own long brown hair over her shoulders and looked at him then she looked at araitha neither of them spoke thestuss mouth locked shut as if a key had turned behind his lips it was araitha who laughed now and said scattering her words light as beads oh cliro it means nothing we onlyonly for a moment that was all liar clirowhat could it matter we both love you do you she threw back her head defiant grudge me a little pleasure always her way attack was defense to araitha i grudge you this thestus opened his locked lips and spoke to araitha dont try to reason with her we both know what she can be like when she loses her selfcontrol cliro turned and slapped him stingingly across the mouth he swung aside with a curse was already reaching for the dagger lying in its sheath on the floor araitha made a noise cliro kicked thestuss hand away then kicked thestus full in the chest so he fell back bruisingly on his wellformed butt no said cliro soon but not yet sweetheart cliro said araitha clirando no longer liked the sound of her name from her friends beautiful mouth the mouth was very red and swollen from thestuss kisses tonight maybe that was why the name of cliro sounded wrong be quiet you bitch both of you ill issue the challenge now so you know in seven days at first light before the maiden first you i think thestus for the shorter time ive known youif ever i knew you at all a little later for you araitha you filthy slut i am no you are a slut you are a traitor to me him i hate but you i hate the most i called you friend araitha began to cry like any soft merchants wife clirando turned her own eyes burning she stalked out and across the court where the others standing there who had seen most and heard all of it murmured together she knew that anyone other perhaps than some great sage would have felt shocked pain and anger but aside from her personal hurt this very publicly witnessed betrayal showed her own judgement up poorly no one could fail to be aware she had been in ignorance until tonight clirando was a commander in no respect could she be seen to have been stupid she thought now in horror that blind to their antics she might well have trusted them beside her in battleand possibly been unwise in that too had their desire proved so irresistible honor demanded they should have told her to her face but they had deceived her as if she were some silly woman reared only for the house clirando did not go up to the lightningblasted roof forgive me she said to the goddess in the private shrine beside the main hall amber lamplight starred the goddesss calm face polished marble etched and dressed with gold her eyes were two green stones clirando also had green eyesthestus had said they were green as leaves of the bay tree i cant help mend your roof maiden im shaking like some fool before her first skirmish pardon me the calm face looked down at hers i will meet both araitha and thestus individually in the warcourt before the whole town i think you allowed me to see what those two had done to me to find them out ill punish them oh not a fight to the death but ill shame them both theyll lose their places in amnos and go far away where i need never look at them again do you allow it lady above there came a faint rushingtiles dislodgedand then cries and a crash as they plummeted onto the terraces below is that disapproval lady parna did not answer but clirando had never known her to it was a formality to ask clirandos human course was already set she had long thought though one must respect the gods one could not expect understanding from them they gave favors or hurts according to some indecipherable law of their own and i am hurt she thought struck in the heart she would make them pay her lover her sister there was no other road now to peace arguments among the warriorpriests of parna and the father were often settled in the warcourt in public duel generally it was two men who fought women tended to settle their disagreements with only their bands to witness rarely did a female warrior demand satisfaction of a male in the court though there had been cases now and then clirando had known that aside from the officials and certain priests bound to attend a lot of amnos would crowd into the public seats to see it had occurred to her many people had known about thestuss liaison with araitha some even came to her subsequent to her finding out and confessedamong these was erma from clirandos own band i never knew if i should tell you cliro you should have i know but clirando forgave erma who was holding back her tears she was still young only fifteen five years younger that clirando tuyamel on the other hand offered to skin thestus for clirando i wouldnt want the skin thanks my friend clirando said tuy had laughed fair enough i shall leave it to you then the morning was fine the sun just torching the east when clirando stood on the warcourt and faced her former lover across the clean paving all around the crowd sat in respectful silence there was none of the shouting or merriment that went on when ritual games or war exercises took place here this was a solemn fraught occasion clirando had to steel herself too she had fought beside thestus only once in battleagainst pirates last fall blood raining among red leaves at the edges of amnoss forested shores but often he and she had exercised together they knew each others moves perhaps too well she had thought he would try to surprise her she judged correctly the instant the signal came to begin he dropped onto the ground and came rolling at her like a human hedgehog as she leaped aside his short sword whipped out it cut one of her sandal thongs only her reflexes had saved her from much worse she tore off both sandals and he having stood up again watched her mockingly there was contempt in his face maybe that was only a mask or maybe his looks of love had been the mask she had tried very hard not to examine why he had used her as he had and played her false now certainly was not the time for analysis clirando wondered if he had other tricks and he had having allowed her space to undo her shoes he lounged idly paring his nails so a slight amusement rippled through some of the audience only to be shushed as improper he would not move again to meet her she stood waiting he stood idling he began to whistle a popular tune of the town come on she said her voice carried im here if you want me you come on she knew it was another trick clirando moved toward him slowly then suddenly very fast running as if straight into himveering at the last second a fine pinkish powder spurted from his left hand clouding the air between them he must have taken it out with the paring knife it would have been in her face her eyes if she had dodged less effectively play dirty then a bitter smile touched her mouth he must be scared of her from veering she swung and cut him across the left shoulder blood burst like a flower with a roar he turned on her to her he seemed heavy now graceless he had not bothered to prepare for this only his tricks she had been practicing every day he was a poor warrior brave and strong cunning sometimes but his skill was not so great she had thought more highly of him when she loved him seeing him through lovers eyes wanting him to shine inside six minutes more she had scored him lightly across arms and chest thighs and even his back as he went skidding down from a sidelong blow she did not aim to cripple him he would need his fighters trade where he was going out into the wide world far from amnos but by then he was a mess and losing blood his face pale and congested ugly frantic he was bellowing at her oaths and blasphemies for which the priests would be setting him a penance he told her also and told the crowd why he had lost his sexual interest in her she was too cold he said cold as moon isle with its heartless crags she was too masculine she had no feminine gifts to match her male ones clirando knew these things were lies and saw that possibly in desperation he was trying to unnerve her that way and so catch her off guard she felt nothing by then only the desire to end the fight as he lunged she brought up her blade under his and sent it spinningto be fair his sword had grown slippery from his bloodthen she punched him clean and square on the point of the jaw he keeled over and fell with a crash his already unconscious eyes staring at her all the way down the priest and priestess of the court approached and asked if clirando was satisfied yes but one more thing what is it let him be sent away you know clirando that he must be you have disgraced him before the town he will never fight for amnos again they offered her an interval to rest then clirando said she would meet araitha at once she believed this would be harder but in fact when her sisterfriend came out pale and angry and lovely in the broadening rays of the sun clirando felt nothing still they fought well and without tricks for ten minutes during which each cut the other clirando thought this is too much like play this is too much like times when we have done this for exercise and to learn from each other something came to clirando then the terrible rage she had not wanted to feel and so far had avoided feeling when she loses her selfcontrol he had said clirando lost it some part of her stood in the air watching in astonishment as she slashed and hacked at araitha who was now falling back before her words tried to boil from clirandos mouth she held them in but they radiated from her eyes she believed judging by araithas face finally clirando sprang she went through the swirl of araithas bladewhich afterward clirando found had sliced her left arm from shoulder to elbow as they tumbled over she drove her knee into araithas midriff exploding all breath from her body clirando knelt over her vanquished opponent plucked the sword from araithas loose grip and slung it clattering across the court youre done she hissed araitha had no breath she sprawled away and curled up on the paving crowing for air in the same posture thestus had adopted when first attacking clirando are you satisfied yes she too is disgraced she too will never fight for amnos again a victor might be applauded by the crowd the stands were applauding loudly in the tumult clirando could hear the battle shouts of her own band she did not look did not acknowledge she went below to one of the fighters rooms was bandaged drank a pitcher of ale and fell into a deadly sleep araitha visited clirandos house three nights later it was the hour before araithas ship was to sail taking her away to the distant city of crentis where she had relatives thestus by then was long gone araitha wore a womans dress and heavy cloak and her hair was braided with golden ornaments she stood staring at clirando clirando said who let you in old eshti she doesnt know she thinks we are still friends above the dusk was already full of stars over the little courtyard a tiny fountain tickled the night with silvery sounds and leaves rustled in the trees as the house doves settled through a lighted door eshti the servant woman was already bringing cups of fruit juice and wine thank you eshti said clirando put them there something to warm you the nights turn colder said eshti and she our poor ladygirl this long journey then eshti went to araitha and pressed her young hand in two old ones dont fret dear youll be home in amnos before too long ill see the mistress doesnt forget you clirando had not been startled by her servant eshtis ignorance of what had happenedonly glad eshti who would have been upset had not been bothered with it the market no doubt would have carried the gossip but eshti was a little deaf and besides well known and liked it seemed lips were tactfully sealed when she approached when the old woman had gone clirando found she had dug her sharp nails into her palms she relaxed her fists best she doesnt know then she said but tell me before you go what you could possibly want from me to give you something clirando i want nothing of yours how could you think i would this gift you must take no yes ive had it especially worked for you the ancient women who live in the caves on the mountainsidethey helped me fashion it clirandos heart turned to stone witches lived up there and other mad and dangerous sorts she readied herself for one more tricksome poison or assault araitha spoke softly i curse you clirando its nothing much your life will be hollow as an emptied jar nothing in it but dust love may come and go adventures may come and go but they will echo in the hollow of you and they too will become dust and never again will you sleep oh no that respite from your thoughts will never be yoursunless some drug gives it to you all your life be it short or long sleepless and empty you shall go clirando shrugged youre a fool araitha araitha said nothing her face was like a statues expressionless and blind she slipped away out of the courtyard vanishing from dark to light to darkness in the subtle way of a ghost clirando poured the juice and wine on the ground they had been poisoned by araithas words her childish horrible little bane clirando was not afraid she spent the evening as she had planned reading books and scrolls from her fathers library he had been both scholar and soldier and traveled to many lands at the usual hour clirando went to bed coolly she mused a moment on araithas words but paid them no proper heed just as she always normally did she fell asleep swiftly and slumbered until morning she had suspected it was a feeble curse the trading ship the lion which was to carry araitha to crentis sank in a gale off the unfriendly coasts of sippini all on board were drowned and the ship herself dragged to the bottom only remnants of cargo washing in to the port evidenced what had happened when news reached amnos two months after it was tuyamel and vlis who came in person to tell clirando she heard the tidings quietly when her girls were gone clirando threw a pinch of incense into the watch fire of her private shrine forgive her parna let her live well in the lands beyond death forgive me too for i dont know what i must feel that night clirando dreamed of araitha not drowning nor as she had been in life but veiled and hidden passing through a shadow to a lightto a shadow when clirando woke with a start it was still deep night she lay awake through the rest of it until dawn showed in the window the following night though tired from exercise she did not sleep at all her life was active and under her command she did not think this insomnia could last but it lasted night followed night sleepless she grew accustomed to the changing patterns of moon and cloud reflected on the ceiling even when exhausted as she came to be she lay down to rest at noon sleep would not come it fluttered over the room before the cinders of her eyes brushed her with its wing and flew far far off death it seemed had cemented the curse firmly into a place of power or it was parnas punishment winter entered amnos now was the time of long nights clirando suffered it as best she could when an alarm rang from the towns brazen gongs she leaped down the streets leading her band among the other warriors pirates were trying their luck again made hungry by lean weather they were beaten back into the sea clirandos band did well and sustained no casualties as the season moved toward spring clirando took herself in hand the physician had already supplied her with an herbal medicine which scarcely had an effect now she gained a stronger one with its aid every third or fourth night she was able to sleep two or three hoursthough waking always with a heavy head and sickened stomach the bane will die away in its own time like a venomous plant i must ignore it which will lessen its hold on me she pushed the burden from her would not think of it by day and lay reading through the nights strangely her body young and fit acclimatized to sleep loss even if on the third or fourth evening without slumber sometimes she would see phantoms moving under trees or against wallstricks of her tired eyes surely not real the priestess she consulted listened carefully to all clirando told her the priestess who had been a warrior too in her youth and was now middleaged and stout told clirando gently and you have not mourned araitha no mother ive made offerings to the goddess for her sake and put flowers by the altars in araithas name but i cant mourn iim angry still disgusted still yet you fought her and bested her and ruined her life in amnos do you mean i killed her clirando stared it was because she had to go away that she died no it wasnt you that caused her drowning the sea and the wind did that but you broke her spirit clirando why else did she curse you in that way she could have wished me dead i think said the priestess quietly she preferred you to live and suffer thestus did not curse you he didnt care enough or love enough but araitha was your sister measure her feeling for you by her last acts what shall i do like all of us clirando you can only do what you are able do that the moon which by now figured so vividly in clirandos sleepless nights began to be important to all the townindeed to all the known world from crentis to rhoia and the burning southern deserts of lybirica every sixteen or seventeen years through the strange blessing of the gods there would come seven nights of midsummer when every night the moon would be full seven nights together of the great white orb coldly glowing as a disk of purest marble lit from within by a thousand torches the last such time had been in clirandos earliest childhood she had only the dimmest memory of it of her mother leading her up among the family on the roof each night to seeand of all the house roofs of amnos being similarly crowded with people who let off eastern firecrackers in spiraling arcs of gold and red among clirandos band only erma and draisis had never seen the seven full moons but all of them had heard of the moon isle even thestus come to that he had compared clirando to its unlovely rocks when they fought the isle lay out in the middle sea beyond sippini it was sacred and secret but as was also wellknown on every occasion of the seven nights certain persons had to go there to honor and invoke the moons power amnos would send its delegation of priests and priestesses sometimes others were selected to sail to the isle how they were chosen was never made public and no one was permitted to speakor ever did soof what took place upon the island nevertheless or perhaps because of the silence theories abounded the isle was full of dangerous and terrible beasts also of spirits and demons it was a spot of ultimate ordeal and testand some of those sent there had not returned clirando herself had never speculated unduly she had been too busy too fulfilled in her life the same priestess was waiting for her when she answered the temples summons and entered the shrine beside the main hall in the altar light below the statue of parna the dumpy older woman had gained both grace and presence i have something to tell you clirando yes mother you and the six girls of your band have been selected for an important duty certainly mother well be glad to see to it perhaps not the faintest nuance went over the priestesss face it was an unreadable expressioncaused only maybe by the flicker of the altar lamp you seven are to travel to the moon isle clirando felt her heart trip over itself she swallowed and said to the isle yes you will leave in ten days in order to be there at the commencement of the moon month motherthis is an honor for usbut none of us have any notion of what we must do when we arrive none have said the priestess flatly but then clirando this is both an honor for you as you say a reward for your valor and care in the pastand a penance a privilege and a trial youll have heard disturbing things of the place yes yes mother i thought most of them fanciful forget that impression the isle is supernatural and may produce anything it is a place half in this world and half elsewhere in spots they say it opens on the country of the moon itself for philosophers have decided the moon is not what it appears a disk but rather a world an unlike mirror to our own therefore anticipate magic and great danger sacrifice is common on the isle so is death but too the land is mystical and profound and from death life may spring there is a saying a closed eye may sometimes see more there than one which stares do you consent to go motheri consent but my girls have no fear for them they will be safer than you you clirando are the one the isle requires human presence on it invokes the power of the moon her cold fire but sometimes pain is needed in the process but not from all clirando felt a shadow fall on her like a heavy cloak for traveling her sleepstarved eyes half glimpsed araitha suddenly standing there in the shade behind the goddesss statue motionless with face averted this is my true punishment then you may see it as such said the priestess or as a chance at salvation the seas at this time of year are calm as honey the voyage will last no longer than nineteen days and perhaps rather less go now and tell your band pack anything you may need for battle or for mere existence landscape across night and water in darkness the island there was no moon tonight tomorrow was the moons first night clirando do you see i see the beacons are burning high up the coastal cliffs were gemmed with them drops of brilliant fire each one separated from the next by many miles they were like eyes watching as the boat came in nothing else was to be seen but the luminous rollers of the surf on the shore the galley had put them off as soon as the sun set in the middle sea the isle was visible a black dot far away the captain told clirando the water there was too shallow for his ship but also no man or woman unless called or ordered to the isle might go in any nearer strong and aching for action after the slow voyage the band was quite eager to take up oars and row gradually the sea dulled to a leaden blue and the sky faded like an autumn rose great darkness came scattered with stars the galley had drawn away briefly the younger girls chattered excited or unnerved then they fell silent as the rest the hump of the island grew from the night always still blacker and then the beacons burned out above clirando had been given by the captain a rudimentary map which showed a way in they found the entry soon enough a narrow defile sliced between and below the steep surfaces of the cliffs they followed the sea channel and soon the beacons were left behind them only starlight then shone like steel on the water for perhaps a further quarter of an hour they rowed under the cliff stacks until the channel opened again into an inner bay they drew the boat up across pale shingle a statue of an unknown goddess stood there guarding the beach her eyes glittering grey zircons who is she whispered draisis seleti said maut i think a goddess of the east asked tuyamel do you think its maut cliro clirando bowed to the goddess maybe but whoever she is this is her place well offer some wine when we uncork the skin after they had set their fire the ordinary sounds of arrival and domestic preparation ended then each of the women heard clirando thought the vast stillness close about them it was intense and fursoft and fearful this silence it had in it a kind of tinsel quiveringnoiseless yet always in the ears they spoke the women in hushed tones eating the cold meats and apples from home drinking the wine clirando observed them they were good girls awed and probably nervous yet staying cool and contained this was not like fighting what war asked of you was quite different what the isle asked only the gods knew presently clirando who had not yet drunk took some wine in a bowl along the shingle and poured out a proper measure for the goddess who seemed to be maut haunter of waters let all go well for them lady protect them and allow them to win honor for myself i wont ask you nor for sleep i know even if youd grant it id be unable to receive your gift firelight made the zircon eyes sparklebut only the firelight when she went back they were saying that games were celebrated at a town on the island deep in its interior to mark the seven nights and a great fair was held as well full of wonders with goods and animals on show that came from remote lands she wondered where they had heard this all clirando had ever heard of the isle even on the galley had been mysterious uncanny and troubling someone yawnedvlis clirando said ill take the watch yes clirando they nodded solemnly they believed that their leader had trained herself to need little if any sleep on duty none of them even tuy knew clirando now seldom slept at all why worry them they boasted of her talent for wakefulness as they settled down clirando again went off a short way she sat on a boulder jutting from the stones and sand about forty paces along the beach from here she could see all the long curve of the shingle and beside a cliff path that slipped suddenly up along the rock face it looked to be rough going but they would use it in the morning would they find other people here quickly the beaconlighters perhaps if no one else the sea sighed and crinkled to and fro lit by phosphorescent runners of foam like a lullabyfor some in the red circle of firelight the others had curled up already they were all sleeping heads on rolled cloaks long legs and folded arms relaxed as the limbs of sleeping cats only tuyamel softly snored just audible in the quiet but clirando was aware the snoring would stop once tuy was properly asleep how well i know them i know them better than i know myself clirando regarded the act of sleep sometimes it had seemed to her wandering up to the roof of her own house she had seen all amnos sleeping all the world with only she herself awake forever a pebble loosened by something or nothing and tumbling down the cliff side jolted her into a tremendous jump clirando started to her feet dazzled and alarmed what had happened she had sleptshe had slept for how long her trained eye scanned the stars from their positions she worked out that all of an hour must have passed she did not sleep she had been watching for hours now and then prowling up and down along the edge of the seaand then a deadly chill washed through her and slowly she turned her head the campfire burned low and in its smoky glare she saw that no one now lay curled about it every one of her band had vanished clirando ran forward she kicked the fire up in a blaze drew out a flaming stick and held it high where had they goneand whywithout waking her all around the rolled cloaks undisturbed the impressions of sleeping heads still pillowed into them the last baked apples sat along the fires rim nothing else was there apart from a bit of wood seleti had been carving and the wineskin clirando drew her sword if some enemy were about he she or it must be confronted it was too late for subterfuge here she called and then she gave the ululating battle cry of the band it echoed wildly off the cliffs she hoped against hope for some answering call when her own yell died none came nothing did only the sigh of the waves and the thick glimmering sound of the silence she could not help herself a kind of terror was in her she who could not sleep had slept and her brave girlsnone of them a weakling and all six togetherhad been takenor had goneaway a weird gleam shone out across the water now for a moment she could not think what it was but it was the dawn beginning clirando walked to the sea and plunged in her hands and her feet the water was nightcold shocking her back to some sanity she was alone as all were when it came down to it she must rely on herself whatever had lured or forced her girls away clirando would find it and them while the light strengthened in the east clirando gathered her few belongings together as the last stars winked out she was already on the tortuous path that wound upward from the beach to the high places above just as predicted it was hard going when she at last broke out of the thin clinging shrubs onto the plateau of the cliff top the sun was two hands width above the sea behind and below her the beach and the water but aheadclirando looked inland shoulders and walls of rock palisaded the headland grey and white and grown with sea ivies and wild peculiar flowers quite some way off the plateau tipped over and down into what seemed to be thick forest of pine and larch the dark evergreen trees sacred to night and the gods of hidden things far in the distance other heights rose from the forest and stood on the sky nearby a narrow stream of clear water emerged from the natural stonework thankfully clirando drank from it cupping the water in her hands it was sour and salty here too near the sea but it quenched her thirst when she raised her head a creature was there among the rocks staring at her the wildflowers framed it oddly it was a kind of lion or large lynx yellow eyed with a dappled creamy hide clirando pulled the knife free of her belt she had hunted where she had to for food or protection though she had never seen an animal quite like this one she could deal with it if necessary the beast fixed its eyes against the lean flanks a long tail lashed generally they did not meet your gaze this long was it magical clirando said very low what do you want the lion creature flung up its head eyes narrowed and jaws open to reveal lines of white fangs this gave the irresistibly unsettling impression it laughed then with a final lash of its tail it sprang around and bounded away between the stands of rock it had been a male and obviously not hungry clirando walked toward the plateaus dip and the forest by day the isle was not so silent from the shore the cries of seabirds sometimes lifted and from the forest occasionally other notes however these sounds were sparse and intermittent for this reason the faint shuffling and skittering that started to accompany her progress and which had nothing to do with her own light footfalls seemed at first an illusion some obtuse echo stirred up from the aisles of rock as she moved but in the end clirando knew her instinct that something followed her must be addressed she turned slightly still going forwardand caught a flash of vague darkness darting behind a rock paying no apparent heed clirando strode on but again she drew her knife she could not be sure what tracked her she did not think it was human yet she had not seen enough to judge what sort of animal it might be by then she had reached an area where the cliff plateau bulked upward to a stone hill on the top of which was built one of the great beacons unlike the others along the outer coast this had not been set alight though a thin smell of old fires clung here the beacon itself she saw was built as a round cauldron of stones the kindling stacked ready inside and covered by oiled skins pegged into sockets in the hill this emblem of human activity both gladdened and disconcerted her as she was looking up the skittery soft scuffle came again at her back definitely not an echo of her own movements clirando spun round she froze three things poised on the rock in a curious huddlealmost as if they were chained together by some invisible rope they were unlike anything she had ever seenyet mostly piggish in shape large pigs covered in an ashy black skin from which stuck out spines like those of some lybirican cactus their heads were misshapen with tusks or horns pointing from their jaws the sides of their faces and above their small flat greenish eyes horrible things monsters the very stuff of the legends of moon isle they made no move to attack clirando took half a step toward themthey neither ran at her nor backed away stooping swiftly she plucked up a handful of loose stones and hurled them at the creatures they shied a little at the impact tossing their ugly heads that was all were they the beasts of some local god abruptly all three peeled back their upper lips unlike the lion beast earlier their teeth were blunt and yellow but even so not an encouraging sight clirando rasped her sword out of its sheath she would not turn her back on these things again she thought exactly then a voice called down from the beacon above who is there it was the voice of a woman and not young stay where you are mother clirando shouted till i deal with these pigs the old voice broke into a cackle of laughter pigs is that what you see deal with them i doubt you can something came slithering and bouncing down the stone hill behind clirando she turned affronted but not amazed to be attacked from both sides and saw a large wedge of dark wet bread falling it shot past her landing between her and the pig things let them have that whatever they are a morsel of comfort called the old woman from the beacon and you come up here to me clirando could see the pigs were sniffing after the bread creeping forward to it more interested apparently in that than in the warrior girl so clirando jumped at the hill and ran up it leaping over the loose stones and tufts of lichen at the top she looked back down the pig things were eating the bread sharing it in an unusually wellmannered way among them it had been soaked in wine or beer and obviously pleased them one animal raised its head and from its snout came the strangest sound a kind of jeering whinenearly human so its pigs is it said the old woman clirando turned again and saw her she was sitting around the far side of the beacon weaving on a little upright frame a cloth of grey and red pigs for you she said what are they clirando asked yours said the woman clirando let out a bark of mirth theyre nothing to do with me oh you think not the woman herself wore a mantle that was grey and bordered by red she looked ancient as the rock but her eyes were still black and bright mother said clirando thanks for your help now perhaps youll tell me did a band of girls come by this way warrior women of amnos going to the festival of the seven nights warriors asked the old woman clirando thought she had a clever wicked face theyd be all in their fighting garb with swords and such walking proud clirando nodded nothing like that said the old one thenmotherif they went by you how were they oh i saw no one said the woman i was asleep i lie up in that hut over there while i tend the beacon tonight i must light it for the moon fire to tempt the moon to shine full ill get nothing helpful from her thought clirando the old one had the look she had seen on the faces of certain grannies in the town who found everything the young did funny enjoying scorning and misleading them well my thanks in any case clirando moved off over the hill she passed the leaning hutit looked as if no one had stayed there for ten years or more glancing over her shoulder she noted the old woman had disappeared around a jut of rock had she been real this is a place of demons and shadows at least the pigs were not now on her track clirando reached the beacon hills foot and broke into a fast lope she came to the descent and the edge of the forest just before noon picking her way down she found a trail now and then carved to earthen steps at the steeper spots an altar stood by the path side just in under the trees a black formless stone was there with a wooden cup in front of it holding dregs of honey from the smell prudently clirando took out a sweet wafer from her food store and dropped it into the cup i dont know you but i respect you she said bowing to the altar and the stone then she went down into the depths of the forest dark green at noon as the heart of a malachite story the pig creatures came back that night with the dusk she had thought she was free of them all day clirando had trekked through the forest it was dark as a cellar in parts in others long aisles opened lit by filtered sunlight here and there the conifers gave way to oaks and even beeches about whose roots drifts of flowers sometimes lay but the flowers were small and pale and the leafy cloudbursts of the canopy seemed full of cores of blackness in areas the trunks of the pines massed thick as an army closing off not only all light but any view or path now and then clirando heard birdsong onceonly oncea single grey pigeon sped across from tree to tree she saw tracks of deer and foxes once of a wolf and twice of boarbut none of the animals were ever to be seen elusive as the wildlife her comrades from the band nowhere did she detect any evidence of their passing either freely or as captives little streams went through the forest often falling down over tall rocks into some pool below by such a pool she decided to make her camp that night and arranged it in the sunset hour clirando took from her pack a handful of oat flour and mixed it with water and raisins putting the cake to bake in the fire she sat with her back to the rock the waterfall splashing softly to her left long shadows gathered as the peachy glimpses of the sky cooled well there was no fear she would sleep again tonight clirando had considered what had happened on the beach since she only slept now if drugged then she had been and her band with her they had talked quite a while over the food so probably that was not at fault very likely the wine they had brought was the culprit clirando who drank it the last slept the last she had left the skin today on the shore because it was too cumbersome to carry but who had done it who had put the sleeping draft into the wine and why some new enemy tonight was the first night of full moon the old woman would be lighting her beacon and all the other beacons would also beam out again along the coasts and somewhere the island celebrated like the rest of the worldbut where here in these trees she would see the moon threading through the boughs clear at the center of the glade and over there in that gap clirando ate her oat bread and drank water from the pool she tried not to think of pirates stealing up the beach to take her drugged girls for slaves after all there had been no marks of them anywhere inland it seemed but too likely now they had been stolen away by ship why then did the robbers leave clirando not tempting enough perhaps she thought ironically thestus had praised her looks comparing her to a young lion but araitha was the beautiful one and besides clirando was cold and had no feminine talents in a sudden rage clirando hurled the husk of her bread into the fire a splash of flame rose there i am not cold i have passion i showed you that thestus but best i showed you when i beat you in the warcourt her voice rang hard on the silence as if it hit the darkening sky and in that moment from out of the noiseless forest where not even the birds had sung a farewell to the sun surged up a piercing wailing jeering cry clirando was on her feet weapons ready but after the jeer silence the forest breathed as the sea did leaves touched by faint night breezes not a bird or animal had reacted to the unnerving noise she had the rock behind her the fire and the pool in front a reasonable defensive position she waited tense as the sword in her hand minutes went by three or four maybe longer nothing stirred beyond the pool among the columns of the pines the crysome night bird perhaps some animal hunting no she had never heard such a screech from any animal or bird or been told of one but then again moon isle was scalding her ears and brain searing her heart and blood the awful wail went up again now it had three voices humanit was like the jeering of some insane and evil crowd she saw them trot the three of them from among the trees and the folding cloak of night the pig monsters from the cliff top clirando bent and drew from her fire a long branch ripe with flames she held it aloft in her left hand then purposely she walked by the fire skirting the pool taking measured steps they stood together in a looser formation than before the beast in the middle lifted its lip and out came the mocking cry full blast she would move slowly then sprint straight at them fire for the one most to the left the sword through the neck of the middle one then around to take the third with whatever she had she was shaking inside herself but also lit with fury what happened then seemed like the childish joke of some cruel god something else rushing like a whirlwind bowled directly into clirando sending her headlong and sprawling it leaped over her back as she went downshe felt it go hot as fire pushing herself up the burning branch lost the sword juggled back into her grip she checked in astonishment what had knocked her down was the other animal she had met on the cliffs the lion with the dappled pelt either that or one exactly of the same species it had jumped over her and gone plunging at the three pig things just as she had planned to do as she stood there gasping she saw how it plummeted straight into all three angling its leonine body as it did so the large paws thrashing squealing now all three pigs jumbled away from it they went galloping back among the trees the cat in hot pursuit the last she saw of the incredible scene was the lions creamy tail lashing in darkness like a snake then everything was as it had been and silent once more clirando retrieved the burning branch from the ground and stamped out the scorches it had made uneasily confused she turned to retrace her way to her fire something else was there the reflection of it fire limned went down into the pool clirando straightened and raised her sword her green eyes were wide and burning like the flames that is my place come away from it but you left your place he said casually did you see why i saw something running off through the wood clirando said move over there away from my fire i shant ask you again were you asking very well then as you like when he moved along the poolside and out onto the apron of turf she never took her eyes from him he too was a fightershe could tell from the way he stalked forward the coordination of his movements but he had a beauty not often seen among mortal things found more commonly in wellmade statues of young male gods his hair was so fair it seemed white as mountain snow white as the moon this one also is some illusion or demon he stood now about twelve paces from her backlit by the fire she could see a thin scar high on his right cheekbone and how the muscles flexed in his arms as he slid the knife he had held back into its sheath there were darns and recent tears in his clothing and on one of his boots the silvery trail of a tiny snail that still slid along there then descended to the grass if a facsimile he was a good one he looked real we dont have to quarrel do we he inquired pleasantly we can share provisions perhaps i have some bread and cheese and a little alcohol who are you what are you doing here my name is zemetrioszemetrios of rhoia i was told to come here you too i imagine unless this sacred and terrible place is your home the sword weighed heavy on her hand she thrust it back into the sheath almost startling herself tiredness droned in her head and up her spine very well i accept your words then i may share your fire if you like its the oldest law of the gods isnt it to welcome the stranger but how unconvinced you sound he said he waited for her to seat herself but she waved him down first they sat at opposite sides around them the night was now noiseless and beyond the range of the light impenetrable the moon will rise in about two hours he said he set out his provisions the cheese and loaf the flask clirando had eaten but since she had accepted the terms of hospitality she created another of the oatcakes and handed him an apple she waited until he had swallowed a bit of the cheese before she would try it she saw he noted this but he said nothing she wished he was not here they did not speak beyond the barest civilities after he had drunk from the flask he offered it to her having first wiped the lip of the vessel clirando took one sip for politeness it was some raw spirit of rhoia not really to her taste since were two now he said perhaps we should set a watch you speak like a soldier she said i ami was ive fought in the kings legions traveled quite a distance seen the wonders of the world but thats done now his eyes a clear deep blue looked away into his past clirando could see he beheld something there bleak and unforgiving what else this place was for testing and penance for punishment probably she wondered what he had done then chided herself for being at all interested he might be dangerous that was enough to know well she said ill take the whole watch ive already slept my fill the lie was practiced ready he lifted an eyebrow at her you dont trust me then clirando smiled of course not why should i but ill take the watch anyway if anything occurs i will wake you wake me when the moon rises he said i want to see it the last time i saw the seven nights i was only eight he stretched out with no pretence or air of feeling vulnerable his movements were both masculine and graceful a pleasure for anyone to observe she thought sourly a pity they should be wasted on her i wonder how it is he murmured she can renew herself these seven times together scholars have written he added dreamily theres more than one moon involved in these nightsour own and six of her sisters she calls from other spheres he turned his head a little and fell apparently instantly into sleep it might be an act but clirando thought not the gods knew she had in recent months had endless opportunities to study the sleep of others and for a stupid instant she felt jealous of his ability to sleep so simply to her now it was an alien concept when the moon rose he woke anyway the way in fact clirando herself had often done sleeping in the open they said if the full moon touched your face with her white hand you roused in the past of course clirando had then gone back to sleep there she is said the man called zemetrios he lay still looking up together they stared awhile at the bright disk passing over the glade reflecting like pearl in the pool the moon looks as it always does at full he remarked what did you expect something moreas these are the seven nights he sat up abruptly stretching so she heard the strong muscles crack in his arms ill take the watch now if you like no need she said come on girl youre a trained fighter youd know in a split second if i was trying anythingdoubtless youd kill me doubtless i would but i have no difficulty in keeping the watch myself he said you look tired to your bones clirando blinked affronted and defensive thats for me to judge then ill say no more but at least will you tell me your name you have mine it was true in courtesy she owed him that clirando one of the warrior women of amnos she said shortly yes i thought youd be from there your bands are highly spoken of he paused looking now down into the moonshining pool clirando in fairness id like to tell you something of myself of what sent me here i ask to know nothing or youd prefer to stay ignorant of me well and good but this island is no place for human secrecy or deception nor do i think it the best place to travel alone scornfully she said to him her heart beating too fast so youre afraid of the isle my regrets but im no companion for you i have my band to think of and broke off aware that she had lost her band and very likely would never find them again a wide grief swept through her and a sense of shame she had failed her girls he said do me the kindness then clirando of letting me tell you of my crime in the temples of the father anyone may go and tell his worst sins to a priest if the burden becomes too great and i know in amnos there is also a priestess tradition among the female warriors clirando lifted her eyes from her own emotions and looked at him levelly he took this as his cue clirando did not know if she had meant it to be one i killed a man zemetrios said woodenly he began to gaze again into the pool fair and square you might say in a duel outside my fathers house or my house since my father died last year clirando watched him the moon lighted his face but his eyes were shadowed looking down at the water zemetrios of rhoia told her how the man he had slain had been his best friend wed fought as comrades in the legions since both of us were seventeen he was a fine soldier loyal and trustworthy and clever we were like brothers from the first weve fought side by side in enough battlesbeen promoted to the rank of leader at the same time i was at his wedding a pretty girl a sweet girl i dont know where shes gone now she ran away from him you see that was after he changed into another man a silence what do you mean clirando heard her voice it had a sound of awe zemetrios had caught her with his storytelling she must be on guard zemetrios said he turned into a drunkard oh there had been times in the pastyou fight hard you take leave and drink hard but those sessions are occasional then with yazon they became habitual zemetrios spoke briefly in terse sentences of drunk brawls meaningless and savage fights with citizens of the town that yazon deranged with wine would pick he was a trained fighter you see what that would mean they hadnt a chance he broke their legs and arms and knocked them senseless like cold stones i and others dragged him off doused him in the horse trough sometimes we would have to chain him up like a mad dog till he sobered yazon began to beat his young wife also she fled to her parents house on the hills and later after yazon pursued her there firstly with gifts then with threats to some other land they cast him out of the legions in dishonor he had only his soldiers pension then much reduced since he was young and had ruined his own career yazon zemetrios said went to live in an old fishermans hut near the quay he begged for his living or committed acts of robberytwice ending in the jailpit for a public whipping all he could get in money went on winebad wine now the dross of the waterfront taverns i tried my best to help him clirando id paid off his debts three times id begged the legion to give him a second chancetwice i did that but the second time a second chance was refused he didnt know me mostly anyway said he thought me some enemy by then he was never sober my father was sick by then too i had other difficulties and soon enough the duties of burial and mourning zemetrios paused again clirando said nothing the tale disturbed her she empathized with this unknown man and not daring to trust himthestus had won her trust and araitha had always had her trustwould not speak in the end zemetrios told her that he came from the house one morning to find yazon lying across the threshold he was filthy covered in sores and fleas halfdead i took him in he had been my friend what else could i do cleaned up fed and doctored by a physician yazon was surly and irritable refused more than three cups of wine he stole it from the cellars and broke the pitchers in the courtyard when he was done on a morning when zemetrios needed to report to the town fort yazon attacked two of the kitchen girls he raped one and beat them both with a stick and when someone came running to the fort zemetrios raced to his house and pulled the yowling drunkard out into the square before a crowd of citizens and soldiers zemetrios punched his former friend to the ground threw him a sword and told him to get up and fight it lasted less than the tenth of an hour i never meant to kill him or believed not but he was no longer yazon and i perhaps was no longer much myself either id seen the girls crying my father had kept a kind and worthy house the sword pierced him through cleanly enough he fell over and was dead yazon dead i remember said zemetrios one time in the deserts marching east he and i sat looking at the stars and talked about what we wished for ourselves both of us wanted only good things nothing to anger the gods but he died on the street and i left my legion and sold my fathers house and now the priests have sent me here clirando had been holding her breath she let it go carefully so he should not hear her sigh the full moon reached the perimeter of the trees it slipped behind the canopy looking for a moment broken in silver pieces before darkness closed the view in the morning clirando forced herself to alertness this now was her fifth night without sleepaside from the deadly drugged hour on the beach she had not taken much of the herbal medicine on the galley not wanting her band to guess her predicament or herself to be unready for any demand the voyage might make on moon isle she had always realized she could not risk it at all parnas temple had supplied instead a cordial to help her keep her energy and a clear mind clirando drank from the vial zemetrios after he had made his confession to her had lain back and slept again but not she then saw so well his slumbers were disturbed she felt a mean amusement at it but what if this too were some act i can never trust him he may be a liar and felon orhe may not be real at all was such a thing possible yes there were demons here she had encountered them for what else were the pig things but some type of animal demon a man demon might also be feasible and he had appeared by her fireas if from nowhere she thought grimly and enough demoniac men already exist in the human world they shared bread and oatcakes for breakfast they drank water from the pool he told her then that the priests in rhoia had assured him a large village lay at the heart of the isle deep in the forest and below the mountains this was where the seven nights were celebrated we should make for there was this a lie too or a trap but she could think of nothing else to do against all common sense she had a wild hope the girls of her band might be at this village part of the celebration they themselves had discussed journey they both moved at a steady lope along the continuing track that ran through the trees everything was as it had been a hot day burning up behind the leaves and pine needles freckled sunshafts cool shadows little wayside streams rocks and the rare sound or sight of a bird and once a yellowish fox trotting over their path near noon they came into another glade without water but the turf covered with drifts of the pale flowers vines hung from the trees like nets jeweled by fastripening grapes they paused here picking and eating the fruit from behind the walls of the pines there came suddenly a jeering eerie whoop he heard it too she thought transfixed clirando saw a dark huddle of shapes ruffling along behind the curtains of the vines there were more of them now a whole pig herd of these demons of hers last night she had yearned that the lion cat would catch and devour them but obviously even if it had other members of the tribe existed what is it zemetrios said to her they had until then spoken very little and of nothing beyond their own advance the grapes and the mooted village shaken again clirando said animals he stared over where she did or he said supernatural things can you see them the question burst from her before she could decide to withhold it somethingbut the island is full of such stuff they trouble you he asked turning his blue eyes full on her angrily clirando said what business is it of yours only thisi too am tormented by creatures or images that roam through the trees not animal in that sense they call to me in drunken voicesinsubstantial an army of drunken ghosts as he said this clear as if drawn in paint clirando saw araitha standing between two pines she wore her travelers cloak and her golden hair with its ornaments caught the sunlight her face had no expression clirando began to tremble she told herself dizzily that it was only her sleepless eyes that played the trick she shut them which was a mistake and felt zemetrios catch hold of her lifting her clear of some abyss into which she had been about to fall she pushed him away his strength and quickness alarmed her she was humiliated by her own weakness but he would not let her push him off he held her up and put the flask against her mouth take some no its only water i drank the last of the spirits last night clirando drank the water was still cold and despite his words kept the tang of alcohol it steadied her my thanks let go of me now im well youre not but yes ill let go there she could smell him the health of his young body the clean aroma of his hair and breath clirando glanced at the pines the ghost was gone did you kill her zemetrios asked what you spoke a name two in fact a mans name and a womans you spoke his name with utter scorn and hers withforgive me warrior girl with fear clirando dropped herself down to her knees and sat back she no longer felt faint but drained andwhat araitha had promisedempty this man was real she had disgraced herself by nearly fainting in front of him like some pampered lady what did the truth matter now i killed her not directly but she died because of what i did because she lay down with your lover oh clirando it isnt hard to guess you spoke two names remember she lay down with my lover shed been my friend him i beat in fair fight and he was sent away she also she went to crentis but the ship sank shes dead as you say through me by the father said zemetrios softly she cursed me too clirando gave a small rasp of laughter i cant sleep a slight curse you might think no i dont think that well said clirando lets get on she stood up again the forest was silent and black beyond the sunlight of the vine glade like all her life surely now beyond that night when lightning struck parnas temple why did i trust him stupid to blab it all out to him are you a child or what well he knows now clirando ran lightly beside zemetrios through the glints and shades angry with herself lamenting full of pain nothing had importance only to go on to find her band or if not respectfully to complete this awful and weird penance set her by the priestesses of the maiden and then be done with all of it i too will go away into the east perhaps where people lose themselves because already im lost who is clirando clirando would never have blurted out her secret to some stranger but as they loped shoulder to shoulder glancing up at the stranger from time to time she saw the twitch behind his eyes and once his head turning then snapping around again he too heard and saw devils in the forest as he had said that fact alone was certain and sheshe came to hear sometimes an unearthly low sound that filtered through the trees like wind though the leaves never moved it had for her no noise of drunken voicesthe multiplied voice of yazon in all the moods of his insanity if she detected anything it was the jeering cry of the pig thingsbut now never too close possibly he had been right to travel together might provide a little distance for both of them from their haunts even the ghost of araitha had not drawn near had it been she for sure clirando frowned as she ran they are my devils they come for me out of my heart and mind its only that the forest makes them real but how real could i have gone to her and seized her run her through with a knife clouds massed across clirandos eyes she half stumbled and he turned and looked at her his face was concerned curious a root she said and pushed memory and idle surmise to the edges of her brain the trees began to thin out near sunfall the downward slopes were more gradual and oak trees and wild olive predominated here the track ended abruptly another altar place stood there this one with a whitish stone roughly carved and pocked a sort of uneven globe he and she halted beside it in the bronzy light now slanting sidelong through the trees the globe seemed to pulse with uncanny inner light clirando took the last honey wafer from her pack and laid it by the stone i do not know you but i reverence you zemetrios rather sheepishly she thought put the final sliver of cheese on the altar it was mostly rind any god would disdain itor perhaps not since they would otherwise have eaten it look he said quietly a hare bounded among the olives its long ears brushed with light and glowing red they could have brought the hare down for supper either of them she was certain but in this place neither had wished to or though it wise did they in some ways then think alike no remember thestus the arch deceiver though thestus she believed would have wanted to throw his knife or a rock at the hare and she would have had to stop him as they turned from the altar clirando saw an old man sitting about fifty paces away under a broadleaved tree his hands were busy with something that sparkledand she was positive he had not been there in the preceding moments do you see him yes zemetrios said slowly they walked forward making no attempt at caution the old man did not look up but when they were almost within arms length of him he raised his aged face his eyes were black and keen in the pleated paper of his skin youre going to the village he told them the moon town it exists then said clirando perhaps said the old man what spangled through his hands was a threaded skein of brilliant stoneslike eastern rubies and diamonds they looked he seemed only to be playing with them and suddenly he cast them down zemetrios but not clirando sucked in breath meeting the ground the sparkly web changed instantly to a long and coiling snake marked along its back with points of red and silver oh said the old man sarcastically polite did i make you jump bold soldier yes father said zemetrios goodnaturedly he laughed youre a magician then sometimes a magician sometimes other things sometimes i am a tree they regarded him wordlessly the burnished snake poured itself away and up the narrow trunk of a nearby olive things come and also they go said the old man how great a distance to the village now father not far be there before sunset ends they close the gates at first dark a wise precaution said clirando she guessed zemetrios as she did tried to draw the old man out provoke him into some revealing word or action but he did not reply now only took from the inner folds of his garments another skein of beads moving it to and fro between gnarled hands he crooned what must have been the spell to make a serpent out of it well good evening to you said zemetrios he and clirando walked on about twenty steps farther along both of them turned as one only shadows sat under the broadleaved tree the snakemaker i shall call him that said zemetrios it was a trick an illusion maybe did you see how he did it no but then often you never canthat is the idea of it i met an old woman too zemetrios said the first day when id climbed up from the beach there was an unlit beacon there she wove only cloth not snakes she said she lived in a hut i met her also the hut hadnt been used for years what are they he said softly as they paced on again are they demons too if so i dont recognize them not all demons are recognizable youre sensible clirando she shrugged the ground sloped up now the trees were much fewer in number long stretches of grass and weeds between them and no path anywhere as if though many walked through the forest none ever came as far as this the sun which they could see now hung low in the sky a red ball in a curdling of gold and scarlet cloud they had reached the top of the hill they looked down into the small basin of a valley impending sunset described it exactly fields and groves vineyards and orchards clustered there and from them protruded high walls of dressed stone above which showed tiled roofs and one tall slim tower the village behind everything mountains rose three peaks one behind another and touched sidelong with flame by the dying sun the way down to the valley was easy the slope was broken now by another pathway itself of laid stone and broad enough for three men to walk together at first dark the gates shut he repeated they broke into a racers run leaping down the roadway into the valley village shadows are called by the ending of the day night unfolds her wings with the white moon in her hair clirando shuddered the fragment of song had sounded inside her skull words clear as the plinking of the lyra which accompanied themso clear for a moment she thought a voice had actually sung aloud a hand actually plucked the chords araithas voice and araithas hand it had been a favourite song of hers to play after supper zemetrios this time did not seem to notice clirandos lapse he said there are no lights in this village clirando said nor any lights anywhere among the fields and orchards not one torch burning not a single dog to bark the sun was just now down over the horizon leaving a solitary rift of gold darkness was claiming the landscape but not a lamp shone out anywhere and over the stubble of the fields where already the grain must have been scythed not one figure walked the orchards too had been stripped of fruit which surely would not have been ripe whats happened here zemetrios asked the walls of the villagetown lay ahead of them and in them two tall wooden gates stood wide a street of tamped earth ran in from there and buildings lined the way but there alsono movement and no illumination we must go and see she said the thought of her girls as in her mind they had vanishedand now this deserted village they hurried to the gates and reached them as the final golden wash faded on the skys edge and darkness bloomed like a long sigh over the earth look the gates are closing together not thinking caught by some primal instinct they bolted between the slowly joining gates clirando cursed herself even as she did soto pelt into this unknown enclosure that might contain anythingand heard zemetrios curse louder but by then they were in the gates padded together at their backs and in a fiery chorus at once every lamp torch and candle in the village was or began to be lit the village street the houses and other buildings blushed to sudden life faces appeared at windows and figures emerged on terraces others came strolling along the thoroughfare two men that neither she nor zemetrios she thought had previously seen were securing the gates with bars just in time travelers one of the men remarked to them then down the street came striding a giant creature tall as the roofs her black hair swinging as she swung her impossibly long legs a lighted brand in her grasp with which she brought alive the last torches leaning from house walls zemetrios laughed clirando glared at him had he gone crazy a stiltwalker clirando he said and looking back clirando saw the woman who was dark skinned as a lybirican was perched on two long poles each swathed in her abnormally long white skirt a child ran up then she carried a basket of apples and dates and offered it to them zemetrios reached out at once clirando said be wary im hungry clirando yes but if you eat that you may also be dead or he conceded this is magic food but the child waited there smiling and holding up the basket which had been lined with vine leaves before either of them could decide a man rode by on a brown horse and called the child to him bending from the saddle he took a fruit and bit into it are these truly people zemetrios asked that one there on the horse the childor are they another sort of demonillusionseven figments come from our own heads we both see the same things here said clirando men with snakes lamps lit a horseman and a child a basket of fruit yes but suppose another man tapped zemetrios on the shoulder zemetrios shot around to find the fellow bowing low he wore the leather apron of tavern staff come to our innhouse warriors it is a fine house the best wine on the isle good meat and newbaked bread our rooms are of the nicestthough were full for the celebration of the seven nights still one or two choice chambers remain we also boast a bathhouse and water always hot from a steamy spring come to our house warriors he sounds like any tavern tout from rhoia to ashalat murmured zemetrios the man swayed beaming and bowing all through the village circulated the usual evening street sounds laced now with rills of laughter and notes of music above a woman called across from one balcony to its neighbor and in another window another woman appeared with a little pet dog on her shoulder the scene was normal perplexingly so as he had said rhoiaor anywhere thriving in the civilized worldwould parade like this after sundown even amnos clirando said to the taverner whats the name of your inn the moon in glory zemetrios added and why does your village hide until the gates are shut and why is there no one out in the fields and not a single light oh master its our custom on the seven nights soon as the sun starts to sink we sit in quiet and not a candles lit till the last rays gone then we shut the gates and every light is kindled as for the country about whyeveryones here of course they are where else to see and salute the great moon zemetrios turned to clirando do we believe him oh believe me master the taverner had a round face that now grew anxious the innkeeper will be displeased if i lose him custom sidling nearer the man whispered hes a skinflint and he loves to make money ah money then i reckon this is real enough clirando looked about her her weariness pushed against her back and shoulders who cared if it was a trap or an illusion she should not think this way but she said we can see for ourselves the man skipped before them up the street and along an alley to a blueplastered wall out of which a lemon tree grew its hard green fruit scenting the air a boy all smiles as well whisked open a gate into a yard torches blazed on walls nightperfumed flowers spilled luxuriously from urns there was additionally the smell of good bread and roasting joints and over the low wall steam puffed from the domed roof of a little bathhouse just as promised oh clirandoforgive me i cant resist zemetrios sounded both amused and charming nor i she admitted but with chilly reserve yet from nowhere the oddest feeling fled through her what in the maidens name was it in dismay clirando accepted it had been a moments natural pleasure as if her life was quite natural too and the town her friend and zemetrios this unknown fighter from another country someone she trusted liked and perhaps much more night unfolds her wings with the white moon in her hair and love rises from her bed of dreams to waken all the sleeping earth what is it cliro she gazed at him stricken i can hear a song i can hear it too about night and the moon and love ive heard it in rhoia its an old tune something loosened in her she thought even if this is fakery we both see and hear the same things now something in that and besides that voice singing is a boys not hersnot araithas it was only after they had parted to seek the male and female sections of the bath that she recalled zemetrios had called her cliro as if long familiar with her and close despite the taverners boast the inn seemed not that fullor certainly not the bathhouse clirando had the three narrow rooms to herself she washed in the first under the tepid fountain and then soaked in the second in a pool of delicious heat that blanketed her up to the chin an attendant in the first room washed her hair now it spread about her in the hot pool scented like the perfumed shrubs outside finally she sprang into the last cold pool with a hiss of anguish that quickly disappeared as the water toned her muscles closed her pores and awarded her a feeling of vigor she might have slept a whole night through it seemed to her there must be special salts in the spring that fed the bathhouse which was often the case she felt literally renewed her eyes clear and well focused her blood moving like waves of light unnerving her less now the feeling of pleasure almost of happiness and anticipation continued and grew stronger she thought of tuyamel tilting her head doubtfully and vlis chuckling and young draisis enthusiastically vindicating happiness at all costs ill find them clirando thought kicking her feet in the cold water as a child might i shall find them here this village tonightor tomorrow ill ask and ill look for them but she knew her exhilaration had to do also with zemetrios she felt lenient with herself why should she not be glad at the company of an apparently decent and highly attractive man every reason but as that warning voice stirred at the back of her mind clirando kicked it up in the air with the sprays of cold water then she climbed out and dried herself shaking her hair like a dog he had already commandeered a table for them and two benches tucked into a wall nook he had ordered beer which generally clirando preferred to wine she thought he himself did not care that greatly for wineunderstandable if he had seen its ill effect on yazon they talked to each other now freely again as if wellknown to each other and quite at ease but the subjects of the conversation were only the excellence of the hot water the types of food the inn offered all around a crowd massed at the tables and serving girls and men went to and fro clirando saw no one else she knew i have hopes my band of girls reached this village she said at last i was separated from them after we brought in the boat he looked at her consideringly it was like a question and reluctantly after a few seconds she heard herself say they vanished from the beach theyd been sleepingand i tooi fell asleep which now i never can unaided there was some drug in the wine before she knew it would happen he put his hand briefly and warm over hers im sorry clirando ive heard so many tales like that about moon isle it will come right youll make it so his touch chimed upward through her flesh she stared resentful at her own hand as if waiting to see a burn or scald appear where his fingers had rested gruffly she said i mean to walk about the village to see if i can learn anything dont ask any of them here he said surprising her id guess youll learn nothing that way i thought you believed this innthis villagetrustworthy did i say that no i said it was all irresistible she saw he too was looking intently at her hand suddenly he said i like your hand clirando of amnos forgive me but the firmness and the callus there from a warriors knife my first love i have to tell you was a warrior woman even before that my mother had belonged to a band but then she wed my father and gave it up clirando frowned did he force her to no he was an honorable man it was her choice she never lost her edge though she would wrestle the other girls for practice and she could ride as well as any man better than many she was the one who taught me horses the food came and they ate dipping the warm bread among the sauces tearing off chunks of the succulent roast around and about the inn went on as inns did everywhere in the known world clatter of dishes clink of metal cups mirth and singing the occasional quarrel roused and calmed abruptly a long high call went through the room the moon shes risen not one person kept their seat even the servers went out they all stood on a high open terrace above the yard there on the wall balanced the moon round and blazing white yes said zemetrios something new after all she looks whiter here dont you think clean and cold a man spoke behind them it is the snows that cover her clirando turned a merchant well dressed and well groomed wiping his ringed dinnergreasy hands on a napkin snow zemetrios queried he smiled indeed so our sages tell us at midsummer in this our world up there midwinter comes the snows fall thickly and so the moon shines so white the moon is also a world then clirando asked innocently it was what the priestess had said but she thought of zemetrioss stricture to ask anything here would be profitless perhaps something so esoteric would not matter do you see that mountain the merchant pointed back over the roof of the inn the other roofs of the village and up into the sky where all three peaks showed as if faintly drawn on by a brush the central height is known as moons stair there is they say an entrance up there that leads between the worlds and out onto the surface of the moon sleepers often travel to the moon as do sorcerers or priests in a trance but physically theres only one way and that is by climbing the mountain called moons stair zemetrios said ive heard of an entrance to the lands beyond death thats in the east like that then said the merchant or maybe its all lies his grin was crafty knowing it seemed he understood quite well what zemetrios had said to clirando earlier down in the yard servants were lighting the tails of firecrackers now they dived upward on flights of glittering topaz clirando thought surely they would have done this last night toowe should have heard something of it seen it even far above the forest she was unable to feel alarm at this not even suspicion when she glanced back the merchant had gone in returning apparently to his meal others were jostling down the terrace steps and across the courtyard come watch the magicians came the cry now shall we go and see the fun he said perhaps if your girls are here no doubt theyd go to see isnt that the best chance clirando thought of draisis and fifteenyearold erma she nodded as they followed the rest of the people out of the alley and along one of the wider village streets zemetrios said in her ear one further thing clirando the inns so full the taverner could offer us only a single apartmenti mean it has only one bed he seemed to reckon us partners but i assured him you would use the room and i would take a place in the common area clirando was jolted she did not know why then thought she did no zemetrios you take the room you know i never sleep a place on a bench is less trouble for me no cliro you must have the bed its more comfortable particularly if sleep eludes you what she scowled at him you think me some soft little lady even when i could sleep i managed as well on a rock as a couch zemetrios burst out laughing for an instant her annoyance increasedthen melted clirando began to laugh too excuse me she said of course youd think of nothing of the sort of course not it was only your fairness offering me the bed i thank you but no need you take it still following the crowd they were turning now into an open square well argue it later he said the moon fired white arrows through the garden vines that overhung the square the tall narrow tower seen previously rose from one corner and nearby was a temple to the father its crimsonpainted columns gilded with torchlight a grove of trees grew in the center of the space they were clearly sacred carefully shaped conifers strung with baubles and little masks made from fine lybirican paper a line of four men sat crosslegged on the ground before the grove they wore vivid clothing sewn with glinting beads red yellow green and blue the people elsewhere in the square had also sat down except for latecomers at the back among whom were clirando and zemetrios behind them was only the high wall of a house to begin with the four magicians acted out a short play they were traveling performers clirando thought but during the drama a burlesque that concerned a runaway servant a harsh master and a mischievous god magical effects abounded at first they were of the sort that clirando had watched many times from such troupes at amnos birds flying out of sleeves coins found in ears objects disappearing and then reappearing somewhere unexpected bit by bit however the magic became more miraculous and much stranger the man in the yellow robe who played the servant opened wide his mouthand out darted a silver frog swiftly pursued by six other silver frogs from the same spot all these bounced about the square finally leaping together and becoming a silver ball which rolled away under the blue robe of another man he who played the god the actor who played the master meanwhile lit a fire on the bare earth by sneezingor pretending to sneezedirectly at it the fourth mageactor who had taken all the other parts suddenly assumed the head of an ass clirando could not see how he managed this one moment he was manheaded and the next not the asshead was also extremely convincing waggling its ears and letting out mad brayings through wrinkling lips the play ended with the cruel master punished and the servant rich all four then danced a maniacal stamping dance to the twanging accompaniment of entirely invisible musicians laughter had rumbled through the crowd shouts of approval encouragement or chagrin at the plight of the characters clirando and zemetrios were not immune they had laughed and shouted too the fourth magician now reached into the fire and drew out two handfuls of it flames burned and flickered in both hands matching his red robe and lighting up his face then the fires froze it happened slowly and completely then he held up before them two dully glowing bunches of steaming orange ice these were passed into the audience which in turn passed them around when they had reached the back of the crowd both zemetrios and clirando were able to examine these iceflames they certainly were icecold sweating at the warmth of the nightas ice would have done after she had handed them on to her neighbour she rubbed her frozen fingers and thought these mages are very great next thing the magicians pointed up into the sky above the moon was lifting toward the zenith only the most engorged stars gleamed strongly enough to be seen against her extravagant light the magicians started to wave their arms and call up at the heavens stars stars come down and visit us no one will miss you up there on such a moonwhite night and the stars came they detached themselves from the black sky circling swarming like diamond bees down toward the island clirando heard zemetrios murmur beside her she too was astounded and filled by the wildest happiness why should stars not fall from heaven if they did what else wonderful might not be able to occur the laws of the gods were often so harsh did this magic signify such laws might be broken scintillant in drifts the stars began to festoon the trees some were large as a platter others small as a brooch they lit up the square with a pure bluish radiance others fell into the hands of the magicians who began carelessly to juggle with them arcs and firebursts dazzled as these tinier orbs dashed from hand to hand the show went on hypnotically until a faroff note sounded from above musical as any lyra she calls them back the crowd bellowed the moon wants her children home again and the mages let go the spangled stars which swirled together while others swooped from the trees to join them a vortex of white fire spun above the square then flew upward the great light faded each star must be fitting itself back into its place clirando thought she saw several do this settling in unseen sockets in the velvet dark the four mages stepped forward brushing off their palmsas if the stars had left a slight stella pollen on them what now clirando realized he and she stood so close their shoulders and arms were in continual contact his right armsworn arm her left she had not noticed before as if this were quite natural the magicians were reaching out now toward the grove of sacred trees also as if this were natural they were drawing down the boughs drawing them outward and over like tall cloaks of thick blackgreen fur the trees unraveled bringing their baubles and decorative masks with them and wrapped all four figures round the men vanished into the mantle of the trees then the trees smoked the whole square of people breathed as the mass of men and conifers coiled and spiraled up into the skyup to where the stars had gone and the white mask of the moon but where men and trees had been a creamy lion prowled the center of the square beside a patterned lynx with emerald eyes an antlered deer black as ebony a tusked elephantus from the east heavy with long grey hairwhich providing its own fanfare trumpeted the crowd shrieked applauded scrambled to its feet in a mixture of fright and pleasure illusions clirando murmured dreams said zemetrios but the animals too sprang upward now like the rest they surged away into the air smaller and smaller they became at the last moment four flashes like miniature lightnings occurred each creature became one last star just visible against the brilliance of the moon ive heard all men zemetrios said have a spirit animal that lives inside their soul perhaps perhaps zemetrios escorted clirando up the inn stair to the allotted room it lay deep in the house behind winding corridors and countless other chambers from most of which eddied quiet voices and now and then unstifled cries of delight the whole village had become flagrantly amorous returning from the display in the square they passed through laughing kissing groups couples dancing with linked hands to the music of flutes their eyes fixed only on each other by shadowy walls under courtyard trees embraces arms about each other mouths fused lost only in the world of lovetwo becoming one a sadness had stirred in clirando she shook it from her she would not become one of those who grudged other women the joy of lovemaking after all oani and seleti among her girls had both had lovers there had been no sign of the band anywhere surely they would have come to see the magicians as almost all the village had seemed to she believed she had not taken enough notice of their absence as she should if they were not here then then tomorrow she must search let me fret about that not give in to pointless jealousy she kept her mind on the problem as she and zemetrios walked through the inn to the room they were not to share the door was of old wood carved with a sort of tree a tree of fruit but the carving was rough and had faded away sanded off by time even so it was a splendid room when once they had opened the door the window had been shuttered though the night remained close and warm clirando undid the shutters outside the village curled away into the dark hardly a light anywhere aside from a few last smoldering torches they lit the rooms two candles despite the low ceiling the chamber was large and clean the bed too was large heaped with covers and furs as if for the cold months he said maybe after all youll sleep tonight she said nothing knowing she would not ill look forward to seeing you again in the morning rest well wait yes cliro her back to him still she said crisply this is a great cave of a room why not stay theres space for both of us and enough pillows and covers for an armyenough therefore to spare if one of us sleeps on the floor when he did not reply she turned and looked at him in the dull light she could not read his face saw only the slight scar on his cheekbone the lucent steadiness of his eyes if you trust me he said i trusted you in the forest she answered flatly or rather zem i trusted myself if you were not to be trusted i too have now called him by a familiar namedid i mean to he lowered his head it was a meek gesture belied by his tall muscular frame and for a second she did not trust him but then he said you can rely on me cliro dont insult me by making out im a mannerless oaf i wont lay a finger on you however much she waited what had he meant to say however much he would like to the excitement of the night still fizzed in her blood like strongspiced wine be careful she pointed at the bed this is a wide couch he did not speak clirando drew her sword do you know the custom yes a woman and a man who must sleep in the same bed put a sword between them and so keep chaste heres mine then she said well both lie down here neither of us is a baby let alone a dishonorable fool what do you say another sword rasped and candlelight slid down it as it in turn was drawn from his scabbard he placed it in reverse head to toe with hers the hilt under the tip of her blade her hilt upon his point agreed either side the bed looking down at the swords which already lay and slept there she and he well she said do you prefer i sleep clothed he said something flamed at clirandos center no use to deny it none at all nor to denyshe had not been careful only if you prefer weve pledged faith strip if you want ill turn my back so she turned again honorably enough behind her she heard the click and rustle of his garments undone and coming off andthere on the wall clirando saw his shadow reflection clear in every detail drawing the tunic over his heard unbuckling his belt did she dare look around at him she wanted to her core was full of fire leaping and aliveno longer frozen flame defrosted by desire abruptly he cursed at the signal irresistibly clirando spun about what is it she lamely demanded hardly knowing what she said her eyes full only of zemetrios standing naked before her a sharp bramble from the wood caught in my bootit had a sting he said explaining the curse breaking off his body was tanned and beautifully made as it had promised to be again she thought of statues of gods but this one was living from the width of his shoulders to the narrowness of his hips the coordination of arms the long legsperfectaside from the scars of old wounds that marked him yes he was soldier and warrior so much was obvious what caused that scar this oh that was at ashalat three years ago a spear he lived just long enough to regret it and that one over your ribs a knife i cant recalldisbuthiem i think in the northern isles or was it bas bara that one then on your stomach oh that one my first year as a soldier my own fault i managed to stab myself at practice shameful he laughed his laugh was golden like his body and his beauty unselfconsciousno flaunting himself yet in such a still couth way he gave however no sign of wanting her judging from evidence already clearly before her that would have been a proud show too did she dare go over and touch himthat slender final longhealed wound on his thigh would he recoil he did not want her maybe it was only that he liked her respected her maybe she was a warrior woman like his first love and like his mother she meant nothing else i count fourno five scars i include the little scar on your cheek she paused is that your total you mean my back do you cliro by the father no i havent one on my back her gaze left the alluring playground of his body and fastened on his blue eyes nor i i didnt think so i have more scars than you zem perhaps this shows me to have also lesser skill in battle or to be more brave how many scars then seven one candle flickered as if a spirit had breathed on it neither of them looked at the candle he said in a low voice show me and at his own words his thought clirando beheld on him all the arousal any woman could ever have required it matched she conceded her own hidden want her hands flew over her garments she was bold also flaunting her slim and tawny shape came from its concealment the tips of her breasts already woken and hard in silence she pointed out the seven narrow scarsone on the right shoulder three at her stomach and waist two on her right leg tiny as small coins and the longest deepest scar on her left arm made by a blow that in the moment it happened she scarcely noted it had been araithas in the warcourt the bed still lay between them divided by two swords cliro he said be sure if you have doubts ill take myself off into the inn i do warn you though i shall then get myself very drunk stay sober stay with me as they moved about the bed to meet each other each of them saw in a sudden glimpse one more magic stranger and less strange than the sorcery of sex the swords both blades had twined together roping each other round like vines is that because we but he reached her then he took her face in his hands his body gathered hers in his mouth was familiar to her she knew it as if many times before all the inebriated power of sexual hunger coursed through her her hands moved over his smooth and unmarked back she gripped him against her in moments the entwined blades were thrust from the bed and furs and coverlets in heaps across the floor his lips on her breasts were like a rain of warm honey his teeth grazed her with shivering darts at the flaming center of her flesh he woke her fire into a conflagration they raced quickly along the road of lust unable either of them to delay another minute as he filled her her body sprang to amalgamate with his the struggle of ecstasy began and exploded like every firecracker ever loosed on a night of full moon blind and moaning they clung the crescendo bursting them in an infinity of stopped time until cradling each other rocking sighing they fell back into the hollow of the night we went too fast he said what else i have waited you waited for me did you know that but now youre here cliro he said into her hair as he lay on her heavy blissful one cover she did not wish to push away they stayed like this for a short while until she felt him stir again now we go more slowly he said gravely and with his hands and mouth he played her exquisite as any master musician the strings of her body flowing with boundless notes in an agony of joy she held herself away from the brink they rolled still connected and lying over him she now began to search out the melody of his flesh tuning and waking him torturing him to the peak of pleasure casting herself over into the roiling sea only when she saw she had mastered him the vast wave hurled them up again high as the moon and over and slowly downward into the second valley of aftermath winter clirando was cold winterit was winter and she lay outdoors where was she thestus lay by her she could hear his deep sleepers breathing but she had slept as heavily and now her skin seemed rimed with frost clirando flung herself off the bed panicstricken feral this was not thestus she was not on campaign it was summer not winter she did not sleep nights darkness was done with a pallid livid dawn was beginning over the village and clirando could make out how the sky was somberly whitened for she had left the shutters open but this white sky was far too white the roofs around were also far too white she went to the window a blast of freezing air met her naked body like pain small wonder heavy snow had fallen in the night it covered everythingtrees buildings and on the narrow alley below undisturbed it made a flawless marble paving not a sound rose from the village either not a trickle of smoke from any hastily stoked hearth no bird flew no human thing was visible under the deadly blossom of the snow and ice only an intermittent conifer showed any growing covering the rest of the trees were bare as bones and on a nearby wall an eastern rosebriar snaggled skeletal black and white last night it had been smothered in red flowers she heard zemetrios erupt from the bed behind her in the name of all they wrapped themselves in the formerly redundant furs and both stood in the window the village is empty he said deserted the village is ruinous clirando added it was true the more she peered at the icy vista the more she noticed the holes in the plaster fallen stones and gaps where roofs had given way not the previous night but long ago the snowy trees had not all been cultivated in gardens and yards but had rooted in the houses and out of streets and alleyways even in this roomthat crack along the wall the broken stool she had not seen yesterday the balding furs were musty with age looking across the room she dismally noted the old carven door was half off its hinges the snow he said with irony must have fallen down from the moon if the moons covered in snow as the man said perhaps it did this place is a demonic trap its accursed as we are he drew her around to face him no longer you and i are no more one alone to face the dangers and dirt of this world two together yes clirando it did not go easy with her even now emotionally to bond with him so quickly if a summer morning had woken them very likely she would have felt otherwise but now once more she was not sure she could trust zemetrios her beautiful and mesmerizing lover the one she had waited for her equal and her beloved nevertheless she nodded and saw in his eyes he knew she put him off that way for a moment his mouth thinned turning from her brusquely he gathered up his gear and began to dress no longer twined their two swords lay among the quilts separate around and below the inn was as void as suspected in the long main room under a now partly broken staircase bushes clawed from the floor and icicles hung where the onions and green herbs once had the smoke chimney had fallen into the cooking heartha hundred years ago from the look of it they exchanged very few words brief comments on the wreck warnings about treacherous places in the floor and in the snowy hollows of the streets and alleys outside when once they got there the village was desolate and desolating sheand he she had believedhad been happy here nearly carefree the good food the wellmannered crowds and the music magic friendship the potent lawbreaking of the four magicians in the squareall of it lies hallucinations traps nothing to do with life or enjoyment had gone on in this winter village for ten decades or more nothing but loneliness and decay not even any animal laired here and the snow the snow could it had fallen from the snowcovered midsummer moon was that likelyof course not but then neither was all the rest we were lovers this demonstrates we were fools after all or i was a fool and he trustless one more chancer and traitor for once a kinder inner voice perhaps more rationalor less guiltridden less involvedmurmured within her do you react too harshly what after all has he done that you should call him by such names but winter had shown her with its unseasonal cruelty that she must not soften she had trusted before now she must raise her shield if not her blade she must be forearmed they emerged from the village at another gate in fact out of a hole in the wall looking back clirando saw the remains of the slender tower leaning like a smashed tooth on the sky beyond the gateway was only a waste of white in which groups of dead orchard trees huddled like black cages draped with ice the mountains rose ahead they were solid now in snow and the white land ran up to them pine forest still grew thickly at their bases moons stair zemetrios said his voice was bleak clirando scanned the middle peak it was not so high as she had thought only a frigid hump who would want to go up there everything was deception she said the merchant lied too how can there be some supernatural doorway on that mountain that allows men to pass through and walk on the moons globeif a globe it truly even is the moon is a lamp thats all like the stars the gods made them simply to give light in rhoia he said we call the moon most often she shes frozen shes cold unjust a bringer of regret clirando flung about before she could make some hard rejoinder she thought confusedly he spoke of the moon he was not thestus taunting me a wind woke suddenly from the islands edges where invisible the sea still coiled its rim perhaps now layered with ice whats that sound he said the wind blowing no he pointed along the snow out of the nearest bundle of pine trees something came striding with huge steps on all the white it was nightdark and it was gianttall but narrow a black banner blowing like a black flame from its top the woman on stilts clirando exclaimed so it is they waited such was her speed the striding stiltwalker reached them in less than a minute last night she had lit torches in a ruin that had looked whole and living now passing them the apparition bent her head to regard them moons stair said the black woman in a remote tone thats your path why zemetrios shouted up at her why else the woman nonsensically said she grinned her teeth were white as winter on she strode around the crumbled village wall she vanished from sight a sign he said guidance only if youre insane enough to think it so im making back the other way toward the coast my band of women was abducted by pirates thats what i must suppose at amnos to be a female warrior is to be a priestess too i owe them more than mere comradeshipthey were in my charge so damn the isle and the seven nights ill build a beacon of my own and hail some ship i must find them clirando he said dont you see you and iwe must go up the mountain why should i see something so absurd our penance didnt your temple speak to you of a sacrifice clirando stared at nothingness yes they said too that there was less danger for my girls than for me id swear your band is safe theyre valiant and strong youve trained and led them so you must trust them even if you can never trust me as for thisdont you feel the tug of that placewhatever it isup there she licked her lips the chill wind was biting through her clothing and the molting furs in which she as he had wrapped herself unwillingly she accepted that it was true enough the mountain pulled at her it was not so high it would be no awful task for either of them to scale it instantly on the wind then she heard a manyvoiced and horrible jeering wail as her head jerked up in remembering fear and distaste she saw zemetrios too was glaring along the snows his eyes searching their demons had returned there had been a sip of happiness for them at the phantom inn now they were due to pay then lets go he said what choice none he broke into the fast steady lope before she did running toward the skirt of pines it would not matter she thought despite any prior notion or hope whether they went together or apart both of them must face the individual punishment the isle had in store yet she too jogged forward increasing her speed she caught him up they advanced again shoulder to shoulder up the rising slope moon all that day they climbed once they were through the hedge of pines the mountain was not itself irksome but the slides of impacted snow and translucent ice sometimes presented blocks to swift progress they began inadvertently to work as a team bittersweet this clirando had never met a man so sane in his judgment of obstacles or so decided in solving them nor where she detected the solution so willing to agree she had found many men in the past even some of the best obstreporous as it were on principle thestus primarily she would have understood this if she had been a housereared woman but she was educated trained fit and canny where necessary they assisted each other they took only short breaks from the ascent neither had any food and only a little water which they drank sparingly once he remarked that the previous evenings dinner had seemed to nourish them even if it had been sorcerous and nonexistent at this she recalled again the other feastthe sexual and emotional feast of their lovemaking she saw that he did too he said looking at her my name you know it was never thestus rage boiled in her then died i know but let that be for now and silence returned to divide them as two swords had not twilight after the unseen sun went down found them high on the shelves of moons stair a broad cave one of many yawned in the mountain they ducked in and made a fire who watches he asked i last night you slept that was some spell i shant tonight do you think so presently they portioned the watch in the acceptable way between them lying or sitting far across the fire from each other the full moon of the third night swam up the sky only partly tearing the veil of snowcloud later more snow fluttered down how beautiful he was asleep a rift of tenderness opened in her heart she slammed a mental door against it clirando did not slumber when he took the watch she lay static as a log her back to him outside at frequent intervals and as she had heard it during the slog up the mountain there echoed the dim jeering yodels of the pig things her personal demons he presumably heard the abusive shouts of his dead friend and brother yazon it was not that she dreamed but she had one brief almostvision of araitha clirandos own friend and sister floated through the depths of a dark sea a corpse with golden hair furling and unfurling next morning they drank the last water some of which was by then ice and went out inside an hour of traveling the way flattened to a craggy endlessseeming plateau they had gained the top of moons stair they paused snow armored the crag outcrops thrust white into the dead sky boulders lay everywhere there was nothing unusual but also nothing comfortable up here it was a place of the known earth yet alienas only the things of the earth could be there was after all no purpose in climbing here nevertheless we climbed he said everything in life is like that surely its our choice and talent to make a purpose from such chaos the wind lifted and fell cutting about itself with sharp blades into the lea of one of the outcrops they went for shelter below far off slopes forest the lost village it was just possible too she thought even in the wan daylight to imagine the mighty outer circle of ocean ringing the island by nightfall they had trekked some way over the mountaintop they sought a crevice between rocks for the nights bivouac tomorrow they would descend there was nothing else to do the moon came up in the dark this evening it was unclouded shining on the snow it was the fourth night the middle night of the seven clirando again took first watch in order this time not to gaze at him in his sleep she stared rigidly out across the fire an hour later in the moonlight and with no warning araitha came walking toward clirando over the mountain clirando got up she drew her knifepointlessly araitha wore her traveling cloak and in her hair were the ornaments she had put there for safekeeping during her voyage to crentis no doubt in reality they lay with her on the seas floor lovely strong bravehow proud you could be of her this ghost comradefriendsister stay back dead thing rasped clirando only say what you want from me araitha did not slow her pace she sighed and her ghostbreath clean as when she had lived touched clirandos face clirando thought the ghost would keep going until it walked right through her she gripped her knife and braced herselfbut at the last second araitha dissolved like colored steam yet in the open area beyond the rocks everything now was changed the mountain plateau was no longer there a vast blank alabaster whiteness loomed and curved away it was not snow but level even and icy cold with a burnishlike freezing fire while above contrastingly the sky was an inkyblack clirando had never witnessed on any other night stars seared on this black like volcanic embers and of all shadespurple russet amber jade but the moon itself had disappeared instead hanging low over a distant jumble of countless spiked mountainsas unlike those of the isle as was possibleanother moon shone in colour it was greenish turquoise it cast an underwater light and formed peculiar shadows soon clirando did not think it was a moon it was some otherlamp worldor was it in fact the earth hung in the sky off the moon itself she found she had stolen forward she felt no startlement only a dull terror when turning she saw even the rocks from which she had just emerged were now no longer behind her all the mountain was gone now on every side the white sheer surface ran to its horizon she took a breath very oddly it seemed to her the air here was not air at alland still her lungs expanded she thought i am on the moons world now or some part of meshe did not know which part nor how she breathed that which was not air but she did for she was not meant to perish yet oh no araitha vindictive had undone the barrier between the worlds and clirando had been sucked through the shadows thoughthey moved they slithered forward growing solid as they did sobe ready they are not shadows how many of them were there it was a herd a battalion of the blackish pig creatures tusked and spined their misshapen heads lolling glassy little eyes riveted on her before she could do anything at all they had pressed inward forming a circle about her she was surrounded two or three animals deep the live cordon wobbled on narrow feet grunting snuffling until at last the familiar hideous jeering screams broke from them deafening now and no longer weirdly synchronized but all out of rhythm clirando hissed in fury it thrust out her fear knife in hand she flew at her tormentors she raked and slashed them she felt the blows strike home she saw the blood spurt burningly red in the uncanny light they did not resist nor did they attackbut the jeering cacophony never ceased all around the circle she pelted and around again still not one of the black pigs retaliated none harmed her she stopped all at once panting somehow disabledeach blow had lessened her and only then the circle gradually fell quiet after the unbearable horror of the noise the unair of this second world congealed inside her ears it was as if she had gone deaf and now they must close in she had hurt them they would trample her and kill her eat her alive clirando straightened she could sell her life expensively even if she must sacrifice it in the end and so she saw it was like a blindfold dropping from her eyes the creatures stood there quite motionless and still making no sound they were striped and running with blood much worse that this from their greenish eyes enormous glittering tears poured down like rain crying they clustered in their circle and they looked at her and as clirando stared into their weeping eyes she saw through to the backs of these eyes as if through polished mirrors and then straight down to some other thing repeating amplifying which she could not make out why do you do this she whispered they only wept clirando took now a few tentative steps she approached the nearest of them it lifted its head it was ugly terrible piteable the crying seemed to have made its eyes much larger they were deeply green like the leaves of a bay tree memory flashed in clirandos brain her mother was picking her up from the courtyard where she had fallen a clirando then about four years old dont cry my love dont cry my love clirando murmured she found she had dropped the knife she put out both her hands and touched the pigs nightmare face quite gently dont cry it will be better soon to her bewilderment the pig at once nuzzled in close to her it was warm it smelled healthy and wholesome but not really animal her hands slid over it it had no spines after all it was smooth under her fingers the wetness of the blood the wounds she had caused healed like seams sewn together now the next animal was nudging at her eagerly come here said clirando she had shut her eyes she took the second pig into her arms she took all of them into her arms one by one she stroked them she kissed their bizarre faces she kissed the tears away and their wounds healed all this with her eyes shut she too was crying she discovered and then softly laughing and from the pigs as she went around to them embracing them soft laughter too she knew when she had reached the end of her ministrations and closed the fateful circle that was when she opened her eyes twenty or thirty other clirandos stood all about her they were her age and her height and weight clothed as she was under the furs in summer garments tanned and fit shaking back brown hair the pigcreature had beenherself no nofacets of herself her self jeering tormentingugly was this then what she really was or what deep in her mind her heart she had believed she was if so then she had mocked herself and driven herself hurt herself made herself weep if not actual tears then symbolic tears to lose love was a very terrible thing to lose affection for ones own selfthis must be worse for you could at least in your mind move far off from others but from yourself you never could until death released you she regarded the other clirandos and they her cleareyed these looks and mouths that did not laugh calm mouths quiet they were separated from her her other selves her anger and her attempt to suppress anger both had done this and her pain and her denial of that pain for pain and anger needed to be felt and to be expressedand then let go she tried to count them the other clirandos twentythirtytenshe could not get the number to come out but she had split herself into these pieces she thought of a mirror made of glass as they formed them in the eastshattered clirando bowed her head anger was spoken pain acknowledged both now must begin their journey away from her she visualized a glass mirror mending did she feel her other selves return perhapsperhaps when she raised her head they were gone only she remained but all of her now she thought all mended and in one piece and so when next moment she saw rushing across the moons long vista the dappled lionbeast she had first seen on the cliffs of the isle she did not draw her knife now she knew as it sprang she too sprang forward in space they met the collision was instantaneous and had no impact only a brilliant lightning that coursed through her cold then hot then warm landing in a warriors practiced crouch clirando knew herself for one moment to be a dappled lynxlion tail lashing claws ready eyes of fire and then the beast sank back into her spirit accustomed as a fine knife in a sheath of velvet the male lion also had beenwashers it was a part of her she had no need to dread it only to know and guide itand permit it at the correct times to guide her a joy beyond all joys filled clirando she ran about the moon plain jumped high whirled through the air light as a feather playing never had she known such liberation but even as she experienced it intuitively she recognized it could not and must not last mortals had their duties in the world only before and after death could such freedom deservedly be theirs she sat thinking this for a while there on the surface of the moon quite calm until something altered in her mind and suddenly she began to see instead her ridiculous predicament for she knew no route back if a psychic gate had been opened for her where was it now she did not think the ghost of araitha could conduct her home into the world the surreal euphoria had left her perplexed clirando stood and looked away to all the white horizons vaguely then she heard a distant shouting it was no longer any nightmare of her own zemetrios had he too been pulled through to this other place to contend with his past at this thought clirando became fully herself or reckoned she did in the heat of battle you could not always carefully plan it took her some hours to walk across the long curving of the moons back and the fishbone spikes of the mountains were much nearer when she halted in astonishment before her lay a fine house that would have fitted well in the upper streets of amnos it was surrounded by a grove of trees winter bare and thick with icicles the house seemed to think an ordinary earthly night had fallen for lamplight burned in the visible windows and over the gate of the courtyard the gate itself was ajar as if to invite clirando in she hesitated but then the strident shouting came again she had heard it many times as she traveled it had guided her here she pushed wide the gate and crossed the yard between ranks of frozen urns and shrubs the door of the house too was open clirando entered sword in hand and reached the threshold of a graciously furnished room now rather spoilt a chair had gone over broken pitchers lay on the floor two men were there also one of them stumbling shouting it was this awful voice she had heard before then in the moment before the shouting stumbler fell the other man caught him back yazon listen to me this would have been your twentyninth day without drunkenness think what you had achieved and lost the other grated i have ruined it besides what do i care give it me back the wine but yazons voice dropped away into sobs he sank down on a couch and zemetrios seated himself beside him no my friend no wine youll have to kill me first zemetrios his face was weary as that of a man who had been entirely sleepless for months yet also hard and resolute yazonhe could be no one elsewas speaking now of horrible secrets of drunkenness but his eyes at last were growing sane and sad as if some god had told hersattu perhaps the little god of domestic thingsclirando seemed to know it all this naturally was not what had taken place in the world at rhoia instead the house of zemetrioss father had been magically rebuilt here on the slopes of the moon by some spirit or spell and now in this new reality zemetrioshaving given up his post in the kings legions and sent all his servants women and men both away to safetycared for yazon striving to cure him to make him whole that then must have been in zemetrioss hidden mind not that he had killed yazon in ragebut that he had not devoted his life however briefly or lengthily to helping yazon not with money or shelter but with the comradeship and dedication they had each shown the other in war now zemetrios wished to atone it was very plain that zemetrios believed utterly this situation truly existed clirando did not know if she could or should have any part in such a scenario but the previous bliss of her own liberation now filled her with the desire to assist in whatever way was possible to assist that was zemetrios she spoke his name could he hear her yes he looked across at her instantly his face which had seemed older than its twentyfour years was suddenly as she recalled a smile lit his mouth and eyes and here is my beautiful wife clirando the other manghostillusionwhatever he might bealso looked up at her and he too gave her a smile it was not corrupt only distant some halfforgotten goodmanners from an earlier time when he had been himself and she wondered then if perhaps really this was yazon come back from death to undo this knot of pain and anger as needful for his phantasmal life as it was for zemetrioss mortal one and i warn you yazon said zemetrios with amused lightness try nothing stupid with her shell kill you and have your skin sewn up as a sunshade his wife in his fantasy this dream of righting wrongs and making all good i am his wife zemetrios got up came to her and kissed her gently on the lips things will be better now youre here only clirando marked accurately the passing of the last three nights of full moon though perhaps she did not do it as accurately as she meant to because she had to get her bearings from the rise and fall of the bluegreen earthworld above in the house apparently months went by she herself was not conscious of these her time frame functioned very differently and the scenes that were enacted and in which she sometimes took a small part were fragments of some vaster drama played clearly for zemetrios alone she went along with everything knowing he did what he must his penance and selfexamination were longer than hers deeper and darker though less savage in the segments of events that clirando witnessed zemetrios hauled yazon back to sober health zemetrios was by turns dominant and consoling as appropriate he never gave up and gradually the physical ghostimage of yazon responded then clirando would find the two of them at friendly noisy practice with swords or bows or wrestling eating talking they played lybirican chess they would discuss the army days and reminisced away the nights that somehow came and went inside the outer time which she alone observed they would look up at the blue orb in the sky and call it the moon of course zemetrios never separately sought her it seemed she was tucked away somewhere in his illusory life in the house mainly she was peripheral to his task sometimes he did not even see or hear her as she entered a room only a few paces from him he only ever fully saw yazon the one in fact who probably was not there she began to think yazon was not a ghost working out the dilemma of its life no he was solely a conjuring of zemetrioss mind and of moon isle she came to believe all this would end at the finish of the moons seventh night till then she could do nothing but be present offering her slight participationa touch a cup filled from the well in the courtyard every illusory thing seemed real as in the village therefore how would this saga be resolved she pondered too with the winter snow in her heart if zemetrios would have been driven mad by the finish of it the ultimate problem was their return to the world which still she had not solved maybe they must stay here despite all expiation and maybe too they would be segregated here from each other do i love him even in that extremity and strangeness this question was paramount and unanswered sometimes she sat alone in the winter yard of the simulated rhoian house gazing up at the multicolored stars indoors the men talked rationally remembering old campaigns the food and drink she had found in the kitchens had nourished her and them even the rug bed she had made herself was comfortable she could sleep now anywhere therefore would have been comfortable perhaps madness has taken all of us but the lion lashed its tail in her spirit and she herself quieted it be patient when next the blue orb rose that would be the seventh night as far as she knew she could do nothing but wait in sleep she heard zemetrios speaking to her very softly its done cliro he has gone instantly she was fully awake where away away where he must he spoke of yazon who it seemed had gone back to the lands beyond death zemetrios said this has been a dream she thought thank all gods he knows but it was a dream i needed to be dreaming oh clirando i should have given him that no matter how he was i should have tried so much harder to save him in the true world while he lived not dragged him into my house and shunned and treated him like a sinful baby despised and left him always to himself busy with my own affairs i should not either have gone out and left my servants at his mercyafraid of him afraid to offend me ive done what i should have done but here itsfreed me but i shall never cease to be sorry he leaned close to her resting his forehead on hers how long has all this gone on it seemed a yearbut he was my friend my brotheroh cliroif only id done this then as i should she held him they lay wrapped among the rugs like two children in the dark hush my love she said if only any of us had done what we should we see it clearly when it has passed by yet we must try to see and try to do thats all the gods ask that we try and she thought and is he my love then and she thought yes he is my love they curled together beyond the narrow window the blue disk gemmed the sky he had survived the test and was not deranged each of them had paid their debt to themselves they slept exhausted in each others arms the next time they woke it was together and they lay on the bare plains of the moon the house with all its lamps and groves its rooms and well and yard was gone only those mountains like spines scratched along the horizon the earth hung above and all the stars there was a way that led us here beyond the rocks he said but how do we find it clirando stared into her mind there were visions there still things which came from the magic not only of this place but from the sorcery of the isle slowly she said theres home nodding at the disk above but the way to it clirandos brain showed her the magicians in the square who had called the stars instinctively she raised her arms up in the inky black the exquisite jewelry shivered one by one starsstarsdetached from their moorings they began to float down not a swarm now a snowfall if it was a dream you might do anything and if not still you might attempt it the stars wove around one another in slow sparkling tidal surges she thought of the old woman weaving on the headland the old man who made snakes at the forests end and of the stiltwalker lighting torches high in air a bridge began to form in a wide swooping arc it was laid with coruscating stella stonesemeralds rubies amethystsit curved down toward the surface where they stood making a hillroad for them to climb while the rest of the arc soared away like the curve of a bow infinities up in the air the earth disk had received the far point of this incredible bridge without the tiniest ripple they neither debated nor held back both he and she ran at the bridge of stars this extraordinary path that led toward the ordinary and the mortal simultaneously they leaped landed clirando felt the faceted paving under her feet ethereal colors washed them like high waters now copper now bronzy now golden not to sleep so longit had been worth it to know a dream like this one both of them laughed children laughed like that innocent and prepared to credit that dreams came true as so often on the isle shoulder to shoulder clirando and zemetrios broke into their companionable welltrained mileeating lope over the night over the heavens running home through the spatial outer dark which for them was full of a rich sweet air mild breezes summery scents branches of static stars rainbows and light wild music halfseen winged beings clirando knew no fear no doubt and no reticence she thought idly as she bounded earthward this is the truth but somewhere somethingoh it was like a vagrant cloud feathery and adrift it bloomed out from nowhere it poured around her zemetrios was concealed she half turned missing him and then a delicate nothingness enveloped her that too brought no alarm it was also too good too true and after only a second anyway it was done and then clirando this known female face bending to hers someone well liked familiar tuyamel clirandos eyes were clearing she stared into six faces now all known all in their way loved her girls the women of her band lie still cliro said tuy firmly youve flown such a great way off and had such a long journey back they were sworn to secrecy they assured her all of them no one who came here must ever afterward speak of the secrets of moon isle besides they knew very little certain personsthey go to certain places the priestsand the godsdirect them some even goso we heardto the moon itself and you went somewhere cliro thats what they said her band told her how the morning after they had beached their boat on the strand of the isle they had found her unconscious and had not been able to rouse her though she breathed she seemed all but dead and so they picked her up on a litter improvised from cloaks and bore her inland an ancient priestess by a beacon on the cliff top declared clirando had suffered no awful harm she has not slept a while the priestess said now she must so clirandos loyal girls carried her with much care and attention to one of the seven inland villages of the island every night of the full moon you lay here lamented seleti we tried to wake youthe moon was full for seven nightsdraisisbut you never stirred and the old priest the one with the pet snakes he names after jewelshe said we must let you slumber you were so young he said affrontedly added erma you would certainly see in your lifetime several more such seasons of seven moons you missed all the festivities elaborated oani jugglersmagicians vlis one of them made a bridge over the sky all like precious stonesgreen red mauve yellow tuyamel though i knew it was all a trick clirando lay on the narrow pallet in the cell of the temple in seventh village her heart beat leadenly it had beenall of ita dream and yet she had been enabled to throw away the negative and hateful things only proper grief and regret remained exceptzemetrios if all this had been a dreamincluding even as it had transcripts of actual external thingswhat had zemetrios been his thoughts his personalityhis mouth his arms she lay a few days in the little temple of the maiden then when she had recovered enough clirando roamed through its courts admiring columns and the flowering vines on its wallsfor summer had continued uninterrupted in the world here and there meeting others she mentioned a particular name zemetrios they asked the mild priestesses warrior they said to her not unkindly no one may be told anything more than the minimum of any other here this is moon isle for those like yourself or the man you mention what each does and experiences is a private matter only they and the gods can know so they would tell her nothing and was there anything to learn everything else had been her dream so why not this golden man she had wanted a lover tranced or asleep she had had one and now she knew for sure she loved him well then she loved a figment of her dreams she would not be the first or last two days following the celebration of the seven nights which all of them repeatedly reminded her she had missed clirando walked around the village it was not at all like the one she had seen when asleep the buildings were clean and garishly painted the three or four temples were garlanded and that of the maiden had walls of deep red patterned with silver crescents just as she had heard priests and priestesses thronged the isle and lingering warrior bands were there too traders and performers but now the processions and shows were over a great packing up was going on a great leavetaking and neither was it any use to question these people let alone the villagers who seemed educated in coy evasions there seemed too a polite unspoken wish that visitors should go it began to make her band uneasy and soon enough clirando as well i threw off my guilt i must throw off this also she slept always soundly at night she did not dream she thought at all as if she had used all her dreaming up would she ever see the ghost of araitha again or himwould she ever see zemetrios again no never on the fourth day they set off along the forest track it was rather as clirando had visualized it but then her girls had carried her this way now animals and birds abounded a statue marked either end of the road island gods nicely carved clirando thrust her introspection from her she acted out being her ordinary self calling it back to her it came meanwhile her girls were so attentive and careful of her that clirando eventually lost her temper leave off treating me like some fragile shard of ancient pottery what will you do on the boat wrap a shawl over my legs and pat me on the head there under the sunsparkling pines she wrestled tuyamel and vlis and threw them both and hugged them all they danced about there laughing embracing loud and boisterous as elevenyearolds next day they reached the shore and rowed out to the galley by sunfall they were on the way to amnos and life as they remembered it epilogue paper the windblown sky was full of birds that morning summer had stayed late in amnos giving way at last to a harsh bleached winter now spring tides freshened the coast and men and beasts were casting the torpor of the cold months clirando had been with eshti her old servant woman to the fish market and coming back eshti bolted straight to the kitchen with her prizes clirando climbed up to the roof of her house she was watching the antics of the house doves circling over the courtyard trees and out of her inner eyes from nowhere araitha came and stood silent in her mind clirando recalled how she had stood in the yard too laying her curse then turning away from shadow to light to shadowor had it been light to shadow to light unlike her companion her dream lover clirando had had no dialogue with her dead friend to set anything right between them araitha therefore might always haunt her no longer injurious only bitter it could not be helped at least her curse was spent all winter clirando had carried on her life as she had in the past if her mood was sometimes uneven she hid it mourning the loss of a dead comrade was one thing but to mourn the loss of someone who had not been real was wretched and bewildering sometimes she even mocked herself but nownow it was spring clirando turned eshti had come up on the roof puffing from the steps wiping fish scales off on her apron what now clirando inquired has dinner swum away no lady the priestesses of parna have sent for you clirandos thoughts scattered apart and back together in concern she sprang downstairs to fetch her cloak in the shrine by the main temple hall one of the two priestesses who received clirando was the middleaged woman who had dispatched her to the isle clirando saluted both of them she said have i committed some error mothers the two of them gazed at clirando only the older priestess smiled not at all there are matters which have just come to our attention now spring has driven the ice from the harbors ships are moving and letters have arrived in amnos clirando nodded though familiar with books she had seldom seen a letter next moment she saw two normally they would be of folded cloth written on then waxed both of these letters were of fine paper made from lybirican reeds a ships captain brought them here this morning said the other priestess one is for you clirando the other the other was sent to us by one of the wise women of moon isle she is over a hundred years of age but she lives sometimes in a hut on a headland and still she weaves cloth for her eyes stay clear and her fingers agile i met her said clirando she checked or thought i did the wise womanshe has no other namesays that something has come to her notice about a warrior girl clirando she is called who was sent to the isle to work out some inner tussel the gods allowed her the trance of profound sleep which the isle can give and in the sleep various adventures by means of which her trouble was healed however the priestess paused and clirandos heart paused within her it seems during this time clirando showed strong evidence of being herself a healer and a spiritual guide shocked clirando interrupted no motheri did nothing like that ignoring her gently the priestess went on although personal experiences on the isle are not generally spoken of there are two exceptions to this rule firstly as perhaps you will guess anyone may speak in secret to a priest of their own experience this recital may naturally include mention of others who haveor who have seemed to havebeen part of it the priests though they will answer no direct question will nevertheless should it be needful afterwards pass on any insight to those others who have shared the event providing and this is the second exception the insight is sufficiently profound and so a man a soldier formerly with the rhoian legions reported the events to the temple of the father on the isle he too had been sent there to work out some penance and guilt and sorrow and he too had the gods trance fall on him the priests cared for him in this sleep as it is always done just as the priestesses cared for you clirando but when he woke he had an unusual story to tell it seems he found himself in a forest and there he met a young woman who engaged his interest at once being he freely says for him the perfect type of woman both a warrior and a girl of great grace the priestess smiled again peered into one of the paper letters and read aloud also blessed with a passionate clear mindedness the priestess allowed the letter to fall closed once more it seems too that in this dream he had and which apparently he shared with her the woman he describes so admiringlyand whose name he gives as clirandothat she gave him to understand she was not averse to his person at the conclusion of their journey she assisted him further guiding him forward as he describes through a magical gateway and so on to the mystic plains of the moon itself here his own difficulty was resolved but once again clirando remained at his side helping him always now we hear of visits to the moon which may happen on the islehow else did it come by its namebut they are rare he insists that had it not been for the woman he himself would never have got there and so never confronted what he must finally when all was done she the priestess again consulted the paper summoned a path of stars and led him home by that route to the world butto his horrorhe lost her on the way the priestess folded the paper into her sleeve she looked at clirando do you know anything of this clirando could not speak then words came he is called zemetrios so he is i note your heart is full of love for him that is the maidens gift to you then but it takes much more than love alone to work the magic you have done my girl and so it transpires the maiden gave you another gift too for you are a healer and guide as he has said no dont shake your head of course you have made mistakes and blunders on this occasion it was your first excursion into such realms you will need training as tough and demanding as any youve known in the fighters art you stumbled on your gift which till now you never knew you had but this man zemetrios is no fool he insists you possess psychic powers he has convinced the wise women thats enough for us such talents must never be denied then then as ive said you shall be taught you will still be a warrior but to one trade will be added another butmotheri now sit on the bench there and read this second letter which has come only for you the ships captain has said he wishes a moment with you then hes in the little fountain courtyard no doubt he expects to be rewarded for bringing such costly paper all this distance clirando found she had sat down she sat with the second letter unopened all she could see or think was filled only by one face one name he was real he lived and knew her she had guided him unknowing through forest and mountain and otherworld her lover her beloved zemetrios and their lovemakingthough experienced in a dreamhad in some manner taken place for both yet nowhe mentioned nothing of meeting her again the flame flicked before the statue of the goddess her green eyes blinked or it was only a trick of the light clirando broke the wax seal on the second letter her mind blank as a paper never written on and read this they will have told you im dead but i did not drown when the lion sank the waves and wind dragged me to shore with two or three others from the ship and washed us up senseless at a little fisher village most of a year i stayed there making a slow recovery but a complete one at last i set out and reached sippini from the port there i write to you now i am in good health and strong again and have engaged with a warrior band to fight honorably for the town my former disgrace i confessed but they have overlooked it saying both you and the gods had given me a beating and let me off now i might turn to better things clirando be aware that i acknowledge now the miserable wrong i did you i hadnt any need to lie down with thestus and should have resisted myself and him for this mean act i lost your friendship always nor do i plead that you will change your mind for i deserve nothing else but the other crime i worked against you oh clirando i regret that almost worse to curse youyou that i wronged at least i know that such a petty thing would never stickit can never have harmed you you are so strong but i am ashamed forgive me clirando if you are ever able for both my faults and think sometimes one kind thought in tribute to our happier past of me once your sister and comrade araitha the letter fluttered from clirandos fingers the motion reminded her of a doves wings araitha lived araitha lived and was herself again a hot blameless joy burned through clirando standing up she cried aloud there in the shrine naming the gods it was not blasphemy but a paean of gratitude as such it seemed the goddess parna at least received it when she went out to the fountain courtyard she had all her money left from the market wrapped ready in a cloth to tip the captain he had brought her such news the man was standing by the little fountain looking down at the golden fish swimming about in the tank for a ships captain he was well dressed and very well groomed his blond hair gleaming with cleanness in the spring sunshine when he looked up she saw that he had grown as pale as she had clirando mastered herself so youre a liar after all no lies by the gods cliro trance or waking i never lied to you once and if i never wrote any love words upon the moon i scarcely had time did i or are you angry i delayed in finding you for a while i could hardly even be certain you were real by the hour id convinced myself winter had closed the seas i mean zem she said you lied today when you told them you were the captain of a ship but i am id sold my fathers house remember and given up my legion so i bought a ship what better means to come here ive worked on ships before in my soldiers travels i know them well enough this ones a fine one shes called the brown warrior i named her after you with your tan skin and your acorn hair clirando felt the yard the town and the world draw far off from her she stood in space somewhere between sky and earth and he stood facing her there and they were alone together well he said you helped save my mind and my soul on the isle but if i only dreamed you liked me you must tell me to go i warn you though youll get drunk stay sober zemetrios stay with me he crossed the court in three strides and took her in his arms as she took him in hers they muttered into each others mouths and necks and hair what lovers mutter at such times it had been an irony he said that as he set off to seek her in amnos being one of the first ships out it was he who ended up carrying with him the report of his own letter of her healing skills as for her letter from araitha he was amazed when clirando told him what it was he did not ask if she would ever seek for araitha in the future nor did clirando ask herself the gods who had it seemed allowed all this might one day advise her by some sign four giggling novice priestesses coming to feed the fish dislodged the couple in the court so then they walked to her house down the winding streets eshti showed great approval at the houseguest we shall have the best candles she told them and the glass goblets from the chest eshti decides these things said clirando so i see thats good it will leave you more time to concentrate on me but when must you sail when i want im my own man she thought hell ride his ship across those treacherous seas those waters of gales and drowning she thought we are both fighters neither can curb the others life the gods brought us together perhaps they will keep us together now the spring dusk came early up in the yard trees the house doves were already arranging their nests which signified it would be a forward spring and summer when the candles were lit the polished glasses filled she sat with him and they ate supper as if they had done so for twenty years tonight they would share the bed in her chamber where she had watched sleepless the unsleeping moon now she would see him and herself reflected in his gaze now she would see a future the sea wind tapped at the shutters and the lamps before the household shrines dimmed and brightened all the jeweleyed gods there winked at clirando and zemetrios a trick of the light banshee cries ce murphy this ones for my mom rosie murphy who wanted to know what the story with jos mom was dear reader in september of i got an email from my agent the incomparable jennifer jackson saying shed just spoken with my equally incomparable editor marytheresa hussey who wanted to know if id be interested in participating in a luna books anthology as one of three contributing authors the other two authors were to be need i say the incomparable tanith lee and mercedes lackey not being a great fool i said yes a month of frenzied thought was interspersed with me singing one of these things is not like the others followed by a flurry of frenzied writing the result is banshee cries book of the walker papers it fits chronologically between book one urban shaman which came out in june and book two thunderbird falls due out in may i hope you enjoy the story sunday march th pm cell phones are the most detestable objects on the face of the earth worse than those oceanvariety pill bugs that grow bigger than your head which were on my personal top ten list of things to avoid my life had been a lovely cellfree zone until nine weeks six days and four hours ago not that i was counting on that fateful day i got an official business phone to go with my bulletproof vest and billy stick id even been given a gun to go with my shiny new badge i wanted those things about as much as id wanted to bonk my head on the engine block id sat up beneath when the phone rang i rubbed my forehead and glared at the engine then felt horribly guilty it wasnt petites fault id hurt myself and shed been through enough lately that she didnt need me scowling on top of it all the phone kept ringing i rolled out from under the mustang and crawled to her open door digging the phone out from under the drivers seat what only one person outside of work had the phone number as soon as i spoke i realized that a politer pickup might have been kosher the resounding silence from the other end of the line confirmed my suspicion eventually a male voice said walker i turned around to hook my arm over the bottom of the cars door frame and did my best to stifle a groan captain i need you these were words that another woman might be pleased to hear from captain michael morrison of the seattle police department then again if he was saying them to another woman there probably wouldnt have been the slight tension in his voice that suggested his mouth was pressed into a thin line and his nostrils flared with irritation at having the conversation he had a good voice nice and low i imagined it could carry reassuring softness the kind that would calm a scared kid unfortunately the only softness i ever heard in it was the kind that said this is the calm before the storm which happened to be how he sounded right now i crushed my eyes closed face wrinkling up and prodded the bump on my forehead to come in to work its my weekend morrison as if this would make any difference i could hear his ears turning red i wouldnt be calling you in yeah i bit the word off and wrapped my hand around the bottom of petites frame whats going on silence id rather not tell you jesus morrison i straightened up feeling the blood return to the line across my back where id been leaning on the car is anybody dead is billy okay hollidays fine can you get over to woodland park yeah i i tilted my head back looking at the mustangs roof truth was id been futzing around under the engine block because i couldnt stand to look at the damage done to my babys roof anymore a twentynineinch gash not that id measured or anything ran from the windshields top edge almost all the way to the back window from my vantage thin stuffing and fabric on the inside ceiling shredded and dangled like a teddy bear whod seen better days beyond that soldered edges of steel not yet sanded down looked like somebodyd dragged an ax through it which was precisely what had happened a little knot of agony tied itself around my heart and squeezed just like it did every time i looked at my poor car the war wounds were almost three months old and killing me but the insurance company was dragging its feet full coverage did cover acts of godor in my case acts of godsbut id only said shed been hit by vandals because who would believe the truth in the meantime id already spent my meager savings replacing the gas tank that somebodyd shot an arrow through my life had gotten unpleasantly weird in the past few months i forced myself to find something else to look atthe opposite garage wall had a calendar with a mostly naked woman on it which was sort of an improvementand sighed yeah i said again into the phone im gonna have to take a cab fine just get here north entrance wear boots morrison hung up and i threw the phone over my shoulder into the car again then i said a word nice girls shouldnt and scrambled after the phone propping myself in the bucket seat with one leg out the door bedraggled as she was just sitting in petite made me feel better i patted her steering wheel and murmured a reassurance to her as i dialed the phone a voice that had smoked too many cigarettes answered and i grinned sliding down in petites leather seat still working yknow in my day when somebody made a phone call they said hello and gave their name before anything else gary in your day they didnt have telephones are you still working depends is this the crazy broad who hires cabbies to drive her to crime scenes i snorted a laugh yeah is she gonna cook me dinner if im still workin sure i said brightly ill whip you up the best microwave dinner you ever had okay i want one of them chicken fettuccine ones where you at chelseas garage gary groaned a rumble that came all the way from his toes and reverberated in my ear you still over there mooning over that car jo i am not mooning i was mooning she needs work you need money and snow tires and more than six inches of clearance you aint gonna drive it till spring jo even if you do get it fixed up her i said sounding like a petulant child petites a her not an it arent you baby i added addressing the last part to the steering wheel look are you gonna come get me or not its even a paying gig morrison called and wants me to go over to woodland park arright garys voice brightened considerably maybe therell be a body morrison glared magnificently when i arrived with gary in tow the two of them facing off was wonderful to behold morrison was pushing forty and goodlooking in a superherogoingtoseed way with graying hair and sharp blue eyes gary at seventythree had hemingway wrinkles and a connery build that made him look dependable and solid instead of old and his gray eyes were every bit as sharp as morrisons for a few seconds i thought they might start butting heads but morrison pointed at gary and barked you stay here gary looked as crestfallen as a wet kitten i actually said aw cmon morrison and got his glare turned on me oops its arright jo gary gave me a sly look that from a man a few decades younger wouldve had my heart doing flipflops i bet theres a body you can tell me about it at dinner you need a ride home ill take care of it morrison said in a sharp voice gary winked at me shoved his hands in his pockets and sauntered back to his cab whistling i choked on a laugh and turned to follow morrison tromping through a truly unbelievable amount of snow it had started snowing in midjanuary and as far as seattle was concerned hadnt stopped in the two months since even the weathermen merely looked stunned and resigned mumbling excuses about hurricane patterns in the south having unexpected consequences in the pacific northwest what is it with you two so whats going on captain we spoke at the same time leaving me blinking at morrisons shoulders and starting to grin what is it with us me and gary are you serious he answers your phone morrison was talking to the footprints in the snow in front of him not me my grin got noticeably bigger only the once that was like six weeks ago morrison and who told you that anyway i wanted to laugh im just saying hes a little old for you isnt he morrisons shoulders were hunched as if he was trying to warm his ears up with them i grinned openly at his back and lowered my voice so it only just barely carried over the squeak and crunch of snow as we walked through it all ill say is you know how they say old dogs cant learn new tricks turns out old dogs have some pretty good tricks of their own morrisons shoulders jerked another inch higher and i laughed out loud the sound bouncing off tree branches black with winter cold snow shimmered and fell off one making a soft puff and a dent in the snow below it morrison flinched at the sound head snapping toward it as his hand dropped to his belt like hed pull a weapon my laughter drained away and i followed him the rest of the way to a park baseball diamond in silence he climbed up snowcovered bleachers making distinct footprints in the already walked on snow compacting it further i put my feet in precisely the same places hed stepped fitting my sole print to his exactly we had the same size feet and in policeissue boots his prints were indistinguishable from mine at least to the naked eye a forensics officer could probably tell there was a weight difference between the two of usin morrisons favor thank godbut for the moment i enjoyed the idea of stealing along behind the captain invisible to anybody trying to track me morrison stopped on the step above me and turned so abruptly i nearly walked into him i rocked back on my heels one step below him my nose at his chest height as i frowned up at him thanks for the warning i hated looking up physically to morrison we were the same height down to the half inch that put us both just below six feet and any situation that made me look up to him made me uncomfortable of course the reverse was also true and id been known to wear heels just so id be taller than he was no one said i was a good person tell me what you see assuming he didnt want me to describe himwhich had he not been so antsy about the snow falling from the tree a few moments ago id have probably done just to annoy himi turned away looking over the baseball diamond it was buried beneath two feet of the wet heavy snow that had made my jeans damp from tromping through it i shook one foot absently knocking snow off my boot id lived in wisconsin for a winter so snow wasnt entirely new to me but this was ridiculous for seattle and i said so morrison huffed out a breath like an annoyed bull and i puffed my cheeks muttering okay fine i see snow well duh clearly morrison wanted more than that snowmobile tracks i didnt even know people in seattle owned snowmobiles um footprints around the diamond like peopleve been playing snowball i thought that was pretty clever snowball like baseball only with snow right morrison didnt laugh i sighed poor poor putupon me there are cops theres some teenagers over there theres actually there were a lot of cops now that i was looking picked out in dull blue under the gray sky they worked their way around the baseball diamond and stumped their way through the outfield theres um i frowned i dont hear anything either there arent any people around dead trees no morrison growled full of so much tension that i looked over my shoulder at him feeling my expression turning worried what do you see he repeated and suddenly i got it a drop of ice formed inside my throat and spilled down into my stomach like drinking cold water on an empty belly i folded my arms around myself defensively shaking my head shit morrison it doesntit doesnt work like that i mean im not like good enough to make it work i dont know how i dont want to god damn it walker what do you see i turned back to the field stiff as an automaton my lower lip sucked between my teeth one of my arms unfolded from around me completely of its own will hand drifting to rub my sternum through my winter jacket there was no hole in my breastbone no scar to suggest thered ever been one but i found myself pulling in a very deep breath trying to rid myself of the memory of a silver blade shoved through my lung and the bubbling coppery taste of blood at the back of my throat id nearly died eleven weeks ago and instead found that buried within me was the power to heal myself and maybe a great deal more more than one person had called me a shaman since then i didnt like it at all im not any good at this morrison i dont know if i can do it on purpose my voice was strained and thin full of reluctance morrison didnt say anything once upon a timenot that long agothe only thing he and i had had in common was a complete disdain for the paranormal and people who believed there were things that went bump in the night id been struggling for the past three months to get back to that place back to a world that made sense where i didnt feel a coil of bright power burbling in the core of me waiting to be used i desperately wanted to believe it had been some kind of peculiar dream most days i was able to cling to that morrison was not helping me cling i could feel the tension in him not with any extrasensory perception but with how still he was holding himself and the deliberate steadiness of his breathing he wasnt any happier than i was about asking which perversely made me willing to play ball i put my teeth together muttering only you could get me to do this that struck me as being alarmingly accurate i found myself abruptly eager to do it so i didnt have to think about what id just said unfortunately i was at a complete loss as to how to proceed id pulled denial over my head like a blanket the past several weeks now that someone was asking me to use my impossible new gifts i didnt know where to start just thinking about it made the power inside me flutter like a new life full of hope and possibility i swallowed against nausea that was as unpleasantly familiar as the idea of life inside me and tentatively reached for the bubble of power a spirit guide called coyote had suggested to me i work through the medium i knew best cars in reaching for that bubble of energy i tried to do that morrison wanted me to see well if i wasnt seeing clearly then the windshields needed washing power spurted up through me a sudden warm wash that felt startling against the cold winter afternoon a silverblue spray swished over my vision just like wiper fluid i closed my eyes against the brightness and a perceived sting and without really meaning to envisioned windshield wipers swooping the liquid away leaving my vision clear the sting faded and i opened my eyes again the world was beautiful even the gray sky glimmered with light sparks of water shimmering above me as i brought my gaze down trees whose branches were weighted with snow flickered with the greenness of waiting life only cold and dead to the mundane eye sap waited to rise leaves prepared to bud all a promise of explosive activity the moment winter let go its hold the chainlink fences that surrounded the ball field had their own resolute purpose created and placed to do a specific thing a distinct sensation of pride in doing the job emanated from them the people on the field radiated different energy swirling colors that bespoke worry or fear or determination the rough shapes of their personalities hammering into me and leaving nothing taken for granted i wanted to turn and look at morrison to get a sense of him with this other sight id called up but i was afraid if i moved id lose it again i dropped my gaze to the field itself still not knowing what i was looking for and a wave of maliciousness slammed into me like a tornado it whipped around the core of power inside me and dug claws in sharp knifeedges of pain cramping my belly it sucked the heat out of me draining the coil of energy in sudden throbs faster than a heartbeat my knees crumpled lightheadedness sweeping over me morrison caught me under the arms so easily he might have been waiting for me to fall i twisted toward him grabbing his coat as he slid an arm around me more firmly youre all right his voice sounded like it was coming from unreasonably far away given that i knew he was right behind my ear ive got you i didnt want to move desperately glad for the support he offered both physical and other his presence was solid and comforting a wall of commitment and strength in deep reassuring purples and blues i doubted he knew he was projecting his own personal energy in a way that let me borrow some but i was incredibly grateful for it i managed a shaky nod hanging on to the flow of strength he offered using it to shore up my own depleted silvers and blues after a few seconds i was able to get my legs under me again though morrison didnt quite let me go i locked my knees and made myself turn to look at the field again crimson lines bleeding with pain and rage flowed up from the field following the lines of the baseball diamond points of vicious black stabbed behind my eyes making marks that seemed to shoot up into the sky and fade somewhere beyond the stars looking at the field felt like someone was digging talons into my innards trying to pull them out and bind me to the death that had already been wrought there gary was wrong there wasnt a body there were three cmon walker tell me what you see talk to me walker how many have you found my voice was groggy as if i was talking through pea soup morrison let out a breath that sounded like it meant to be a curse just the one whatre we missing two more i slid out of his grasp and to the snowcovered bleachers my jacket wasnt nearly long enough for sitting on and cold started seeping through my jeans immediately all women there and there and there i pointed blindly at the field unable to convince myself to lift my eyes and study it again not that it wouldve helped the snow was only snow again not breathing with its own chaotic pattern of lights i was just as glad that i couldnt hang on to the second sight for long what the hell made you call me in for this holliday that explained a lot billy hollidaybesides having one of the more unfortunate names id ever encounteredwas the departments numberone believer id played a mocking scully to his mulder until my own sensible world turned upside down hed been remarkably kind all things considered in not giving me too much shit since then if something struck him as genuinely abnormal about the murders it made a certain amount of sense for him to think of me god how i wished he hadnt i slumped down forehead against my knees which reminded me that id smacked my head earlier i pressed my palm against it tryingnot very hardto call up just enough of that energy inside me to smooth the bump away it didnt work i was almost grateful it suggested i wasnt as completely weird as the past couple of minutes proved me to be my silence drew on long enough to prompt my boss to keep talking something i hadnt intended but for which i was also grateful some teenagers found the first body holliday was on call and when they dug her freeyou should probably see for yourself do i have to my voice was still thin im a beat cop morrison not a homicide detective id never wanted to be either despite having attended the academy id been a mechanic and the short version was morrisond hired my replacement when i had to go overseas for a while but thanks to my mixed ethnic heritagei was half cherokeei looked too good on the roster to actually fire instead id gotten an upgrade from mechanic to actual living breathing cop morrison figuredhopedid spit in his face and quit i couldnt stand to give him the satisfaction which left me sitting in the snow whining and praying hed give me a break you have to so much for praying i got up brushed snow off my cold bottom and stumped down the bleachers billyd obviously been on duty when the kids called in about the body because he was wearing sensible shoes typically when he got called unexpectedly he came in wearing a pair of great heels which i still noticed because he had better taste in shoes than i did id never heard anybody tease him about crossdressing partly because he was a hell of a detective and partly because he was something over six feet tall and looked like he could break you in half it didnt hurt that his wife couldve been salma hayeks slightly more gorgeous sister at the moment though he was wearing regulation boots and crouched over a frozen woman whose insides were no longer in i stopped several feet back and said jesus by way of announcing my arrival the womans intestines stretched out of her belly and into the snow ropy frozen lines of blackness buried in the cold her stomach had been cut open in an efficient x and judging from the rictus her face was frozen in shed probably been alive when it happened if itd been summertime i probably would have lost my lunch but the icy strands and beads of cold on her face looked so surreal i couldnt quite wrap my mind around it having been a person once she looked like a prop on a sound stage for a movie set in the arctic hey joanie billy was watching the guys from forensics brush snow away from the womans body careful detailed work that gave lie to the fact that the weather had almost certainly destroyed any available evidence glad you could make it he pursed his lips and shrugged well i know what you mean i edged a few steps closer staring down at the woman reluctantly whyd you want me look at her he shrugged again got ritual murder all over it did the dead lady tell you that billy gave me a dirty look that i deserved id only learned recently that some of his intuitive leaps in homicide cases were courtesy of an occasional ability to converse with ghosts it was not the kind of thing i was comfortable with even thoughor particularly becausei could now do it myself no he said the physical evidence did can you not make jokes right now joanie this woman deserves some respect these women i let out a long exhalation looking at my feet theres two more isaw them satisfaction showed in billys voice for just an instant i knew bringing you in was the right thing to do you get anything else creepycrawlies shivered over my skin making me even more uncomfortable than a wet butt and dead bodies did by themselves billy was much much easier with weird shit than i was the shamanic gift that i hated having would have been far better off residing in him no im sorry i forbore to mention i didnt have a clue how to get anything else he looked disappointed enough as it was i lowered my voice feeling like a member of a sekrit brotherhood that dared not voice its name did you get anything billy shook his head been dead too long i never get anything from people whove been dead more than fortyeight hours they lose their connection with the world i nodded then frowned i thought you said your sister visited you three years after she died i guess bloods thicker than ether the wind picked up as he spoke a hairraising keen that had no business anywhere outside of a holler i instinctively lifted my shoulders against it then felt a scowl crinkling my forehead so hard it ached there was no new chill in the air no cutting cold through my coat despite the shriek of sound a shadow came down over the world making me look up at the sky as if the sun wasnt already hidden beneath doomfully gray clouds there were no clouds a window framed the section of sky i could see scattered stars valiantly struggling against the light of a brilliantly full moon irish lace curtains caught at the moons edges making it whimsical and delicate in the clear black sky seattles snowbound chill was driven from my skin and the breath i took was full of warm air and the scent of tea recognition jolted through me like needles under my fingernails i knew the window i knew the curtains and i knew that if i looked to my left i would see a near stranger lying beneath a handmade quilt and dying of nothing more than her own determination to do so i turned my head for all that i didnt want to look at the woman on the bed she had black hair worn much longer than mine it lay in softlooking waves against her white pillow stark contrast in the moonlight even in the bluewhite light her eyes were very green and her skin was nearly as pale as the pillowcase i heard myself say mirror mirror on the wall which i certainly hadnt said in real life i wouldnt have let myself even if id dared i was a wildly imperfect reflection of the woman on the bed where her skin was uniformly smooth and pale mine was marked with a handful of freckles scattered across my nose where her features were fine mine seemed too sharp or too blunt she was tall although not as tall as i was and had a degree of elegance to her that my long limbs and mechanics hands could never emulate her skin changed color a horrid sallowness creeping in i looked back at the moon to see blood draining over it fear scampered through me the pure childish terror of the unknown my voice broke as i said sheila but when i turned to her the woman was gone joanie billys hand on my elbow big and warm brought me back to the field with a start i looked at his hand then up at his worried frown you all right yeah i justkind of spaced out sorry i dont know what that was did you say something the wet chill of seattle winter settled back into my bones leaving me scowling at nothing the moon had been full the night my mother died but we hadnt spoken we hadnt had much to say to one another not from the time shed called me out of the blue to say she was dying and shed like to meet the daughter she abandoned twentysix years earlier id gone out of a mixed sense of duty and curiosity and spent four uncomfortable months that culminated in her death on the winter solstice almost three months ago to the day i said do you think theres anything else you can pick up youve got more mojo than i do his grin suggested he was biting his tongue to not ride me harder than that ill umshit the last word wasnt meant to be heard but billy laughed anyway i curled a lip and waved it off perversely glad that he was teasing me a little ill try i wanted to try about as much as i wanted to stick redhot pokers against my feet but i couldnt quite bring myself to say that to the one person who didnt think i was at all crazy granted he was nuts himself by any normal standards but i wasnt in a position to be throwing stones is the morning soon enough billy turned a sad smile on the womans body then made a gesture to encompass the rest of the field theres a lot to do here and i dont think another night is going to make this any harder on anybody you work tomorrow yeah ill give you anything ive got before i go out on patrol i admired the weary confidence in my voice as if i actually expected to come up with anything the problem was that i was afraid i might all right thanks joanie billy hesitated a moment before adding i know you dont like this so im a great sport for going along with it i know tomorrow billy it was more than not liking it it was like fingernails on chalkboards combined with dentist drills on unnumbed teeth my world was a sensible straightforward place checking out ritual murders on a psychic level simply did not belong i kicked clumps of snow as i slogged back to morrison to bum a ride home he was driving his personal vehicle a gold toyota avalon xlswhich i thought of as the american version of boxy but safeso he hadnt been on duty when hed called me i didnt envy him his job neither of us spoke during the whole drive both wrapped up in our individual discomfort of what i was doing there i didnt even say thanks when i got out just thumped the top of his car and watched him drive off only after he disappeared down the ave did i go into my building taking the steps up to my fifthfloor apartment two at a time gary to whom i was practically certain i had not given a key was hanging out in my apartment playing tetris on my computer thought you never touched the things i said as i unlaced my boots you didnt leave any entertainment rags what was i supposed to do cook dinner i put the boots on the carpet where all the melting snow would be absorbed and slid into the kitchen in my stocking feet nothin to cook i looked details details besides there is too ive got at least three different frozen dinners in here i heard the telltale musical bloop that said hed died horribly in the game and a moment later he appeared in the door frame making it look ridiculously small with his bulk even in his eighth decade he retained the build of the linebacker hed once been a fact that he took no small amount of pride in so was there a body i pulled two microwave dinners out of the freezer do you remember calling me a bloodhound when we first met nope gary gave me a disarming smile so there was a body there were three and i really didnt want to say anything else i busied myself stabbing holes in the plastic tops of the dinners then mumbled as fast as i could and i said id maybe do a little checking out of what was going on in the astral realm sort of thing i dont suppose youd hang around and bang a drum after dinner eh gary cupped a hand behind his ear leaning forward a little and wearing a cocky grin that would do james garners maverick proud whatd you say im an old man lady cant hear when you dont speak up i hate you gary he beamed at me now thats no way to talk to an old man joanne walkingstick augh gary no stop that id dropped my last name along with the rest of my cherokee heritage when i graduated from high school and a compulsive slip of the tonguewas there such a thing it had felt like it at the timehad caused me to mention the longsinceabandoned name to gary the day wed met its walker dont do that gary the humor id started with fell away into discomfort and i shrugged my shoulders unhappily as i put the first meal into the microwave please hey he came into the kitchen to put a hand on my shoulder and turn me around no harm meant jo you arright i just i summarized the experience at the park staring alternately at his feet and my own not wanting to meet his eyes i just hate this shit and the thing with remembering my mother all of a sudden just freaked me out the microwave beeped and i turned back to it my stomach grumbling gary put a hand on the door keeping me from opening it lets hit the voodoo stuff first darlin food grounds you you know that youre shooting yourself in the foot by eating first he lifted a bushy eyebrow or is that on purpose i squirmed feeling like id been caught being naughty gary grinned bright flash of white teeth that looked like hed never smoked a cigarette in his life and steered me into the living room wheres your drum bedroom i dragged a cushion off the couch and stuffed it against the front door cutting off the draft that circled from beneath it gary went into my bedroom like he belonged there and got my drum it was the only thing i owned of any intrinsic value itd been a gift from one of the elders out in qualla boundary not long after my father and i moved back there it was painted with a raven whose wings sheltered a wolf and a rattlesnake and had a drumstick with a soft rabbitfur end dyed raspberry red and a knotted leather end that made sharp rich pangs of sound against the taut leather even fourteen years after having been gifted with it i was still amazed anyone would make something like it for me gary knew it and carried it as if it was fragile a gesture that made my nose sting with embarrassing emotion i settled down on the floor as he came out of the bedroom with the drum and a closed fist i thought you might want this i turned my hand up and he dropped a silver choker into my palm made of tube links intersected by triskelions it had an irish crossa simple quartered circle identical to the cherokee power circleas its pendant what your mom gave it to you didnt she yeah i shed given it to me the day she died id worn it for two weeks gradually getting used to the peculiar feeling of having something resting in the hollow of my throat until the day id been stabbed through the lung and the necklace had been blackened with my blood itd taken days to get the stains out and i hadnt brought myself to put it back on in the intervening weeks yeah all right i swallowed nervously and fastened the choker with fingers that suddenly felt thick and clumsy youre all mr insightful tonight arent you gary sat down on the couch cushion that hadnt been scavenged grinning somebodys gotta be you ready i nodded fighting the urge to curl my fingers around the necklace and pull it away from my throat to alleviate the alien pressure of jewelry against my skin ill wake up thirty seconds after you stop drumming wed only done this a few times but establishing the time felt like ritual gary started knocking out a heartbeat rhythm and i let my eyes drift shut waiting to follow the sound of the drum out of my own body i had a deep dark secret the world i saw through shamanic eyesthe one in which every thing on earth be it animal mineral or vegetable sparked with the essence of lifewas a world i dreamed about even when i was dead set against its reality the world i saw with my spirit eyes was one where i could see garys big rumbly presence like a v engine that a girl could rely on it was one where i could slide through the ceiling and get an alarming look at my neighbors sexual proclivitiesalthough this time i went through the window when i separated from my body because i can be taught and i really didnt need another eyeful of somebody elses sex life except for the glimpse that afternoon i hadnt looked at the world from a spirits perspective since january when my life got turned upside down in the first place there was something offkilter as i slid into the seattle night winter had come on too hard and the life in the city that sped below me felt strained like the world was being pushed in a direction it wasnt prepared to go in the blues id seen a few months ago seemed darker the electricity of life dammed up in some way streets seemed more congested as if their purpose had been forgotten it hadnt been like this a few months ago and the feel of it made my skin prickle there was a lingering feeling of familiarity below the wrongness but when i reached for it it slipped away i spun through the air weightless and silent watching sudden flashes of red and orange erupt in backedup traffic countered by calm waves of blue that i tried to encourage clumsily i passed a stretch of road where a womans astrally projected spirit hovered above her car looking down at traffic much like i did pure boredom emanated from her as if driving home had been so dull itd flung her out of her own body she didnt seem to sense my presence and i whisked past her not knowing how to stop and say hello i left the city behind without having a destination in mind moving as fast as thought itself color vivid and strong streaked with the coldness of winter shot past me sometimes forming into recognizable images but more often staying abstract i wondered if the abstraction was due to my lack of direction but with the thought came a clear pathway that i recognized with a startled shiver a bower of trees arched over a singletrack path white flowers all but glowing under a source of light i couldnt pinpoint the path was smooth as if it had been often walked on i tumbled from flight to run along it great huge strides so i felt i was still flying there was a presence in front of me somewhere buried in the depths of the earth it carried its own weight its own gravity well drawing me toward it i careened around a corner pretending i was driving petite and came up against a cave its mouth blocked off with boulders the presence beyond the cave mouth had a genial feeling to it as if it were amused at my audacity and youth i hated feeling like people were laughing at me i glowered at the boulders and reached for the smallest stone i could find trying to wriggle it out of its lodged position in the ranks of larger stones a vise clamp fastened itself around my wrist hauled me back and did something that put my feet over my head and my head against the ground i lay on my face with a mouthful of dirt not entirely sure how id gotten there but pretty certain that any moment now i was going to start to hurt and what is it a womans voice above me asked that you think youre doing siobhán walkingstick the lilt of ireland was strong in her voice almost masking the sarcasm with which the question was delivered i was pretty sure she didnt want an answer i had comparatively little experience with mothers but the tone suggested to me that she knew perfectly well what i was doing and that the real question was why was i doing something she obviously regarded as unbelievably stupid the physical pain i was expecting didnt seem to be coming so i rolled onto my back and stared up at her she looked remarkably tall from this vantage and somewhat bustier than i thought of her as being she also wore an expression of exasperation that was both more vivid than any expression i could remember seeing on her in life and which although strictly speaking was entirely new to me i had felt on my own face any number of times distress settled over me it didnt seem fair that i was turning into my mother when id barely even known the woman eventually one of the numerous things crowding my mind and vying to be said won out i asked you not to call me that it seemed even at the moment an awfully calm response to the appearance of a woman i believed to be dead i was treated to a second new expression dismay which was wiped out almost instantly by the thoughtful examining gaze that was all id really ever seen of her very well then joanne her tone spoke volumes about what she thought of my anglicized name but i was almost entirely overwhelmed with not caring i got to my feet somewhat stiffly although i suspected any injuries id sustained were in my own mind of course they were thats what happens when you travel on the astral plane moving on then i looked back to the wall of rocks eyeing the one id initially grabbed joanne my mother said in a remarkably good dont you dare test my patience one more time young lady voice i dropped my hand and turned to face her making a point of looking around rather dramatically im sorry i said did you think you had something to say to me that i might listen to is there some burning reason that i should pay attention to i dont know what are you a banshee or something youre dead mother we didnt much like each other when you werent dead why dont we just leave it at that and you can go do whatever it is dead people do im busy busy yes i went to work on my rock again tugging it a few millimeters out of the wall she clamped her hand around my wrist again her fingers were tremendously cold not just like the dead but as if she was emitting cold the way a living body emits heat you dont understand what youre doing joanne i hated the warm lilt of her voice a low alto that i wanted to instinctively trust i couldnt possibly have recognized it shed abandoned me with my father when i was three months old but from the moment shed called me seven months ago id fought against wanting to curl up in the warmth and safety of that voice and letting myself forget about the world like you could possibly know what im doing i dont even know what youre doing here go away i yanked my wrist trying to escape her grasp i failed in that but i did manage to loosen the rock i held the entire wall shifted ominously deep scrapes of stone bumping down a few inches against one another my mother hissed a sound like an angry cat then lifted her voice in a high keen that made me jerk away again this time succeeding and clamping my hands over my ears you will not pass this barrier siobhán walkingstick her voice thundered inside my head making me equal parts angry and dizzy i set my teeth together and stomped forward grabbing my stone again they always say i never knew what hit me technically i knew what hit me it was my mother beyond that i really dont know what happened except one second i had the stone in my hands and the next i was about forty feet away lying on my back in the dirt and she was standing over me like one of gods avenging angels in a blouse and long skirt my lip was bleeding i lifted the back of my hand to it staring up at her she crouched putting a hand on my shoulder it seemed to carry the weight of the world behind it as profoundly heavy as the draw that had pulled me toward the cave mouth in the first place you are not yet ready to face what lies beyond that wall daughter i havent much time to act and less time still to tell you about it get yourself home ive no energy for wasting on sullen little girls who refuse to listen to their mothers her will hit me like a wall itself reaching right for the core of energy inside me as if it was her own she shoved me into the earth with the hand on my shoulder using my own stored power as her focus point i popped out the other side and into my body so hard i fell over backward gary stopped drumming and jumped to his feet while i stared at the ceiling and tried to determine if all my parts were where i thought they should be they were after a few seconds i said ow and thought id leave it at that there was no part of me that didnt hurt it wasnt the godawful pain of having a sword driven through me but i ached like someone hadwell shoved me through solid ground i said ow again for good measure and pushed myself up slowly gary hovered over me nervous but kind enough not to ask what the hell happened all right kind enough not to ask for a few seconds at least i shook my head exhaustion sweeping over me without warning the bubble of energy inside me that i spent so much time trying to ignore was depleted again i felt like id been depending on it without knowing about it i need food i got up largely to see if i could and wobbled to the kitchen door when id reached the frame without mishap i turned my head to answer garys question i dont think my mother is as dead as i thought she was i refused to say anything else until id eaten gary finally stopped asking zombie vampire wraith and ate his own dinner watching me with the eagerness of a kid at christmastime i swear anybody on the planetexcept possibly morrisonwould have been better suited to my insane new world than i was billy had already lived with something like it his whole life gary thought it was cool i wanted it to all go away so i could sleep in peace at night and work on petite by day theres something out there i finally said gary gave an evocative snort that made me aim a kick at him under the table to both our surprise it connected and he yelped looking injured sorry i mean something that wants me to go check it out my mother was standing sentinel over it tonight she wasnt there last time last time i saw it in january look that doesnt matter she kicked my ass gary put a bite of spaghettithe closest thing i had in the freezer to chicken fettuccinein his mouth to hide a smirk i drew my foot back for another kick then remembered id managed to hit him once already and felt guilty he looked smug making me annoyed for feeling guilty so i swung at him again i missed so obviously i said through gritted teeth she thinks whatevers behind door number one is dangerous then you should stay away from it gary said wisely i dont even know what it is mothers are always right dont you know that he wrinkled his eyes into nonexistence as i scowled at him right i forgot sorry he paused mothers are always right you dont wanna find out whats behind that door gary he lifted his hands defensively im just sayin well dammit i want to know whats back there i hesitated she said i wasnt ready for it garys bushy eyebrows rose if youll excuse me for coppin a phrase from today duh you really think youre ready for the monster in the closet no but id like to know what it is knowledge is half the battle or something look gary pointed his fork at me whatd you go in there looking for i shrugged uncomfortable i dont know nothing specific okay theres your problem you got no focus you need to go in there and talk to somebody who knows whats going on your buddy the coyote coyote never gives me a straight answer i sounded just like the sullen kid my mother had accused me of being yeah thats kinda what the whole trickster thing is all about jo i flung my hands in the air why do you know that why does everybody on the whole planet know this stuff that i dont why didnt somebody else get this stupid talent you can have it youd be a lot better at it than i am gary huffed probably my rant cut off as my jaw dropped garys gray eyes sparked good humor with a steely undercut you done uh i cleared my throat um yes thank you you got something special kid youre gonna have to learn to suck it up and live with it or walk away right now theres some dead ladies out there that maybe you can help if you stop your whining and bitching and get on with it are you gonna do that or what okay i sounded very small and pathetic and embarrassed arright gary got up his plastic spaghetti dish in one hand lets go try this again then he stalked into the living room leaving his muttered jeez dames lingering on the air it took longer to go under this time in part because of chagrin and in part because of the microwaved fried chicken that settled in my tummy and made me more aware of my body than was helpful after several minutes of drumming though i suddenly fell backward into my body and found myself scrambling down a thin tunnel in search of an internal garden that somehow reflected the state of my soul there was a fundamental difference between going there and goingother placesthat i went it struck me that it might really be helpful to get a grasp of the different levels of reality that i seemed to be able to access being able to name them for example could be useful it might make me soundor at least feellike less of an idiot whether i had a name for it or not the journey to my garden felt distinctly internal whereas moving to the astral plane seemed to involve leaving my body in some kind of upward fashion i scuttled through little tunnels feeling myself drawing closer to the center of me until the light turned gray around me and i popped out of a mousesized hole in one of the walls surrounding my garden i looked back and the hole was gone sealed up safely by my meager mental defenses the garden itself waswell it wasnt quite dead which was something it was functional not beautiful with straight pathways in geometric patterns and grass cropped so short i could see dirt between individual blades a small pond with its own waterfall bubbled at one end of the garden more agitated than i remembered it being i took a couple of deep breaths to see if it would calm the pond but it didnt seem to help the problems deeper than your breathing joanne i dont have any problems there i went again with the juvenileresponse syndrome i waited a few seconds trying not to blush then looked for the speaker who lolled on a concrete bench his tongue hanging out i tried very very hard to modulate my voice into politeness as i said hello coyote he rolled to a sitting position and shook himself all over golden eyes bright as he cocked his head at me if you dont have any problems what are you doing shouting for me i i took a deep breath and stood up straighter i need some um help guidance i latched on to the word feeling rather proud of myself please i added hastily if you could nice mr coyote man i thought but didnt say i didnt have to he snapped his teeth at me like i was an annoying fly i heard that my shoulders sagged coyote could hear anything i thought while i heard nothing of what he thought sometimes i thought that meant id made him up other times i was equally certain it meant i hadnt you did not make me up coyote said no i muttered youd be cuter and less annoying if i had he grinned a coyote grin at me and stretched long and lazy when he was done stretching he wasnt a brown and gold beast any longer instead an indian man sat there his skin as red as bricks and his hair blueblack and long and falling to his hips he wore jeans and was barefoot looking incredibly comfortable in his own skin only the eyes were the same bright gold and full of mirth is this better it was certainly cuter he laughed even though i hadnt spoken out loud and stood up to go drag a hand through the bubbling pool at the end of my garden what do you need jo thereve been some murders andmy mother is alive or something ican you help me find her he lifted his head in a swift motion more like a coyote than a man your mother is up there in the astral realm or whatever it is bossing me around wow i was practically certain spirit guides were not supposed to say wow cause you know so much about spirit guides he said ill see if i can you wont be needing to lad jesus christ i whipped around unbalancing myself with the motion to find my mother standing directly in front of the mouse hole that i couldve sworn closed up when i arrived she ignored me momentarily focused on coyote sheila macnamarra she said to him a pleasure and arent you the handsome one joannes a lucky girl my dead mother was matchmaking me with a dog great im not a dog im hardly matchmaking joanne you opened up the conduit im just here to say hello i set my teeth together and waited a few seconds before i trusted my voice hello mother i waited a few more seconds before it burst out of me what the hell are you doing alive a trace of surprise and injury darkened her eyes im not alive joanne you saw me die then what are you doing here besides kicking my ass back into my body which hurt thank you very much not nearly so much as facing down that enemy would have hurt joanne sheila made a small and elegant gesture bringing her hands in toward her heart as if collecting sorrow there theres very little time and a great deal to tell you id hoped we could talk before but you werent ready before what before i died sheila said nonplussed that was why i asked you to come of course i never dreamed youd be so closed off if youd been ready i could have explained so much ready for what i felt very small and young suddenly a feeling that was reflected in the garden it grew around me dramatically until coyote and my mother both towered over me and even the sparse blades of grass seemed much larger in comparison to my own height my mother cast a glance at coyote that clearly said she despaired of me but she brought her attention back to me in an instant to accept your heritage at least on my side what youve got to face youre still not ready to hear it but the moon is changing and im out of time siobhán listen to me im a gwyld a shaman i interrupted dully id heard the word before only directed at me not my mother some kind of druidic version of a shaman you came back from the dead to tell me that like it could possibly matter like i could care i was not i knew being fair part of me did care part of me cared so much it hurt to breathe and that was the part that lashed out at her it was perversely like finding out there was a santa after all frustration creased her forehead i left the mortal world to protect you siobhán ive known since before you were born what you might be what it was youd have to face but you were so unprepared i saw no other choice you needed protecting what i said if you strike me down ill become more powerful than you can ever imagine is that your gig complete incomprehension flitted across her expression i set my teeth together about to lash out again but a shriek of wind erupted sounding in my ears but going unfelt against my skin my gaze went to the sky even as a shadow dark and red fell across my vision again a full moon hung above me one that hadnt been shining on my garden moments before one with blood spilling down its face and with a piece of darkness falling from it like a scythe a deep sense of malignancy boiled up inside me as if a thing of hatred was being born cold raging hands seemed to clench around my heart and i listened frantically for the rhythmic drumbeat that would let me know i was still alive my mother let go an inhuman screech like a car braking too hard and flung herself at the sky her hair spread out like ravens wings blocking my view of the bloody moon the slice of night that had fallen from it was enveloped by the black spiderweb of her hair i heard another yowl as gutwrenching as the earlier ones and the barbs that had knotted in my heart loosened a small furry bundle of bone crashed into my chest knocking my heart into pounding again as sweat stood out on my body in cold terror coyote stood over me for a moment or two his golden gaze fixed on mine before he brought his head down to smash it against mine with tremendous force for the second time in a single evening i slammed out of the realm of other and back into my body aching all over with pain and confusion it took the better part of an hour to get gary out of my apartment which both made me feel better and worse when he was gone i sat on the couch with a pillow hugged against my chest staring blindly at nothing it was inconceivable to me that my mother had been some sort of mystic the woman id known for a few scant months had held her cards close to the chest always judging and never commenting id spent four months with her and when she died felt as though id known nothing more about her than she liked altoids thered been no real mourning at least not on my part confusion yes and not to be delicate about it a whole lot of resentment shed disrupted a life in which i had not missed her to any noticeable degree in order to have me witness her death shed been young only fiftythree and in extremely good health id been left with the impression that she was bored of life and as such saw fit to leave it under her own power it appeared that the power in question was more literal than id thought i mean anybody who could will herself to death wasnt a person whose emotional state was one i wanted to tangle with she might decide it was time for me to die and i might not be tough enough to argue i hadnt even tried arguing in favor of her life which probably made me a very bad daughter not that there was any really compelling reason to be a good daughter to the woman whod abandoned me when i was a few months old we hadnt liked each other as adults i could only assume she hadnt much cared for me as a baby either a fine thread of emptiness wove through me an ache that id spent the better part of my life resolutely ignoring i hadnt been given up for adoption by a mother who thought it was best for me id been dumped on a father who hadnt known i existed until that moment by a mother who evidently didnt like me very much it was not something i enjoyed thinking about especially as it reminded me inevitably of a boy growing up in north carolina whom i had known full well i couldnt properly mother not at fifteen not in the confusion of mourning the sister whod been born with him and whod died just minutes later too small to live i set my teeth together and put my forehead against the pillow shoving away every thought of family ties that came haunting me introspection was not my strong suit i didnt like to look back and i wasnt prepared for the past in the form of my dead mother to come calling i fell asleep sometime after midnight still wrapped around the scratchy couch pillow monday march am there was a place on the other side of sleep that id been to where id walked among the dead and spoken with them the plana plan which i didnt have any intention of mentioning aloud not even to myselfhad been to whoosh through dreamtime find the dead women and learn whod killed them then jaunt off to work like don juan triumphant instead i woke up stiff and disoriented the next morning curled up on the solitary couch cushion without having had a single moments otherworldly experience while i slept an ache of uselessness welled up behind my eyes not only did i not understand what was going on but the baser part of me didnt care having it all go away would have been far more within my comfort zone i had just used the phrase comfort zone with all due seriousness right inside my own head i clearly needed to get up stick my head in a bowl of cold water and drink a pot of strong coffee which i did except it was a hot shower instead of a cold bowl and i swear i didnt drink more than three cups of coffee honest i called a cabnot gary he knew too much about me and i wasnt up to facing that this morningand went to work my nose mashed against the window i missed petite i wanted to be cozy and safe driving her instead of taking a cab i had a better relationship with my car than i had with most people with any people a small and somewhat snide voice inside my head said i told it to go away paid the cabby and stumped through the precinct building to find billy actually i was looking for his desk where i figured i could leave a note explaining my humiliating inability to find anything useful and then run away before i had to confess my failure out loud id come in early just to be sure i could pull that off billy was earlier he leaned on his elbow big palm wrinkling the side of his face until his left eye had all but disappeared into the curves of flesh he looked like hed been up all night which was not only possible but likely an attack of guilt grabbed me by the throat i snuck back out of the precinct building and scurried down the street to the doughnut shop to get him a lemonpoppyseed muffin and an oversize mocha his face actually lit up when i plopped them down on his desk several minutes later which made me feel slightly less like a loser youre a goddess the side of his face was one big red mark from leaning on his hand too long he unwrapped the muffin took a slurp of coffee and squinted up at me you didnt get anything about the murders did you is it that obvious back to loserville you look like a kicked puppy but ill forgive you anything for the next five minutes because you brought me the manna of heaven damn i looked at the muffin impressed i shoulda gotten me one of those things billy chuckled and sank back in his chair its unoiled hinge drawing out a creak that slowly lifted every individual hair from my fingertips to my nape i wrapped my hands around his coffee cup for a few seconds trying to chase the chill away he ate half the muffin in one bite then nodded at his computer screen speaking around crumbs id forgive you anyway i found some stuff out not about our dead girls they all had id by the way were seeing if theyve got anything in common but so far they look random anyway the murders somehow i was able to understand every word he said i usually couldnt understand most of what i said when my mouth was full i twisted around to look at the computer screen interpol thought of it this morning i remembered reading about some kind of ritual murders about thirty years ago you read them thirty years ago billy wasnt more than ten years older than i was he gave me a look that suggested i shut up i pressed my lips together and widened my eyes all innocence the murders were about thirty years ago i read about them a few years ago pedant because you what read about ritual murders for fun joanie billy said annoyed i lifted my hands in apology and tried to keep quiet billy glared at me until he was sure i wasnt going to interrupt again then continued these women all had their intestines stretched out connecting them with one another i suddenly wished i hadnt drunk a lot of acidic coffee for breakfast and looked around for something neutral to eat there was nothing handy except billys muffin the second half of which he stuffed in his mouth clearly suspecting that i was about to raid it a burp rose up through the soured coffee in my stomach and i clamped my hand over my mouth tasting coffeeflavored bile yuck youve got a soft heart joanie billy gave me a very tiny smile that did a lot to make me feel better im not a homicide detective mmm yeah anyway so i remembered this morning reading about a murder like that over in europe its not the kind of thing the authorities like to noise around no kidding my stomach was still bubbling with ook so weve got a copycat either that or somebodys changed his hunting grounds anyway the only case there was an eyewitness for was like i said about thirty years ago a woman who was presumably supposed to be the last victimtheres never more than fourfought back and managed to escape the garda síochána this was in ireland i didnt mean to interrupt it just popped out billys ears moved back with surprise yeah what you had some runins with the cops while you were there no i just remember my mother talking about the garda she didnt call them the síochána i said the word carefully sheacawna i had to ask her what it meant it means police billy said helpfully then waved off my exasperated raspberry yeah you know that right anyway they werent able to find the guy and for a while the woman was under suspicion but she got off when the marks on the victims bodies had obviously been made by somebody a lot bigger than she was theyre usually strangled into semiconsciousness before the horrible stuff begins like being halfstrangled isnt horrible it had nothing on having your innards ripped out while you were still alive and i lifted a hand to stop billys protestation i know so what was her name maybe we can talk to her get some kind of information about this psycho that might help us billy leaned forward chair shrieking protest again to pull up a minimized screen that was my thought she was from mayo ive got some people there looking to see if they can find her her name wasoops wrong window he pulled up another one scrolling down her name was sheila macnamarra i finished feeling lightheaded the woman on the computer screen looked more like me than the one id known had there was a ranginess to her that i shared and our eyes were shaped more alike than id realized id never seen a picture of my mother when she was young and young she was the photo showed her from the thighs up she was obviously several months pregnant with me i closed my eyes unable to think while looking at the photograph on the computer screen you wont i cleared my throat trying to wash away the break id heard in my voice you wont find her shes dead joanie billy sounded bewildered you know this woman yeah i wished i was wearing my glasses so i could pull them off instead my hand wandered around my face like a bird looking for a resting space my fingers pressed against my mouth then spread out to cover the lower half of my face before curling in again i couldnt stop the little actions even when i tried shes my mother i wanted the next half hour or so to disappear into a jumble of confusion but it adamantly refused to it was all horribly clear with an overwhelming babble of questions that i caught every syllable of and a host of concerned confused angry expressions that wouldnt let me back up and take stock of the situation no one had known my mothers name not any more than i knew billys moms name everyone had known id gone to ireland to meet her and that shed died but nobodyd pried beyond that which id been perfectly happy about now though morrison was standing over mewell trying to i was on my feet too unable to stay sitting while he demanded to know how it was i coincidentally had connections to this woman whod been a suspect albeit briefly in a murder case that was nearly thirty years old he went on for quite a while during which billy tried to be the voice of reason and i watched them both with growing incredulity finally i edged between them and said captain which brought morrison up short i rarely resorted to using his actual title look this was my reasonable voice i didnt have a lot of hope for it working on morrison but id never tried it before and anything was worth trying once my mother obviously didnt kill those women she wasnt big enough the police reports cover all that i guess i am big enough i lifted one of my hands with its long fingers and shrugged and we have no idea when our women died so actually billy said i winced and looked at him he grimaced back apologetically and shrugged the first body has a fair amount of degradation they figured she died about three weeks before it started getting cold enough to snow so much probably around christmas morrisons cheeks went a dangerous dark florid purple youre telling me we had a body lying around woodland park for three weeks before it snowed and nobody noticed the good news i said under his outrage is that i was in ireland at a funeral on christmas good alibi how the hell morrison shouted ignoring me did a body lie around in a public park for three weeks without anyone noticing i dont billy began morrison roared find out and stalked into his office slamming the door behind him everyone within forty feet flinched i sucked my lower lip into my mouth and watched the venetian blinds inside the captains office swing from the force of the door crashing shut do you think he does that for dramatic effect i didnt realize that was my outside voice until nervous laughter broke around me then rolled over into outright good humor someone smacked me on the shoulder and the audience that had gathered for the drama broke up it never failed to astonish me how there were always people around to watch tense moments unfold youd think none of us had jobs to do i followed billy back to his desk since i still wasnt on shift for another forty minutes i really hate to say this he eyed me wary but but im pretty sure nobody was supposed to see that body i dont think it was cosmic coincidence i think there was my tongue seemed to be swelling up and choking my throat in order to prevent me from continuing my sentence part of me wished it would succeed power power was easier to say than that other word the fiveletter one that began with m and ended with agic involved yeah billys eyebrows rose a fraction of an inch can you do that billy i cant even pick my nose without using a finger sometimes my mouth should stop and consult my brain before it says anything billy got this wideeyed look of admiration that belonged on a nineyearold boy it said wow that was really gross and more important how come i didnt think of it my mouth consulted my brain this time and i asked i dont suppose you could just forget i said that no billy said in a tone that matched the admiration still in his eyes i dont think i can im going to have to tell that one to robert melinda will kill you billys grin turned beatific yeah he said happily girls dont get stuff like that except you he added hastily but youre sort of not like a girl i stared at him after a while he realized he might have said something wrong and backed up hastily i mean you areof course youre a girl its just you know youre one of the guys billy i said bear in mind that what youre saying is coming from a man who wears nail polish im not sure its helping see thats what im saying have you ever worn nail polish no i said slowly i started to put some on once but it made my fingers feel heavy and i hated it okay then so what im saying is i bet more of the guys here have worn fingernail polish than you have so im more like a guy than one of the guys my tone was flat and dangerous well i thought it was billy didnt seem to feel threatened kind of yeah youre like an überguy you know everything about cars and you drink beer and shoot guns only then you also clean up pretty good billy i was a hundredpercent cranky and this time he heard it he looked up surprise lifting his eyebrows solve your own damned case i turned on my heel and stalked away i stomped all the way down to the garage beneath the precinct building and peeked around the stairwell wall peeking wasnt much in keeping with my stompy mood but i wanted to see if my archnemesis thor the thunder god was in the garage before i went in he was of course i sat down in the shadow at the foot of the stairsthe last flourescent light in the row above the steps had never to the best of my recollection been functionaland wrapped my arms around my knees watching the mechanics at work this was where i belonged id gone to the academy because the department had paid my way but id never wanted to be a cop i was a mechanic and something of a computer geek the two went hand in hand with modern cars and i was happy with both labels but my mother had taken her time dying they had hired thor as my replacement and now i was a cop his name wasnt really thor it was ed or ted or something of that nature he just looked like thor big and blond with muscles on his muscles he was working on mark rodriguezs car which was forever having the wheels pulled out of alignment i had a suspicion that rodriguez went home and beat the axles with a hammer but i couldnt prove it thor wasnt working on the wheels right now though he was under the hood his convictorange jumpsuit and blond hair bright against the shadows cast by the overhead lights i put my chin on my knees watching silently from the shadows it wasnt as good as being up to my elbows in grease myself but the smell of oil and gasoline was as soothing to me as mothers milk not that anything about my mother was soothing i stifled a groan and put my forehead against my knees listening to the muffled cursing and goodnatured banter that went on over the rumbles and squeaks of fixing cars tension ebbed out of my shoulders as the comfort sounds and smells vied with my mothers memory for priority in my thought process sheila won out the image of her pregnant kept invading the backs of my eyelids she was prettier than i was and looked serenely confident as she stared back at me from behind my eyes i could all but see the wind picking up her hair long black strands that whisked back from her face with a life of their own but no matter how hard i tried to meet her eyes i couldnt read any emotion in them come on i didnt think i was speaking aloud i was talking to a memory of someone id never known tell me whats going on cant you whats this guy want you stopped him once o mystical mother give me something to work with here she didnt evidently not even the memory of her responded well to sarcasm i sighed and dropped my head farther against my knees in the garage metal bit into metal with a highpitched squeal a shriek that should have lifted hairs on my arms and made me shiver with discomfort it had exactly the opposite effect draining away tension from my neck and making my grip on my own arms slip a little so that i slumped even more on the stairs id spent far too much time in shops listening to that sound to find it uncomfortable at least not when i heard it someplace like the garage where it belonged its a strange way you have of belonging that sound made me flinch my fingers tightening around my arms again i could still hear the scream of metal although as i lifted my head it seemed to blend with a wuthering wind no less eerie a sound sheila macnamarra my very own mother stood a few feet away wearing the cableknit sweater and jeans shed worn in the photograph taken almost twentyseven years ago a silver necklace glinted in the hollow of her throat all but hidden by the sweater her hair was lifted on the wind moving slowly as if time was being stretched thin and we were slipping between moments of it sure and thats whats happening now isnt it she took a step forward the blustery gray sky behind her superimposed over the shops girders and lights siobhán grania macnamarra my name sounded liquid and lovely in her accent if i overlooked the fact that none of it was the name i considered mine you grew up so tall my girl sheila curved her hand over her tummy and smiled at me your father was tall he still is my voice was hoarse i could see blowing grass around her knees and a white twostory house in the middle of a field i could also see with a little more effort the shop behind her this was not like any of my limited experiences with worlds that were other as much as i wasnt crazy about those at least i kind of knew what to expect from them this was a whole new ball game are you real that i am sheila crouched so that she was looking up at me on my stair so its come round again has it were back to where we began you and i howve we been girl have we had a good life together cold shocked against my skin from the inside making my cheeks burn what are you talking about we havent had any life together at all youre dead sheilas shoulders pulled back her face blanching am i now she stood hands pressed against her thighs and took a few steps away her shoulder ended up lodged in the stairwell corner which bothered the hell out of me and didnt seem to phase her at all and how long have i been dead about three months what you dont kn wire contracted around my lungs forcing air out as surely as a sword could i rubbed the heel of my hand against my breastbone and tried to pull in a breath deep enough to snap the feeling of suffocation you dont know my words had no strength behind them im talking to the you from thirty years ago i told you now didnt i that we were between moments of time sheila turned back to me sudden urgency crackling in her movements and here i thought this was something done on purpose but its not lass is it youve fallen through time and dont even know how youve done it have i been such a poor mother to you then taught you nothing of the old ways ah siobhán whats gone on my name is joanne even as i spoke i saw the words cut her something i hadnt intended her eyes lost some of their light and she fell back a step lowering her gaze i see joanne then its a fine name and isnt it though now tell me girl you called me but i think its my own skill thats brought me here not yours she frowned at me faint and censuring i can see the power in you but its raw and untempered i dont understand youre a woman grown you should be at the height of your skill by now theres not really time to go into it right now mother you stopped someone a killer right it was all coming out much more sharply than i meant it to but i had no idea how to deal with this woman there was softness in her kindness love it didnt fit with the mother id known and i was afraid distraction would keep me from ever understanding what was going on she was already dead it seemed a little late for her to be getting the answers she needed hes back or somebody like him is back whats going on i watched it happen the gentleness drained from her leaving behind something much colder and more stark lines that i hadnt seen in her face a second earlier now etched themselves around her mouth and between her eyebrows the serenity washed away leaving behind nothing more than resolution a wave of sickness and sorrow hit me in the stomach and overtook my whole body making tears sting at the back of my eyes my throat tightened up and my hands cramped from cold the girl in the photograph was gone and the woman id known as my mother had replaced her i wanted to say i was sorry to take the words back because id liked the confused lightvoiced young woman from the photo and id made her leave i was never going to escape that with a handful of sentences id taken the joy out of my own mothers heart and turned her into someone whose focus was so strong that she could will herself to death while i sat by her side and watched the shriek of metal penetrated my awareness again combining with the wind to scream in banshee cries that i thought would wake me up every night for the rest of my life ive yet to fight the blade those poor women their lives lost and to no avail sheila curved both her hands over her belly now then made fists of her hands damn him damn them both to hell me there was something about an irishman cursing someone to hell that carried far more conviction than an american making the same damnation my voice came out a childish squeak betraying a fear i thought should be absurd but which seemed very real at that moment sheila jerked her head up then yanked her hands away from her pregnant tummy no the softness was gone from the irish lilt leaving cold edges not you siobhán joanne i thought i had the strength to banish him and lock away his master forever but there are things i will not risk me i squeaked again sheila flattened her hand against the curve of her belly again the gesture more than answer enough my head began to pound a throb that fit into the beats between the rise and fall of the wind and tearing metal you didnt stop this guy who rips out peoples entrails for fun and profit because you were protecting me sure and i thought id be stopping him girl hard dissonant notes sounded in my mothers voice id thought this plan through for so long break his power circle and push him so far out of time hell be lost for good but i cant follow him to the ends of the earth to make certain for the life within me cant withstand the journey my fragile siobhán time blurred with a squeal of sound a toofast babbling of voices being sped up the light changed winter sun dropping and darkening into night clouds whisking above sheila faded to an ominous red as if the shadow of an eclipse was slipping over them even the prosaic flourescent lights burning behind the memory of clouds began bleeding i twisted in my stair seat looking behind me at a low red moon dread prickled up through the soles of my feet itching like bee stings and spread higher into my body the bleat of time fastforwarding slowed and avaricious malevolence crawled over me pinning me in place like an unfortunate butterfly my lungs filled with blood pain slicing my cheek as i clapped my hand against a healedover scar there my fingers came away coated in red wetness a piece of darkness fell away from the crimson moon plunging tip over tail to the earth in the instant before it smashed to the ground blackness flared and it became a man or at least a thing that looked like a man emaciated and pale it moved too smoothly to be human gliding across the irish field and through the garage walls faster than a man could run my belly contracted the knot of power hidden there flaring ready to be used if i could think of a way to use it i couldnt think at all the thing the mani saw in a flash of moonlight how sharp and narrow his features were like the rest of him and remembered that sheila had called him the blade it seemed like a good name and the choking sensation of blood in my lungs only brought home the accuracy of it the blade swept toward me moving ever faster while i sat frozen feeling as if i was wrapped in safety unable to free myself even with the best of intentions the blade reached out long bony fingers curling them as if hed throttle me and i sat and watched him do it sheila macnamarra did not i never saw her move but then i was transfixed by the blade and looking the other way she put herself between me and him a human woman vibrant with life she flared golden like a moment of starborn glory and the blade shrieked a sound of torn metal and moaning winds he leaped forward fingers clawed for her throat she caught him with a foot in the stomach and they rolled ass over teakettle thumping through the field and the bodies of police sedans i felt each jolt as they hit the ground smashing through my body as if i was encased in water despite myself i let go a little giggle i felt no personal danger only fascination and curiosity as i bounced around with the two combatants i could feel sheila gather her will and insist upon change the air itself responded as she flung up her arm to block the blades attack his hands crashed against a shield of air as solid as steel sheila scrambled to her feet still wielding her invisible shield and smashed it in a backhand swing catching the blade by the face and knocking him backward again i felt her gather her will bars that i couldnt see but could sense began to spring up around the blade this wasnt just the essence of healing the thing id been told i could do as a shaman it was something more something far beyond not just my capabilities but even my skill to imagine i watched round eyed with admiration and astonishment as the world seemed to leap at her command my mom can beat up your bad guy a little part of my mind crowed i clamped a hand over my mouth to prevent another giggle from escaping the bloodred of the sky deepened like a warning bell the blade shot taller more narrow as if gaining strength from the wrongly colored world sheila faltered a creature of light weakened by its absence the blade shrieked pleasure and crashed through the bars shed built shattering her will as if it was nothing for the first time i saw her cower a moment of weakness in the woman with an indomitable spirit i had nothing to give but i had nothing to lose either i reached out to the place i sat in the real world my garage a place of safety and comfort to me and begged for power to help save the woman who protected me the very cars themselves seemed to respond filling me with the knowledge that i wasor had beenone of their caretakers the walls of the place in a building meant to house those who safeguarded the city gave to me what i asked their own strength and certainty in the role they filled for a moment it overwhelmed me raw power from things that had seemed lifeless to me before then the blade was bearing down on sheila fingers locked around her throat making her the fourth victim of his murdering spree i took what id been granted and coiled it up with my own core of silverblue power then wound up and threw it overhand like a baseball into sheila macnamarras hands power erupted like an electric line cut loose snapping and flailing the blade shot backward landing dozens of yards away on hands and feet still skidding back rocks in the field tore up under his long fingers furrows grooved in the concrete garage floor for an instant the banshee cries stopped leaving a silence so profound it hurt me in my bones then even i saw the flash of silver thread that lay between myself and the roundness of my mothers belly it pulsed with the power id just thrown crackling and popping like a trapped snake the blades gaze snapped to me focusing on me for the first time since sheila had placed herself between us he howled a victorious shriek and pounced toward me forgetting sheila in the moment of triumph as he reached me sheila rose up behind him with her hands wrapped around a column of light a weapon shaped from her own will and nothing more she drove it into his spine sending him arching backward with a scream that brought rupturing agony to my ears and then blessed silence the bloodred light cleared i slithered down the last few steps into the garage stickiness trickling from my ears sheilas face appeared above me round eyebrows drawn down with concern long black hair tucked behind her ears she had her hand pressed over her stomach fear narrowing her green eyes rushing clouds whirled behind her head and i managed a tiny smile relief swept her face her lips shaping words i couldnt hear i said thank you feeling the words vibrate in my throat even if they didnt echo in my ears then her face blurred into thor the thunder gods and i decided that was as good a time as any to pass out i woke up to a weirdly silent world in which morrisons face was hovering worriedly over mine morrison worried was distressing much more distressing than morrison yelling there were certain constants in my world hearing for example up until this very moment hearing had been one of those constants now there was nothing no ringing in my ears no ocean of blood thrumming no background traffic noises or cops arguing over topics ranging from doughnuts to politics one missing constant i could deal with two was too much i frowned at morrison and said why arent you yelling at least i think i did i never realized how much i depended on hearing myself to know i was talking i mean i could feel my voice box working but the astounding silence into which the words fell really really made me want to begin shouting i didnt but only just barely i thought shouting would look a lot like giving in to panic and since it appeared that half the precinct was standing behind morrison i didnt want to come across like a wussy girl just because of a little thing like shattered eardrums i felt very much like a wussy girl just then it was possible i owed billy a very small apology for being bent out of shape over the oneoftheguys comments a very small apology minuscule i closed my eyes cleared my throatanother thing that i could only feel not hearand said im okay i got my eyes open again in time to see everybody sag with relief even morrison although he covered it nicely by scowling magnificently and judging from the color of his face and the fact that i could see his uvula yelling it made me feel a lot better about not being able to hear actually i sat up very slowly not at all sure that broken eardrums didnt equate to a broken sense of balance it didnt seem to which was nice vomiting on my boss after all this fuss would have been embarrassing especially since he was being nice and had a hand between my shoulderblades keeping me steady as i sat im okay i repeated silently i just ah something tickled along my jaw i reached up to scratch it and came away with sticky drying blood under my fingernails i cant hear i said to nobody in particular especially myself since i couldnt hear me and the thing were after looks and sounds a lot like munchs scream i suspected i was glad i was looking at the gook under my nails instead of the gathered crowd im going to need a little time i said still to my icky fingers and maybe a sandwich the room cleared like id fired a shot ten seconds later the only people left were morrison thor and billy the middle of whom looked like hed rather be somewhere else im fine i told him thanks for um whatever you did he gave me a tight smile nodded and followed the rest of the crowd like hed been given a reprieve from the firing squad i wondered why my mind was wandering down the aisle of shooting similes id never been completely deafened by firing a gun billy looked at morrison in a way that made me look too the captain said something i didnt catchobviouslyand billy cast me a worried glance then nodded and left the room i finally figured out i was in the broom closet which was nice it was the stations flop room kept meticulously clean for cops whod been on the job too long and needed a rest break i hadnt known it was big enough to hold more than two people much less the eight or so thatd been in there morrison touched my shoulder i nearly jumped out of my skin then drew in a sharp breath through my nose and turned to face him eyes wide not hearing sucked a lot he said something and i focused on his mouth concentrating if you think he said slowly and clearly enough for me to read that youre getting out of work today just because you collapsed with blood running from your ears think again i had never heardor not heardsuch reassuring words in my life i split a grin that turned into laughter and leaned forward to give the police captain a hug a tiny dimple that id never noticed before quirked at the corner of morrisons mouth and he returned the hug somewhat gingerly i sat back still grinning and felt my face fall long and googly with dismay oh shit morrisons eyebrows shot up and he followed my focus to his shoulder where his formerly impeccably white shirt was now stained with sticky red residue oh for christs sake walker he said and he didnt even have to say it slowly for me to understand i wrinkled up my face in apology he sighed explosively and waved it off what the hell happened to you i ran into the bad guy i was trying so hard not to shout that i suspected i was barely more than whispering in the garage it was amazing how easily i understood him amazing and somewhat alarming i frowned at his mouth and nodded then shook my head not being able to hear made me feel like i wasnt able to talk either in ireland in the garage its complicated morrison id really like to get my ears fixed before anything else happens you think something else is going to happen something else always happens his eyebrows rose and fell in an acknowledging shrug do you need a doctor i shook my head just some time and some food i felt like somebodyd turned me upside down and shaken every last bit of energy out of me thinking about it made it worse morrisons hand found its place at my spine again supporting me and it took everything i had to not lean over curl my fingers in his shirt and snivel on him for a minute im a little tired that time my voice felt so low i wasnt at all sure id spoken out loud morrison tipped my chin up so i could see what he was saying it struck me as an unbelievably intimate gesture and i felt myself blushing morrison ignored it which was somewhere between relieving and insulting lie back down walker youre white as a sheet i felt white as a sheet i felt like all the energy that i usually ignored had been bleached and left out to dry part of me wanted to argue because morrison was the one telling me what to do the other part thought falling asleep for the rest of the day sounded like a good idea i started to nod but morrisons finger under my chin kept my head from dropping i sent holliday to get your drum thatll help right i nearly kissed him instead i closed my eyes and bit my lower lip nodding yeah thank you my nose prickled with embarrassing tears thanks i didnt hear him answer but i felt the rumble of his voice through his touch ill just lie down until billy gets here or food does i didnt need to hear my own voice either to know that it was full of stings and thorns that was how my throat felt i hoped i just sounded tired not angry or about to burst into tears morrison wrapped a strong hand around my biceps and helped me lie back down i pulled a pillow over my head and knew nothing for a little while billy didnt just come back with my drum he came back with gary who found me in the laundry room washing the broomcloset sheets by the time he found me id eaten and rinsed out my ears which made me feel considerably more human i was leaning against the washing machine feeling it do its thing when gary poked his head in and said something i couldnt hear i grinned a little and pointed at my ear which made him huff and puff like the big bad wolf getting anything useful out of the drum when i couldnt hear proved to be awkward as hell i eventually sat down directly across from gary and kept my fingertips on the drums edge while he knocked out a beat id never felt the drum actually call up energy inside me before it was like a well filling a few bubbles in the depth of me turning into splashes and then into a steady trickle i said faster and gary increased the beat until the power of the drum made me laugh with the feeling of life well lived it was an entirely internal celebration that took my breath and made my blood run thinner and faster in my veins i wanted a hundred drums all around me so their vibrations shook the very air making it safe for me to dance even without being able to hear the beat i burst through the top of my head and into clear sky so cold even the blue was leached from it i could hear my own labored breathing as i tried to catch oxygen from the thin air but i knew with great certainty that i was hearing an illusion my spirit might be unharmedat least with regards to this particular instancebut the body id left behind needed repair work the first analogy that slid through my mind was that of blownout stereo speakers i folded my legs and sat in the clear thin air just as i might have within my own garden and began the process of removing the destroyed stereo components and replacing them i overlaid the idea on my own body and called for the renewed power that lay coiled inside me it sprang up eager for the call and swept through me i had a completely horrid sensation in both my ears at once as if bugs were crawling out of them i stuck a finger in one and wriggled it coming away with a tiny smear of bloody flesh i let out a ragged yell and flapped my hand frantically getting rid of the icky bit then repeated the whole ritual including the frantic flapping on the other side that part didnt hurt the next part did i could feel the power in me rebuilding my eardrums fitting the right amount of newly created flesh into the cavity in my ear it felt like an inkjet printer was zipping back and forth inside my ear making one tiny line of new eardrum after another heat ran down my eustachian tubes and into the back of my throat tasting like blood and feeling increasingly like someone had poured molten gold into the delicate tubes i kept coughing and trying to gag the feeling away nothing worked the boiling feeling continuing to zip around in my ears until they popped abruptly and wind shrieked against my new eardrums i fell back inside my head the ringing of the drum suddenly impossibly loud and yelled again this time scaring the bejeezus out of gary who stopped drumming and threatened me with the drumstick then he leaned over the drum and hugged me without warning mumbling you get in all kinds of trouble when im not around lady you oughta watch yourself yeah well you should see the other guy i wrinkled my face actually i guess thats the problem we can see him now am i sposed to understand that i gave him a lopsided smile not really cmon i need to go talk to billy my mother called it the blade blade i tried it out without a capital letter and with one wrinkling my nose its masters blade specifically and its master is i shrugged billy looked at the ceiling like he was asking strength from god i spread my hands i thought getting any kind of name from a woman whos been dead for three months was pretty good well can you go get more i slid down in my chair glaring futilely at billys computer screen what have i done for you lately huh its the nature of the beast joanie cant get no satisfaction he gave me a sideways look are you really okay right as rain i scratched my jaw where the blood had been i dont know how real this thing is bill im not sure if its something you can catch whatever mother did to it set it back a lot of years but she thought shed have the power to destroy it and that was a big fat bust and whatever it is has got a master forget about the master the master isnt the thing stringing girls out by their guts right right god i hoped i was right then hes not our problem right now by the way melinda wants to know if youre still coming over for dinner i blinked what its the equinox tonight she invited you last week remember and you think to bring this up in the context of masters or was it being strung out by your guts billy fashioned a crooked grin you know mel shes a slave driver i laughed so a little bit of both yeah i dont see why not i mean you tell me i know its the first fortyeight hours of a murder investigation that are most critical but were kind of way the hell past that is taking the night off going to make a critical difference if it does its my ass in the hot seat not yours youre just a beat cop remember a beat cop who isnt doing her job today crap i got to my feet did morrison put somebody on the ave to cover for me or am i going to get beaten within an inch of my life the next time he sees me youre fine joanie billys voice was gentle people who spontaneously rupture eardrums even if they follow it up with a little layyourhandsonme action are generally considered out for the day i sat back down yeah that happens enough to have a protocol for it probably only with me around great can i bring gary to dinner petites still in the shop billy looked around whered he go back to work some of us i said in my best gruff gary voice gotta work for a living darlin oh sure bring him mel cooks enough to feed an army anyway thats because you have four kids billy that is an army i scooted forward nodding at his computer okay so im detective hollidays personal assistant for the day i guess what do you want me looking for billy snorted i can look up weird shit on the net joanie youre the one with the direct line to higher powers jesus h christ on a pogo stick billy dont say things like that higher powers my ass i actually shuddered whatever you want to call it youve got a bead on something i cant access even the captain knows it a fact which did not fill me with joy and glee i sighed dropping my chin to my chest last time i went into the wonderful world of the weird my eardrums exploded billy look at it this way at least nobody shoved a sword through your lung he gave me a sunny smile that held up to the glare i shot his way thank you thank you billy that really helped a lot bastard hey billy looked injured my parents were married mine werent huh id never thought of myself as a bastard before interesting what you can get through almost twentyseven years of living without thinking look billy i heard myself get all quiet like i was about to impart something important billy heard it too and leaned forward my mother had the chance to eliminate this guy back when she faced him she didnt because she was pregnant with me and she didnt want to risk me so this whole thing is kind of my fault i wrapped my arms around my ribs staring at a broken corner of tile beneath billys desk i mean the fact that there are more dead women now i know im being sort of a jerk because i hate all this crap buti really want to get this thing solved i need to whatever it takes billy clapped his hand on my shoulder solid and reassuring well figure it out joanie well get this guy youll get your piece or maybe he said peace i wasnt sure the drumming hadnt been enough to fill me up not all the way at least maybe a hundred drums wouldve poured so much energy and power into me that id have been good to go for the rest of the day the rest of the week as long as it took but by midafternoon i was stumbling like petite did when she ran short on gas and nothing i did brought me even one whit closer to figuring out what the blade was or how to stop him from killing someone else so i did what any sensible woman would do i wentno not shopping my idea of an ideal shopping experience was walking into the store finding exactly what i wanted on the first rack i stopped at buying it and being out of there in five minutes i was a retailers nightmare but i was also a welltrained seattleite when the chips were down i went for coffee the missing o was half a block down the street from the precinct building run by an entrepreneurial young fellow who thought the idea of opening a doughnut and coffee shop next to a police station was pretty funny after a while the cops started thinking it was funny too and began to take a certain pride in being the os numberone clientele a barista greeted me not by name but by drink tall hot chocolate with a shot of mint i waved an agreement and went to pay without ever having to say anything a minute later i was ensconced in the corner hands wrapped around the drink a coffee shop with a mug of hot chocolate was no place to solve the worlds problems from but it beat a sharp stick in the eye i let my eyes half close watching the world through a blur of lashes and waiting for inspiration to strike inspiration last i checked did not come in the form of captain michael morrison well he was certainly inspiring in some ways he frequently inspired me to mouthfrothing argument for example at the moment though he stood a few feet away frowning down at me as if unsure how to approach i untangled my eyelashes and looked up at him i dont bite i thought about that statement then nodded determining it was true i couldnt remember having bitten anyone in my sentient years morrison let out a fwoosh of air and shrugged his shoulders he was wearing a seamans coat with big black buttons so out of fashion it looked like haute couture thats a great coat he looked as startled as i felt to the best of my recollection nothing like a compliment had ever passed my lips when i was speaking to the captain he shrugged again hands in his pockets which made the whole coat move like a woolen wall with a purpose in life and sat down thanks belonged to my father seriously i supposed it was unlikely morrison had sprung fully formed from the forehead of his mother but id never given much thought to his family he was a sailor merchant marines he died when i was twelve neither of us knew what to say after that i slid down in my seat and wrapped my fingers around my hot chocolate tightly enough to bend the cardboard so i said after a while just as he said your hearings back i twitched a grin at the plastic top of my cup and nodded i didnt see if morrison smiled too you and holliday learn anything yet we wouldve mentioned it if we had it came out sarcastic i hadnt meant it to i saw morrisons bulk move back a few centimeters like he was responding to my nasty tone and putting extra space between us good joanne antagonize the boss again im trying captain i really am he muttered you certainly are under his breath making me look up in amused offense his expression hadnt changed maybe i was the only one who thought he was making a joke great just great i really want to solve this i kept my voice low afraid hed think i was kidding after a moment something relaxed in his gaze a little gleam of approval coming into it i annoyed morrison for a variety of reasons starting with knowing a lot more about cars than he did and ending emphatically with wanting a career as a mechanic when it was his opinion i could be a good cop it was possible id taken one tiny baby step toward a better relationship with him by genuinely wanting to solve this case has it occurred to you that you might be in danger walker the chocolate was hot enough to keep my fingers stinging with warmth or id have dropped it in my lap hands suddenly numb from surprise sir i never called morrison sir i dont know which of us liked it less your mother turned this killer in thirty years ago if he puts you together with her i sat there staring at him slack jawed with stupefaction its unlikely i finally heard myself say different country different names pretty much no connection except whatever the hell youve got going on up there morrison pointed a thick finger at my head i touched my own temple guiltily the man had a point crap he had a point and i had no idea what to do if he was right i blinked at the table hoping it might come up with a brilliant answer or two is this going to turn out like the last case then again maybe i hadnt taken any steps toward him approving of me at all i curled a lip at the top of my hot chocolate doing my best james dean impression you mean with a dead body and no actual proof of guilt aside from the word of a semihysterical teenage girl morrison gave a credible growl that rumbled up from the depths of his chest i took that as a yes and shrugged uncomfortably im putting my money on probably silence stretched over the table long enough to break i looked up when it snapped to find morrison glaring out the window his mouth set in a thin line at least he wasnt glaring at me get me some answers walker tell me how to stop somebody else from dying i lowered my gaze to the cup again for what its worth morrison i dont like this any more than you do he stood up the chair feet squeaking back against the wet floor thats the only thing that makes it bearable i didnt feel any less alone watching him leave shoulders broad and strong in the seamans coat i locked myself in the broom closet back at the station and struggled to get inside my own mind when i finally did my garden looked like somebody had dumped ash all over it making it as tired and gray as i felt it was not reassuring nor was the fact that it took coyote a very long time indeed to show up or that he looked distracted when he did how a dog could look distracted i didnt know but there you had it im not he said for the umpteenth time a dog one of the few thoughts i seemed to be able to keep to myself around him was the private glee at being able to get on his nerves with something as simple as calling him a dog it made me feel better right away i even managed a bright grin sorry i need your help god helps those who help themselves joanne i startled what youre a christian now is that so strange is it strange that my shapeshifting coyote spirit guide is a christian you tell me he finally looked at me little spots of brightercolored fur above his eyes lifting like eyebrows no he said its not youve got too many preconceptions walkingstick i wish you people would stop calling me that i didnt like having my original last name bandied around especially not when i was dealing with psychic realms i didnt really understand the idea that names had power was one i could grasp if nothing else which actually brought me to my point i need to know how to protect myself coyote he snapped his teeth at me and got up to pace toward me looking alarmingly like a predator instead of a scavenger you shouldve been learning that for most of the last three months so sue me are you going to throw me to the wolves just because im slow on the uptake more than slow i admitted one might go so far as to say recalcitrant deliberately recalcitrant i could live with that at least i could live with it as long as he gave me the help i needed now possibly very possibly this was not a good longterm game plan i promised myself id think about that later preferably much later i did my best puppydog eyes on coyote note to self puppydog eyes work better on people who do not actually possess puppydog eyes themselves coyote looked disgusted i retreated on the puppydog defense and tried a verbal one all i need to know is how to protect the very core part of me coyote my name that kind of thing i dont want the bad guys to be able to get to it easily a thought which only strikes you now that a bad guy is looming yeah coyote dropped his head in a very human motion and sighed so deeply i was surprised he didnt start coughing you know how to do it joanne think in metaphors what i found myself grinning just a little like airbags and steel frames keeping my little ol name safe he gave me a look that would reduce a lesser woman to blushes of embarrassment i valiantly ignored the burning in my cheeks and mumbled oh i dont know why i put up with you he snapped his teeth at me again and was gone because im cute and irresistibly charming i said to the empty garden no one not even a mockingbird responded please tell me dinner isnt going to suck as much as the rest of today has i leaned over the top of billys computer sighing he looked up offended are you dissing mels cooking i snorted a laugh no i just feel useless i put my hands on his desk letting my head hang find anything about the blade billy let out an explosive sigh and creaked back in his chair hands folded behind his head comic book references stuff about some swordsman named bob anderson wesley snipes pictures really i perked up edging around his desk to try to get a look at the screen any halfnaked ones joanie i drooped i didnt think so there wasnt nearly enough halfnaked wesley in those movies anyway billy gave me a flat look any luck with the psychic stuff my cheeks went hot with discomfort no icant get there my jaunt to see coyote had tapped me out i couldnt get any further out of my body than your average caterpillar could in fact a caterpillar with its whole transformation process was probably going to have more success than i was right now oh billys silence stretched out a few long moments all three of the dead women are from the greater seattle area he said eventually the captain went to visit their families to tell them i was hoping wed have something for him when he got back way to lay the guilt on billy i slumped again my head heavy enough to strain my neck all right look im going to go down to the park and um i wet my lips you remember that thing i did in the garage in january billy let out a huff of laughter how could i forget a lot of people seem to have or theyre trying hard to i shook my head i thought maybe id try something like that again down at the park having you along would be helpful you uh know how to put your energy out there pulling my tongue out with forceps would have been more fun than saying that sentence billy bless his pointy little head didnt laugh he just stood up and grabbed his coat fresh snow glittered over paths that had been stomped down by a lot of police officers in the past twentyfour hours the sky was clearing leaden gray clouds parting to let sparks of sunlight through i squinted at the ground kicking up sprays of snow as i tromped through the park a few steps ahead of billy i could feel billy walking behind me on a more than physical level in january id asked people to offer up their energy to help me net a god billy was getting ready to do that again coiling his own essence into a ball that hed be able to share with me when i needed it not i thought unlike what id done for my mother in the memorydream connection that morning i blurted sheila didnt defeat that thing by herself filling up the silence of the snowcovered field with my voice i was there of course you were there billy sounded confused she was pregnant with you no i mean i was theretwice such a gift i had for explanation he was kicking her ass i threw her some power it went right throughmeinto her you boosted your fetal self so your mom could draw enough power to defeat the blade billy made it sound so succinct and sensible that i had to look over my shoulder at him to see if he was kidding he wasnt i nodded yeah and then he noticed me the adult me and came after me which distracted him enough that sheila couldget him i didnt really know what shed done besides stab a sword of light through his spinal cord maybe that was enough to set your average evil minion back thirty years so billy said when youve got this timetravel thing down pat you want to slip back to about oh and tell me to invest in microsoft i laughed only if you promise to share the proceeds with me i hunched my shoulders trying to rid myself of the itchy sensation between the shoulder blades my interference with sheilas confrontation twentyseven years ago felt important i just wasnt sure why i bounced off a wall that wasnt there and crashed back into billys chest he oofed catching me then frowned down at me joanie i have no fucking clue i put my hand out and encountered resistance i prodded then stepped forward and leaned into it feeling like a mime billy fought a grin and completely lost the battle gonna grow up to be marcel marceau i sure as hell hope not can you um billy showing a remarkable ability to understand jospeak edged around me and walked through the wall id hit he turned eyebrows lifted shit i said in my best thoughtful tone and what the fuck apparently crashing into invisible walls brought out the naughty words in me curious i pulled my glove off and put my hand against it directly a dangerous burst of dull red flashed around the entire baseball diamond so quickly it was gone almost before i registered it a tingle of malicious familiarity made the nerve in my elbow ache morrison was right the blade had found a way to recognize me joanie billy stepped back through the barrier as if it wasnt there i leaned harder on it prodding at it with my hands and trying to do the same with my mind it failed miserably i did not think of my mind as a poking instrument there was no scalpellike wit here no sharpasaknife insights nor could i come up with a car analogy that would let me slide through the wall cars and walls in my experience smashed together not phased through one another not that id ever smashed up a car myself petite was the only vehicle id ever owned and id have killed myself before running her into anything joanie billy asked again i took my hand off the wall my nerve quieting as soon as i broke the contact i cant get through obviously he put up some kind of firewall a firewall yeah you know to keep unfriendlies out of your computer network i know what a firewall is joanie im just questioning your usage how come it let me through if its a firewall i lifted my eyebrows at him it doesnt recognize you as an unfriendly its programmed for me it was a lot easier to think in terms of computer protocols than magic i thought i might be on to something here right so can you still do the thing you were going to do i pursed my lips and looked through the invisible barrier one way to find out the core of power in me was waking up the wall providing some kind of challenge it felt ready to stand up to i was pretty sure it was a false high but i was willing to take it last time i did this i said more to myself than billy it didnt actually do a damned bit of good youre older wiser and stronger now there was an unexpected resonance to billys voice a depth of faith that i knew full well i didnt deserve still it made me straighten my shoulders and drag in a deep breath of cold air i closed my eyes momentarily feeling the steam from my breath beading into water on my eyelashes when i opened them again i wasnt quite in my own body anymore the core of silverblue energy was alive inside me pushing me out as though there wasnt enough room for the two of us in this town for a moment i felt like i was being given a gift i didnt really deserve i hadnt done any of the training coyote thought i should and i wasnt sure i ought to be able to slip out of my body so easily the flip side to that equally frightening was that if i could do it without any training then maybe he was right and it really was something i should be doing with my life i didnt like that possibility any better at all right in front of me the blades firewall glimmered dark red like blood seeping out from the heart of the world it cut off my ability to see anything inside it with more than ordinary eyes i turned my head very slowly unsure if my body was doing the same thing but afraid to move too quickly for fear of jarring myself out of the double vision beyond the firewall the world was full of neon colors pulses of life that looked like a kid with fingerpaints had gone wild billy was just to my right a swirling ball of orange and fuchsia energy held in his hands i whispered thanks and though i was pretty sure i hadnt said it out loud he crooked a grin and nodded his head once in acknowledgment i reached out for his colors calling them to me as politely as i could they leaped out of his hands whirling together like agitated kittens and spun into the silver and blue core of me i felt instantly a dozen times stronger my mind cleared focus spilling through my limbs as if the blood had just remembered that it was supposed to be running i didnt expect the sudden boost in clarity it suggested my power really hadnt recovered from the runin with the blade that morning or almost thirty years ago whichever the point was if billys energy was bringing the world into that much sharper relief i was even more tapped than id thought buoyed by his dancing fuchsia and brilliant orange i spread my hands sending tentacles of power darting over the blades shield silver slithered over red trailing my and billys colors like banners testing and tracing the barrier i went up not around looking for weak points that would allow me to hack into the system giggling while out of body was an interesting experience it felt like champagne bubbles in my nose and fingertips little sparkles of glee that didnt require containment as if in response to my laughter the red wall faltered my giggles cut off as i jumped to take advantage of the weakness a thin spot in the barrier that began to strengthen again even as i slid threads of power into it i envisioned taloned nails that could grasp and tear more efficiently than my own and worried at the spot like a determined rodent i found myself grinning again wondering what coyote would think of me throwing over the car analogy in favor of using psychic rats to claw my way through a magical firewall even as i grinned a silver tendril punched its way through the wall other colors billys and mine both leaped to the spot squirming through and braiding together to strengthen each other without ever blending or losing any of their own distinctive coherence my hands lifted of their own accord making claws that wrenched apart from one another as though prying open a bear trap the wall above me groaned and then tore great jagged chunks ripping free with the same metalonmetal shrieks id encountered that morning i was abruptly very cold sweat standing out on my face and beading into my eyes a dispassionate part of my mind suggested shock and for a dizzying moment i considered stopping before i found myself facefirst in a snowbank dying of exposure the power i was using gasped and shriveled the jaws id forced open in the red wall beginning to crash shut again my knees gave out and i dropped to the snow the chill helped me focus and i used the energy that had been keeping me on my feet to try to keep the wall torn asunder it had life of its own forced and vicious with no purpose beyond keeping me out destroying me if it could and it was going to i crumpled farther into the snow pressure bearing down on my weakening breach in the wall like so much newspaper i knotted my fingers in snow feeling icy chunks bite into the lines of my ungloved hand and then melt into boneaching cold i was going to be pulverized by someone who wasnt even there what an embarrassing way to die at least morrison wasnt there to see it for a moment i went in a mental circle annoyed that that was my last thought then realizing it couldnt be because this was my last thought power slammed into me drawn from a depth that i could barely fathom deep purple burnt siennabillys colors but at their most profound i could feel the love he drew on lacing his colors with such gladness i was happy to stop breathing so long as i could do it for them i didnt come to my feet my body was irrelevant left behind as i sprang forward on the force of the power billy gave to me unstinting i slammed my fingers all swirled with dominant purple into the barely existent crackall that was left of my opening in the walland tore it apart redness shattered all around me breaking in huge chunks of rawedged power that collapsed into fragments as they hit the ground i boiled through the opening and stood against the waves of blood rage that had gone into the killings the bodies were gone but the black power that linked one woman to another was still there seeped in the earth beneath the snow like their blood i could see lines that hadnt been there the day beforeor that i hadnt been strong enough to see billys outpouring of energy made my skin tingle even if id left my actual body behind he cant keep this up forever joanne stop fucking around did other people have little voices in their heads that said things like that i could stretch myself out a little and touch a hundred thousand minds in seattle just to find out but i was afraid the answer would be no i refrained instead focusing on the thin lines rising up from each of the three points where the women had died they came together in thready blackness like oilsmeared string that glimmered and twisted with unhealthy light making three points of a pyramid they joined at the apex and braided together reaching higher until the braid grew watery and distant i could see it cut through the clouds and into the blueness of the sky beyond but it faded before it reached the dark curve of space above the world i was almost certain it faded not that my vision was failing the power diamond wasnt complete the blade needed one more body to finish building his stairway to heaven that was the good news the bad news was it obviously didnt matter that the bodies themselves were gone the power their deaths had bought was there seared into the ground taking the three women away from the park hadnt broken the spell and i wasnt sure what would the worst news was i could only think of one way to find out the rich colors of billys power hadnt faded at all memories coalescing around me moments of love laughing until the tears came moments of holding sick children afraid of what the night might bring the bright spark of his wifes smile the open acknowledgment that his girls had him wrapped around their little fingers that his boys made him puff up with a fatherly pride he felt a little silly about in this enlightened day and age what he was giving me was the part of him that would never could never give up it was his center his family the core of all his strength and just as surely the center of all his weaknesses he embraced every bit of it flinging it toward me with everything he had giving me the power to reach all the way to the stars he knew what he was doing he could protect himself from the lethal drain but chose not to instead he offered up power far beyond the limits of safety i could take it and follow the blades black thread into the heart of its darkness and learn what lay behind him this morning and almost thirty years ago my mother had had the same choice i fell back into my body with a jolt so hard it made my teeth ache refusing the maelstrom of power offered to me by my friend refusing to take what he would give until the moment his system went into critical failure i wouldnt take it not even to fight the thing that wielded the murderous blade weak with exhaustion i was still able to turn in time to catch billy as he fell the very life of him drained almost to the sticking point the earth itself had power to spare a thin greenandblue flow far beneath its frozen surface i reached for it with a wornout plea dragging the offered trickles of energy up through the snow and into myself i couldnt reach even as far as the scattered trees much less beyond the parks boundaries to beg for some of seattles teeming life energy i had to wait bent over billys chilled form drawing in tiny spurts of strength until the swirling core of silverblue inside me gave a little groan and let power flow into my hands i fell back on the analogies i knew best billys battery was drained and needed a jump the thought of jumping billy made me burble a snicker his wife would beat me up the logical side of my mind said that if part of a person was the battery it would probably be his mind my hands drifted over billys heart without paying any attention to the logical part of my mind i actually made little pinchers of my fingers like jumpercable heads and clumsily stabbed one hand against my own heart the other staying over billys it was a long and slow transfer of strength my eyes halfshut and my head bowed over his i was gaining very little for myself what i could draw from the frozen ground beneath the snow i simply siphoned into billy his color improved gradually and he finally chuckled more shaking his body than sounding in my ears think we can walk out of here if we lean on each other mngrnf i thought that was supposed to be maybe billy seemed to understand and we took a couple of long minutes to climb to our feet giggling with exhausted clumsiness you find anything out he asked once we were both on our feet yeah i tried out this whole walking thing one shaky step i could feel weary relief spill through him and into me what his first step wasnt any steadier than mine i smiled wearily and pulled myself up a little straighter letting him lean on me i found out ive got the best friends in the world cmon lets go holliday your wifes expecting us for dinner i swear on my wifes grave gary herded me up the stairs to billys front door maneuvering billy into line behind me mel stood in the open doorway looking bemused gary spoke to her not to me or billy which was just as well because wed gone well past punchdrunk sometime in the past hour of work and were howling with laughter every time anybody moved i swear on annies grave gary repeated to mel this aint my fault they were like this when i picked em up at the station id ask why billy wasnt driving melinda said getting out of her husbands way as he snickered and staggered through the door but i think i see why im melinda holliday she threaded a hand between me and billy to shake garys then fixed me with a gimlet eye have you two been out drinking joanie an eruption of giggles escaped through my nose and squirted tears from my eyes i clapped both hands over my mouth and tried to wiggle a finger up to clear my eyes no swear to god hi mel i bent to give her a hug hoping i wouldnt lose my balance in doing so she was nearly an entire foot shorter than i was and better dressed than anybody id ever met including billy thiss my friend gary gary muldoon he i said extravagantly is a hero where hero equates to designated driver melinda asked archly get in here all of you she sounded like she was herding cats or her four children we all straightened up and scurried inside to the best of our ability more obediently than either cats or her kids would have done jooooooaaaaanne that was the last thing i heard before i went down in a pile of elbows and knees and squirming bodies oh sure i heard billy say somewhere above my head joanie gets all the hugs but your old man gets nothing we see you all the time dad a voice from the pile of squirmy people on top of me pointed out the oldest kidrobertwhodidntliketobecalledbobby thatwasalittleboysnameextracted himself from the pile to give billy a proper hug he was eleven not quite old enough to have too much dignity to show such blatant affection that left two kids squishing me and one toddler slapping his barefoot way down the hall with the clear intention of finishing off the dog pile melinda scooped that one up eliciting a howl of dismay while the girls jacquie and clara clambered off me pulled me to my feet and attached themselves to my sides like leeches joanne we havent seen you since foreverhow come you dont come over more oftendid i show you my friendship pinsno i want to show her my xbox its cooler than the dumb pins i didnt even know which of them wanted to show me what but i promised as loudly as i could that i wanted to see both the pins and the xbox and anything else they had to show me which satisfied clara who released me and went tearing off down the hall shouting about the computer games i grinned after her and gave jacquie an extra hug she beamed and clung to my side even more enthusiastically i had no idea why they liked me so much but i adored them and it made me feel id done something right in a prior life except the annoying little voice in my head said brightly you havent had any thats what coyote told you remember i told the annoying voice to shut up and tried to get my boots off without letting go of jacquie it was partly selfpreservation i still wasnt doing so well at the whole standingonmyown thing and neither it seemed was billy who leaned against the nowclosed door and smiled wearily this was what he needed more than any power i could have jumped his battery with the rambunctious noise and love of his family erik the toddler yowled dooowwn and then added in a snuffle pease melinda laughed and put him down he crawled over to my feet through the snow wed tracked in and helpfully began yanking on my shoelaces id been ushered out of the hall and into the kitchen and had a glass of wine in my hand before i was entirely sure id gotten my boots off erik came trundling after us with one of the boots wrapped in his arms which i took as more or less a good sign mel was exchanging pleasantries about it being nice to meet you with gary who scooped jacquieshe was only fiveoff the floor and turned her upside down jacquie shrieked with unholy glee narrowly missing kicking gary in the nose for an old guy with no kids of his own he ducked well the first sip of wine hit me behind the eyes like a bowling ball i let slip a startled giggle and lifted the glass to peer at it as if i might see a miniature bottle of whiskey hidden in the rich dark liquid are you all right joanne mel somehow heard my giggle through the general noise and turned to look at me her eyebrows lifted and a teasing smile in place what have you and bill been up to all kinds of weird shtuff i caught myself just in time but robert sitting on the counter where he wasnt supposed to be smirked and rolled his eyes as if to say grownups mel without having to look his way said off the counter rob go set the table which was apparently his punishment for thinking himself superior to adults he thumped down with another eyeroll and i winked at him in sympathy as he skulked into the dining room weve been misbehaving horribly i assured mel ill tell you about it after dinner youd better i get huffy when strange women bring my husband home acting drunk on holidays im not that strange i protested she laughed and went to open the kitchen window sending a blast of cooler air into the hot room i stepped closer to it taking a deep breath as i leaned over the sink and peered at their backyard it looked like a thomas kincaid painting down to giant snowmen and halfburied swing sets moonlight turned it all purpleyblue i lifted a toast to the man in the moon the hard edges of his full disc reddened and mellowed by the wine in my glass youre pretty strange jo gary said i looked back over my shoulder youre not helping he shrugged grinning and turned to melinda anything i can do to help maam you could start by not calling me maam melinda suggested i shook my head dont say that hell start calling you dame and lady and broad if youre not careful its parta my charm gary said i laughed you keep saying that and you keep hangin around i figure i must be right melinda arched a curious eyebrow at me i put my nose in my wineglass suddenly aware that my cheeks were staining pink from something other than the warmth of the kitchen i heard her underthebreath mmmhmm before she clapped her hands together making herself the picture of efficiency all right joanne you get the roast beef gary you can get the potatoes jacquie get in here thank you dear would you get the corn and wheres your sister erik not under the table sweetheart erik not under theerik get out from under the table she went to pull her errant child from beneath the dining room table while gary and i followed jacquie around all of us picking up our charged items i dont know how she does it i whispered to gary four of them i cant even find my own shoes some mornings thats cause you leave em in the bathroom gary how do you know that he gave me an unrepentant grin and put the potatoes down on the table as he headed back into the kitchen i put the roast beef down and smacked a hand against my forehead robert appeared at my elbow looking curious is he your boyfriend no robert got a grin that looked suspiciously like his mothers said uhhuh and sauntered off i had the distinct feeling id been had you can sit next to me jacquie announced from behind me i spun around blinking down at her at least she probably wouldnt tease me about gary okay where are we sitting here and here she dragged two chairs out and looked at me expectantly i sat and she scrambled into her own chair looking smug a moment later mel appeared in the doorway carrying erik on one hip and an enormous bowl of gravy in the other hand jacquie youre supposed to be helping set the table im keeping joanne company jacquie said virtuously i gaped at her and mel laughed out loud i see how it is all right you keep joanne company she put the gravy down and disappeared back into the kitchen as i yelled im being used after her jacquie giggled pleased with herself and tilted her chair precariously so she could lean on me by the time i got her straightened up the table was set and everyone had gathered around i lifted my wineglass and my eyebrows looking to billy for permission to make a toast to mel i said cheerfully a miracle of modern efficiency thank you for inviting us to dinner i lifted my glass a little higher watching the wine catch the bright white of one of the chandelier lightbulbs and turn it red as the full moon oh shit i dropped the wineglass and ran for the door i didnt actually get my boots all the way on until gary had us halfway to the park i kept fumbling my stupid damned cell phone as i tried to call morrison finally on the fourth try i got the right number punched in and he answered in with a wornout hello morrison youve got to get everybody out of the park right now do we have anybody there call them out hes going to be there the blade its the full moon mother said the moon was changing can you call them out gary gave me a sideways glance of concern billy leaned over the front seat of the cab hanging on my every word i had no idea what mel must think i hadnt managed to say anything coherent between grabbing my boots and running for the cab apparently i still wasnt saying anything coherent morrison was silent on the other end of the line for a few moments then exhaled heavily walker of course its walker does anybody else do this kind of shit to you can you empty the park theyre never going to see him coming morrison theyre just going to get killed youve got to move now another moments silence and then i will call you back in two minutes do not do anything until you hear back from me morrison hung up i finally pulled my second boot on wishing my foot werent soaking wet and cold from melting snow hurryhurryhurryhurry gary hurry if i hurry any more well be dead it was true the roads were coated in black ice and he was driving as fast as i would have which didnt bode well for anybody joanie its blade dammit its the full moon i twitched around to look at billy then twitched forward again im going to have to explain it to morrison i dont want to explain it twice i leaned forward as if my doing so would urge the cab to a faster pace dammit dammit dammit stupid stupid stupid jo hey gary said surprisingly quiet under my litany of abuse you got no reason to be callin yourself stupid lady unexpected sniffles hit me right in the nose no right i mumbled not no reason close enough for this old dog the cell phone rang and i nearly jumped out of my skin as i answered it god i hate these things i assume youre talking about the phone morrison said the parks clearing out what the hell is going on walker youd better not be screwing with me i would not screw with you i promised fervently its the full moon morrison my mother died on the full moon it was the solstice now its the equinox and the moon is full again check the records i bet thats what it was twentyseven years ago too how the hell am i supposed to check the records on the full moon from thirty years ago theres this really cool web site i started then screwed up my face and grabbed the ohshit handle as gary took a corner by use of the force without looking where he was going and with no apparent regard to life or limb look it doesnt matter i know im right hes killing people on the full moons of winter this is the last one tonights the equinox im going to stop him how i have absolutely no idea i hung up not wanting to hear morrisons response to that to my utter surprise the phone didnt ring again less than two minutes later we pulled into the parks lot i tumbled out of the cab almost before it stopped moving and ran for the baseball diamond as fast as i could gary and billy came after me shouting i expected to slam into the blades red barrier with such force that itd throw me back instead i flung myself at it so hard that i skidded ten feet in the snow when i hit nothing at all i said something witty and intelligent like da fuh around the mouthful of snow i got for my troubles and scrambled to my feet waiting for all hell to break loose somehow despite everything i didnt expect it to break loose by way of crimson falling down the face of the moon to cast a bloody shadow on the earth everything real seemed to go away the bite of cold air the shine of moonlight on fresh snow my friends voices yelling somewhere behind me i stood there with my jaw hanging open staring up at the bleeding moon while a sliver fell from it and tumbled all the way to earth just before it hit the ground it flared a cloak of blackness that cut the air with a banshee scream then the cloak settled the blade walking forward tall and thin and hatchet faced i could feel power rolling off it heavy as the sea and with as much concern for the threat i provided as the ocean itself might be right about then it struck me that i was so low on power id been punchdrunk and giggling less than an hour earlier and that out of all the days to pick a fight with something that looked like morticia addamss incredibly evil older brother today might well be the worst possible choice the blade came toward me faster than a run without any visible means of locomotion he simply glided over the bloodcolored snow picking up speed that was all the more eerie for its silence i did a mental check over my list of available weapons there werent any i was going to die to my surprise i discovered i could live with that i let out the best war cry i could manageit had nothing on jacquies gleeful yelling but it wasnt badand flung myself at the blade with everything i had which was nothing the blade wasnt prepared for that i hit him in the stomach a shoulderfirst tackle gary wouldve been proud of it was like smashing into a flexible block of ice cold split straight down into my bones and made the marrow into something that carried icy death he screamedfor the first time i realized the metalonmetal shriek id heard time and again was actually coming from the blade a banshee wail straight out of hell a banshee wail if id had time id have stopped to beat my head on something id called the haunting shrieks banshee cries without thinking it through all along the blade was a banshee harbinger of death my death specifically if i didnt gain the upper hand we rolled and thumped across the frozen field struggling for sheer physical dominance for a moment i had him but he wrapped bony fingers around my wrist and cold seared into my skin again numbing my arm all the way to the elbow i was going to have a dandy case of frostbite if i got out of this alive he flung me backward over his head using my arm like a fulcrum i actually cartwheeled in the air watching the blood moon zip by before i smashed into the snow and skidded i staggered to my feet turning just in time to catch the blades shoulder with my gut an excellent reversal of my tackle a moment earlier all the air wheezed out of me and i hit the snow again doing less skidding and more sinking with his weight on top of me he was heavy for such a skinny thing as if hed been emptied of bone and muscle and had cold iron poured into his skin instead his fingers wrapped around my throat driving me further into the snow it felt so warm compared to his hands that for a few seconds i stopped caring cozy in my snow bed and ready to sleep a tiny offended burst of power flared in my belly reminding me what real warmth was i opened my eyes again looking up into the blades grimacing rictus i couldnt tell if it had ever been human skin stretched across its bones so tightly it mightve been a mummy eyes with bloody fire lighting them staring wide and empty at me its teethher teeth i finally realized it was or had been at one time female of course banshees were her teeth were bared dry lips pulled back from them i wasnt sure she needed to breathe but her chest was expanding wait i knew this part this was where she screamed until my eardrums ruptured i thought twice in one day was a little much so i took what warmth the power inside me offered forced it into my arm and jabbed upward with two stiffened fingers right into her throat my fingers went all the way through to her spine with a horrible sound of flesh tearing as easily as paper the scream turned into an aborted glerk and the banshee loosened her hold on me i kicked her off and rolled away clapping my hand to my throat coughing through bruised muscle for air for a few seconds we stayed there both swaying watching each other warily the hole in her throat sealed up not like human flesh would but like paper was being stretched back to fit into a hole itd been wrinkled away from she pounced again and i ducked absurdly smug at the startled look that brightened her flamecolored eyes as she went flying over my head then she tackled me from behind smashing my face into the snow i thought very clearly damn that thing really corners and had a brief irrational moment of wanting to try petite out against her instead i dragged in a lungful of snow and ice as i shoved so deep into the snow that i hit the earth below it the banshees knee was in my back bearing down with too much weight for me to move i scrabbled for the wornout center of power within myself and came up dry apparently id blown my one chance when i didnt finish ripping her head off a minute earlier i pounded a fist in the snow weak flailing as i tried to buck her off it was about as effective as threatening to catch a storm in cotton candy she bent forward bony knee pressing into my spine between my shoulder blades i thought about screaming but i couldnt get enough air to she hissed right there behind my ear and i had the horrible idea she was spitting maggots into my hair why maggots were a problem when i was about to be dead i didnt know but the idea completely grossed me out in the womb i heard you die for no one lives when a banshee cries i wasnt just going to die i was going to be rhymed to death that simply wasnt fair i flailed again wishing my arms didnt feel so heavy wishing my legs would kick instead of lying there getting colder wishing i could wake up enough energy inside me to reach out for more i didnt even have enough to ask the city to hit me with its best shot a tactic id tried once before and had sworn i wouldnt do again that i even thought about trying told me i was in dire straits the pregnant gwyld was clever and wise took you away from prying eyes should have known it couldnt last power like yours cant be passed her voice was singsong and scaly grating against the ringing in my ears i tried jerking my head back not even a banshee could like a head butt to the bridge of the nose right but the weight of her hand was too much to move i considered giving up and dying it was pretty clearly in the books on the other hand she was saying something interesting if i could get enough oxygen to my brain to work my way through her bad poetry master sees and master hears gains his strength through bloodred tears thirty years hes gone unfed shamans gifts protect the dead the words burrowed into my brain extracting details about my life in exchange for my fumbling grasp of what the banshee was telling me i whimpered into the snow and tried hard to hang on to the idea of my name wrapped safely up in airbags and seat belts i felt the scrape of her voice slide off that thought and nearly laughed with relief i could keep her away from the most important things at least if i was going to die i wasnt going to die with my soul eaten power erupted in my belly like molten gold being poured into me i straightened my arms suddenly filled with strength and shoved up lifting the blades weight as if it were inconsequential i whipped around flinging her off me and she landed yards away skidding through the snow on hands and knees back arched like an angry cat for an instant the banshee cries stopped leaving a silence so profound it hurt me in my bones i had no time to wonder where the new strength was coming from i drew on the memory of my mother throwing up a jail cell made of her own will and copied it bars of blazing silver flashed up out of the snow slamming closed around the banshee she threw her head back and keened a high piercing note that shivered all the way to the bloody moon my bars wavered under the onslaught and her voice strengthened the moon itself seeming to hang lower in the sky the longer she wailed black threads of power the sacrificed lives of three women wound together and responded to the banshees cries they leaped through the bars id built piercing her bony body she grew in size and in power feeding from the blood lines which throbbed and pulsed like arteries as they spread across the snow i dug deeper into the fresh power id found discovering an oceans depth of energy waiting to be tapped it ran deeper than i did the same kind of power that billy had tapped into earlier that day the love of family the protective streak that went beyond what a single person could encompass i could use it but i doubted id live through it it didnt matter the ocean of blue crushed down upon the banshee pressing down to sever the blood lines they flattened carrying less sustenance but refusing to shatter i felt halfmoon cuts opening up on my palms my hands fisted so tightly that blood couldnt escape the tiny slices my fingernails made the banshee kept screaming her voice muffled by the weight of my power but not yet broken i set my teeth together and reached deeper into the core of power id tapped willing to die as long as i took the other bitch with me sheila macnamarra put her hand in mine pale and wraithlike in the bloody moonlight there was no substance to her only a terrible force of will and with her touch a heart of coldness broke inside me i gave her one shocked look and she returned it with a smile as warm as the summer sun we started this nearly thirty years ago now didnt we the lilt in her voice turned thirty into tarty lets put an end to it shall we that morning and almost thirty years ago id thrown her a fastball of my own power now she made good on the gift returning it threefold the depth id reached the unexpected strength wasnt mine at all and it wouldnt in the end tap me out it was my mother who would die for it my mother who had already died for it golden strength and red temper flowed into me blending with my own silvers and blues in a way i hadnt seen before she shored up the silver bars of the cage id built added her weight to that of the deep blue sea out of the corner of my eye i saw her nod and found myself walking forward my fingers trailing in the golden depth of her strength i slipped between the bars of the cage id built putting my hand all the way into sheilas power and withdrawing a sword made of fire i recognized the shape of it a rapier with a sweeping guard that flickered and warmed my hand without burning me flames shimmered to a deadly edge along the slender blade the banshees screams erupted all over again but the power bearing down on her muffled them and left my beleaguered ears in no real danger the black lines of blood magic that fed her parted under the swords blade where theyd refused to disintegrate under raw force a scalpel i thought my mother was a scalpel and i came so close to never knowing that to not understanding the banshee stopped screaming when the lines were cut her gaze fixed on the red moon as if waiting for rescue to come i glanced up at it then shook my head hes still locked behind bars not bars behind a fallen cave mouth the broken stones held in place by my mothers will my mother who with my help had disrupted the sacrifice that would feed him almost thirty years ago and with her help id done it again tonight still hungry too i leaned in my hands shaking too weak to help you bitch surprise creased the blades narrow face as i took her head the fiery rapier ripping through her neck with the sound of paper tearing loud in the absence of her cries i caught her falling head with a grace that bewildered me fingers knotted in her thin hair and walked away from the dusty bones with a spot of emptiness building inside me all the power that had been brought to bear both mine and the dark stuff birthed by the banshees murders faded clear moonlight reestablishing itself over the frozen fields my mother wearing the cableknit sweater and jeans shed worn in her youth folded her arms beneath her breasts and smiled at me mom i hadnt ever called her that before it made my throat tight and her smile fragile you brought me to america to protect me from that thing didnt you the banshees rhymes finally made sense so it couldnt find me her smile flickered still fragile and she lifted her chin i saw quite clearly the silver celtic cross of a necklace that rested against her collarbone momentarily exposed by the shift of her sweater i pressed my fingers against my throat where the same necklace now rested i thought it was for the best lass you told me you see before you were born you told me i hadnt succeeded in destroying the blade it was all i could think of to do to protect you i closed my eyes briefly remembering the way joy had bled from her expression and left resolution in its place i nodded in a jerky motion and made myself open my eyes again thank you i thought i could explain when you were grown when you came to see me but you werent ready grief colored the shadow of her smile so closed off siobhán whatever happened to you that turned you away from the wonders of the world she lifted her hand staying my answer before i had a chance to give it theres no time not anymore there hasnt been since the beginning bitter ashes isnt it but thats the price of gaelic blood my siobhán for all their wars are merry and all their songs are sad i whispered surprise brought out her smile and let it fade into pleasure at my recognition of the quote it was all i could think of to do loose myself from the world i could see it in you siobhán joanne my joanne that the moment was coming when youd have to choose i thought if i could hold on in spirit i might protect you for a little while distract the darker things while you grew to understand your gifts you did my throat was still tight i tried swallowing against it but came up dry you were here i would have died tonight thank you iwill i see you again she was fading around the edges now like the cheshire cat i knew the answer even before she shook her head and looked away to hide the shock of loneliness i felt stab through me the space of the winter moons was all i could bargain for i was afraid even it might not be enough bargain i looked back at her what was left to see she looked younger somehow the smile that curved her mouth belonging to a woman id hardly known goodbye siobhán know that i love you there was nothing left but her smile and then even that was gone morrison had joined billy and gary at the bleachers when i walked back to them none of them seemed to see me coming gary clutched his chest and sat down with a thud glaring at me as i clumped up to the bleachers what the hell happened out there jo whatd you see not a goddamned thing you ran off and now youre back i looked up at the sky the moon seemed higher than it had been more solid and real somehow it didnt seem that long to me morrison was staring grimly at the head i still carried is that the killer i lifted the head a few inches yeah wheres the rest of it out there i turned around waving the banshees head at the field there was no body lying in the snow nor any sign of the wrestling fight id had with her the only footprints at all in the new snow were mine leading up to the bleachers even they only seemed to begin a few yards away just on this side of the closest blood line that had been drawn with one of the victims entrails i stood there a few seconds waiting for a clever explanation to pop into mind nothing did after a moment i looked at the head again then over my shoulder at morrison as i hefted it do you want me to bring this in it took a long time for him to say no i nodded and gave it a swing or two then threw it back the way i came it arched and hit the snow with a soft poof powder flying in the air when it cleared there was no mark that suggested anything had landed on the smooth white surface its over morrison said almost a question i nodded billy let out a whistle that split the air and shoved his hands in his pockets with an air of finality so who wants to come back to the house for dinner i bet mel kept it warm why dont you come with us captain theres plenty gary stomped down the bleachers billy a step or two behind him morrison looked at me i kept my head turned a little to the side meeting his eyes he finally nodded and jerked his chin lets go tension ebbed from my shoulders and i dropped my chin to my chest captain not morrison i didnt know why morrison turned eyebrows lifted i swallowed trying to figure out the right thing to say neither thank you nor sorry seemed exactly appropriate i stood there gazing at him until he developed a faint surprisingly understanding smile come on walker he said more gently were done here he tilted his head again and walked down the bleachers after the other two i let out a deep breath and followed them all smiling at the moon
