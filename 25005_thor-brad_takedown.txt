brad thor takedown the fifth book in the scot harvath series for robert m horrigan a beloved patriot who served his country with courage honor and unparalleled dignity exitus acta probat the ends justify the means one djemma elfna market marrakech morocco may the problem with being in the wrong place at the wrong time is that you never know it until its too late thats how it was for steven cooke and the bitter irony was that right up to the very last moment of his life he thought he had stumbled upon an intelligence jackpot the blondhaired blueeyed twentysixyearold had happened across the meeting completely by accident in fact cooke wasnt even supposed to be in that part of town except that his sister had asked him to bring her a special caftan when he flew home for a longoverdue visit at the end of the week although he had way too much work to do before leaving steven had always found it hard to say no to allison the two were more than brother and sister they had been best friends since childhood in fact allison was the only person who really knew what he did for a living even their parents had no idea that their son was a cia field officer steven had been in morocco just under a year and had gotten to know marrakech fairly well the souk at the heart of the small city was a labyrinth of passages and narrow alleyways donkey carts laden with merchandise lumbered up and down the hot dusty thoroughfares while the everpresent haze hung so thick that neither the citys mudbrick walls nor the high atlas mountains off in the distance could be seen from the main square the heat was absolutely insufferable and as he combed the various covered markets for the perfect caftan for allison cooke was grateful for the shade it was when steven took a shortcut through one of the alleys that he noticed an unremarkable café with a rather remarkable patrona man who had disappeared two days before the september th attacks and for whom the united states had been searching ever since if he was correct his discovery would represent not only a major coup for american intelligence but it might also place a very distinct feather in his cap and set him apart as one of the more distinguished young field operatives that would be nice though cooke reminded himself that he had joined the cia to help defend his country not to rack up attaboys removing his cell phone steven contacted his supervisor and filled him in on everything he had seen including a mysterious new player who had entered the café and was now sitting at their mans table with no one close enough to provide support the best his boss could do was request the retasking of one of their surveillance satellites to help gather additional intelligence the lions share of the operation would fall to steven there were a staggering number of question marks surrounding the man in that café and the cia needed steven to gather as much information about him and what he was up to as possible though adrenaline fear and excitement were coursing through his bloodstream cooke focused on his training to keep himself under control the first thing steven needed was a record of the meeting since there was no way he was going to show his white anglosaxon face in that café and potentially scare away his quarry he had to get his hands on a fairly decent camera moving through the marketplace as fast as he dared he finally found what he was looking for the only problem was moneyhe didnt have enough of it the souk pickpockets were notorious and he never carried credit cards and definitely never any more cash than he knew he would need what he did have though was his kobold chronograph wristwatch and the shop owner gladly accepted it in exchange for a canon digital camera with a fairly decent zoom lens and an extrahighcapacity memory card from the edge of a rooftop across the alley steven interspersed his picturetaking with pieces of short video he hoped the experts at langley would be able to decipher whatever had drawn the man in the café out of hiding must have been extremely important for him to risk this meeting steven filled the highcapacity memory card and was about to reinsert the lowend factoryincluded card to see if he could get any pictures of the mans car once he left the café when he heard a noise behind him the garrote wire whistled through the air and then snapped tight around his neck stevens hands scrabbled uselessly for it as he felt a knee in his back and the pressure begin to build when his trachea severed the camera clattered onto the rooftop cracking the screen the damage made no difference to the assassin as he dragged the lifeless young cia operative back from the parapet and pocketed the camera as well as the spare memory card the only thing abdul ali cared about was that there never be any record of the meeting in that café the americans would know its outcome soon enough and by then it would be too late two white house situation room washington dc may president jack rutledge entered the situation room and signaled the men and women around the conference table to take their seats he was less than five months into his second term and had already been called to this room more times than in the last two years combined he had hoped to use his second term to focus on the key domestic policy issues he had campaigned on and which would comprise his legacy but more than that the president wanted to leave his successor democrat or republican a better country than had been left to him the war on terror though had much different plans for rutledge contrary to what the white house press secretary was spinning to the media terrorist plots against america and american interests were not on the decline they were in fact on a very marked upswing and the united states was running out of fingers and toes with which to plug the dike for every attack the united states thwarted three more popped up in its wake the operations tempo in the intelligence military and law enforcement communities was higher than anyone had ever seen despite its phenomenal successes most of which the average citizen was never aware of all america seemed able to do was tread water the country was running well beyond capacity and it was only a matter of time before the overtaxed system collapsed from sheer exhaustion something needed to be done and done soon that was the thought on the mind of every person in the room as the president finished skimming the contents of the file folder in front of him and turned the meeting over to general bart waddell director of the defense intelligence agency thank you mr president replied waddell a tall darkhaired man in his late forties as he stood he pressed a button on a small digital remote and the plasma monitors at the front of the room as well as those recessed within the situationroom table sprang to life with the revolving dia logo the footage i am about to show you was shot this morning it was developed thanks to two converging pieces of intelligence the first was a series of satellite surveillance photos ordered up by the central intelligence agency when one of its field officers spotted the subject in north africamorocco to be exact the second piece of intelligence was a tip that pinpointed the subjects base of operations more than six thousand kilometers southeast in somalia waddell advanced to the first slide in his powerpoint presentation and everyone watched as a dusty toyota land cruiser pulled up in front of the weatherbeaten façade of a long singlestory structure what you are looking at is a muslim religious boys school or madrassa on the outskirts of mogadishu the man getting out of the car on the right is mohammed bin mohammed aka abu khabab alfari or as our analysts are fond of calling him m ampm he is known as alqaedas master bombmaker and head of their weapons of mass destruction committee born in algeria in he has training in both physics and chemical engineering waddell then advanced through a series of still images as he continued to narrate at alqaedas tora bora base near jalalabad mohammed not only built and managed a facility for the manufacture of nuclear chemical and biological weapons but he provided hundreds of operatives with training in the use of those weapons most of you are familiar with the images that made it into mainstream media showing the scores of dead dogs cats donkeys et cetera scattered outside the complex everyone in the room was indeed familiar with the photos but it didnt make them any easier to have to see again around the table they nodded their heads in grim unison the photos only heightened some of our worst fears about the ghoulish experiments we suspected m ampm was carrying out with anthrax and other biological and chemical poisons when our teams hit the site in we found hoards of documents authored by mohammed they bore little similarity to the other terrorist manuals recovered at alqaeda safe houses throughout afghanistan and pakistan which in comparison were extremely crude mohammeds manuals contained very innovative designs for explosive devices and represented a huge leap forward in alqaedas technological capabilities on september ninth two days before the attacks against the world trade center and the pentagon mohammeds facility was completely abandoned and he was evacuated to an unknown location somewhere in the hindu kush mountains despite numerous leads we had not been able to assemble any verifiable eyeson intelligence for him until this morning any idea what he was doing at the madrassa asked secretary of state jennifer staley waddell turned to james vaile the director of the central intelligence agency to see if he wanted to field the question dci vaile looked at staley and said there have been reports that some elements of alqaeda are taking advantage of the absence of a strong centralized government in somalia to reestablish themselves and open up training camps homeland security secretary alan driehaus shook his head and said i suppose the fact that we wouldnt touch mogadishu or any of that area with a tenfoot pole only adds to its appeal for them how do you know we wouldnt touch it asked general hank currutt chairman of the joint chiefs of staff a patriot who had bled for his country on more than one battlefield currutt had never been a big fan of driehauss he felt the secretarys position called for a warrior familiar with combat rather than a career attorney familiar with nothing more than the inside of a courtroom for his part driehaus resented currutts constant implications that he wasnt up to the task and that serving his country for more than two decades in the department of justice was somehow less noble than having served it in the armed forces considering the whole black hawk down incident and the fact that our resources are stretched too thin as it is replied driehaus i just assumed we wouldnt be too hot to jump into another conflict over there i think we need to start being very sensitive to the perception that were empire building empire building replied currutt is that what you think this is i said thats the perception but youd have to be blind not to see where it comes from well let me tell you something weve sent a lot of brave young men and women to fight for freedom outside of our borders and the only land weve ever asked for in return is enough to bury those who didnt come home the room was completely silent normally the president embraced healthy differences of opinion among his cabinet members and advisors but he knew something that secretary driehaus didnt hank currutt was at the battle of the black sea as that infamous eighteenhour firefight in the heart of mogadishu s bakara market was known eighteen servicemen had been killed and more than seventy wounded there were too many pressing issues vying for their attention to allow the animosity between driehaus and currutt to become the focus of this meeting they needed to concentrate on the matter in front of them and rutledge was enough of a statesman to know that allowing currutt to jump across the table and rip driehauss throat out was anything but productive the president said as far as im concerned all options are on the table at this point mohammed is one of the most dangerous threats to this country and i have to be honest up to this point id been harboring a secret hope that with all the bombs we dropped on tora bora we had pulverized whatever rock he was hiding under and thats why we hadnt heard anything from him but now we know differently and i want to discuss what were going to do about it general waddell it was your folks that gathered the intel whats your read on this well mr president we know from the documents weve recovered and from our interviews with detainees both at gitmo and in afghanistan that mohammed had been trying to assemble very sophisticated delivery devices for multiple terror attacks inside the united states weve got eyes on him right now and i think we need to strike while the iron is hot were never going to get a chance like this again i say we take him out director vaile inquired the president as he turned to the head of the central intelligence agency would you concur normally i would but weve got a problem in this case what kind of problem asked waddell we know that despite our successes alqaeda is reconstituting itself they have a myriad of attacks at different stages of development here in the united states and abroad some of which were on to and many of which were still trying to smoke out as you are aware mr president one of the most troubling pieces of intelligence weve uncovered recently is that theyre very close to completing a transaction that would allow them to launch an unprecedented nuclear attack on the us based upon several converging streams of intelligence including the loss of our field operative and the satellite imagery we pulled from marrakech we have a very high degree of certainty the transaction was masterminded and is being controlled by mohammed bin mohammed the cias position is that its vital to national security that he be taken alive for interrogation purposes you mean torture by some friendly government replied secretary driehaus the ultimate in american outsourcing vaile fixed the head of the dhs with a very unfriendly stare where would we send this one the exsoviet facilities in eastern europe are pretty much out of the question especially now that the press has been all over them most of the western europeans wont allow us to use their international airports as transition points anymore so i suppose that leaves us with our old fallbacks egypt jordan which side are you on alan asked vaile i side with the rule of law replied driehaus everyone in the room knew the secretary was not a fan of the administrations extraordinary rendition policy it was a strategy that allowed prisoners to be handed over to foreign governments who conducted torture so that the united states could sidestep its own laws strictly forbidding it keeping his eyes locked on driehaus the dci said regardless of where mohammed might be interrogated i think the presidents policies have served our country and in particular your department exceedingly well with all due respect to the president i think youre wrong said the dhs secretary were supposed to be a nation that holds the rule of law above all else we use it to justify every single thing we do including the invasion of other sovereign nations if we dont truly place that principle above all else then we cant be any better than the terrorists were fighting against thats it bellowed general hank currutt as he rose from his chair and stabbed his thick finger at driehaus im not going to listen to any more of this subversive garbage subversive replied driehaus thats a mighty convenient way to label opinions that dont agree with yours listen you smug sob if you dont like the way things are being done here then resign your post pick up a picket sign and stand on the other side of the fence with the rest of the whackos out on pennsylvania avenue once again things were quickly spinning in the wrong direction lets take our seats and all calm down said the president when currutt didnt comply the president ordered general i said sit down once the man had retaken his seat the president looked at driehaus and said youve got a sharp mind alan especially when it comes to homeland security issues and thats why mr president interjected driehaus our enemies use our extraordinary rendition policy as prime recruiting propaganda in fact with all the attention the media has been devoting to it they dont need to recruit at all willing bodies are lined up out their doors and down the block this policy makes us look like hypocrites no it doesnt stressed rutledge who had been getting progressively more frustrated with his appointees refusal to be a team player the policy makes us look tough whats more it gets results civilized rules of engagement and jurisprudence mean nothing to a vicious enemy willing to do anything to succeed if we want to win we have to adopt the same strategysuccess at any cost im sorry alan but if a nation refuses to bend then that nation is almost certainly doomed to break in this case we have to suspend the rule of law in part in order to save it that one remark tore at the very few remnants of respect driehaus had left for the president we know mohammed exchanged information with the palestinian and hezbollah bombmakers who helped richard reid design the shoe bomb he carried on the paristoboston flight in lets indict him under that if we put him on trial here a fair trial it will go a long way to repairing our image abroad and itll send the message that were tough ramzi yousef bombed the world trade center in interjected the attorney general laura finley we found him tried him and put him in supermax out in colorado but whered that get us his uncle khalid shaikh mohammed came back with alqaeda and hit the trade center again in yousef got a fair trial and then he got life in prison thats pretty tough if you ask me but it didnt stop anything alan weve worked together and you know i have a lot of respect for you but the presidents right we cant bring knives to gunfights anymore driehaus was about to respond when the secretary of state jennifer staley piped up and said as someone who deals with americas image abroad on an aroundtheclock basis i want to put my two cents in here have the press leaks about our interrogations of detainees abroad hurt our image overseas yes they definitely have but the bottom line is that right or wrong the united states is safer because of what were doing so we shouldnt be concerned with what happens to these people once theyve been handed over to another government when we render a suspect that suspect is often being rendered to his or her country of origin or a country where that individual already has outstanding warrants despite how the press warps our involvement we actually have very little control over what happens from that point forward so theres a slice of absolution in it for usa washing of the hands as it were replied the dhs secretary staley was much too intelligent to walk into that one instead she offered what ill say is that even our beloved president lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the civil war i think the intelligence weve gathered through extraordinary rendition speaks for itself driehaus looked around the table so im the only one nobody else has any concern about adding yet another name to the secret prisoner rolls of this policy actually said a voice from the other end of the table i do stunned all heads in the room turned to stare at the fbi director martin sorce once he was sure he had everyones attention the director continued this will be one of the highestranking alqaeda members weve ever taken down but because of the wide coverage of extraordinary rendition some of the more cooperative governments weve been working with have said they wont take any more of our prisoners weve also had a couple of socalled escapes which we know alqaeda facilitated through bribes payoffs or intimidation of some of the people involved with these same governments so this isnt as easy as throwing a dart at a map and asking the locals to warm up the coffee and jumper cables because weve got a new stepchild for a prisoner this big and this dangerous security has to be our number one issue i want to know that whomever we park this cupcake with theyre not going to lose him thats a good point said the dci mohammed bin mohammeds capture will create a lot of special problems and security will be the biggest alqaeda would do anything to get this guy back if we let the egyptians or jordanians host him theres no guarantee theyll be able to hang on to him look at what happened to the uss cole planners in yemen on the flip side if we transport him to gitmo our hands are going to be tied in terms of how hard we can press him for details and we are going to need that wmd transaction intelligence as soon as possible so wheres that leave us asked attorney general finley between a rock and a public relations hard place said the secretary of state while we cant change the bad press weve already received secretary driehaus does have a valid point whatever we do going forward wed better not screw it up three after twenty more minutes of discussion the president adjourned the meeting informing the participants he would take their suggestions under advisement quietly rutledge questioned why winning the war on terror and winning the war with the media seemed to be mutually exclusive how many more september ths had to happen before the american people realized what a savage enemy they were facing it was one of the most trying challenges of his administration but the president knew that however unpopular his choices might be he had to put the welfare of the country and its citizens firsteven if many of them couldnt stomach what had to be done as he was readying to leave the room secretary of defense robert hillimana graying heavyset man in his midsixties with wirerimmed glasses and wearing a neatly pressed brooks brothers suitasked mr president may we have a moment of your time general waddell stood next to him with a folder in his hand once the rest of the cabinet members had left the situation room waddell handed the folder to hilliman who opened it and said mr president immediately after you asked me to task certain agencies within the defense department to develop a plan to handle the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants of significant intelligence value which along with the cias efforts is how we came up with extraordinary rendition replied the president yes sir but we at the defense department also foresaw a situation wherein operatives at the very top of alqaedas organizational pyramid men like mohammed bin mohammed ayman alzawahiri or even bin laden himself might pose a special set of challenges incongruent with our rendition policies are you trying to tell me youve got a different take on how to handle this yes i believe we do then why didnt you say something during the meeting asked rutledge hilliman answered by pulling an executive summary from the folder and handing it to him the president read it through twice and then once more for good measure before saying how many people would be in the loop on this as few as possible sir responded waddell its an extremely unorthodox plan and we feel the less who know about it the better thats putting it mildly said rutledge as he motioned for the rest of the file as he slowly read through it he asked how confident are you that this can be pulled off and i dont want a rosy bestcase scenario i want the real downanddirty assessment waddell looked at hilliman who replied because of certain elements beyond our control we put it at about a sixty percent probability of success that didnt sit well with the president thats not a very good number no sir its not but considering the situation we think the benefits far outweigh the liabilities i dont agree with you said rutledge if this ever became public knowledge the fallout would be devastating yes sir replied waddell but we have contingencies in place to make sure that doesnt happen with only a sixty percent probability of success said the president youd better have a boatload of them hilliman and waddell had been at this game long enough to know when to back off and let an operation sell itself they also knew that jack rutledge would make the right call no matter how hard a decision it was he always did after a few more minutes of studying the file the president nodded his head and said i want you to keep me up to speed every step of the way on this of course mr president responded hilliman general waddell then picked up one of the secure telephones on the situationroom table dialed an inside line at the defense intelligence agency and spoke five words that would have repercussions far beyond what any of them could have imagined were go for operation driftwood four somali coast kilometers south of mogadishu may mohammed bin mohammed tucked a handful of local currency into the front of the boys pants note by note and then sent him on his way back to the madrassa the elevenyearold had been exquisite maybe not as exquisite as the european or arab boys he was accustomed to but one made do with what one had at hand once mohammed had finished bathing he brewed himself another glass of tea and stepped out onto the villas terrace it was darker than normal for this time of eveningthe clouds of an approaching storm having hidden the stars overhead a bit fatigued from his illness and his recent trip to morocco mohammed leaned against one of the stone balustrades and listened to the roar of the indian ocean crashing against the beach below after a few more minutes of salt air against his skin mohammed returned inside there was no telling how much havoc the storm might wreak on satellite communications and he had a few last elements to put in place the transaction was nearly complete because of his particular predilections mohammed preferred to live at the beachside villa alone but that didnt mean he was lax when it came to security not only did he have his own men posted on the roads in both directions but he also enjoyed the protection of several local warlords in addition the beach had been mined with antipersonnel devices and the entire villa had been constructed with reinforced concrete and steel to protect against any of the remotecontrolled predator drone attacks the cowardly americans were so fond of with no central government and no outside forces meddling in local affairs men like mohammed bin mohammed were free to do as they wished in somalia in just three years alqaeda had opened dozens of covert training camps throughout the country and had significantly added to the organizations numbers shipping them off to iraq to gain valuable realworld combat experience whats more after their humiliating defeat at the hands of local militias the united states wanted nothing to do with this part of the world it was the perfect base of operations everything in mohammeds world seemed to be improving even his health in one of the villas small bedrooms mohammed carefully unlocked a specially fabricated titanium briefcase and booted up his encrypted macintosh powerbook as he worked his mind drifted to the little boy who had left only twenty minutes ago and he started becoming aroused again with the arousal though came something elsea dull throbbing in his back just below the rib cage complemented by an overwhelming urge to urinate too much tea and too much sex mohammed thought to himself as he rose to go to the toilet when he approached the bedroom door his heart caught in his throat hands on top of your head said one of several blackclad figures armed with very nastylooking assault rifles mohammed was stunned how could the house have been breached the man in black told him once more to put his hands on top of his head this time in arabic ignoring the order mohammed lunged back into the bedroom toward the powerbook as he did a pair of barbed probes from a taser x ripped through his cotton robe and embedded themselves in the flesh of his back when the electricity raced through his body his muscles locked up and he fell like a dead tree trunk facefirst onto the stone floor his hands and feet were flexicuffed and the last thing he saw before being dragged from the room was two of the men going for his laptop had they been paying attention they might have seen mohammed smile seconds later an explosion rocked the small bedroom and the hallway was showered with titanium shrapnel chunks of plaster and pieces of charred human flesh five scottish highlands may eileanaigas house was a twelvebedroom estate located on the northern end of a private wooded island in the middle of the river beauly in addition to its majestic silver birch douglas fir spruce and pine trees the estate also boasted a dramatic gorge a heated outdoor swimming pool small formal gardens an extensive wine cellar and a security system that rivaled that of any leading head of state the security was a very necessary precaution as the man who lived on the island had many powerful enemiesmany of whom were his clients known simply as the troll the lord of eileanaigas house lived by the motto that knowledge didnt equal power it was the proper application of knowledge that equaled power and when applied in a very precise manner knowledge could also equal incredible wealth it was in following this mantra that the troll had made a substantial living for himself dealing in the purchase sale and trade of highly classified information both his cutthroat business acumen and his gluttonous appetite for the very best of everything stood in sharp contrast to his height at just under three feet tall he could barely reach anything in his home without some sort of assistance normally in the form of miniature stepladders made from ornately carved exotic hardwoods the houses size was a reflection of how the troll saw himself and only its most private areas had been retrofitted to accommodate his size another reflection of how the troll saw himself were the two enormous snowwhite caucasian ovcharkas argus and drako who never left his side weighing close to two hundred pounds each and standing over fortyone inches at the shoulder these giants were the dogs of choice for the russian military and the former east german border patrol they were extremely athletic and absolutely vicious when it came to strangers intruding on their territory they made perfect guardians for the trolls island domain and most important for a man who made his livelihood dealing in the art of duplicity and blackmail the dogs could never be turned against him in fact hed always had an odd premonition that the dogs might one day save his life tonight argus and drako sat warily near the fire as a powerful summer storm raged outside despite the warmth and its sirens call to sleep their eyes were glued to the man who had just arrived at the castle whisky asked the troll offering his guest a drink i dont drink replied the man his dark narrow eyes bracketing a once prominent bedouin nose im surprised i thought you would have known more about me the troll smiled as he poured himself two fingers of germainrobin brandy abdul ali aka ahmed ali imad hasan and ibrahim rahman date of birth unknown place of birth also unknown though western intelligence speculates somewhere in north africa most likely algeria or morocco hence the cias cognomen of the berber even though no western intelligence agency has been able to obtain a photo of you it is speculated that you have undergone multiple plastic surgeries to change your appearance you speak more than five languages and are at home in at least a dozen countries worldwide more than half of them in the west for all intents and purposes youre a ghosta man who travels wherever he wants whenever he wants with no one ever knowing if he was really there or not it is believed you have both prior special operations and military intelligence training though with whom no one can or will say you have been suspected in more than thirtysix terrorist attacks on western targets and have been directly implicated in eleven highprofile assassinationstwo of which were mi agents three mossad and four more who were deepcover operatives for the cia your height has been listed as anywhere from fivefooteight to sixfootfive you have a spear shaped birthmark on the back of your left shoulder and are in short one of the highestpriority targets for every organized intelligence agency in the western world ali was impressed thats very good everything except for the birthmark i do not have one you do now replied the troll i had it inserted in your file and crossconfirmed by three separate sources it may come in handy someday consider it a bonus alqaeda has given me a considerable amount of business over the years the troll then climbed up into his desk chair and said lets talk about why youre here you know why im here of course i do your man in somalia mohammed bin mohammed ali nodded his head everything i was able to uncover is in the file i forwarded to your superiors i dont understand your need to see me in person i have learned that even in our delicate line of work there is no substitute for meeting facetoface be that as it may this is still highly unusual replied the troll as he cradled the snifter in his diminutive hands so are the circumstances surrounding mohammeds disappearance mr ali the only reason i have agreed to meet with you is because of my longstanding business relationship with your superiors if you have something to ask me please do so ali studied the troll for several moments before responding id like you to tell me what you uncovered like i said its all in the file i am very meticulous about my work as am i but sometimes small details have a way of getting left out i dont leave out detailssmall or otherwise said the troll you never know something that may have seemed inconsequential at the time might turn out to be quite important to us now please humor me the troll took a long sip of brandy he knew that lying to the man could prove to be a very bad mistake there was no telling if alqaeda had a piece of the puzzle he was not aware of all he could do was stick to his plan it was inevitable that they would come to interrogate him he was one of the few people who knew where mohammed bin mohammed had been hiding your man in somalia was targeted by an american covert action team american repeated ali not israeli youre sure of that as the file i sent your superiors clearly states he was taken by a private vessel to waters off the eastern seaboard of the united states and then flown by helicopter to somewhere in new york city and he is still alive from what i understand but he wasnt in very good health to begin with apparently he has a serious kidney problem interjected ali finishing the trolls sentence for him we know to his credit it seems to be making his interrogation quite difficult for his captors this is where i get confused if it was the americans why would they bring him to america straightaway why not take him to a cooperative country for interrogation first i dont interpret intelligence mr ali i simply facilitate its transfer now if theres nothing else actually there is said the assassin as his hand moved toward the inside of his sport coat the ovcharkas began to growl the troll placed his finger on the tiny trigger of a special customized weapon recessed beneath his desk and with his other hand signaled the dogs to be silent well aware that there was a weapon trained on his stomach ali slowly removed a piece of paper from his jacket leaned forward and slid it across the desk the troll took his time in reading it now the alqaeda operatives real reason for wanting to meet facetoface was out in the open your organization doesnt pay me for advice but im going to give you some anyway no charge cut your losses and move on even if i could pinpoint his exact location what you are suggesting is suicide it cant be done thats not your concern all we want to know is if you can put a team and equipment in place by the specified date said ali with enough money anything is possible but twenty million dollars on top of which youll be paid twice your normal fee and a bonus of five million once the operation has been successfully completed meaning once you have recovered your colleague ali nodded his head think of it as an added incentive the troll was silent for several moments as he pretended to reflect upon the offer they had played right into his hands with this kind of money he would have enough to buy what he needed from his contact at the nsa but his mole at the department of defense would be much more expensive nevertheless he was confident he could get the information he needed with plenty of money left to spare finally he said the biggest problem i see you facing mr ali is time if you can allow for more it might help increase your probability of success no there is no more time mohammed is scheduled to complete a very sensitive transaction for us in the very near future then i would suggest you get somebody else to do it there is nobody else the man mohammed has been negotiating with will only deal with him if mohammed fails to appear we forfeit our place in line and the man will simply contact the next prospective buyer if that happens we will end up losing much more than just a highly valued member of our organization what is it you are buying if you dont mind my asking it is none of your concern responded ali the troll smiled he knew exactly what they were buying there were very few things alqaeda would be willing to pay so much to get their lead negotiator back for if youre successful the americans will throw open the gates of hell itself to find youall of you abdul ali wasnt quite sure if the dwarf was referring to their rescue of mohammed bin mohammed or what they intended to do once mohammeds transaction was complete either way it didnt matter you have our offer take it or leave it considering that the troll had dreamed about this exact opportunity for years how could he do anything other than accept as abdul ali left the manor house he couldnt help smiling that the troll would accept the assignment and help them in their task was a foregone conclusion what amused the assassin more was that the little man had no idea that alqaeda knew that it was he who had betrayed mohammed bin mohammed to the americans their network of contacts might not have been as vast but it could be incredibly efficient soon the trolls usefulness would run its course and when it did abdul ali would take particular pleasure in bringing the mans parasitic existence to an extremely painful end six montreal canada july when sayed jamal entered the bedroom of his governmentsubsidized apartment scot harvath slammed the butt of his h ampk right into the bridge of his nose knocking the terrorist to the floor and causing him to bleed profusely dont you know that allah prefers playing to a full house said harvath as he flexicuffed the mans wrists behind his back he doesnt like it when you skip out of morning prayers early and neither do i as harvath stood up he gave jamal a sharp kick to his ribs to emphasize his unhappiness with the mans premature return to the apartment like ahmed ressamthe algerianborn terrorist who had been caught at the canadianus border with over pounds of explosives and a plan to blow up los angeles international airport on new years eve sayed jamal was yet another algerian national who had taken advantage of canadas liberal asylum policy to hide out just north of the border and plan attacks against the united states with its quaint cobblestone streets and european architecture montreal was a city that made many people forget they were only twentynine miles from new york state scot harvath though was no longer one of those people finding a canadian penny mixed in with his us change once or twice a year harvath used to joke that canada was the most patient invading force in the worldone penny at a time one pop singer at a time one actor at a time it might take them ten thousand years to conquer the united states but they were on the move and the american people needed to wake up but when canada started to become an operational staging ground for middle eastern terrorists bent on destroying the united states the joke was no longer funny upon reaching canada or its territorial waters all that these asylumseekers had to do was claim status as political refugees and they would be granted canadian protection under the un convention that was it the screening process was so poorly managed that nearly one hundred percent of them were granted a formal hearing complete with free legal advice money and a place to stay while they often waited more than two years to appear in front of a canadian magistrateif they even bothered showing up at all for their hearing with laughable screening procedures and nonexistent enforcement significant numbers of these fake asylumseekers found their way to montreal where they joined muslim terrorist organizations with strong ties to alqaeda one such organization was known as the algerian armed islamic group or gia and it was the gia that had brought agent scot harvath to canada the united states had been trying unsuccessfully to convince the canadian government to extradite sayed jamal to stand trial in the united states jamal was a former chemistry professor who somewhere along the line found religionradical islam to be specificjoined the gia and followed several of his gia counterparts to iraq where he took up arms against the western imperial crusaders aka the american military interestingly enough of all the foreign fighters in iraq the majorityover twenty percentcame from algeria and while several syrian terrorist groups were known for producing exceptional snipers it was the algeriansthe gia in particularwho were known for being the best bombmakers in the business in fact the most horrific roadside bombsthe ones that scared the hell out of even the most experienced eod or explosive ordnance disposal techs were the ones produced by the gias most proficient bombmaker in iraq sayed jamal with over two hundred american servicemen and women killed and wounded as a result of jamals specialty ieds known as efps or explosively formed projectiles which could penetrate up to four inches of armor from over feet away the united states had pulled out all the stops to track him down when the heat got too intense in iraq he fled to canada there he spun an elaborate cover story and was granted full refugee status but while you can take the jihadi out of the jihad you can never really take the jihad out of the jihadi nsa intercepts revealed a dramatic increase in terrorist chatter suggesting that jamal was coordinating future attacks within the united states once the united states had pinpointed the terrorists location they began extradition requests despite a mountain of evidence in favor of the extradition the canadians refused the liberal prime minister wasnt convinced that jamal was who the americans said he was even so the pm made it clear he wouldnt even begin considering extradition unless the united states promised to waive the death penalty in the case as far as the united states was concerned there was no way in hell that was ever going to happen soon after talks broke down a copy of jamals canadian intelligence dossier magically appeared on the presidents desk jack rutledge didnt need to ask where it came from he knew how back channels worked and he also knew that there were several highranking members of the canadian security intelligence service who were sick of seeing their countrys benevolence exploited by muslim extremists considering the sensitivity of the assignment he knew there was only one person he could call with jamal now ziptied and under control harvath turned his attention back to the most dangerous part of the assignmentsecuring jamals laptop hed been briefed that the united states had recently lost two very experienced operators when they attempted to retrieve a highranking alqaeda members powerbook harvath didnt know what spooked him morethe fact that the united states had taken down an alqaeda operative so highranking that even with his abovetopsecret polo step clearance he couldnt find out who it was or that as the two members of the assault team had gone for the terrorists laptop it had detonated killing them instantly all harvath knew was that jamals computer was believed to contain a veritable treasure trove of information and that because of some association with the aforementioned highranking alqaeda member his laptop most likely had been rigged with similar explosives and a mercury tilt switch it was at times like this that harvath would have given a years pay to have had a good eod tech along for the ride but he didnt have a good eod tech he didnt even have a bad one all he had were two empty aerosol cans and a styrofoam cooler packed with dry ice the idea had been to render the mercury in the tilt switch useless with a product used for flashfreezing biological specimens known as quickfreeze after the tilt switch was immobilized it would create a window of several seconds during which he could pick up the laptop and place it in the cooler it then could be transported back across the border where a team was waiting to defuse it at the time the plan made sense what nobody had counted on was jamal coming home early because of it harvaths attention had been diverted and now he didnt have enough quickfreeze left to attempt refreezing the tilt switch he had to think of something else returning emptyhanded or worse nohanded were not options he was willing to consider though harvath was just two careers removed from his days as a united states navy seal the lessons he had learned with the secret service at the white house and now as a covert counterterrorism operative for the department of homeland security only served to reinforce his special operations trainingthere was an answer to every problem you just had to look hard enough to find it glancing at the special suunto xmi watch hed been issued for the trip into canada harvath saw that he was very close to falling behind schedule he had a rendezvous to keep and if he missed it it was going to be hell getting out of the country and back across the us border as he cycled through various options in his mind something suddenly bubbled to the surface sayed jamal was a bombmaker and unfortunately a pretty good one from the intelligence reports harvath had read he knew that the man was meticulous and if he was meticulous he was probably also very safety conscious the question was would he have what harvath was looking for and if so where did he keep it dragging jamal up by the hair harvath put his gun under the mans chin and said youve got a lot of soldering equipment in here sayed if a fire broke out it could be pretty expensivenot to mention the undesirable attention it would draw that was ramzi yousefs mistake with that little chemical fire in the philippines if i recall correctly his pal got busted going back later for their laptop didnt he but youre smarter than that i can tell so tell me wheres your fire extinguisher jamal spit in harvaths face and cursed him in arabic ebn el metanaka harvath responded as he jammed the silenced barrel of his weapon into the painfully soft tissue beneath jamals chin we can do this in arabic or english i dont really care i just want to know where it is the bombmaker tried to spit at him again but harvath cut him short with a knee to the groin hed had a feeling he wasnt going to get much help but it was always polite to askand scot harvath was nothing if not polite he dragged the terrorist to the kitchen where he found what he was looking for under the sink good choice sayed he remarked as he pulled it out powder extinguishers leave such a nasty residue co is much cleaner and a lot colder looking around harvath then asked now then where do you keep your falafel mitts asshole seven fortyfive minutes later harvath pulled his car over to the side of the road yanked jamal out of the trunk and shoved half a tampon up each of his nostrils to stem his nosebleed after putting a windbreaker over the terrorists shoulders and zipping it up the front to hide his stained shirt harvath slid him into the front passenger seat fastened his seat belt and warned him what would happen if he tried to make any more trouble once again jamal tried to spit but harvath was ready for him he nailed him with a blow to his solar plexus doubling him over and knocking the wind out of him reaching back into the bag of goodies he had bought at the convenience store just outside montreal harvath withdrew a powerbar and a bottle of spring water at thirtysix his carefree days of unlimited cheeseburgers and beers were now behind him at five feet ten and a muscular pounds harvath was in better shape than most men half his age but he found it took more and more work just to maintain his level of physical fitness if an assignment in a muslim country required that he grow a beard after a couple of days he soon saw traces of gray mingled with the light brown that matched the hair on his head his father a navy seal instructor who had died in a training accident when harvath was in his early twenties had gone completely gray by forty despite the small lines starting to form at the corners of his bright blue eyes it wasnt anything harvath couldnt live with everybody had to get older sooner or later what the signs of aging did make him wonder about was how much longer he wanted to put up with the stress of working for the government the fact that he couldnt get any good information that might have helped him on this assignment about the highranking alqaeda terrorist the united states had recently bagged was just another in a ongoing string of frustrations he was grudgingly putting up with while he respected his president and loved his country the mounting bureaucratic bullshit was really beginning to piss him off having been both a seal and a secret service agent at the white house harvath understood the value of rules regs and a proper chain of command but when the president had created a special international branch of homeland security dubbed the office of international investigative assistance and had offered harvath one of its plum assignments scot had thought things were going to be different known as the apex project harvaths covert unit was supposed to represent the collective intelligence capability and full muscle of the united states government to help neutralize and prevent terrorist actions against america and american interests on a global level though it technically didnt exist and harvath was nothing more than a benignly titled special agent just last year a selfaggrandizing senator with her sights set on the white house had been able to discover enough about him and his involvement with the apex project to force his resignation though it was only temporary not knowing what his next move would be or what his life might be like with his cover blown was not a very pleasant experience he knew that his was a quiet thankless profession that could only be lived in the shadows but he was growing very tired of being at the mercy of partisan hacks and career politicians who sought advancement by stomping on the backs of true patriots guilty of nothing more than a deep love for their country he was so fed up with all the crap that hed recently presented his boss gary lawlor with acaliber bullet wrapped in red tape the bullet was designed to take out targets at extremely long distances and lawlor understood that it represented harvath who was constantly being sent on missions overseas to take out terrorists the red tape was selfexplanatory the job might have been a bit more palatable if it afforded him time to pursue any semblance of a personal life most of his buddies even his former teammates from the seals were pretty much married off and starting families though he didnt necessarily want to start one of his own tomorrow it would be nice to see a point in his nottoodistant future where his career would allow him to of course that presupposed finding a woman who would want to start one with him as well most he found were unable to put up with the demands of his job which regularly sounded the death knell in his burgeoning relationships thered only been one woman hed ever been able to see himself actually making a full go of it with she was even prepared to uproot her life and move to dc to be with him but in the end the demands of his job had made it impossible the bright side of everything if you wanted to call it that was that if he decided to go through with leaving government service he was not at a loss for job offers from the private sector in fact there was one job in particular harvath was thinking very seriously about takingan instructor position with a worldrenowned tactical training center in colorado called valhalla what haunted him though was the fear that once he entered the private sector he would no longer be able to look in the mirror and still consider himself a patriot that said it was still a decision he had to make and he knew that it would undoubtedly weigh heavily on his mind over the upcoming holiday weekend rounding a bend in the otherwise deserted country lane harvaths attention was drawn to more pressing matters as his vehicle was met by a police roadblock a smile began to metastasize across sayed jamals face the terrorist clearly saw his salvation at hand no matter who scot harvath was and what american agency he worked for he could not legally take him from canada against his will this was about to end up very badly for the united states the american had been a fool to ever remove him from the trunk had he left him there the man very likely could have driven straight across the border without ever being searched sayed knew that it was only a matter of moments now before he would be free and then he would tell every reporter he could find about his terrible ordeal at the hands of the imperialist americans slowly approaching the roadblock harvath kept his cool can i see your license and registration please asked a machine guntoting officer in a royal canadian mounted police uniform when harvath rolled down his window harvath made a show of patting his pockets and replied i was so excited about coming to canada i must have forgotten to bring them the officer looked around the vehicle and then said we get that a lot who is your passenger help me screamed jamal sensing this was the only chance he was going to get at freedom i have been taken against my he continued but was cut off when harvath slammed his elbow into the mans mouth dont mind him said harvath well aware that the royal mounted police not only didnt carry machine guns but also didnt patrol canadas borders hes just a little moody its his time of the month yeah replied the officer i can see the tampons i think hes just nervous about crossing into the states i would be too said the csis agent posing as a mountie he then waved for the roadblock vehicles to clear the road and added especially if id been responsible for killing and wounding all those american military personnel jamals bloodied face went pale the canadians were in on it we just wanted to make sure you got your man said the agent anything else about the operation we should know youll want a team to sweep his apartment hes got a lot of bombmaking materials in there but other than that it was pretty smooth okay then said the man as he tapped the roof of harvaths car thank you for visiting canada have a safe trip home we will said harvath smiling and giving a little wave as he drove away two kilometers later they came to a small clearing and harvath exited the car checking their gps coordinates on his suunto he activated the preplannedroute feature grabbed the styrofoam cooler from the backseat and pulled jamal out of the vehicle shoving him toward the woods less than half a klick in they heard a branch snap and harvath knew they werent alone as he looked over his left shoulder he saw a small team of heavily armed men decked out in digital camouflage materialize from among the trees welcome to the united states said one of the men do you have anything to declare yes i do replied harvath as he offered up jamal and the cooler with the frozen laptop canada s a fabulous country great beer great people and they have just started a wonderful terrorist lending program the team drove harvath and jamal out of the woods to the small town of rouses point new york where the operation had kicked off and where harvaths car was waiting eight after a short debrief a man named mike jaffe who was the lead joint terrorism task force agent asked so where to now you going back to dc for the fourth of july weekend harvath shook his head im stopping in new york city to see an old friend who just got back from afghanistan the man smiled and asked where are you going to watch the fireworks from probably a bar stool you gotta be kidding me said jaffe the pronounced new york accent unmistakable in his voice let me tell you something the best place to watch them is in brooklyn on furman avenue between atlantic and cadman plaza ill keep that in mind and if youre hungry afterwards go to lundy brothers on emmons avenue for a real bowl of new york red dont miss their egg cream either they throw in a pretzel for a swizzle stick harvath laughed and shook his head he had no idea what a bowl of new york red was much less why it was important that he search out a real one and hed never had an egg cream in his life but that was new yorkers for you the sun rose and set by their city anyplace else in the world was only second best you getting all this asked the intense silverhaired jaffe sensing harvaths mind was wandering or do you want me to write it down for you i think i got it replied harvath what about you guys a weekend in the catskills before running our pal down to sunny guantánamo bay jaffe laughed actually we were thinking about stapling all of his indictments to him and stringing him up outside fort drum we figured we could sell tickets at a buck a whack and tell the soldiers he was a muslim piñata harvath liked the jttf agents sense of humor youd probably make a fortune he responded knowing that new york s fort drum was the home of the th mountain division light infantry and that theyd lost more than their fair share of people in iraq especially to ieds but unfortunately we dont have time for that replied jaffe the bureau wants him down at federal plaza in manhattan today for his initial processing after that though hell be somebody elses problem harvath didnt envy the people who would have to spend the holiday weekend away from their families and friends while they interrogated sayed jamal but that was how the business worked and harvath knew it all too well america couldnt afford to take a day off from its fight on terrorism not even on the anniversary of its independence the bad guys were always workingalways probing for another soft spot they could exploit and america had to remain one step ahead as harvath watched jaffe walk away to join his men he lamented the immutable fact that no matter how hard it tried the united states would never be able to be on top of everything this time just like so many times before theyd gotten lucky that was it though theyd pulled a rather big player off the field there were innumerable secondstringers standing in the shadows ready to take his place for all of the setbacks the enemy had supposedly suffered their roster of fresh bodies seemed to roll on without end and the one unspoken truth that every american involved in the war on terror knew was that it wasnt a matter of if the terrorists would hit us again it was only a matter of when harvath prayed that he would never see that day because he knew that when it came it would make look like choir practice nine new york city the drive from rouses point to manhattan normally took five and a half hours but with the help of a thermos full of coffee a heavy foot and george clinton and parliament harvath made it in four with the sunroof open the windows rolled down and tear the roof off the sucker pumping from the speakers of his black chevy trailblazer harvath rumbled across the george washington bridge toward manhattan a little after pm as he took in the skyline and watched the tidal wave of fleeing holiday traffic the weather couldnt have been betterlow eighties bright sunshine and only a trace of humidity it was going to be a perfect weekend an hour outside the city harvath had phoned his pal recently retired delta force operative robert herringtonbetter known to his friends as bullet boband established a rendezvous point for their meeting because bob was still wrapping things up at the manhattan va they decided to meet at one of harvaths favorite pubs near times square called the pig amp whistle where theyd begin the first leg of their barhopping alcoholics unanimous meeting after driving around the neighborhood for twenty minutes harvath settled on the cheapest garage he had seen agreed to hand over his first born three pints of blood and a vital organ to be named at a later date as payment and then walked four blocks over to the pig inside the staff and the customers were glued to tv sets harvath grabbed a seat at the bar ordered a pint of bare knuckle stout and tried to piece together what was happening the stations were covering a hostage standoff at a grade school in the bronx what a way to start the fourth of july weekend thought harvath as he ordered a late lunch and tried to forget about the world and its problems for a while his mind drifted to the first time he and bob herrington had met theyd been assigned to a unique joint special operations program training the special forces of an allied south american country the soldiers final task at the end of the training was to show off their new skills in a series of highend exercises culminating with them assembling on a mountain plateau where the countrys president its top generals and other assorted vips were sitting in a reviewing stand the catch was that it had to be done in a very tight time frame though the soldiers were performing better than any of their american instructors thought they would once they hit the run up the steep mountain face it was obvious they werent going to make it up to the parade ground by the specified time so what did bob do once they arrived at the base of the mountain and were out of sight of the reviewing stand he gathered up all the soldiers rifles strapped them to his pack and ran ahead of them for his part harvath couldnt understand what herrington was doing just below the plateau he stopped and then handed a rifle to each one of the soldiers as they passed up on the parade ground there were several moments of confusion as the soldiers traded rifles back and forth until each was with its rightful owner as harvath walked to the edge of the parade ground he saw bob smiling and it was at that moment that he learned his greatest lesson about leadershipthe only thing that matters is that your team achieve its objective together how that happens is immaterial as long as you all cross the finish line together bob could have taken credit for the soldiers success but that wasnt his style he was happy just to see them succeed harvath had liked bob from the minute he met him but on that dusty parade ground in south america he had developed a real respect for him and that respect had turned into a friendship that transcended the years and more than a few assignments together in fact harvath often joked that bob had become the older brother he never wanted fortyfive minutes later harvath was about to order another beer when bullet bob materialized out of thin air and slapped a joint special operations task force coin down on the bar the rule was that if you and a colleague had both been given the same coin for an operation or a team youd been on and you didnt have your coin with you you were responsible for buying the round if you did have it then the man who issued the challenge had to pick up that round harvath was way ahead of his old friend reaching down he lifted his cocktail napkin and revealed his coin after asking if there was any louis xiii cognac in the house harvath shook his buddys hand nice try my friend he said careful of bobs injured shoulder you win some you lose some replied herrington who was at least three inches taller than harvath and a bit broader in the chest his similarly colored brown hair was cut neat but he still sported his go native afghanistan beard his narrow green eyes took in everybody and everything in the room turning to the bartender herrington said bring us another round of whatever hes drinking and make mine a double hes having a pint of stout love the irish barkeep said flirtatiously bob smiled his most charming smile and replied then bring me two of them i dont like the fact that this guys got a head start on me the woman rolled her eyes as she went in search of three new glasses i think she likes you said harvath once the woman was out of earshot hearts and minds its what im all about harvath laughed it was nice to see bob in reasonably good spirits under the smile and devilmaycare attitude though he knew the man was not taking his forced retirement well that was a big part of why harvath was spending the fourth of july weekend in new york city the other part was because at present he didnt have a solid relationship with anyone worth spending the weekend with the only woman harvath could have seen himself with was otherwise engaged quite literally and on her way to marrying someone else as if he could read minds bob wasted no time in asking so hows meg harvath knew the subject was bound to come up both he and bob had been part of a hostage rescue team that had freed meg cassidy from a hijacked airliner just a few years prior because meg had been the only one to see the key hijackers face she had been recruited to help track and id him for termination a good part of her training for the assignment had taken place behind the fence as it was known with bob and several of his colleagues at the delta force compound at fort bragg this time next year you and ill probably be attending her wedding said harvath youve gotta be one of the dumbest people ive ever met you know that good to see you too robert replied harvath as the bartender returned with their beers and set one in front of harvath and two in front of bob after she walked away to take care of another customer bob said meg cassidy is hands down the best woman ive ever seen you with and you let her slip right through your fingers its complicated shes a woman said bob as he took a sip of his stout and let his response hang in the air between them theyre always complicated it was a subject harvath really had no desire to get into its over okay its okay with me if its okay with you its okay with me said harvath centering his beer on its coaster so who are you dating now asked bob nobody herrington smiled so then youre not really okay and its not really over is it give me a break would you at least tell me youre gay seal or no seal you were in the navy after all being gay comes with the territory for you squids what do they say when youre under way gay is okay fuck you replied harvath who then added you know if at any point you want to pull that excessively large nose of yours out of my personal life id be more than happy to discuss what happened in afghanistan this time it was bobs turn to be silent though he hadnt meant to harvath had dragged a piece of sandpaper over a very raw nerve when herrington finally spoke he said how many men did you lose when the president was kidnapped too many yeah said bob nodding his head knowingly it sucks but you know what can be worse harvath shook his head having men under your command seriously maimed and in constant pain thats worse than seeing them die at least when theyre dead theyre not in anguish anymore harvath signaled the bartender to bring him another round and said what happened in afghanistan bob waited until harvath had his beer and after a little more prodding responded we were tasked with taking down a target near herat somehow they must have known we were coming because they hit us first and hit us hardreal hard we had a guy attached to our unit whod messed up his ankle and i was helping hump his load i should have seen that ambush coming but i couldnt i wasnt on point i was the third guy in the column making my way back up to the lead when it happened the two guys in front got it real bad i got off easy compared to them but it doesnt matter because of me all three of us were handed medical retirements you think this is all because you werent on point a team leader leads period thats bullshit bob and you know it said harvath nobody can be on point all the time not even you thats why the position gets rotated but it was my turn to be up front yet you were humping the pack of an injured man you cant do both not anymore apparently shit happens bob not to me it doesnt and not to my team we hadnt even had so much as a hangnail in almost two years and then bang three of us are out one of my guys will never walk again will never be able to make love to his wife and the other ones blind hell never be able to watch his kids grow up all of this because i wasnt up front when i should have been harvath knew bob pretty well and he knew his reputation firsthand in fact most people in the special operations community knew it bob could carry an entire battalion on his back he was an incredible athlete and that athleticism made one of the best soldiers the united states had ever created since the day hed joined the army right out of high school through his time as a ranger and into th group and then delta bob had always led the way it wasnt an ego thing it was just bobyou couldnt hold him back the fact that he was taking the injuries of his teammates so personally was not surprising to harvath that was also the kind of guy bob was it was the way most american soldiers were truth freedom and the american way played well for the cameras but the fact of the matter was that in the frenzied heat of combat you werent fighting for your country you were fighting for the guy right next to you looking his friend in the eyes harvath tried to assuage some of the mans guilt by repeating bob shit happens yeah maybe but its not the way i wanted to go out replied herrington as he paused and took a long swallow of beer i wanted to go out on top i wouldve liked just one more chance to prove not only to my team but to myself that i could still do itthat what happened had nothing to do with me getting old too slow harvath was not going to let this become the tone for the entire weekend bob needed to snap the hell out of it you and your team competed in how many triathlons when you were home last year two and the worst showing you had fifth place harvath pretended to think about it for a moment and then responded you know i think it probably was a good idea for the army to cut you loose after all i mean only two topten international finishes youre obviously on a downhill slide bob wasnt looking at him but harvath could see the faint traces of a smile form on his face and he decided to push the humor a little further jesus christ bob youre forty years old someone oughtta be fitting you for false teeth and a new hip not giving you a gun and sending you out on this nations most dangerous assignments thats what us young guys are for herringtons smile now spread from ear to ear first of all youre only four years younger than i am and second seal or no seal i could whip your ass in a new york minute so dont get cocky youd have a hell of a time meeting women this weekend if i end up dotting both of your eyes for you harvath was about to suggest bob abandon the commando motto of silent swift and deadly in favor of senile slow and deaf when herrington looked up at the television and said thats not good harvath looked up and noticed that several nypd emergency services unit trucks had gathered at the site of the bronx school standoff the esu normally turns out in smaller trucks two per squad continued herrington those big rigs are their rolling armories they dont move those in unless the situation is really bad i count at least four up there that means four squads responding this is no runofthemill hostage situation harvath knew that outside the military the nypds esu was not only the largest fulltime swat response group in the country but also one of its absolute best and while they were all brothers in arms each squad preferred to work alone and only called in backup when it was absolutely necessary scenes of the beslan school massacre in russia began to race through harvaths mind a school was a perfect terrorist target and an attack on one would have an unbelievable impact here in the states harvath often wondered why a terrorist group hadnt tried it yet the media coverage as well as the communal american heartache would be off the charts he was about to mention this to bob when one of the tv anchors cut in with two additional breaking news storiesa fire at new york city mayor david browns emergency operations command center in brooklyn and a sniper targeting aircraft out at laguardia in queens after listening to the reports herrington shook his head if i didnt know better id think that somebody was skimming the cream that school standoff in the bronx has got to be one hell of an assault to get that many esu squads there just like beslan said harvath for all we know bob continued more squads are already en route then theres the airport theyve got that place so gridded out they know every rooftop draw and grassy knoll within a twomile radius that could accommodate a shooter anyone able to get inside that perimeter and stir up this kind of trouble has got to be a pro or this all might be just one really shitty day in new york i dont know cmon bob why would somebody want to tie up all those tactical teams at that moment the tv station cut back to footage of the raging fire at the mayors emergency operations command center beneath the brooklyn bridge and herrington replied maybe for the same reason somebody would want to take out the citys backup commandandcontrol facility you dont seriously think this is part of some larger attack do you asked harvath who knows but if you dont mind id rather not be sitting in a bar in the middle of times square if it happens ten despite both the airconditioning and the antiperspirant his handler had insisted he wear nassir hamals purple polo shirt clung to his sweatcovered body all of the martyrs had been offered drugsvalium to be specificin order to help them remain calm when the time came the mullah from the mosque in new jersey who had counseled them had assured them that taking the drugs would in no way jeopardize their entry into paradise though several of the others accepted the offer and tested the pills in advance to gauge their effects nassir had refused he was confident that when the time came he would meet his end with a heart made strong by his love of islam but now as nassir sat in the interminable traffic along th street with nothing but his thoughts and a broken fm radio to keep him company he wasnt so sure looking at the cell phone on the seat beside him he considered calling his handler but then decided against it they had stayed up all night together praying reading verses from the koran and talking about paradise as the others slept his handler had become almost like an older brother to him confiding in the younger man that the prophet mohammed himself may peace be upon him had visited the handler in his sleep and had instructed him that nassir be given one of the most important and most difficult of the assignments it was an honor that nassir accepted with the utmost sincerity and obligation to duty though he had not been allowed to say a proper goodbye to his mother and sister both of whom had immigrated to the united states with him ten years prior he hoped they would understand he also hoped they would appreciate the annuity his handler had said each of the families of the martyrs would be receiving islam took care of its ownan attribute nassir saw sorely lacking in the culture of the west regardless of how his family felt in his heart nassir knew he was doing the right thing when he had been approached in his mosque on the north side of chicago and asked if he wanted to study with a very wise and learned imam visiting the city nassir had jumped at the chance disenchanted with a failed business a failed marriage and what he saw as his downtrodden american existence he had looked everywhere until he found the one thing that filled the emptiness inside himislam in time he had thrown out his record collection had stopped smoking and was chastising his younger sister on a daily basis about the evils of dancing the type of friends she associated herself with and the revealing american clothes she wore one day she finally worked up the nerve to suggest that if he didnt like america and its ways then maybe he should go back to their home country nassir had seriously considered it had even saved for a plane ticket and made arrangements to stay with extended family once he got back but then the imam had come into his life after they had gotten to know each other he had suggested another ideaone that would require him to place the greater glory of allah above his own selfpity and selfserving desires as the traffic started moving again nassir swung the counterfeit fedex van onto third avenue and headed south a few blocks later he saw his target without even thinking he began reciting the special verses from the koran that all of his fellow martyrs had been given to provide strength and courage for the moments aheadthe last moments any of them would ever know eleven it was now and out on the street most people were oblivious to anything but getting started with their holiday weekend as he and herrington walked away from times square harvath tried to make sense of what they were doing a healthy bit of paranoia was a prerequisite in their business but at what point did it become too much the rational side of harvaths brain said leaving a perfectly wellstocked bar and an aboveaverage looking bartender was that point but his gut said bob might be right on the money where are we going he asked pointing south down broadway bob said times square has gotta be pretty high on the terrorist hit parade i know a good restaurant not far from the va lets go there thevayouve spent enough time there as it is dont you get sick of being anywhere near there youd be surprised its not your grandfathers va anymore scot theyve come a long way sterilize the instruments and everything now do they even better if they amputate a limb you get two bullets instead of one to bite on at least bob hadnt lost his sense of humor what about my truck asked harvath seeing a cab that had just dropped off its fare herrington made a beeline for it and said leave it well come back and pick it up later as they drove harvath looked out the window at the hordes of people crowding the sidewalks and his mind wandered back to the news reports theyd been watching in the pig amp whistle taken as isolated incidents the events unfolding just outside manhattan were indeed serious though nothing to panic about but when you lumped them together as a whole they were just too coincidentaland coincidences were something neither scot harvath nor bob herrington believed in in fact no one in their line of work did they had been taught to always try to connect the dots and look for a bigger picture even though he was supposed to be on vacation relaxing harvath couldnt stop thinking about what bob had said and so repeated his earlier question lets say youre right about whats going on across the river why do you think someone would want to tie up all of those tactical teams i can think of about a million answers replied bob as he eyeballed a graffiticovered truck idling outside a nearby bank and none of them have a happy ending but if you break this down into its simplest parts the reason youd want to tie up tactical teams is to prevent them from interfering with your objective or your egress right as their cab sped up bobs eyes moved to a group of taxi drivers who had doubleparked near a falafel stand and were chatting animatedly to one another so so if you were a suicide bomber or were going to fly a plane into a building you wouldnt care about tactical teams by the time they knew what you were doing theoretically it would be too late it depends on what you were doing what if you werent a suicide bomber or planning on flying a plane into a building what if you had other plans harvath looked back out his window and asked like what i dont know replied herrington i just saw all that stuff happening on tv and it gave one of those uhoh feelings old habits are hard to break bob smiled thats better said harvath as he decided to change the subject they were both a little too on edge now am i going to be able to get that shot of louis xiii you owe me at this place were going probably not for that well need to find you some highend gay bar but maybe therell be some cute navy guys there you can hook up with harvath gave his friend the finger and bob laughed below th street the traffic began to back up and herrington started giving the driver directions fifteen minutes later as they crawled down th the cabs radio erupted with terrified voices shouting in a language neither harvath nor herrington understood when scot asked what was happening the driver stammered the queensboro bridge what about it it just exploded twelve long island expressway tim and marcy didnt mind driving the girls into the city in fact they actually preferred it this way the girls could have a few drinks and not have to worry about who was driving home as they drove they could see that the fiveoclock traffic coming out of manhattan was bumpertobumper as people fled to places like fire island the hamptons and montauk point tim looked over at marcy and she could immediately read his mind thank god we wont have to be sitting in that she said the girls had given them the entire rundown on what they planned to do first they were going to hit soho for shopping and then meet up later with some of their friends for dinner at a trendy new restaurant in chelsea after that there was a hot new club in midtown they wanted to hit but they didnt want to be there too early heaven forbid they be the first ones there so it had been decided that if upon the initial driveby there wasnt already a line in front theyd kill time at a spot they all liked on th called town theyd have a glass or two of wine and then try the club again later though marcy had been cool about letting the girls listen to whatever they liked in the car she facetiously begged five minutes of forgiveness as she changed the radio over to wcbs to get a local read on traffic she wasnt a worrier by nature but with what was going on in the bronx brooklyn and queens marcy wanted to make extra sure they were steering well clear of any potential tieups according to wcbs it looked like smooth sailing down to the williamsburg bridge and across into lower manhattan so marcy switched the radio back to power and focused on the drive the girls laughed gossiped and lamented their last summer of real freedom before graduating from yaleall the while acting as if the two adults sitting up front werent even there that was okay with tim and marcy they were more than used to being ignored when they hit the williamsburg bridge traffic began to tighten up marcy put up with it for as long as she could but it was maddening once she had enough space to slide over into the left lane she signaled and made her move about six car lengths later she could see why traffic was moving so slowly an ugly paperbag brown utility truck labeled birchman landscaping was going at least fifteen miles an hour below the speed limit while everyone else was trying to do at least twenty over marcy rolled her eyes at tim and he responded dont even say it just watch replied marcy as she pulled alongside the truck sitting inside were two darkskinned males probably mexicans i told you she said give it a rest marcy it takes all kinds to make up the world i know it does the germans are the fast drivers the italians the crazy ones and the mexicans are the slow ones i resent that replied tim im italian and thats why im driving i rest my case tim smiled marcy would never change ill tell you what he said that trucks got to be the ugliest color ive ever seen youd think landscapers would be a little more creative wouldnt you paint some flowers on that thing or something now it was marcys turn to smile sometimes she thought tim had missed his calling in life he really was pretty artistic although she figured that must come with being italian caravaggio da vinci michelangeloall italians oh check this out tim added you work for birchman and you not only get an ugly truck and matching uniforms but they give you matching watches as well marcy looked out the passengerside window and saw the men looking at their watches they must be late for their next appointment thats why theyre in such a hurry tim stifled a chuckle he couldnt help it though marcy was often a little too offcolor for his taste she could be pretty funny it used to bother him but theyd been together for so long now that hed come to accept it as part of who she was marcy pressed down on the accelerator and as she passed the landscaping truck said how do you like that tim leaned forward trying to see what she was looking at out her window what theres another one of those landscaping trucks stuck in traffic the other way where we just passed it boy would i like to have a piece of that action their trucks are everywhere and at this time of year they must be making a killing moments later an enormous explosion detonated behind them the girls screamed as the windows shattered and marcy lost control of the suv there was the horrible wrenching sound of metal on metal followed by a deafening crash as everything went black thirteen lake geneva wisconsin jack rutledge had always been of the mind that pilots and presidents shouldnt be seen drinking at least not in the afternoon there was something too unnerving about it so even though he would have enjoyed a nice vodka and tonic right about now and despite the fact that he was technically on vacation he stuck to his arnold palmers as he sipped his half lemonade half iced tea he reflected that there were few places in the united states he enjoyed as much as lake geneva he couldnt understand why he hadnt discovered it sooner his old college roommate rodger cummings a successful real estate developer from chicago had bought a home here three years ago and already the president had been to visit six times it had been his retreat during the rigorous campaignthe place he came for a day or two of rest to get away from it all and continued to be his preferred getaway more so than even camp david the area was referred to as the hamptons of the midwest and though it was an extremely beautiful place to visit in the summer the president found that there really was no bad time to visit his love of lake geneva was a bit ironic as just across the lake from where he now stood was the home of the deceased industrialist donald fawcett who had orchestrated his kidnap several years ago it was also the home in which two united states senators who had conspired with fawcett had met a very grisly end watching the sailboats and assorted pleasure craft crisscrossing the lake the president was glad hed taken his old roommate up on his most recent invitation there was something instantly soothing about arriving here the lake seemed to have a profound effect on him and allowed him to put the cares and concerns of being the leader of the free world on hold as he focused simply on being jack rutledge the man he had brought along a stack of novels that he couldnt wait to dive into unfortunately he wouldnt be able to do that until tomorrow after the daily presidential briefing that happened every morning no matter where in the world he was right now though he had to sing for his supper as his old friend had put it it was just a small gathering only about fifty people many of whom thanks to cummingss fundraising prowess had been major contributors to his recent presidential campaign cocktails and light hors doeuvres and then he was off the hook then he could really relax for the next three days the only thing that would have made the holiday weekend perfect was if his daughter amanda had been there with him but it was summertime she was growing up and she had friends of her own knowing the president would be tired rodger had been kind enough to start the party early the brilliant white pier in front of the large house which had once belonged to an illinois railroad tycoon jutted out into the warm springfed waters of the lake it had been tastefully decorated by mrs cummings with fresh flowers potted palms and small wicker lanterns the guests stood talking on the end of the pier near a group of bright blue adirondack chairs as well as on the expansive aft deck of the estates magnificent sixtyfoot steamship the jolly rodger rutledge made it a point to invite meg cassidy who was also a chicago resident and lake geneva homeowner to the estate whenever he came to town meg had done a particularly significant service to her country when as a civilian she had agreed to help track down one of the worlds most dangerous terrorists without her ability to id the faceless terrorist the united states might never have stopped him meg brought along her new fiancé and while he seemed a decent enough man he definitely didnt have the charisma of scot harvath the president had always been sorry that the two of them hadnt been able to work things out they still seemed perfectly suited for each other but with the demands of both of their careers he also saw that their breakup just might have been inevitable the trio was enjoying a pleasant conversation when the head of the presidents security detail carolyn leonard discreetly approached she apologized for the interruption and then whispered into the presidents ear immediately rutledges entire body stiffened im sorry he said shaking first megs hand and then her fiancés a situation has come up and i have to leave i hope its not serious said meg but the president had already been joined by several more agents from his secret service detail and was being escorted off the jolly rodger whats going on carolyn asked rutledge as he looked over and saw the wetsuited seal team that augmented his maritime activities surface with their weapons at the ready new york has been hit replied leonard what do you mean hit i have very few details at this point mr president i think it would be better if your own people briefed you on that once were in the air rutledge didnt want to wait until they were in the air he wanted answers now especially considering the fact that his daughter was spending the holiday weekend with friends on long island but as he turned to put the question of amandas wellbeing to his chief secret service agent the rotors of his rapidly approaching helicopter quickly made talking impossible fourteen new york city with traffic at an absolute standstill harvath threw twenty bucks onto the front seat of the cab and he and bob jumped out according to herrington they were only about six blocks away from the va and so they decided to make that their destination in every bar and restaurant they ran past people were glued to the televisions and scenes of the devastating explosion on the queensboro bridge when they arrived at the va the lobby was in chaos everyone including the va police was huddled around the television sets bob led harvath through the crowd and upstairs to the office of dr sam hardy hardy was in his late forties tall and fit he was balding and had a look in his eyes that suggested hed been around the block more than a few times hardy looked up from the tv set on his desk when harvath and herrington entered and said to bob it looks like multiple attacks multiple asked harvath as bob introduced him to dr hardy we just heard about the queensboro bridge there have been more hardy nodded his head the reports are just starting to come in but it looks like all of the bridges and all of the tunnels into and out of manhattan have been hit harvath was at a loss for words he stood there with his mouth agape as they watched the television on hardys desk finally he stated i guess now maybe we know why they wanted to draw off the tactical teams and why they wanted to take out the emergency operations center added bob as he turned to hardy and asked have you heard from anybody else no replied hardy but i think theyll start showing up here real soon who are you talking about harvath asked herrington ignored him and said to hardy can i borrow your keycard what for i want to take scot up to the roof and get a look at whats going on ill go with you said the doctor i want to get a look too let me just leave a note in case anyone comes by while were up there up on the roof they could see enormous clouds of smoke coming from the direction of the queensboro as well as several other points around the city down on the street people were in a panic many of them sprinting down rd street toward the east river presumably so that they could get a better view of what had happened to the queensboro and williamsburg bridges for what seemed like an eternity no one on the roof spoke they were dumbfounded as they stood there taking in the horror and devastation bridges and tunnels harvath finally said and at the beginning of one of our busiest holiday weekends how many dead are we going to be looking at thousands tens of thousands at least replied dr hardy shaking his head at least as they stood taking it in not one of them needed to draw the parallel to that warm september morning in when a handful of hijackers brought the twin towers crashing to the ground they were all feeling the same thingthe fear the confusion and finally the bitter anger that the enemies of america had once again been able to rain such death and destruction down on so many innocent people alqaeda bob said almost beneath his breath harvath knew he was right the attacks had alqaedas fingerprints all over them distract and then flank with multiple coordinated attacks it was ripped right from their playbook harvaths thoughts of leaving government service and going into the private sector suddenly seemed much less pressing what he wanted at this point more than anything else was justicea shot to get even and he knew that bob herrington felt exactly the same way as they stood watching plumes of grayblack smoke twist into the late afternoon sky the roof door slammed open and three figures emerged they were just as bob had described them in his emails and harvath had no problem recognizing them are you all okay asked hardy as the newcomers approached they hit everything exclaimed paul morgan a darkhaired twentyfouryearold who stood about five feet eleven his preppy outfit of neatly pressed khakis and a crisp linen shirt stood in sharp contrast to the heavy bronx accent he had grown up with when morgan said the word everything it came out everreeting every bridge and every tunnel doc they nailed them all we dont know exactly what theyve hit paul lets just calm down here replied hardy morgans right doc said tracy hastings a twentysixyearold woman whose blond hair was braided into two pigtails it was a look harvath had always liked pigtails were for little girls but when big girls wore them there was something sexy as hell about it and just as bob had said hastings was in incredible shape she was obsessed with working out and she had sculpted her fivefootseveninch frame into a work of art normally harvath was not drawn to women who were as buff or maybe even more so than he was but there was something very attractive about her that he just couldnt put his finger on tracy must have noticed harvath looking her over because she turned her face away as she continued its all over the tv they hit every bridge and every tunnelsome of them more than once redundancy added rick cates the third and final member of their party he stood at least six feet three inches tall with dark eyes a shaved head and a tshirt that read guns dont kill people i kill people this is the exact attack weve all been talking about he added with a look on his face that mirrored the mix of rage and frustration that they were all feeling hardy tried to calm them down we dont know whats going on so lets just take a deep breath okay every bridge into and out of manhattan has been blown insisted hastings and you want us to just calm down yes replied hardy everybody just stop a second harvath didnt understand what the doctors connection with them was but they all seemed to listen to him including herrington after the moment of forced silence hardy formally introduced corporal paul morgan united states marine corps lieutenant tracy hastings united states navy and sergeant rick cates united states army as harvath finished shaking hands a blueandwhite nypd bell ep helicopter roared right past the rooftop it was so close that through the open cabin door they could see an nypd sniper armed with one of the departments highendcaliber rifles which was capable of taking out targets over a mile away hoorah bellowed morgan as he pumped his fist in the air go get those fuckers like spectators in a oneway tennis match all their heads swung northward to watch the chopper as it raced up the east river toward the smoldering queensboro bridge whether thered be anybody left worth getting once they got there was anybodys guess but as soldiers they all appreciated the sight of fellow warriors going into battle especially ones with an immediate opportunity to avenge an egregious wrong so in need of righting the helicopter was out over the middle of the east river rapidly closing the distance to the bridge when a white contrail of smoke suddenly appeared in the sky cates was the first one to process what they were seeing and as if the pilot of the chopper had any chance of hearing him he yelled rpg fifteen abdul ali didnt need to hear the explosion to know that it had happened he had almost a sixth sense for these things especially when working with such highly trained soldiers the chechens were exceptional and had been an inspired choice with their hair cut short and their faces cleanshaven they drew much less attention than arabs would have though they were the most expensive element of the operation their russian spetsnaz special forces training was worth every penny so far the troll had proven to know exactly what he was doing while ali had been concerned with using only two specific subterfuges to detonate the bridges and tunnels the trolls plan to use fake landscaping trucks as well as vans disguised as federal express vehicles had worked even if one of them had been selected for a random police inspection bags of fertilizer would not seem out of place for a landscaping business and no nypd or port authority officer would have had the audacity to open any of the fedex packagesunless they suspected one of the drivers but ali had selected only his best operatives for this most important of martyrdom operations they had spent their last evening on earth shaving the hair from their bodies reading the koran and ritually cleansing themselves for their entrance into paradise even the handful he had worried about losing their nerve had carried out their assignments perfectly his martyrs had served both him and allah well based on what they were hearing over the radio their efforts to make all of the bridges and tunnels including those used for the subway and path trains impassable had exceeded even alis best expectations random sniper and rocketpropelledgrenade fire would now bring all helicopter airplane boat and ferry traffic above and around manhattan to a standstill all law enforcement and emergency services personnel would now be totally engaged and it would be some time before they could be reinforced which was exactly what the terrorists wanted allah had blessed their entire undertaking their two black suvs with tinted windows and visormounted police strobe lights purchased over the internet now roared up onto the sidewalk in front of a brownstone on west th street a brass plaque in front read transcon enterprises with enviable military precision the heavily armed and armored occupants of the two tahoes poured out and took up defensive firing positions from their boots to their balaclavas they were clad completely in black except for the large patches they wore on their uniforms falsely identifying them as members of the fbis hostage rescue team or hrt for short as half of the team raced to secure the side entrance the rest dashed up the front steps disabled the video surveillance cameras and affixed a large plastic explosive shape charge to the front door yelling a warning to the others the men in front took cover and detonated the plastique their colleagues at the side entrance did the same and with an assortment of fully automatic weapons up and at the ready they all poured into the building though the grayhaired chainsmoking receptionist inside immediately went for her beretta subcompact she wasnt fast enough bullets tore through her body as half of the tactical team made a sweep through the lobby and the others fanned out over the rest of the threestory building they eliminated every transcon employee they sawboth the men and women many of whom poured out of offices and cubicles brandishing pistols and even a couple of shortbarreled machine guns less than four minutes after the killing began the teams weapons fell silent a fog of cordite hung in the air ali removed his balaclava and radioed his men as their situation reports came in none contained the response he wanted to hear there was no sign of mohammed bin mohammed anywhere in the building as one of the men placed the electronic devices the troll had explained would make the americans believe each facility was still functioning ali quietly cursed and looked at his watch reloading his weapon he tried to compute how long it would take to make it to midtown sixteen rooftop east th street what do you mean you cant get a helicopter in here demanded mike jaffe as he gripped his encrypted satellite phone so tight it threatened to crack thats bullshit im telling you right now if you dont find a way then our angels feet are going to end up touching the ground jaffe listened for several moments to the yelling on the other end of his phone and replied negative they can come in black after nightfall and lift us out if not im going to make other arrangements do we understand each other with that jaffe hung up and tossed the sat phone to his number two in command a tall ruggedly built twentyfiveyearold marine sergeant named brad harper no go on the evac asked harper as he tucked the sat phone into the back pocket of his jeans apparently theyre not yet one hundred percent convinced that the attacks are connected to our pal downstairs youve got to be kidding me theyre the ones who informed us about the intercept in the first place alqaeda knows hes here they know hes in new york we dont know that they know hes in this building so what are we supposed to do for the time being we stay put an nypd helicopter was just brought down by sniper fire so now the air space above manhattan is officially frozen until further notice lets go out by water jaffe shook his head nypd port authority and coast guard craft have all come under heavycaliber sniper fire as well on both the east river and the hudson theyve also been ordered to pull back until further notice then were not going to get any reinforcements it doesnt look like it so whats the plan we run this just the way we rehearsed it replied jaffe full battle dress and weld the doors shut on our floor and then jaffe looked at harper and said and then we turn up the heat on our prisoner and get the information we need out of him before its too late seventeen when harvaths blackberry rang he was still in a state of shock though nearly every civilian in new york city would find it impossible to use their cell phone at this moment because of the overloaded system harvaths worked because it was tied to a special government program that granted priority access in times of crisis or emergency excusing himself he walked to the other side of the roof harvath he said raising the device to his ear scot thank god replied his boss gary lawlor where are you in manhattan twentythird and first on the roof of the va medical center what can you tell me about whats going on there were under attack thats whats going on here i just saw an nypd helicopter blown out of the sky by an rpg and from what ive heard all the bridges and tunnels into and out of manhattan have also been destroyed thats exactly what were hearing here at dhs all available local state and federal assets have been dispatchedmarine units aviation you name it theyre revving into fullblown searchandrescue mode right now if you want me to suit up responded harvath just tell me where i need to be lawlor pulled a paper from his desk and said there have been explosions at air traffic control radar stations in new york and new jersey which have knocked the atc system offline in your area based on the intel im seeing im worried that whoever did this may have a secondary agenda you think theyre trying to pull another we have no idea when the sniper situation broke out at laguardia the faa started diverting flights but anything is possible since youre there we need you to figure out whats going on how am i supposed to do that i dont know from what i hear its already anarchy in new york theyve got a lot of good people on the job but their coordination is falling apart just like on everyones rushing to the nearest attack site to try to help pull out survivors the overwhelming number of sites is breaking down response capabilities i wont be able to get you any support at least not right now considering the magnitude of the attacks harvath wasnt surprised but he needed more information to go on gary there are eight million people in new york city who am i looking for and what is the target a communication was intercepted earlier today in it was a reference to allahs bombmaker who had been brought against his will and in violation of international lawto new york city thats impossible said harvath no one could have put something like this together that fast we grabbed sayed jamal this morning how would anyone know we have him much less where we have him thats what you need to find out responded lawlor i want you to question jamal yourself if this turns out to be an alqaeda operation theres a good chance he had a hand in planning or training the people involved either way he may know the end game hes in jttf custody now why dont we let their interrogators handle it because somebody had to have leaked the fact that we grabbed him and have him in new york thats why until we can identify and plug that leak i cant trust anyone else but you on this is that clear have you tried reaching the president replied harvath who could tell by the tone of his voice that gary lawlor was just as angry as he was of course ive tried but dcs just as chaotic as new york right now apparently he was someplace in wisconsin but now theyre rushing him to air force one listen we both know that hes going to be locked down so tight only his closest people will have access to him for the next several hours were on our own and im giving you a direct order lean on jamal as hard as you have to i dont want any more people to die well worry about the consequences of the interrogation later that was all harvath needed to hear but convincing the jttf to allow him to conduct the kind of interrogation on their prisoner that he wanted to conduct even after todays events was something that harvath thought was going to be a lot easier said than done eighteen air force one a president needed to be able to separate his personal life from his professional but right now jack rutledge couldnt do it he had never made any excuses about being a father first and a president second since he had lost his wife to breast cancer several years ago his daughter amanda was all he had left and right now he didnt even know if he had that anything asked the president the minute carolyn leonard entered his private suite at the front of the custom boeing still nothing yet sir im sorry she replied hows that possible they were in two cars correct yes sir and you havent been able to reach either of them no sir but amanda and her friends were riding with marcy delacorte and tim fiore i picked them myself as the lead agents for your daughters detail theyre the best im sure well hear something soon the president wanted to ask her how soon but it would have been inappropriate to burden her with his fears he needed to remain strong besides he knew carolyn was already doing everything she could in the end though there was only so much that could be done for the time being they were both helpless anything from the local authorities theyve got the route into manhattan that the detail was traveling as well as the last gps coordinates for their vehicles well find her mr president i promise you thank you carolyn replied rutledge let me know the minute you hear anything i will sir replied agent leonard as she backed out of the suite so she could buckle up for takeoff because this was supposed to be a vacation the president had left his staff back in dc so they could be with their families over the holiday weekend that meant that as he tried to focus his attention on new york city he was going to have to tackle everything via secure video links from his airborne office hed learned early on that the first hurdle in a situation of this magnitude was separating fact from fiction much like the hours following the september th attacks rumors were running rampant across the country and emergency action plans were being put into effect left and right all anyone knew for sure was that america was under attack again after being briefed over the video link by his chief of staff charles anderson during the planes taxi and takeoff the president replied thats it thats all we know were still trying to gather information sir how the hell is that possible chuck the flow is pretty slow coming out of new york i thought after september eleventh we put procedures in place to change all that we did replied anderson but with any occurrence like this there is a certain amount of event resonance meaning meaning no matter how good our procedures are for transmitting data human beings have to snap out of their shock assess the situation and pass it up the chain of command it just takes time the president didnt like that answer especially when thousands of lives were hanging in the balance including his daughters thats not good enough weve got people injured and dying theyre trapped on bridges theyre trapped down in tunnels choked with smoke and fire and theyre trying to stay afloat in the hudson and east rivers if we dont start communicating properly those people wont have a chance and i cant have that the american people wont stand for it not after i dont care how many asses you have to kick put your boots on and start kicking damn it we put those response systems in place for a reason we were supposed to have learned from our mistakes so lets start acting like it understood yes mr president replied anderson good said rutledge now when can i talk to the mayor it could be some time his emergency command center was targeted in a runup to the attacks and were having trouble locating him the president threw up his hands in disgust i dont believe it what about the governor hes en route from albany right now but he knows even less than we do do you want me to get him on the line and patch him through no i want to talk to mayor brown first i want to hear from him how his people are doing and what they need i dont want things being filtered through the governor that was a big part of the problem with new orleans there is a chain of command sir not with something like this i want you to track down the mayor and put him through to me as soon as possible now so far we have no intelligence that any other cities have been targeted correct yes sir that is correct i guess we can thank god for that said rutledge as he laid his briefing folder onto the table in front of him and massaged his face with both hands what about an appearance i think right now that would be a little premature said anderson premature chuck people are panicked said a voice from next to the chief of staff the camera pulled back to show geoff mitchell the presidents press secretary they need the president to reassure them and it needs to be done sooner rather than later reassure them of what we have no idea whats going on in new york we cant control it and we have absolutely no idea whos behind it i hardly think any of thats reassuring you cant keep the president walled off chuck it doesnt matter that he doesnt have all the answers yet people need to see him thats all they need to hear him say everything is going to be all right hell if we play this right it might even be okay for him to admit he doesnt have all the answers yet but that hes working very hard to get to the bottom of whats happened and then of course he needs to state unequivocally that america s response to this barbarism will be swift sure and severe we can talk about releasing a videotaped statement once we decide where the president is headed after mountain home air force base stated the chief of staff were not going to idaho replied rutledge were on our way back to dc mr president began anderson i dont think that chuck you said it yourself no other cities have been targeted my place is in the white house america needs leadership right now ive already okayed putting the continuity of government plan into action but other than that nothing else changes do we understand each other yes sir the president then addressed his press secretary geoff i want you to start drafting some remarks keep them short chuck is right at this point we dont know a lot and the less we say the better let the networks know that ill be making a live statement as soon as i get back to the white house i think that about does it lets get to work mr president said robert hilliman the presidents secretary of defense from his secure link at the dod if i could have a moment of your time in private please sir go ahead bob replied the president once he had gone into private conference mode what is it well there are some concerns about an intelligence intercept we had this morning what about it apparently reference was made to the united states abducting a foreign national and bringing him here against his will in direct violation of international law this is nothing new bob we hear this stuff all the time especially since all of the press on our extraordinary rendition policy broke i know mr president but this is different different how they could be talking about any one of thousands of people weve detained this conversation made clear that the person in question was a bombmaker who had been brought to new york which means said the president trailing off it could only be one of two people both of whom weve got at the same location with no effective way to protect or evacuate nineteen federal plaza joint terrorist task force harvath looked at the jttf duty officer and exclaimed what do you mean you dont have him we dont have him the young man blasted back like many others he was not dealing well with the stress of the terrorist attacks maybe hes already been processed offered herrington trying to prevent the situation from escalating into an allout interagency pissing match did you check with the federal house of detention on west street what am i new replied the duty officer of course i checked they havent heard of him either harvath was about to come unglued they had covered the entire twoandahalfmile distance to the jttf headquarters at the fbi field office in lower manhattan on foot and now some rookie was telling him that not only did they not have sayed jamal but that nobody had ever heard of him i want you to find mike jaffe right now who said the duty officer what do you have sand in your ears mike jaffe i transferred the prisoner in question to him and a team of agents from this office this morning the young man was tired of having his valuable time wasted by some dhs knuckledragger youve got your agencies screwed up agent harvath none of our guys were involved in a prisoner transfer this morning and we dont have anyone in this officejttf fbi or otherwisenamed mike jaffe it was like banging his head against a brick wall harvaths blood was beginning to boil and he was getting very near his breaking point he needed to go over this kids head and was about to do so when bob thanked the duty officer for his help grabbed harvaths arm and steered him out of the jttf and into the stairwell whats the matter with you demanded harvath shut up replied herrington the hell i will ive got to find sayed jamal and your getting in my way like that isnt going to they dont have him or so says the dumb ass at the front desk sometimes youve gotta go higher up the food chain to get answers well you are going higher up the food chain all right because mike jaffe doesnt work for the joint terrorism task force herrington replied hes with dia the defense intelligence agency bob nodded his head i met him in afghanistan back in my unit was assigned to a very highspeed task force going after the top of the alqaeda leadership and mike jaffe was a part of that task force asked harvath he was in charge of it so why the hell would he pose as a jttf agent we had a saying that both the lord and the dia work in mysterious ways obviously he had a very personal interest in your prisoner a little too personal said harvath as he began walking down the stairs where are you going to make a phone call then im going to find mike jaffe if i have to turn this entire city inside out twenty it was the tapping at his window that caused tim fiore to snap back into consciousness his reflexes kicked in and in a flash he had his sig sauer drawn and pointed deadon at the threat mister the bridge is going to collapse youve gotta get the hell out of here a stranger yelled from the other side of the glass fiores head hurt like hell it felt like someone had smacked him with a lead pipe for a moment he didnt know where he was then slowly it started coming back to him on the ground he yelled at the man on the fucking groundnow terrified the good samaritan fled for his life though he was a seasoned secret service agent nothing could have prepared fiore for what he saw when he turned and looked over his shoulder the entire back half of the armored vehicle theyd been traveling in was gone evaporated it had taken the sliding gun drawers beneath the cargo area along with the third row of seats where agents grossi and swartley had been sitting an enormous piece of twisted metal that looked like a pitchfork had pierced the second row of seats impaling both of amanda rutledges friends amanda was unconscious but tim didnt see any wounds he reached for her and felt for a pulse it was weak but at least she was alive for how much longer though he couldnt tell fiore looked over at his partner whose chin was slumped against her chest marcy he said as he felt for her pulse marcy can you hear me there was no response twisting out of his seatbelt fiore kicked his door open and began yelling into his radio this is echo one weve been hit i repeat echo one has been hit all units respond over hopping out of the suv fiore scanned for threats as he came around to the rear passenger door where the hell was the other secret service vehicle it should have been right behind them it was then that he began noticing the screams screams of terror screams of agony all around cars were overturned and huge sections of the bridge were missing their van had been slammed perpendicularly into the guard rail and judging from the marks on the roof and hood had flipped at least three or four times it was only out of sheer luck they had landed upright and had managed to stay on the bridge at all this wasnt the work of just one bomb there had to have been at least two probably more the injured were everywhere and those who werent wounded sat frozen in their cars wandered aimlessly in shock or ran for their lives fiore tried to open amandas door but it wouldnt budge with the extensive damage their suv had sustained going through the shrapnelridden cargo area was also out of the question he was going to have to go around the other side and pull the presidents daughter over the bodies of her two dead friends as he came around the rear of the vehicle fiore noticed that along with everything else that had evaporated so had their medical trauma bag all that was left was a collapsible litter and being careful not to gash himself he climbed inside and grabbed it he continued to try to raise the other agents as he raced around to the drivers side of the suv because theyd been trained on what to do in case of just such an assassination attempt fiore was able to react almost without even thinking about it yanking the rear driversside door open fiore crawled in as far as he could go gently he unbuckled the first daughter supported her neck as best he could and backed out of the suv guiding her around the jagged edges of the steel pitchfork that had eviscerated her friends until he could lay her down on the litter with two enormous holes behind them and being nearer to the manhattan side of the bridge tim scanned the nearby buildings for a safe haven his training dictated that he get amanda to high ground as soon as possible where he could better control their situation and hold out until their helicopter could arrive trying the secret service command post he said skybox this is echo one do you copy over roger that echo one came the response from the command post what is your status weve been hit at least two vehicleborne explosives timed to coincide with our route echo two is gone weve got two agents missing from our vehicle a third unconscious and the package has been damaged request you initiate operation upswing immediately over negative echo one no can do said the command center control agent all bridges and tunnels into and out of manhattan have been hit weve got a report of an nypd helicopter down possibly due to hostile fire until further notice nyc airspace is too hot and has been shut down is your vehicle operable over all the bridges and tunnels how the hell could that be possible as incomprehensible as it was there was no time to even try to make sense of it now negative replied fiore our vehicle has been totaled over echo one stand by over said the voice stand by was this guy nuts they were completely vulnerable out in the open like this and fiore wasnt convinced that they just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time what if there was a secondary attempt on amandas life in progress right at this moment while watching the pandemonium around them he bent down and checked her pulse again though each protective detail had a medical agent as part of the team they all had gone through extensive medical training fiore suspected that if amanda didnt get help soon she wasnt going to make it skybox we need to evac now over stand by echo one over repeated the controller fiore was about to tell the controller what he could do with his stand bys when he heard someone coming around the front of the vehicle instantly he moved his body to shield amanda rutledge while raising his pistol and applying pressure to the trigger the next thing he saw was a gun as it swung around the front bumper he knew ita secondary attack he was about to pull the trigger the rest of the way when he heard jesus tim dont shoot its me marcy twentyone you scared the hell out of me fiore said as he lowered his pistol whyd you come around the front of the vehicle because my door was jammed and yours was open replied marcy a little unsteady on her feet what happened terrorists with multiple vehicle bombs apparently all the bridges and tunnels in and out of manhattan have been hit echo two is unresponsive and grossi and swartley are gone gone our vehicle took a pretty bad hit marcy looked down at the presidents daughter and referred to her by her codename hows goldilocks shes alive which is more than we can say for her girlfriends delacorte peered into the backseat and felt like she was about to retch it was a gruesome sight as she regained her composure she began to ask about their plan of action but fiore stopped her he had a transmission coming over his earpiece and signaled for her to listen in echo one this is skybox do you copy over roger that skybox we copy over echo one we want you to evacuate the package to the west end of the bridge immediately when you get there find a secure location and dig in were mobilizing our tactical team and will get them to you asap over marcy who had now bent down to examine amanda responded negative skybox the package needs immediate medical theres no time to wait for the tac team over echo one ambulances have been dispatched to multiple attack sites including your location can you get the package to the west end of the bridge and seek medical attention there over will do echo one out replied delacorte who then looked up at tim and said how do you want to play this let me get us some muscle so we can walk shotgun ill be right back removing his credentials fiore ran up to two large men who had just helped extricate a woman from her badly damaged car and said us secret service i have a priority injury i need your help with over here the men followed tim back to where amanda rutledge lay on the litter next to the sheared suv she dont look so good one of them commented are you sure you want to be moving her we dont have a choice replied marcy if we dont get her to help soon shes going to die youre the boss said the other man as he waved his buddy to the rear of the litter while he grabbed the handles near amandas head gently now fellas said fiore on three ready one two three the men delicately lifted the litter as tim and marcy took up security positions on either side looking down again at the young woman who lay unconscious on the litter one of the men remarked hey is this who i think it is marcy was about to respond when there came the sound of groaning metal followed by cries of terror the group turned to see the number seven subway train on the upper deck behind them teetering on the edge of an enormous blast hole that revealed the river below and sky above a moment later there was the horrible sound of metal scraping on metal as subway cars tumbled one after the other through the hole on the upper deck straight down through the hole on the vehicle level and then plunged toward the east river below it was one of the most horrific sights any of them had ever seen as if that wasnt bad enough suddenly the bridge beneath their feet began to shake violently large pieces of metal buckled and yawed as the structure prepared to meet its watery death not a man to mince words tim fiore looked at his group and yelled run twentytwo washington dc this is a real bad time to be asking me for favors stan caldwell the exhausted fortytwoyearold deputy director of the fbi said into the phone whos asking for favors replied gary lawlor who had been both caldwell s mentor and his predecessor before moving over to dhs and the office of international investigative assistance to head its covert counterterrorism initiative known as the apex project im asking you to do your job i am doing my job and im up to my eyebrows in shit right now do you have any idea what the preliminary death toll is coming out of new york city its not good i know ive been getting the same reports you have youre goddamn right its not good stan im not trying to make more work for you he said from his office across town but there are a couple of things here that dont make sense and i need you or somebody in your office to get to the bottom of it for me right now theres nothing to get to the bottom of whoever your guy talked to at the jttf office in new york is wrong thats all there is to it dont bullshit me stan weve got too much history together i want to know what the dias role is in all of this why were they posing as jttf agents for sayed jamals handoff gary im going to tell you one more time and then ive gotta get back to my desk in the sioc the men your agent worked with in upstate new york are jttf plain and simple whoever pegged them as dia is wrong tell your man that if he wants to help out in manhattan i suggest he grab a hard hat attach himself to a searchandrescue team and start digging with that caldwell hung up the phone did he buy it asked fbi director martin sorce i dont think so especially since he had to leave four messages over here before i called him back sorce turned to the other man in the room and said what should we do now from behind his frameless glasses the defense intelligence agencys chief of staff timothy bedford fixed the two fbi men with a steady gaze and replied nothing well handle it from here as bedford stood up to leave he added and gentlemen please remember the national security implications of this issue as far as anyone is concerned our meeting never took place once bedford had left the directors conference room and the door had shut behind him sorce remarked i never did like that guy its no wonder waddell uses him to do his dirty work what does he mean this meeting never took place at least two dozen people saw him come in here what an asshole caldwell smiled the fact that his tie is knotted a bit too tight notwithstanding what are we going to do about this what can we do asked sorce as he stood up from his chair you saw the letter he was carrying from the president weve been told in no uncertain terms to stay out of their operation and in the process lie to people we should be working within particular lawlor whos a former deputy director of the bureau i dont like it either stan but thats the way it is listen weve got too much on our plates now anyway and it could skyrocket if gary is right about a secondary attack said caldwell as his attention was drawn to an urgent message coming in on his pager sorce opened the door of the conference room and nodded to his staff that he was ready to return to the floor of the strategic information and operations center or sioc for a quick morale booster but before he left he turned and said the next several hours are going to be absolutely critical so lets make sure were focused on doing our job which is using anything and anyone at our disposal to stop any further terrorist attacks correct queried caldwell as he looked up from the message on his pager the directors ability to read people was the sine qua non of his successful leadership of the fbi he knew what his deputy was driving at as long as you operate within the framework of the law and remain faithful to your oath of duty youll have my full support even if it means potentially pissing off the president sorce looked caldwell in the eye and said for the record i left the room after i told you to operate within the framework of the law and remain faithful to my oath of duty added caldwell i got it twentythree new york city scot harvath slid his blackberry back into the plastic holder at his waist and said the official word from the fbi is that the jttf duty officer has no idea what hes talking about herrington looked at him and replied he seemed pretty sure of himself to me even so they suggest we find a searchandrescue team and focus our efforts in that direction i think id rather focus my efforts on catching terrorists me too said harvath so where are we apparently on the corner of ignorance and bliss without a goddamn clue why would the fbi cover up the dias involvement in all of this asked herrington who knows i cant figure any of these people out anymore subterfuge on top of subterfuge all wrapped up with prime government red tape its getting harder and harder to believe were all on the same side agent harvath yelled a voice from behind them agent harvath they turned to see the jttf duty officer running out of the revolving door of federal plaza i think i might have something for you he said like what asked herrington nypd picked up a guy at the temporary path station at the world trade center just off church street they think he was supposed to be one of the bombers what makes them think that asked harvath they found him with a backpack full of explosives that failed to go off theres nobody from our office who can get over there right away so ive been authorized to give you first crack at him if you want it authorized by whom stan caldwell deputy director of the fbi as scot and bob walked toward the nypds st precinct on ericsson place the street scenes were surreal on some there were absolutely no signs of life on others entire avenues were taken over by throngs of people still pouring out of lower manhattan making their way north as part of the citys emergency plan the subways had been shut down and many streets were restricted to emergency vehicles only the drivers who were still out searching for a way off the island faced an absolute traffic nightmare with most of their routes blocked by people who had abandoned their vehicles and had fled on foot to make matters worse the sky was obliterated by a smoky haze while a powdery gray ash as if it were the cremated remains of the victims themselves had begun falling across the city harvath though tried to force the macabre scene from his mind by focusing on the matter at hand for some reason stan decided to throw us a bone was all gary had said when harvath called him to relay the update turning to herrington harvath wondered aloud first caldwell says the jttf duty officer doesnt know what hes talking about and then he sends him chasing after us with an interrogation on a silver platter it doesnt make sense theres a little too much fruit in this salad but what do i know replied herrington as far as im concerned we shouldnt look the gift whore in the mouth while chatting with the arresting officers harvath was handed the evidence bag that contained the few items the man was carrying when he was picked up his backpack was with the bomb squad and held nothing of interest other than the explosives that failed to go off scot and bob were shown into the brightly lit interrogation room cuffed to a chipped formica table in the center was a middle eastern man in his earlytomidtwenties his face and arms were covered with cuts and bruises whether the injuries came from having been in the path tunnel when one of his colleagues devices went off or if he had slipped getting into the squad car harvath didnt really care what he wanted was information and he hoped this bomb jockey had something that they could use masaa alkhair said harvath as he pulled the metal chair out from the other side of the table and sat down kayf haalak the man looked up at harvath and spit at his face why were they all spitters herrington who had been trying to up the intimidation factor by leaning against the wall behind the prisoner sprung forward grabbed a handful of his hair and jerked his neck back so that he could stare into the mans face my friend asked you how you were doing it would be polite to respond elif air ab tizak groaned the middle easterner bob who could also speak arabic was familiar with the insult involving the placement of an unfathomable number of male private parts into a certain orifice of his body and responded now with an even less tasteful insult of his own elif air ab dinich the prisoner was enraged with the reference to his religion and struggled to free his head from herringtons grasp bastard fuck you bastard fuck you he yelled over and over again harvath signaled for bob to let go of him and step back upending the evidence bag harvath poured its contents onto the table and said any more spitting and im going to leave you and my friend in here alone for some etiquette lessons understand lawyer give me lawyer the man replied in his broken english that really pissed harvath offjust as much as the fact that there were americans who would fight to the death to see that this piece of shit got a fair and just trial where was the justice for the thousands if not tens of thousands of americans who had just been killed by this asshole and his pals you dont get anything unless you cooperate no lawyer no judge nothing until you give us some answers lets start with your name i no hear you i talk lawyer harvath signaled herrington who came off the wall and slammed the mans head right into the table can you hear me now asked harvath as blood gushed from the mans broken nose when he didnt respond herrington cuffed him with an openhanded slap to the left side of his head and added how about now waving herrington back harvath stated lets talk about this brandnew casio watch of yours they make pretty good detonators dont they your colleague ramzi yousef used one of these to detonate a little saline solution bottle filled with nitroglycerin on a plane bound for tokyo a while back he called it his microbomb but it didnt bring the plane down like he hoped we caught him before he could improve upon the formula allah be praised waj ab zibik yelled the man wishing harvath an infection in a very private place for invoking the name of his god harvath ignored him and continued this watch wasnt meant as a detonator though was it id be willing to bet that all of you got the same new watch for synchronization am i right the man said nothing he just sat there as blood rolled down from his nose along his chin and dripped onto his shirt how about the phone pressed harvath motorola iden pretty nice but a bit out of your league dont you think i mean digital wireless phones like this are meant for business people twoway digital radio alphanumeric messaging fax capabilities highend internet access thats a lot of features just so you and your buddies can set up blowjob parties at the local mosque allah be praised nikomak the man growled harvath ignored the suggestion of what he should do to his mother and toyed with the phone as he continued posing questions since at least one other bomb went off in the path tunnel were assuming you were either a primary or a contingency operative or was the plan to wreak as much damage as possible the man remained silent how were you recruited for this job who contacted you nothing when were you first contacted still nothing what else do your colleagues have planned more bombs something with an airplane other cities what is it at this the prisoner smiled bob was about to reach out and strike him again when harvath stood up and stated im going to post a flyer over at the world trade center site to see if there are any lawyers willing to represent you turning to herrington he said lets go once outside the interrogation room bob stopped harvath and said we were just getting started in there the fear was absolutely wafting off that guy you could smell it i was definitely smelling something though i dont know if it was fear listen were both fans of the art of notsosubtle persuasion but we dont have the time to work this guy over the way wed like to even the nypd is going to have a limit as to what theyll let us do to a terrorist suspect in their custody so lets remove him from their custody said herrington well take him back to federal plaza or to a quiet hotel room an abandoned building wherever it doesnt matter he knows something you could see it in his face what he knows is that were desperate if we put the testicle clamps on him maybe hell tell us something of value maybe not wed need to have psychological leveragehave his family in custody or something like that but at this point we dont even know his name give me five minutes with him and youll have it this guy could turn out to have been nothing more than cannon fodder for alqaedaa means to get a bomb into the path train tunnel i dont want to waste any more time on him besides he may have already helped us out without even knowing it how asked herrington harvath held up the cell phone and said with this are you going to tell me this moron was dumb enough not to erase his call log nope in fact i dont think his phone was used for calls at all so whats it for then text messaging let me ask you a question youve been in iraq as well as afghanistan how many people does it take to detonate a suicide bomb most people would have thought it was a trick question but herrington knew better one plus a handler nearby with a remote detonator in case the bomber chickens out you think that is what this is all about backup detonation not necessarily there were too many bombers to have had handlers physically following each one of them i think this is a coordination issue these phones work on a combination of cell phone towers and gps ive got a very similar setup on my blackberry if all of the bombers had these phones theyd have access to maps of new york city that would allow them to always know where they were a good feature if youd just been brought in from out of town and provide their handler a way to keep track of them at all times added herrington exactly if one of them got pulled over driving into a tunnel the handler would be able to see that they were stopped and either call or text the operative to see what the holdup was or automatically warn the other bombers and put a contingency plan into effect its a pretty clever way to coordinate multiple attacks on a large scale do you think you can backtrack the signal that kind of stuff is way beyond my ability replied harvath but i think i might know somebody who can twentyfour ill put it next on my listright after finding the cure for cancer are you nuts asked kevin mccauliff from the other end of harvaths cellphone call the two were members of an informal group of federal employees who trained together every year for the annual washington dc marine corps marathon in addition to being a fellow runner mccauliff also held a position within an important government agency that harvath had turned to once before for helpthe national geospatialintelligence agency formerly known as the national imagery and mapping agency the nga was a major intelligence and combat support subsidiary of the department of defense and in this situation that was potentially one of its biggest drawbacks so what youre saying is you cant do it replied harvath no returned mccauliff what im saying is that i dont want to do it not if youre asking me to hide it from my superiors thats exactly what im asking you to do i could get fired scot what would i do then if you get fired ill make sure you get work over at homeland security even though he was all the way down in bethesda maryland mccauliff laughed so loud it sounded like he was standing on the street right next to them thanks but no thanks id rather collect unemployment for christs sake kevin this is serious have you seen whats happened up here of course i have its all over the place worse than theyre saying and it could get worse still if you dont help scot youre going to have to tell me what im doing this for for me kevin were close friends and all but thats not good enough ill take your sister to dinner again okay how about that said harvath he knew the analysts sister had a thing for him after the last time mccauliff had helped him out on a hushhush case that had been the payment hed asked for in return we werent in the middle of a national crisis that time were not supposed to be diverting any resources right now if i get caught im going to need a cover story and i dont have one for you said harvath youre going to have to come up with one on your own please kevin we think the people behind the attacks today may have something else planned i need you to do this for me so we can stop them and the reason youre not doing it out of your department is because nobody in my department can do this stuff as well as you mccauliff remained silent so long harvath felt he had no choice but to let the other shoe drop and because this morning before the bridges and tunnels blew i was involved in a covert operation with what i thought was the manhattan joint terrorism task force it turns out they were actually dia agents posing as jttf whatever theyre up to word somehow leaked terrorist chatter intercepted today shows that they already know all about the op that doesnt make any sense were all on the same side why wouldnt these guys work with you and tell you they were dia thats what i hope to find out but none of it matters unless i can figure out what the terrorists are planning to do next are you going to help me or not mccauliff thought about it for a moment and then said a lots going to depend on the cell phone data if its transmitted in a clear format we can grab it if its over a secure channel like ssl im going to need some time to work on decoding it we may not have time you said these phones were on nextel network correct i know a guy over there who might let me peek behind the curtain ill work that angle as well as the gps tracking companys servers ill call you back in a half hour harvath gave mccauliff some additional information from the phone he had forgotten to put back in the nypd evidence bag and then hung up what do we do now asked herrington mccauliffs the best guy on something like this if anybody can turn this to our advantage its him and then what if we pick up a trail on the terrorists there are still only two of us to tell you the truth i hadnt thought that far ahead yet said harvath i have replied bob lets get back to the va and see if we cant improve our odds twentyfive with their two litter bearers tim fiore and marcy delacorte pounded down the bridge as fast as their feet would carry them when they reached the end of the bridge three ambulances were already pulling awaypacked with injured tim yelled to an nypd officer about twenty feet ahead stop that ambulance but the officer knew there wasnt room in any of them for even one more person theres more ambulances on the way he shouted back we cant wait replied marcy as she flashed her credentials us secret service we have a priority injury here the ambulances are gone maam theres nothing i can do fiore tilted his head in the direction of the officers squad car and delacorte knew exactly what he was thinking we need your patrol car i cant do that said the officer and im not asking replied marcy as she raised her weapon the cop put up both his hands okay okay its yours lets get her into the car tim said to the two men who were helping them they rushed to the patrol car and as the officer watched them place amanda on the backseat he asked is that fiore nodded his head wheres the nearest hospital beth israel replied the cop fifteenth and first the nyu hospital downtown is going to be overloaded you cant drive stated marcy as she got in the back with amanda you dont know your way around tim looked around and then spotted something on the dash of a car idling in the gridlock not far from where they were running toward it fiore removed his credentials and held them up when he reached in the window and grabbed the device us secret service was all he said sprinting back to the squad car tim propped the garmin ique gps handheld on the dash fired up the vehicle and hit the lights and siren motorists tried to get out of their way but the effort was useless there was nowhere for them to go the traffic was absolutely locked down aiming for the sidewalk between two parked cars fiore yelled hold on and hit the gas twentysix as ali knew from the information provided by the troll there was no telling which location mohammed bin mohammed was being held at all they knew was that until they found the right one each location was going to be very difficult to penetrate and each would pose its own special set of challenges the rather benign store on th street between fifth and sixth in the heart of new york s diamond district looked like any other but ali and his men knew it was only a front the windows and doors were mounted with bulletproof lexan glass reinforced with hightensile steel frames there was an airlockstyle double entrance that required patrons to be buzzed in the first door and have it close completely behind them before the next would be allowed open discreet vents near the floor were capable of pumping in an incapacitating nerve agent in the event the highvoltageelectrode woven shock mats were not enough to fell any wouldbe intruders even among the extremely security conscious merchants of the diamond district this store was in a league of its own it was the chechens who had decided to avoid the airlock all together as far as they were concerned there was no reason the balance of their force couldnt go right in through the windowsprovided of course someone was kind enough to open them up first dressed like the ubiquitous hasidic jews who did business up and down the street two of the chechen operatives were buzzed into the store with nondescript briefcases in hand moments later as the store staff was distracted by the blackedout chevy tahoes that crashed up onto the sidewalk outside their windows with their lights blazing the chechens carried out their plan both briefcases were detonated with deafening pressure concussions and blinding flashes of white light before any of the staff could react they were gunned down by one of the operatives while the other slapped shape charges to the inside of the largest window by the time the charge blew both of the men were already at the vaultlike door leading to the heart of the stores true operation three us marines dressed in civilian clothes and body armor were able to take down the first terrorist with fire from their shortbarreled m viper assault rifles but as skilled as they were they could not escape the highvelocity shrapnel from the grenade the mans partner lobbed into their security room with the marine contingent down and the rest of the team in the store the terrorists made their way into the bowels of the building shooting anyone and anything that moved threeandahalf minutes later the rooms had all been cleared two of the men bodybagged their comrade while the others reloaded their weapons as abdul ali reached into his vest for another magazine he noticed he was still carrying his cell phonean unforgivable oversight especially as it was no longer necessary if the troll or anyone else needed to reach him they knew how to do it removing the battery ali smashed the phone with the butt of his weapon and gathered up the pieces as he exited the store he threw the remains into the nearest storm drain are we done here ali asked an enormous bear of a man named sacha the chechen leader unslung his bag of electronics threw it into the lead tahoe and nodded his head as the suvs pulled off the curb ali looked at his watch and tried to compute how long it would take to maneuver through the streets to their next destination he also wondered if it would be where they would finally find mohammed bin mohammed half a world away the troll was lying on a long leather sofa as his caucasian ovcharkas argus and drako dozed on the floor next to him he was enjoying an exquisite snifter of calvados and an original copy of the friedrich dürrenmatt play the visit when a tiny chime sounded from the direction of his desk setting the slim volume on the table next to him the troll swung his legs over the edge of the couch and hopped down onto the floor immediately the dogs snapped to attention and followed their master to the manor houses enormous dining hall there any traces of the halls original function had been erased by the rows upon rows of highend computer servers and satellite equipment that filled the room a raised platform with a sleek yet childsized glassandchrome table sat accompanied by a tiny leather desk chair at the far end of the hall suspended above the table were three flatscreen monitors sitting down in the chair the troll punched a series of keys on a lucite keyboard recessed within the tables surface and the monitors sprang to life it was amazing how far the troll had come in his little life moments later a series of multicolor status bars began charting the enormous chunks of encrypted data that had already begun downloading to his servers thanks to his bag of sophisticated electronic tricks sacha had fulfilled the first part of his assignment perfectly removing the treo device from the pocket of his sport coat the troll ignored the desire to contemplate the course of his life and authorized sachas first bonus so far so very very good twentyseven back at the va harvath waited in dr hardys office while bob went up to the roof in search of his three friends the images of death and destruction scot saw on the small television on hardys desk were worse than anything hed ever seen in any combat zone the macabre horror of it all made it difficult to tear his eyes away but he had to he needed to think beyond the devastation and try to put the pieces of what he knew into some kind of coherent picture in his mind to do that harvath focused on one of the framed diplomas hanging on the wall because of bobs injured shoulder he had automatically assumed that samuel hardy was an md but as he read harvath realized the man was actually a phd how the hell could a phd be in charge of bobs physical therapy he wondered unless harvaths train of thought was interrupted as dr samuel hardy phd entered the office anything new he asked as he threw a stack of folders on his desk and gestured toward the television the body count projections have been raised twice in the last twenty minutes scot replied god help us all harvath nodded his head and said can i ask you a question of course what kind of therapy are you doing with bob herrington hardy looked at harvath a moment and then crossed over to his desk with all due respect thats really none of your business harvath begged to differ with the doc and politely replied im assuming its not physical rehabilitation no said hardy careful with his choice of words physical rehabilitation is not my specialty and the others i met on the roofcates morgan and hastings what about them bob told me they were pals from his rehab i figured that meant physical therapykind of like workout buddies thats not too far from the truth but again im not at liberty to discuss your patients said harvath finishing hardys sentence for him i understand actually i dont think you do then why dont you help me im a psychologist thats it just plain old psychologist theres nothing that plain about psychology old maybe but nothing is ever plain in my work harvath wasnt a big fan of circumlocution he got his fill of it on a daily basis working in washington let me cut to the chase he said up until five minutes ago i thought bob herrington was putting together a team of exservice people that i could rely on now im not so sure so forgive me for being blunt but what exactly do you do here the doctor reached into his lower desk drawer and pulled out a blackandwhite photograph of four soldiers they were standing along a riverbank wearing vintage vietnamera tigerstripe camouflage thats a much younger me there on the left he said that picture was taken at nha trang when i was with the th special forces group you were a green beret asked harvath yup howd you end up a psychologist when i got out of the army i was dealing with a lot of issues hardy paused a moment and then said bob told me you were a seal is that right technically i still am replied harvath ive just been on loan to a couple of different government agencies well then you may be able to appreciate some of the problems i was facing i burned through a lot of doctors when i got home from vietnam both psychologists and psychiatrists alike they all had one fundamental thing in common that made it impossible for them to truly help menone of them had ever been in combat their code as human beings was based upon the judeochristian ethic while mine was based upon the warrior ethic they couldnt even begin to understand the things i had been asked to do and which i had done so willingly for my country thats why i decided to go into psychology so you specialize in helping treat people who have been in combat not just anybody replied hardy only the best of the best my area of expertise is with special operations personnel like bob remarked harvath whose brain then took the next step and rick cates paul morgan and tracy hastings hardy allowed his silence to serve as his answer what are we talking about here highend ptsd asked harvath post traumatic stress disorder is a relatively common issue for combat veterans but less so for our elite warriors what we see in them especially when theyve been forced to leave active duty prematurely because of an injury or whatever is an inability to reconcile the real worlda place not often governed by loyalty and honor with the world they have just left behinda brotherhood that prides itself on character and integrity harvath was intrigued but he was still having trouble deciphering what exactly the doctors role was so your job is to help them adjust to life outside the spec ops community more or less replied hardy every combat vet has issuesno matter who they are but people in the special operations community often share several in common and thats why group therapy in some cases can be so helpful in making a smooth and productive transition back into the civilian world harvath let the idea tumble around in his brain for a few moments and wondered if there were any issues he might be keeping at bay which he had never really taken a good look at bobs words from the pig amp whistle about letting meg cassidy get away rang in his ears but he tried to ignore them dr hardy was talking about deep psychological issues not his decision to place his career over a healthy interpersonal relationship with a member of the opposite sex pushing that thought from his mind harvath asked the one question that was most pressing at the moment without violating doctorpatient confidentiality is there anything going on with any of them that i should be concerned about that depends how well do you know them bob has told me about each of them in his emails but this is the first time ive ever met any of them in person without knowing the details of what youre asking them to do replied hardy its very hard for me to answer your question that was a fair enough response i may not be asking them to do anything said harvath in fact i hope that turns out to be true but the flipside is that i may be asking them to step up to the plate in a way they havent been asked to in a little while the terrorists arent done yet are they asked hardy harvath shook his head we dont think so well each person reacts to the stress of combat in different ways what i can say is that bob herrington is an exceptional leader if rick tracy and paul are the people he wants on your team then id take that as a serious endorsement but what if things get ugly theres no way to predict unfortunately you wont know until something happens at which point it could be too late hardy nodded many symptoms exhibited by soldiers outside the realm of combat have more to do with adjusting to the real world than anything else put them back into the stresses of battle and nine out of ten times their symptoms disappear and that tenth time asked harvath how do i deal with that you cant only that soldier can it comes down to facing his or her personal demons and thats a battle that requires more courage than anything you might ever face on the other end of a gun it was an answer that harvath not only understood but could appreciate the only problem was that the possibility that one of the people on his team could very well freeze up when they were needed most scared the hell out of him twentyeight tell me whats going on in new york said the dhs secretary alan driehaus as he walked in to gary lawlors office unannounced and pulled the door shut behind him lawlor had never cared much for the man in either his us attorney role or the position he now occupied at dhs as diplomatic as he was it was becoming harder and harder for gary to hide his dislike apparently theres been some sort of terrorist attack in new york its all over the news dont give me your condescending bullshit whats your involvement in this me i swore off terrorism years ago it was a prerequisite for getting this job the continual lack of respect he was shown throughout the department galled driehaus to no end shortly before all of this happened one of your people grabbed a muslim immigrant whom the canadians had granted political asylum to and dragged him back across our border true or false who the hell told you that replied lawlor stunned that somebody was leaking classified information and to of all people the pinhead secretary of the dhs ive got my sources well theyre wrong like hell they are replied driehaus none of you people get it do you we cant hold ourselves out as a country that cherishes the rule of law only when it suits our purposes we play right into our enemies hands when we do that its hypocritical what would you have us do alan wait for the bad guys to make their move and then throw them in jail no i have no qualms with preemption but there have to be limits we have to obey the rules really tell that to the families of the people who died today and see if they give a rats ass about limits or the rule of law pc or not were smackdab in the middle of a crusade and the only way western civilization is going to survive is if we meet radical islams force with overwhelming force of our own but western civilization isnt about brute force its about the power of ideasone of the greatest of which is the rule of law and that as all men are created equal they are equally bound under those laws wake up alan the sword is the midwife of civilization and everything that has happened since civilizations birth has happened at the tip of that sword i dont care how many starbucks are in my neighborhood how many digital pictures my secretary can cram onto a single memory card or how realistic the imagery is on my nephews new playstation we still live in a world where might makes right the moment we lose sight of that rule and start shrinking from our duties as a nation is when well all need to begin trading in our minivans and baseball mitts for prayer rugs and arabic lessons even as a product of the s driehaus had never seen the nation so ideologically divided why did so many have such a hard time seeing the damage that the current policies were doing to america so we just toss the rule of law out the window no replied lawlor what im suggesting is that we stop believing that western principles apply to our enemies we cant win the war on terror playing by a set of rules our opponents refuse to recognize and thats where you come in you and your collection of former soldiers and exintelligence agents hidden away in the bowels of dhs operating from budgets ive never even heard about careful alan youre wiping your feet on the threshold of a very dangerous house one i should point out into which you havent been invited i dont care i want to know right now what people you have in new york these are people who are operating under the umbrella of this agency of which i am in charge lawlors patience was quickly coming to an end dont let your philosophical judgments cloud your ability to execute your job you know how this works my division may be in dhs but its not of dhs so all animals are created equal but some are more equal than others is that it i prefer to see it as we all make our own unique contributions to the welfare of our nation thats an interesting way to characterize blackmail kidnapping and assassination lawlor sat with his best poker face waiting for the secretary to actually make a point or get the hell out of his office what happened today is a real wakeup call for our country gary the war on terror is not working the pace at which attacks are being plotted against the united states is beyond exhausting we cant win with this strategy dont you see just because we perceive ourselves as having the right to do something doesnt mean we should do it we can either lead by our example or be reviled for it lawlor turned to a stack of paperwork on his desk and barely masking the disgust in his voice said i suggest you get back to the war room i guarantee youll be much more appreciated there driehaus was pretty sure hed gotten the information he wanted from the oiia chief and opened the door as he was about to step into the hallway lawlor said by the way mr secretary yes said driehaus as he turned around just for the record it wasnt western civilization that made all men equal it was samuel colt twentynine the white house president rutledge traded drafts for his television appearance with his press secretary all the way back to andrews air force base in maryland the only break he took was when carolyn leonard brought him an update on his daughter knowing that amandas friends had been killedas well as presumably all but two of her protective detailand that they were trying to get her to a hospital for treatment of her unspecified injuries made it very difficult for jack rutledge to concentrate on the task at hand carolyn promised to brief him every twenty minutes whether she had any new information or not with confirmation that amandas friends had not survived the attack on the williamsburg bridge rutledge contacted their parents from air force one and delivered the heartbreaking news personally when the president arrived at the white house he read through the final draft of his speech and nodded his head no one had heard him utter a word since entering the building the mans face was resolute and it was clearly evident that he was both enraged and distraught beyond communication waving off the makeup artist rutledge stared into the camera and waited to be given the signal that he was on the air when it came he began speaking good afternoon today our great nation has come under attack with the despicable terrorist acts of september eleventh still fresh in our minds the forces of evil lashed out at our very way of life by once again targeting new york city americans in the thousands have died as a result of these deliberate and cowardly acts the victims come from all walks of life they were businessmen and women doctors teachers students children moms dads sisters and brothersall of whom were preparing to celebrate the nations birthday many more were injured including my own daughter amanda who along with two of her friends now deceased were making their way into new york when the attacks occurred as a father as president of this great nation and as an american i feel the pain of the people of new york the images of burning bridges and smoldering tunnels have filled us all with shock sadness and a determined unrelenting anger the goal of these attacks was to extinguish the greatest beacon of hope and freedom in the world but america s light will not be dimmed we shall emerge from this trial and we shall do so with our beacon of hope shining brighter than ever before while the terrorists may be able to shake the foundations of bridges and tunnels they cannot shake the foundations of our great country we have once again been forced to stare into the face of evil but i know that as americans we will not let that evil divide us i urge everyone to remain calm the full resources of the american government are being brought to bear to identify and locate those responsible for committing these despicable acts as we have said continually those who harbor terrorists are just as guilty as the terrorists themselves and we shall make no distinction between the two i want to thank the members of congress who stand with me in so strongly condemning these attacks and on behalf of the american people i also want to thank the many world leaders who have already contacted me to express their condolences and to offer assistance most of all i want to thank the rescue workers police fire and ems as well as the millions of americans across the country who are lining up to give blood and are already putting in place the charitable mechanisms that will be so needed in the days weeks and months ahead to help heal one of the greatest cities on this earth to the people of new york i say you have suffered an unfathomable loss but you are not alone each and every american stands shouldertoshoulder with you right now and you are in both our thoughts as well as our prayers our hearts are heavy with sadness at your loss a loss borne by all freedom and peaceloving people across america and around the world geoff mitchell watched from just off camera as the president prepared to wrap it up the remarks were pitchperfect and rutledge had delivered them flawlessly after showing a quick excerpt from the declaration of independence about america pledging its sacred honor to help the victims and their families the cameras would fade to the presidential seal and that would be it though the circumstances were horrible the press secretary had always hoped hed be given a chance to write a speech that would be remembered for eternity he felt pretty confident this was going to be one of those speeches what he didnt know was that why it would be so well remembered was still yet to come as the president came to the end of his remarks he abandoned his script and to the terrorists responsible for this revolting act of cowardice i say this america will never stop until we have hunted every last one of you down we will go to the far corners of the earth draining every swamp and turning over every rock along the way and when we find youand we will find youwe shall use every means at our disposal to visit upon you a death one thousand times more hideous than that which you have delivered to our doorstep today america has defeated the greatest evils of the modern world and it will defeat the scourge of radical islamic fanaticism as well thank you and god bless america the red light atop the main camera switched off but no one spoke not even the floor director whose job it was to inform the president that they were safely off the air am i clear asked rutledge the irony was not lost upon the director who replied id say you were crystal clear sir knowing it would take several minutes for the technical people to pack up their equipment from the oval office chuck anderson asked mr president may i have a word please in my office pointing at the press secretary he added you too geoff once they had gone through the adjoining door and it had closed firmly behind them the chief of staff said do you have any idea what youve just done were not going to hide behind politically correct labels anymore chuck id say you made that abundantly clear along with the fact that the christian west is now officially at war with islam i didnt say we were at war with islam i said radical islamic fanaticism replied the president the chief of staff looked at the press secretary am i wrong geoff or are we now officially at war with the islamic religion i think youre taking the presidents remarks slightly out of context said mitchell and you dont think thats whats being done right now by every twobit imam and petty despot in every muslim nation around the world i dont think its beyond repair he was angry and with very good reason we can smooth it over just hold it ordered the president were not retracting repairing or smoothing anything over im tired of dancing around this country is going to stand by those remarks all the same sir i wish you would have run them by me first said the press secretary going offthecuff like that can be very damaging no matter how well intentioned the chief of staff a longtime friend of the presidents shrugged and said the president doesnt do anything offthecuff geoff he knew very well what he was saying i dont understand responded mitchell rutledge took a deep breath am i angry youre damn right i am our country has been attacked and i have no idea if because of those attacks my daughter is going to live or die i said what every single american and every single western world leader wanted to say and needed to sayradical islam must be stamped out everyone tiptoes around the elephant in the middle of the room while the elephant continues to eat and grows bigger and bigger right before our eyes what about our muslim allies what about them scoffed the president radical islam is an even bigger threat to them and yet they sit idly by and do nothing at all about it what about the regular muslims who might see this as a slight against them and their religion to hell with them mainstream islam has done absolutely nothing to stop this cancer metastasizing within their midst they havent even wholeheartedly condemned it as far as im concerned they dont get a pass anymore no more sitting on the fence waiting to see which way this all goes either theyre part of the solution or theyre part of the problem period the chief of staff as well as the usually verbose press secretary were both at a loss for words finally geoff mitchell said then i guess we really are at war thirty for security reasons they had agreed that real names would not be used from an operational standpoint it was much better that way for all of them to tell them apart jaffe and his team had assigned nicknames to the two foreign intelligence agents working with them the lanky darkcomplexioned man in his midthirties with the brillopad hair and breath that reeked of garlic was called rashid while the older more experienced operative with the pockmarked face jet black eyes and turkish mustache was referred to as hassan outside the interrogation room jaffe banged one of the monitors on the av cart hoping to improve the quality of the satellite downlink cmon damn it he mumbled as he tried to tweak the signal i think were really crossing the line with this one said brad harper as he stood and watched the ghostlike images fading in and out of focus from halfway around the world mohammeds only been in us custody for six weeks we can break him we just need to give it more time we might not have any more time but now were talking about noncombatants kids for christs sake really said jaffe what about all the kids killed on the bridges and in the tunnels today do you think these people gave a damn about them obviously not but how about all the other kids who will be killed if that sick son of a bitch in there gets away with launching multiple nuclear attacks on our soil that still doesnt make it right and i want to go on the record as being completely against this duly noted replied jaffe as the signal finally improved enough for them to proceed i dont know how long well be able to hold the downlink so get in there and make sure were ready to go and by the way he added as harper began walking away i want you to remember that i didnt get to where i am by being stupid or soft harper had considered the man neither stupid nor soft in fact he might have even been too hard for his own good nevertheless there was nothing for harper to say all he was left with was a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach marines were honorable and they sure as hell didnt torture children even though it was going to happen on the other side of the globe harper felt as responsible for what was coming as if he were standing in north africa carrying out the orders himself he could only hope that god would have mercy on their souls for what they were about to do moments later the door to the interrogation room opened and mike jaffe rolled the av cart inside with its multiple cables snaking behind into the hallway before turning the monitors back on he addressed the prisoners who were flexicuffed to two very uncomfortable wooden chairs both of the men spoke english well enough so there was no need for a translator it took us quite a while to make the connection between you two in fact we almost missed it wed spent so much time looking for any of bin ladens or zawahiris children who might have gone into the family business that we foolishly never considered your lineage mohammed you must be very proud of your nephew here he seems to have really taken to the profession ive been trying to figure out what the bin mohammedjamal family crest might look like maybe two lions holding a roadside bomb or would it be more subtle maybe a chain of blasting caps over a nice banner that read women and children first anyway we decided to do a little more genealogy and guess what we found jaffe nodded his head and harper activated both of the monitors rana is quite a lovely village as the monitors glowed to life one showed the battered mudbrick exterior of a large village house while the other showed a family of women and children huddled in one of the rooms inside several men in black fatigues with dark balaclavas covering their faces held them at gunpoint sayed jamal instantly stiffened in his chair it was exactly the reaction jaffe had been hoping for i guess i dont need to ask whose house were looking at mohammed knew that he was looking at his nephews home and family but he remained completely impassive take a good look at them said jaffe as he held up his cell phone the men in that house work for me they obey my orders and unless you start cooperating things are going to get very unpleasant for your nephews family now tell me about the nuclear material jaffe counted quietly to three and asked the question in a different way we already know where the material was stolen from a top secret european facility we also have a pretty good handle on when it was stolen what we dont know is whos planning on selling it to you and how you planned to use it tell me what i want to know and ill have my men leave that house right now when mohammed refused to answer jaffe raised the cell phone to his ear and said start with the oldest daughter immediately there was a frenzy of activity on the monitor as the order was relayed and one of the gunmen pulled a screaming young woman away from her family and dragged her out of the room the family members wailed and the image shook as the camera was removed from its tripod and rushed down the hallway it caught up with the gunman in what appeared to be a bathroom a large copper tub was filled with water and the gunman was holding the womans head underneath sayed jamal cursed his captors in arabic as tears began to stream down his face jaffe though paid no attention to him his eyes were locked on mohammed bin mohammed jamal quickly realized what was going on and turned to his uncle begging him to tell the americans whatever they wanted to know mohammed yelled at him to shut up brad harper didnt give a damn if it was insubordination or nothe couldnt allow this to go on any longer approaching jaffe the powerfully built marine said thats it were not doing this youre going to have to find another way without taking his eyes off mohammed jaffe drew his pistol and pointed it at harpers head stopping the marine in his tracks every member of this family will die slowly and painfully unless you tell me what i want to know said jaffe his eyes boring into mohammeds who is selling the nuclear material when the man still refused to answer jaffe spoke into his cell phone again kill her the command was relayed to the gunman on the monitor who drew his sidearm placed it over the edge of the tub and fired two shots jamal was hysterical with rage and screamed first at the americans and then at his uncle for having killed his daughter mohammed looked at him and told him to shut up jaffe didnt bother asking about the nuclear material now instead he spoke into his cell phone and once the camera had returned to the room where the family was corralled he said to mohammed why dont you pick the next one thirtyone harvath had just hung up with kevin mccauliff when herrington walked into dr hardys office with his crew and said everyones in harvath looked morgan cates and hastings oversizing them up as it were trying to divine whether theyd be up to what he might call on them to do bits and pieces of the things bob had told him about them in his emails floated to the forefront of harvaths mind cates who had relocated to new york from oklahoma was the son of evangelical parents though he himself was not particularly religious he saw the war on terror exactly as his enemy did as an outandout crusade the physical stresses of the job had bought him a ticket out of active duty when both his knees blew on an assignment in the south of afghanistan morgan the youngest team member had been raised by a single mother hed been in big trouble with drugs and street gangs and had joined the marine corps as his ticket out and a way to see the world beyond new york though a head wound left him unfit for duty many doctors including hardy questioned if he wasnt already just a bit offa bit too reckless with his own life long before that fateful day in iraq finally there was tracy hastingsthe naval eod tech she was the daughter of a wealthy new york family her parents had seriously disagreed with her decision to join the armed forces but the attack on the uss cole had helped her make up her mind and the headstrong young woman wouldnt be dissuaded she hadnt joined the navy in spite of her affluent upbringing she had joined because of it she thought that if anyone had an obligation to serve their country it was people who had profited so handsomely by it tracy used a little makeup to cover the facial scars left by an ied disposal gone bad but the damage was still visible from what herrington had told harvath her injuries had been quite severe but the surgeons had done a remarkable jobright down to matching the particularly pale blue color for her artificial eye harvath could tell by looking at each of the people standing there that they were a tightly knit group that was good the question was could they function both as individuals and as a cohesive unit under the stress of combat and just as important would they accept him an outsider as both one of their own and as their leader as hardy went to check on some of his other patients they had the office to themselves harvath asked herrington to close the door once it was shut he said i am going to be completely honest with all of you youre not my first choice for something like this and youre not even my last choice but the situation being what it is you are my only choice fuck you too said morgan herrington held up his hand and said let him finish harvath waited a beat and then said state local and federal resources are completely and i mean completely tied up with searchandrescue efforts air traffic over and maritime traffic around manhattan has been suspended due to sniper and rpg fire what helicopter and boat traffic there is is working off the opposite sides of both the hudson and east rivers somebody doesnt want any reinforcements making it to manhattan that means that we will have no support for this assignment whatsoever your participation will be in an unofficial unrecognized and most definitely unsanctioned capacity meaning what asked cates it means youre not federal employees and you are not being recognized as active duty soldiersin essence your disabled status hasnt changed i guess its lucky for you then that even though they took our jobs we all got to keep our training replied cates harvath liked that answer continuing he said were dealing with an extremely well organized enemy of indeterminate size and resources who is presumably still operating somewhere in manhattan you mean theyre not done yet responded paul morgan harvath shook his head i dont know thats why i wanted to be completely straight with you in short we have very little idea of what were up against this could turn out to be nothing but ive got a feeling it might be an extremely dangerous assignment anybody have any other questions yeah joked cates so whats the bad news a wave of tense laughter rolled through the room tracy hastings raised her hand halfway and asked if we dont know who these people are and what their objective is how are we supposed to find them i just got off the phone with someone whos working on it replied harvath we might have something very soon so we need to be ready to move in the meantime weve got a bigger problem all i have is a pistol and its in my truck back up in midtown were going to have to figure out what were going to do for weapons another wave of laughter rolled through the room but this time it was anything but tense twenty minutes later paul morgan removed a piece of false drywall from the back of a closet in his small gramercy park apartment and said go ahead and take your pick it was a veritable arsenal in the pistol department morgan had two unertl meu soc s a glock and a fourinchbarreled smith amp wesson hanging next to them were a mossberg gauge shotgun a remington x sniper rifle and a fully automatic troy industries cqbspc a assault rifle that morgan had chanced a big official asswhupping for smuggling out of iraq so much for our weapons problem said harvath as he gazed at the display im going to ask another stupid question but how are you set for ammo once again the group laughed morgan crossed into the kitchen which was covered with travel posters for places he hoped some day to seeparis rome hong kongand removed a set of keys from his pocket the refrigerator was a mosaic of snapshots showing morgan as a marine in a number of other exotic locations around the world that were normally much more humid or dusty than paris rome or hong kong he unlocked a small padlock on the side of the freezer door and swung it open inside boxes of shrinkwrapped ammunition stood in a neat series of rows where do you keep your grenade launcher asked herrington dr hardy told me that grenade launchers are for paranoids so i sold it to a buddy of mine a while back morgan let them stand there wondering for a second longer and then smiled and said kidding only kidding i never had a grenade launcher besides with what the surfacetoair missile battery ive got up on the roof cost me who could afford a grenade launcher everyone laughed but secretly none of them would have been surprised to find that morgan did have a crate of sams stashed somewhere upstairs clearing off the kitchen table morgan hoisted a kiva technical backpack stuffed to the gills with gear and set it onto one of the chairs is that your bugout bag asked hastings the marine nodded his head and began unloading his pack a weeks worth of the very best survival equipment money can buy as morgan pulled out mres chemlights water purification tablets parachute cord and other items cates said a weeks worth whatever happened to seventytwo hours hurricane katrina thats what the marine looked at harvath even dhs is now telling people they need to have at least a weeks worth of supplies on hand in case of trouble right harvath nodded his head knowing that they were talking about having people raise it to a month or even two not only did he have a bugout bag ready to go at a moments notice in case of a terrorist attack or some other sort of disaster but so did most of the military law enforcement and intelligence people he worked worth even civilians had them the way harvath saw it it was pretty stupid for anyone government employee or otherwise not to be ready in case of an emergency that said his bugout bag was sitting in the back of his traillblazer in a garage uptown it weighed at least fifty pounds and it would have been quite uncomfortable to carry everywhere with him even so there were several items in it he would have liked to have with him right now as morgan continued to remove items from his seemingly bottomless bag hastings asked whered you get all the money for this stuff lets just say that in my old life i was a good saver a real good saver added cates as he checked the labels in a couple of the sport coats hanging in morgans closet the marine laid out an assortment of extremely highquality knives from chris reeve as well as a brandnew gerber lmf iiinfantry which could be used to carve ones way out of a helicopter fuselage and respectfully offered harvath first pick though they were all exceptional harvath already had his neverleavehomewithoutit benchmade auto in his pocket and if they made it back to his trailblazer hed have access to a superb fixedblade knife from larue tactical i dont suppose youve got some flashbangs in there said harvath as he watched paul morgan continue to pull gear out of his bag no but i do have this replied the marine as he withdrew a blackhawk medical pack harvath was about to say that he hoped they wouldnt need that when his cell phone rang it was kevin mccauliff after chatting with him for only a few seconds two things became apparent kevin had some pretty good news he also had some pretty bad news thirtytwo harvath listened as mccauliff gave him the good news first the nga analyst had been able to hack the server containing the tracking data for the terrorists cell phone that harvath had borrowed from the nypds evidence bag it was one of over fortyseven different phones operating off the same account it and one other had continued to broadcast a signal after the bridges and tunnels had been blown that other phone was recognized by the server as the lead wireless reception device mccauliff explained that all of the units had been programmed to text message positioning data to the lead phone at regular intervals now it was time for the bad news wherever that lead phone was it was now no longer transmitting a signal mccauliff had no way to tell harvath its current location only where it had beenan address on the upper west side and another in the diamond district on west th street even though the lead phone appeared to have been disabled mccauliff strongly suggested that harvath make sure that the positioning software on the one he was now carrying was turned off harvath told him hed already done so back at the police station and as he grabbed a pen and paper asked mccauliff to repeat the addresses the lead phone had been at one more time when harvath asked if there was any satellite imagery available for those locations mccauliff told him that was also part of the bad news and that harvath would understand what he meant once he saw it all kevin needed was an email address harvath saw the cable modem next to the pc on paul morgans desk crossed his fingers hed be able to get online and gave mccauliff one of the hotmail accounts he used when he didnt want to run things through the dhs servers five minutes later harvath downloaded the first in a series of emails and saw exactly what mccauliff meant about the satellite imagery also being part of the bad news the smoke from all of the fires made it very difficult to make anything out three emails later he waved herrington over and said do you see what i see here bob stared at the screen and slowly scrolled through the images from the building on west th street when he was finished he backed up and did it again then repeated the process several more times he wanted to be as sure as possible before rendering any kind of opinion finally he said the image quality absolutely sucks but if i had to make a guess id say that those are pictures of two vehicles carrying two breaching teams of anywhere from four to seven men each thats what i think too replied harvath as he clicked on the imagery of the diamond district address how about here these pictures are even worse than the others said bob those could be our two vehicles or they could be completely different ones with all the haze and interference from the smoke you cant tell for sure well theres only one way to find out hooah shouted cates mocking morgan but doing it with the army yell lets go get those fuckers hastings paid no attention to cates looking at all the gear she said dont you think were going to draw a lot of attention running around manhattan with all of this stuff good point replied herrington as he looked at morgan the marine crossed the room and pulled several backpacks from his hall closet a buddy of mine is a rep for camelbak these are their new scabbard bags you can throw a rifle or a shotgun into the scabbard in the center and then pack the rest of your gear in the compartments around it harvath studied the cleverly designed bags and remarked its still going to look like were packing some serious firepower morgan pulled three rain covers from behind his snowshoes well use these for the remington the troy cqb and the mossberg nobody will have any idea what were carrying for someone who had his hair parted seriously enough by a bullet to be medically discharged from the marines so far he seemed to have his act together this guy didnt miss a trick okay remarked scot i guess now all we have to do is figure out how the hell were going to get where were going looking out one of the windows and down the street of the lowerfloor apartment rick cates replied ive got an idea but ive also got a feeling nobodys going to like it thirtythree eyeing the collection of dirt bikes outside cox cycle shop harvath cautioned cates not to let things devolve into a thats my chopper charlie this is my gun clyde kind of situation as they stood on the sidewalk watching the army civil affairs specialist spin his story to the crossarmed heavily tattooed staff of the motorcycle custom shop harvath herrington hastings and morgan tried to come up with a plan b they agreed that the fastest way to the diamond district from gramercy park was to try to go straight up fifth avenue but it was reserved for emergency vehicles only and most of the cops theyd been seeing werent particularly helpful unless you were driving an official vehicle they werent letting anyone through not even a car full of surgeons theyd seen who needed to get to an uptown hospital as quickly as possible harvath was wondering if maybe they would be better off heading north on foot retrieving his vehicle and using its lightsandsiren package to try to barrel through the rest of the distance when cates was shoved backward onto the pavement by one of the tattooed bikers immediately harvath and the rest of his group stepped forward but cates held up his hand and waved them back showing extreme patience and control he got up off the ground dusted himself off and reengaged the man who had just shoved him harvath and the others watched as cates went toetotoe with the pound biker and their exchange got progressively more heated moments later the biker grabbed cates by the throat and swung his other arm around in an attempt to hit him in the side of the head cates parried the blow and brought his free hand crashing into the mans jaw before the tattooed giant could respond cates whipped his head forward and shattered the cartilage in the mans nose with a vicious head butt the bike store manager rammed his knee into catess abdomen but the special forces reservist quickly returned the assault by kicking the big man in the groin causing his knees to buckle and for him to fall to the pavement in pain if you guys would like to help yelled cates over his shoulder as the rest of the biker staff in the shop began grabbing wrenches pipes and assorted bludgeons now would probably be a good time harvath and company drew their weapons and rushed forward upon seeing the display of firepower the biker shop staff laid down their arms and retreated into the back of the garage cates kicked his assailant in the gut and walked inside located the keys for the motorcycles they wanted and then hit the button to lower the garagestyle door once it was down he jammed a screwdriver into the holes where the padlock normally went pulled two sets of flexicuffs from paul morgans pack and secured the front door what did i tell you about not turning this situation into a confrontation demanded harvath as they climbed onto the motorcycles i couldnt help it replied cates as he fired his up did you see that guys tats hes got a million of themso what you obviously missed the one on his left arm said cates as he pulled forward onto the sidewalk he had a picture of uncle sam with a black eye and underneath it the letters fta fuck the army yelled morgan over the whine of his suzuki fuck that asshole hoorah cates herrington and hastings both flashed rick the thumbsup and harvath had no choice but to flash his as well to be kicked out of the service for what was known as the big chicken dinner or more correctly a bad conduct discharge meant that the bike shop manager was one screwedup individual and had committed the equivalent of a serious felony to proudly boast that fact underneath a disfigured tattoo of uncle sam was unforgivable he deserved everything cates had dished out to him and more what do you say boss yelled morgan as he revved his motorcycle harvath noticed that the team was looking to bullet bob for guidance and as herrington shot a questioning look in harvaths direction harvath nodded his head for him to take control these people respected bobs experience and looked to him as their leader fortyseventh and fifth yelled herrington as fast as we can get there lowering his head and rocketing his bike out into traffic harvath decided he could worry about chainofcommand issues later right now they had a very strange puzzle to start putting together the only question was were the few pieces they had going to be enough to make any sort of progress thirtyfour gary lawlor tried to discern a connection between the two addresses harvath had given him the terrorists were obviously looking for something but what what could they possibly want in a brownstone on the upper west side and a location in the diamond district in midtown neither seemed typical terrorist targets compounding the problem was that someone at the dia was playing some sort of role in all of this but until he had a better handle on who and what it was there was no way lawlor was going to tip his hand to them they were a collection of superspooks bound by completely different rules of engagement than the rest of the intelligence community theirs were the rules of war and there wasnt much they couldnt doincluding locking him up indefinitely without charge for even sniffing around the edges of one of their operations call it interagency mistrust or a strong instinct for selfpreservation but until lawlor got a much better feel for the lay of the land he was going to stay as far away from the dod and its defense intelligence agency as possible in the meantime as the director of the apex project he had a host of other resources at his disposal logging on to his computer he accessed the shared intelligence database network and entered the two addresses that kevin mccauliff had provided harvath with when the search results came back they were more than disappointingthey were downright impossible according to the database there was no information available for either addressno utility records no mortgage or business license information nothing both locations appeared to be operating in a vacuuma big black one someone had scrubbed both addresses so completely clean that neither offered a single trail leading anywhere that kind of sterilization normally happened only in covert government operations so deep they were referred to as happening at crush deptha status reserved for issues of vital national security for one reason or another these issues were sometimes better handled in the civilian arena rather than on military bases or at established intelligence agencies but even so the crush depth locations lawlor had known during his career were like minifortresses gary still wasnt any closer to understanding what was going on in new york though if the imagery from kevin mccauliff did indeed show two crush depth locations being hit what was the reason better yet how in the world could the terrorists have known about them the operational intelligence would have been polo step at the very least the fact that they had hit not one but two suggested a security compromise so devastating that its repercussions could very well be felt for years if not for decades to come lawlor jumped over to the dhs server pulled up the most current fema damage map for new york city and filtered out as much noise as possible he wasnt interested in casualty estimates or the positioning of emergency equipment all he wanted to know was where the terrorists had specifically struck once that information was isolated he added secondary problem spots such as reported sniper and rpg locations apartment building and property fires as well as any other major events that demanded a large police fire or ems response with those in place he added the last layerthe secret upper west side and midtown locations the terrorists had just struck he tried to make sense of it but the harder he stared at the screen the more the questions piled up in his brain if these were crush depth locations what agency or group was running them and what was their purpose with all the chaos in new york was whoever oversaw those locations even aware that theyd been hit that was one of lawlors biggest questions the only obvious thing in the whole muddled mix was that if the terrorists were pinpointing and hitting actual crush depth locations then the united states was in even bigger trouble than it thought lawlor realized that he was going to have to go against his better judgment and talk to people outside his immediate circle whatever the fallout might be as long as he could stop the terrorists before they struck again it would be worth it thirtyfive national security agency fort meade maryland mark schreiber poked his head into his supervisors fluorescentlit office and said i think weve got another problem in manhattan no kidding replied joseph stanton jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward the flatpanel televisions on the wall behind him some idiot blogger started a rumor that a bio agent was part of the attack and no matter what mayor brown says nobody is listening to him thats not what im talking about replied schreiber as he stepped the rest of the way inside and closed the door behind him transcon and geneva diamond are unresponsive stanton stopped what he was doing and laid down his purple highlighter his bespectacled face was bloated from a diet too rich in sodium along with too many hennessyandcokes after hours his hair was unkempt and his entire wardrobe seemed to be permanently wrinkled he wore a seersucker suit that should have been retired years ago and a striped regimental tie decorated with coffee stains unresponsive how nobodys answering email did you try calling them schreiber nodded his head the phones dont seem to be working how about pinging the servers i did that and it comes back aokay still processing so whats the problem asked stanton if we can ping the servers via satellite and get a response then why isnt their email working it piggybacks off the same system new york s in chaos right now we dont know what the damage is or what services have been interrupted lets not worry about it you dont find it a bit odd that we cant connect with two of our substations considering everything thats going on up there not really the servers are still churning right you said so yourself so someone has got to be processing data yeah but i just have a bad feeling about it replied schreiber were under attack so having bad feelings is understandable give it a little while longer im sure well hear something and if we dont stanton didnt have time for this then well have a friendly neighborhood beat cop stroll by and give us a report youre joking right said the young man of course he was joking and if this kid spent a little more time interacting with real live people and a little less time at his computer he might know it picking up his highlighter and turning his attention back to the stack of paperwork on his desk stanton replied its going to be a very long night mark why dont you take a few minutes relax and then see what kind of sourcing help theyre going to need upstairs fine but if we still dont hear anything from new york then well dig a little deeper but for now i want you focused on helping the people here who need it the most ive been to transcon and geneva diamond believe me those folks know how to handle themselves thirtysix new york city navigating through the traffic as best he could fiore kept the secret service command center apprised of their status while marcy fed him updates from the backseat the bottom line was that their progress was horrible and their patient was getting worse with the fdr completely impassable tim was forced onto side streets most of which were jammed at th street near tompkins square marcy yelled tim shes crashing were losing her rapidly scrolling through the iques options tim found what he was looking for im going to cut through this park hold on jumping the curb at avenue b fiore raced through tompkins square and came out again at th street and avenue a he barreled through a police barricade at first avenue and after hanging a tirescreaming right turn pinned the accelerator and raced for beth israel hospital his only hope was that theyd be able to make it there in time thirtyseven the lone nypd officer standing guard outside the battered geneva diamond and jewelry exchange storefront was relieved when harvath appeared and flashed his dhs credentials the fact that he had pulled up on a dirt bike along with four other rather hardlooking individuals didnt faze him a bit not with everything else that had already happened that afternoon the officer had been waiting for backup since stumbling onto the scene fortyfive minutes earlier while en route to another location with every pair of professionally trained hands in the city needed to help search for survivors in the rubble of the bridge and tunnel bombings random lootings werent on the patrolmans priority list but when a group of th street merchants flagged him down and told him what had happened the officer immediately changed his mind after moving onlookers away from the front of the store he ventured a few feet inside what he saw had caused him to remain there until help arrived he was just about to reluctantly abandon the post when harvath showed now he was more than happy to turn things over to someone with more authority and greater jurisdiction in all his years on the job nothing had prepared the patrolman for the carnage hed seen inside now it was harvaths turn with bob herrington and the rest of the team in tow they picked their way around the dead bodies and brass shell casings at the front of the store and headed toward the vaultstyle door at the back the door was half open and as they approached it tracy hastings ordered the team to stop whats up said harvath hastings pointed to the pockmarks on the walls and ceiling around the frame and replied shrapnel we cant touch that door until were sure its not rigged harvath thought she was being a little too cautious until herrington said trust her she knows what shes doing all right he responded stepping aside to let her get a better look at it but make it quick once hastings was convinced it was safe she waved the rest of the team forward inside they found a hightech security control room that had been blown apart by what hastings claimed was probably one or more fragmentation grenades lying on the floor were the badly mangled bodies of three men in tactical vests with modified ms lying nearby these guys are jarheads remarked morgan as he rolled one of the bodies over plenty of guys in the security industry cut their hair too short said cates that doesnt make them marines morgan ignored the remark and pointed at the mens feet the marines only use the best gear and these guys are all wearing quantico desert boots while harvath preferred original swat boots paul morgan did have a point many of the marines hed known were particularly fond of quantico boots but even with the ms there still wasnt enough evidence to qualify the bodies as being marines as if reading his mind morgan slid a plate out of one of their tactical vests wrapped on it with his knuckles and said us militaryissue interceptor body armor harder than kevlar and can stop anything up to a millimeter round cates whistled and said these guys certainly were prepared but for what replied harvath more for his own benefit than anyone elses whoever took these marines out must have been very good lets finish clearing these rooms bob and the rest of the team relieved the marines of their sig sauer p pistols as well as their machine guns and as many loaded magazines as they could carry before sweeping the balance of the geneva diamond and jewelry exchange as they did harvath tried to figure out what the hell the operations real function was in the heart of new york city no jewelry storeno matter how busy or how well connected its ownerswas going to be granted the protection of three machineguntoting us marines as they went from room to room it became apparent that the operation was completely paperless whatever secret it held had either been taken to the grave when its personnel had been raked with gunfire had been stolen by the terrorists or was locked up in its workstations and racks and racks of servers exercising the only other option left available to him harvath collected whatever photo identification he could from each of the fifteen corpses including the three us servicemen whose ids listed them in fact as activeduty marines he hoped gary would be able to make some sense out of it because at this moment harvath had absolutely no idea what or who they were dealing with thirtyeight less than halfway through their list of locations abdul ali considered himself lucky that theyd only lost one of the chechen soldiers it was a treacherous but necessary path theyd been forced to follow the troll had explained that each location would be more difficult to assault than the last and that was why ali and his team were taking them in ascending order of difficulty there was no sense starting with the most difficult location and working their way backward only to find that mohammed bin mohammed was being held at one of the less fortified sites it seemed reasonable and there was a consolation however small that with each location they scratched off their list abdul ali was one step closer to recovering mohammed whether the man was waiting inside this location or the next made no difference to the chechens unbeknownst to ali the troll was paying them on a perassault basis and so it was in their financial interest that the attacks continue until the very bloody end what ali did know was that the troll had been one hundred percent correct about the american governments penchant for secrecyespecially when it came to the deepcover operations on their list both the left and the right hands purposefully strove to keep each other in the dark and thereby created a considerably uncommunicative culture it would take days to sort out what had happened to the various new york undercover operations and by then allah willing abdul ali and mohammed bin mohammed would be long gone as the team approached its next objective ali was supremely confident that its occupants had no idea they were coming he girded himself with the hope that this might be the last assault they would have to conduct the vents for the lincoln tunnel vent shaft were located at the west midtown ferry terminal also known as pier on manhattan s west side as abdul ali and his chechen mercenaries arrived the vent shaft towers were still belching plumes of acrid black smoke high into the air from the hundreds upon hundreds of vehicles burning in the tunnel beneath the hudson river emergency personnel were everywhere as they tried to use the ventilation shafts to evacuate survivors with over forty million vehicles passing through the tunnel each year it was one of the busiest in the world and a perfect target ali quietly marveled at the chaos allah had indeed blessed their undertaking attached to the north ventilation tower was a new york waterway bus garage and ali instructed sacha to park just past it alongside two large dumpsters the men readied their weapons and then donned their gas masks and black tactical helmets in practiced unison they exited the vehicles and raced into the nearly empty garage accompanied by a very special trojan horse most of the bus staff had raced next door to try to help extricate survivors from the tunnel and only a handful remained behind they were quickly dispatched by three of the chechens who then dragged their bodies to the rear of the garage where they could be hidden away out of sight the secondary stairwell secreted within the north ventilation tower had been constructed to be very difficult if not impossible to find without proper help once it was located the team readied its secret weapon and sent ivan hobbling down the stairs via a fiberoptic camera mounted inside the animals collar ali and his chechen handler watched as the small yet sturdy border collie with its brightly colored searchandrescue vest limped forward toward a large steel door three feet away the handler depressed a button on his remote which caused the dogs collar to beep twice in quick succession immediately the dog began whimpering and laid itself down for a moment it appeared that their tactic was not going to work then the groan of metal on metal resounded through the corridor and up the stairwell as the steel door began to slowly open two men outfitted similarly to the marines at the geneva diamond and jewelry exchange appeared and seeing no one else in the corridor shouldered their weapons and cautiously approached the injured dog wondering how it had made its way down there they assumed it must have been part of the searchandrescue efforts in the tunnel and had somehow lost its way what the marines should have been asking themselves was where the animals handler was once the marines were close enough ivan received another cue got up and limped inside the facility having seen enough from ivans collarmounted camera ali nodded to the handler who then signaled the rest of the team to get ready the dog was then sent its final cue ivan bit down on a tab at his right shoulder and pulled it forward causing the heavy vest packed with plastique and ball bearings to activate and fall to the ground the speedy dog was halfway to the stairs before anyone inside knew what had happened with the deafening roar of the explosion still ringing in the ears of those not instantly killed by the detonation abdul ali and his men rushed inside with their weapons blazing they plowed a bloody trail through the odd submarinelike structure as they searched for the man alqaeda was willing to risk anything to recover but once again it was all in vain not only was mohammed bin mohammed nowhere to be found there was no sign he had ever been there to begin with when they were safely inside the tahoes and back out into the maddening traffic abdul ali quietly went over the plan for taking down their next target from everything he had read this one was going to be their most difficult yet and for the first time since they had started he questioned his teams chances for success thirtynine scottish highlands the troll had gone through only a fraction of the information from the geneva diamond and jewelry exchange when the lincoln tunnel data began to stream in it was time for another payment to sachas account the chechen was easily worth his enormous weight in goldespecially when it was someone elses the fact that abdul ali had no idea what his alqaeda money was really buying made the transaction even more delicious for the troll it could conceivably take a lifetime to sift through all of the information now gorging his servers each piece on its own had a certain amount of value but the skillthe art if you willwas in knowing how to join together just the right tidbits to create a true masterpiece that was where the troll excelled in his profession it was quite amazing especially for someone whose prospects in life had been seen as so negligible that even his parents had given up on him early in life when it became obvious the troll was not going to grow any further his godless georgian parents made no attempt to find a suitable loving home for their son nor did they try to find even a halfdecent orphanage instead they abandoned the boy selling him as if he were chattel to a thriving brothel on the outskirts of the black sea resort of sochi there the boy was starved beaten and made to perform unutterable sex acts that would have shamed even the marquis de sade himself it was there that the troll learned the true value of information the looselipped pillow talk of the powerful clients proved a goldmine once he had learned what to listen for and how to turn it to his advantage the whores most of them lifes castoffs as well felt a kinship with the dwarf and treated him well in fact they became the only family he ever knew and he repaid that kindness by one day buying their freedom those who had been unkind to him were evicted to fend for themselves a fate made even more unbearable when the troll had the madam and her husband tortured and then killed for the inhuman cruelty he had spent years suffering at their hands he had indeed come a long way and once his servers were full from this transaction the world could go to hell as far as he was concerned the data he was now hoarding was the ultimate annuity with the money he stood to make he could do and buy anything he wanted as the troll scanned the data coming in he enjoyed a bouchée of escargots and morel mushrooms followed by a magret of duck martiniquaise with caramelized leg confit all complemented by an exquisite bottle of château quercy st emilion bordeaux from his cellar though many many dots would need to be connected if the data flow stopped right at this moment the troll couldnt have been happier the information being stored on his servers represented thousands upon thousands of manhours which he would never have to expend but more importantly would never have to pay for riding the heady wave of windfall the troll decided a little semiretirement party was in order there would be kobe beef for argus and drako and for himself three of the most exquisite girls a certain mariscala he knew in madrid would be more than happy to provide after emailing a request for the womans most recent catalog the troll placed an order for hampers full of the most outrageous delicacies london s fortnum amp mason had to offercaviar aged cheeses foie gras charcuterie pies chocolate and chutneys it was going to be the party to end all parties the georgian castoff had hit the ultimate jackpot forty except for the ids harvath had recovered from geneva diamond and jewelry exchange the scene had been a complete bust in fact it had raised more questions than it had answered which left them with only one remaining leadthe upper west side location since they were not that far from where harvath had parked they swung by to grab his bugout bag as only soldiers could cates hastings and morgan marveled at harvaths customdesigned highend tactical electronics pack as well as the wide variety of goodies it held dumping it out in the rear cargo area harvath began repacking it with just the essentials he thought he might need only to have bob say several times you wont need that nope that either finally with bobs seal of approval the bag was packed and harvath changed out of his jeans and polo shirt into a pair of tactical tdu trousers an under armour shirt a blackhawk tactical vest and his original swat desert boots he was now ready for anything or so he hoped the team jumped back on their motorbikes raced out of the garage and headed north toward th street inside the transcon building the carnage was almost identical to geneva diamond the assailants had apparently entered via two breaching pointsa front and side door the men and women who worked inside were dressed in business attire and possessed a fair amount of weaponry the weapons though had done them little good their dead bodies were sprawled across the floors or slumped over desks that were slick with blood while the walls were strikepointed with multiplecaliber bullet holes jesus christ exclaimed cates as he surveyed the damage who the hell is doing this more importantly why are they doing this asked hastings paul morgan looked at harvath and asked whats the connection between these two places harvath was asking himself the same question but so far he wasnt coming up with any answers lets split up and take a look around if you find anything out of the ordinary let me know out of the ordinary replied cates as he looked around whats ordinary at this point space aliens you know what hes talking about said herrington were all equally in the dark here cates didnt buy it he had a feeling harvath knew more than he was letting on but he snapped herrington a halfassed salute and walked down the hallway what do you think asked bob once the rest of the team had dispersed harvath took a slow glance around the room the smell of blood and cordite tapdancing a little too heavily on his already uneasy stomach i dont know what to think he responded obviously these places were fronts for something but what and why are the terrorists so interested in them after a successful series of attacks on major new york targets why hang around to do this harvath swept his arm in a wide arc taking in the devastation around them it doesnt make sense its smalltime compared to what theyve already accomplished herrington studied the scene for several moments and then said maybe this has to do with why they were trying to draw off the cream harvath wasnt following him the hostage crisis in the bronx the fire at the emergency command center in brooklyn the sniper targeting aircraft at laguardia all of it served to tie up highend tactical assets in those boroughs and potentially draw more away from manhattan then the bridges and tunnels go and every available local state or federal law enforcement officer rushes to the scene of the nearest attack rolls up his or her sleeves and starts helping pull people out theyre heroesdont get me wrongbut one of the things you rarely hear talked about when people discuss what went wrong on september eleventh is that too many people wanted to be a hero that day it wasnt like new orleans after the hurricane hit and the levees broke and cops abandoned their posts in new york all of the police fire paramedics and everyone at federal plaza rushed to the world trade center on to help they saw it as their duty and right or wrong they ignored their commanders and ran down there as fast as they could what if somebody was counting on that happening again harvath looked at his friend are you telling me you think the attacks on the bridges and tunnels were diversions bob shrugged his shoulders i dont know you tell me why shut down the air traffic control system why have snipers target boats and helicopters around manhattan that had been troubling harvath as well and there was only one answer he could come up with to prevent it from being reinforced and why wouldnt you want the island reinforced because having to engage reinforcements would either hinder your escape or prevent you from accomplishing your primary objective harvath shook his head thats where this thing loses me weve been saying for years that another attack is not a question of if but when and now its happened the death toll from the bridge and tunnel attacks is easily going to exceed so how can that not have been their primary objective thats the problem with the way we look at these asshats replied herrington too often we give them credit for being a lot smarter than they actually are it makes us feel better that way when they beat us but ill tell you something taking out those bridges and tunnels isnt really an issue of smarts its an issue of manpower you throw enough manpower at any problem and you can solve it especially when your manpower is willing to die to achieve your goal for you but were talking about a lot of manpower here replied harvath the shitbag we interrogated at the first precinct proves they had some sort of redundancies in place two backups three backups so what look at the london bombings look at madrid they just took manhattan and threw more manpower at it thats all even if we never know exactly how they did it they did it and thats all that matters at this point okay said harvath playing devils advocate for a moment suppose everything youre saying is correct and the bridges and tunnels the snipers rpgs and atc site bombings are all intended to isolate manhattan and prevent reinforcements from interfering with the terrorists primary objective from what we can tell they hit this location and then moved to midtown to hit the other in the diamond district what are they after thats the hundredthousanddollar question replied herrington if we can figure that out we might have a shot at stopping them if you want my opinion i vote we go back and convince the nypd to turn over your pal with the overactive salivary glands so we can take him somewhere and interrogate him properly this time herrington had a point the surviving terrorist was the only concrete lead they had as a plan began to form in harvaths mind he suddenly wondered if maybe dead men could tell tales fortyone three replied kevin mccauliff as harvath readied his pen to take down the information each from a different phone in the group but all to the same number harvath had chastised himself for not thinking of this earlier if they knew which phones the suicide bombers had been using it made sense to check on their call records it was mccauliffs mention of a contact at nextel that had planted the seed in the back of harvaths mind and what were you able to find out about the number asked harvath mccauliff drew in a deep breath and said youre not going to like this unless youre going to tell me that these guys were dialing the front desk at the defense intelligence agency i think i can handle it the calls went to an alphanumeric pager purchased two weeks ago which was paid for in cash along with upfront local service oneway or twoway pager oneway answered mccauliff vhf frequency with really no way to trace it youre right replied harvath i dont like it the guy could be anywhere im sorry its not your fault thanks for checking into it for me thats what friends are for right listen if you need anything else call me back but if im away from my desk do me a favor and dont leave a message call me on my cell or send me a benign text okay im still pretty keen on keeping my job here and i never know when big brother is looking at my communications with those words a series of tumblers clicked in harvaths head excited by the idea that had just flashed across his mind he gripped his cell phone tighter and said if i asked you to could you send a text message to that alphanumeric pager and make it look like it came from the cell phone i liberated from the nypd sure replied mccauliff but why because i think maybe we can make mohammed come to the mountain fortytwo the white house jack rutledge looked up as carolyn leonard entered his office whats going on we just got an update from amandas detail agents in new york said the secret service agent is she all right shes at beth israel hospital now weve got agents en route from the manhattan field office as we speak thats not what i asked carolyn i asked if amandas all right we dont know sir apparently she stopped breathing on the way there and agent delacorte had to give her mouthtomouth oh my god theyre prepping her for surgery and we hope to have more information soon inform the hospital that ill want to talk with the doctors myself as soon as they know something in fact dr vennett is somewhere in the building i want her to be in on the call as well yes sir ill have someone find the surgeon general right away thank you carolyn once she had left the room the chief of staff said amandas a strong woman shell pull through dont worry rutledge laughed dont worry how could he not worry this was his twentyoneyearold daughter they were talking about for gods sake bringing the conversation back to what theyd been discussing when carolyn leonard had come in with her update charles anderson asked what about secretary driehaus let him wait maybe hell get bored and go back to his office hes the secretary of homeland security mr president you cant not see him he shouldnt be here chuck and you know it not now he should be back at dhs running his part of the operation i agree with you one hundred percent but the fact is hes here and more importantly the press knows hes here if you snub him its going to make people question how well this administration is handling this crisis damn it i dont have time for this his visit has nothing to do with this crisis the chief of staff softened his tone and said we know that but as far as hes concerned it has everything to do with it give him three minutes and then ill have rachel buzz with a call from one of our allies this way he gets to say his piece and wont be able to claim that you wouldnt see him fine said rutledge ill do it but i want you to know that i think this is a mistake i know you do lets get it over with show him in anderson buzzed the presidents secretary in the outer office and told her they were ready ten seconds later the door to the oval office opened and alan driehaus walked in thank you for seeing me mr president said driehaus as he shook the presidents hand of course alan please take a seat replied rutledge as he sat back down ive only got a couple of minutes so why dont you tell me what it is you couldnt address over the phone i thought i explained myself to chuck and i have to be honest with you alan i told chuck i didnt think now was the time to be discussing this not with everything else happening i can understand that mr president but i have several pieces of intelligence which i find quite disturbing such as first of all i have it on good authority that less than twentyfour hours ago an agent or agents of the united states government crossed illegally into the sovereign nation of canada and then assaulted and kidnapped a guest of that country who had been granted political asylum rutledge shot his chief of staff a look conveying how angry he was to be having this meeting and then turned back to driehaus and asked why dont you tell me who this good authority is that youre basing this rather serious accusation on id rather not mr president id rather you tell me if it is true or not rutledges rope was very short today and he was quickly coming to the end of it raising his voice he replied how dare you come into this office and make demands of me in case youve forgotten alan im the president of the united states and you work for me the presidents reaction was answer enough there was only one more question driehaus had i understand we intercepted terrorist chatter indicating they not only knew we had violated another countrys sovereignty abducted a foreign national and brought him to america against his will but in particular the chatter stated that we had brought the person in question to new york city of all places is this true rutledge leaned back in his chair and said you and i have nothing further to discuss this meeting is over youre right mr president said driehaus as he rose from his chair and removed an envelope from his breast pocket placing it on the edge of the presidents desk he said i can no longer support the policies of this administration i will remain at my post for as long as you and my country need me to help get through this crisis but then im gone ive left my resignation undated fill it in whenever you see fit as driehaus headed for the door the president said that isnt necessary alan the secretary turned a pulse of hope coursing through his body maybe the president could be made to see things the right way but the mans hopes were dashed as the president picked up a pen and said ill fill todays date in right now fortythree new york city in an ambush the enemy sets the time but the attacker gets to set the place and that was exactly what harvath and the rest of the team had done the trick was to select a good location that was also within a reasonable distance of the geneva diamond and jewelry exchange kevin mccauliff felt relatively confident that he was going to be able to spoof what they all hoped was the lead terrorists pager the idea was to make it look like it was receiving positioning updates from the cell phone of the captured middle eastern man whose backpack had failed to explode and who was currently cooling his heels in an nypd jail cell while it might be very odd for the lead terrorists pager to be getting updates it might just be odd enough to pique his interest and cause him to look into why the failed bomber was apparently trying to reconnect and if the lead man tries to call or message our guys cell phone asked herrington it doesnt matter no cell phones except for first responders and law enforcement are working now anyway kevins pal at nextel says hell make sure all anyone gets when they dial the number is a fast busy signal and any text messages will fail to go through all we have to do is keep the updates coming sporadically enough to keep their interest said harvath it sounded like a reasonable enough plan though it potentially had two fatal flaws the team was divided over whether or not the terrorists would have had a contingency plana what to do if you cant hit your target or your bomb fails to go off if they did and one of the bombers diverged from that contingency planlike returning to a predetermined location and contacting an outside playerit might set off alarm bells and instead of drawing the remaining terrorists in actually push them away the second potential pitfall was whether or not the suicide bombers would have been privy to the rest of the operation it was another sticking point that could just as easily work against them as it could in their favor there was a third problem that they all agreed onthey had no idea who or what they were going to be looking for they could set up the worlds best ambush but if they couldnt identify their quarry how would they know when it was time to spring the trap in the end they decided they would just have to jump off that bridge when they came to it the south end of central park fit the ambush bill better than anything else they could think of it provided ample cover and concealment and multiple vantage points and with all of the mayhem across the city the people who had decided to congregate there away from tall buildings or other potential terrorist targets were by and large in the open expanse of the sheep meadow that was a big plus as the last thing they wanted was unnecessary collateral damage or a ready supply of potential hostages if the ambush went sideways which at this point none of them were prepared to rule out their goal was to draw the terrorists into the narrow area just north of the underpass that ran beneath the th street transverse known as the denesmouth arch from there bullet bob the teams most skilled longgun shooter would have an unobstructed field of fire from both directions though he couldnt argue with harvaths rationale herrington would have much rather preferred being with the rest of the team the idea of not being in on the actual ambush didnt sit well with him at all with the light fading harvath took tracy hastings aside and handed her the nightvision device from his bugout bag so youve got no problem giving the girl with one eye a monocular do i look like i have a problem with it he replied as he pulled a pair of motorolas out of the pack then how come every time i turn around youre staring at my face without even thinking about it harvath looked away from her you remind me of somebody thats all ill bet i do she replied not taking him seriously listen being an eod tech youve been trained to pay attention to the smallest details and thats what we need right now as long as you pull your weight i dont give a damn that youre a woman and as far as having only one eye i dont care about that either you got a nightvision monocular because thats all i have with me hastings was surprised by his honesty thats it thats it replied harvath as he turned and walked away to assign cates and morgan their positions fortyfour abdul ali was beyond angry either hussein nassir had lost his nerve or his bomb had failed to detonate regardless the jordanian peasant would undoubtedly choose the latter as his excuse the mans involvement had been a mistake ali could see that now but a beggar could seldom choose from whom he received his alms the operation had necessitated the activation of almost every sleeper alqaeda had within the united states and even then additional men had to be smuggled in from both canada and mexico martyring oneself at least in an operation of this nature did not call for a superior intellect not even superior courage but rather a blinding faith that ones reward would be delivered in paradise that said nassir was a fool who was putting the rest of the operation in jeopardy by trying to track the team down how he knew where they were was beyond ali all he knew was that keeping the details of an operation of this size quiet was very difficult someone must have told nassir more than he needed to know the positioning messages didnt lie the man had gone to both the transcon office and the geneva diamond exchange and now for some reason had situated himself in central park the idiot was going to get himself captured and would compromise everything ali had no choice but to go after nassir and secure him until the rest of their work was done then he would find out how he had learned about the rest of the operation though it was going to have a significant and detrimental impact upon their schedule ali instructed sacha to turn around and head for central park he just hoped he could get there before nassir made any more stupid mistakes and gave them all away fortyfive when gary lawlor fed the names harvath had collected at the two crush depth locations into the shared intelligence database he once again came up emptyhanded they were ghosts every one of themfiguratively and unfortunately now literally but while sterilizing civilian backgrounds was one thing gary had a feeling that erasing a marines life might be a little bit differentespecially if his only role had been to provide security picking up the phone he dialed the number for usmc lieutenant colonel sean olson the ropy fivefootsix olson was a graduate of the fbis law enforcement leadership program known as the national academy conducted on the bureaus quantico virginia campus the program included courses in law behavioral science forensic science leadership development communication and health and fitness its expressed mission was to promote the personal and professional development of law enforcement leaders but many argued that the most valuable thing that was formed at the national academy were the incredible relationships and vast network of contacts among its graduates lieutenant colonel olson was head of the law enforcement security amp corrections branch for the entire marine corps if anyone could get lawlor the information he needed on the mystery marines it was his fellow national academy graduate sean olson im neckdeep in shit right now gary said the lieutenant colonel when his assistant put the call through so im going to save us both a lot of time what do you need lawlor appreciated his colleague getting right to the point and he returned the favor sean weve got reason to believe that the bridges and tunnels in new york werent the only targets jesus christ replied olson as his attitude shifted from impatience to genuine concern you think theres going to be more we believe there already have been the man was shocked where how come we havent heard of it here if by here olson meant the marine corps security division it was easily explainable but if by here he really meant the pentagon then lawlor wasnt so sure the deep crush attacks hadnt been heard about this is a very delicate situation the attacks im referring to were not civilian targets what were they military government thats just it we dont know weve got two locations in manhattan that appear to have been involved in some sort of covert operationstheres nothing about them or their employees that we can pull from any of our databases the only connections we can find between them are that everyone was well armed and all the work they were doing was via paperless workstations and how were these locations attacked asked olson as he shifted the phone to his other ear from what we can tell two assaulter teams hit each location and gunned down everyone inside what for we dont know replied lawlor gary i appreciate the update offered the lieutenant colonel but why are you telling me all of this because three of those killed were us marines i need to find out who they were and what they were doing there olson was already running on an unstable fuel of adrenaline and pure hatred of islamic terrorists but to now hear that on top of everything else today the terrorists had purposely taken out three marines sent him around the bend it took all he had to keep his anger under control and craft a professional unobscenityladen response believe me i would like to help you but this is way above my purview you need to get in touch with dod directly thats just it replied lawlor i cant why the hell cant you youve got three marines dead not to mention a bunch of their civilian colleagues im pretty confident theyll make this a priority just give me five minutes sean to explain if after that you still dont think you can help me ill find somebody else olson reluctantly agreed threeandahalf minutes later the lieutenant colonel had heard enough he hung up with lawlor called his assistant into his office and began giving orders getting to the bottom of what had happened to those marines was now one of his top priorities fortysix the chechens had never met hussein nassir in fact they hadnt met any of alis bombers so asking them to find him and bring him in was out of the question besides it was alis mess it was he who should clean it up changing into street clothes ali secreted a ninemillimeter spanish firestar pistol inside a copy of the new york post tucked it beneath his arm and had the team drop him on central park south though ali had studied his map well the park was still unfamiliar territory and made him nervous he had decided on his way over that this was not going to be a rescue he was going to put a bullet in hussein nassirs head and hide his body so that by the time it was found it would be too late to make any difference from what ali could tell the last three messages to his pager placed nassir somewhere near the central park zoo at least the fool hadnt forgotten all of his training the area was normally well frequented by tourists many of them foreigners and if he remained calm there was no reason he would draw any undue attention to himself the more disturbing offshoot of that logic was what would a middle eastern man or anyone else for that matter be doing at the zoo when new york had just suffered the worst terrorist attack in history anyone with any sense especially a middle eastern man would not be wandering the city but would be off the streets enjoying the safety and concealment of his home or hotel room nassir was an even bigger idiot than ali gave him credit for ali bore no concern over his own appearance his surgeries had softened his middle eastern features and he was often told he looked more sicilian than anything else if put to the test his italian was exceptional and even a native speaker would be hardpressed to question his pedigree approaching from the southwest ali decided to avoid the more direct thoroughfare into the zoo for as long as possible though he had precious little time at his disposal he tried not to rush something was beginning to trouble him about the situation coming alone might have been a mistake he radioed the chechens to ascertain their positions but it did little to calm his unease they needed to keep moving staying in one spot too long risked discovery though they spoke english it was heavily accented only ali could have passed for an american and without him in the lead vehicle they were asking for trouble by just sitting in one spot waiting for him a very nervous part of him hoped that ordering them to keep moving was the right decision emerging from beneath the somewhat hidden and rarely used inscope arch alis senses were on fire he climbed the short flight of stairs at the end of the underpass and found himself on the pathway known as the wien walk making his way toward the zoo ali scanned the area for any sign that he was walking into a trap he passed a group of peoplethree women and a manwho were obviously distraught over the bombings and felt nothing but contempt for them what they had experienced today was only the beginning for america it had proven it would never learn its lesson and therefore it would drink from the same bitter cup it had forced on the muslim world for decades arriving at the zoo ali was eager to finish his business and be on his way he soon discovered that everything was closedincluding the café where he had expected to find nassir he would have to comb the area as he did he lost even more time with every minute he wasted he vowed to make nassirs death as painful as possible nearing the building known as the armory ali noticed a figure up ahead even though it was from the back he could tell it was a man about the same height and build as hussein nassir he was sitting alone wrapped in a mylar space blanket the kind given to runners after a marathon or to victims needing to stave off shock after a major calamity such as a terrorist attack abdul ali was confident that he had found his man reaching inside his newyork post he wrapped his hand around the butt of the firestar and quickened his pace it would all be over in just a matter of moments now fortyseven tracy hastings spoke into the microphone hidden beneath her collar and said contact probable target thirty yards and closing midforties dark hair wearing dark trousers and a black buttondown shirt is this our guy tracy asked harvath from his position on the other side of the denesmouth arch he doesnt look very middle easternmaybe spanish or italian but i cant say for sure is he carrying anything just a newspaper hows he carrying it said harvath under his left arm can you see his hands negative theyre folded across his chest one looks like it might be actually inside the paper that was enough for harvath he signaled herrington and said into the radio i need you to tag him for bob and then see if hes got any trailers you know what to do be careful roger that replied hastings getting up from the bench she had been sitting on tracy headed south on the wien walk toward the suspect with a concerned look on her face she removed her cell phone from her pocket and began sweeping it through the air as if she were trying to get a signal as she neared the man in the dark shirt and trousers she stopped and did a complete threesixty holding the phone high in the air though she pretended to be too wrapped up in finding cell service to notice she could feel the mans eyes all over her it wasnt the same feeling she got when people stared at the scars on her face this was something completely different it gave her chills but she had tagged him and right now herrington would be tracking him with his rifle she kept walking and once she was convinced no one was following the man she cradled the cell phone against her shoulder and spoke into her collar hes alone hastings waited for a confirmation that harvath had received her message and when none came she repeated it again still there was nothing scot can you read me she asked when there was still no response she knew something very bad had happened drop your weapons and keep your hands where i can see them said a voice from behind both harvath and cates did as they were told the man on the bench the voice said your buddy in the space blanket tell him to come over here take it easy replied harvath were legit do it commanded the voice harvath heard the unmistakable click of a pistol hammer being cocked and so he signaled paul morgan to get up and join them when morgan approached their captor ordered him to drop his weapons and get his hands up harvath nodded his head and morgan reluctantly complied dropping his machine pistol there was a crashing through the brush ten yards away and they all turned to see bob herrington forced onto the path by a second nypd mounted patrol officer who had found him on the arch the cops had ruined their ambush their target had picked up on the commotion and was now walking away in the other direction harvath had to do something im with the department of homeland security weve got a potential terrorist subject nearby on the groundnow replied the cop the man was very jumpy stumbling upon a bunch of heavily armed plainclothed people hiding in central park right after a string of devastating terrorist attacks was extremely serious harvath needed to tread very carefully ive got my badge in my pocket he said nobody wants any trouble here okay im just going to reach for my wallet youre not reaching for anything this is the last time im going to say it commanded the officer as his partner radioed for backup everybody on the groundnow youre interfering with a highly sensitive counterterrorism operation i dont know what the hell weve stumbled onto here and until i do youre going to do as i say harvath had no choice but to comply listen he said as he lay down on the ground theres a man retreating along the pathwaydark hair midforties with dark pants and shirt he looks spanish or italian thats who we were waiting for he may be connected to todays bombings we need to apprehend him for questioning please the officer looked down at harvath and then over at his partner frank you wanna take a look sure replied the partner why not before harvath could object the officers horse crunched through the brush and clattered out onto the paved walkway its hoofbeats echoing like machinegun fire off the stone walls of the denesmouth arch you see anything yelled the first officer nope replied the partner who then said wait a second yeah i think i do wait here ill be right back spurring his horse into a trot the partner rode along the pathway and disappeared beneath the arch youre making a mistake said harvath first you want us to apprehend the guy and now were making a mistake said the cop in his thick new york accent whats wrong with you you retarded or something he didnt want you to go dumbass replied herrington he wanted us to watch your mouth smart guy your partners going to scare him off said morgan or worse added cates okay everybody shut up demanded the mounted patrolman you homeland security he said as he pointed his pistol at harvath i want you to very slowly use your left hand to remove your creds from your pocket remember very slowly suddenly there was a burst of activity over the officers radio as his partner yelled the suspect is fleeing west towards fifth avenue and the sixtyfourth street exit onebakereleven in pur the transmission was cut short by the unmistakable crack of gunfire the officer who had remained behind to watch harvath and the other three men radioed shots fired to his dispatcher and then said onebakereleven come in frank talk to me what the hell is going on here said harvath as he flipped open his wallet and revealed his id were legit let us up the cop was torn on one hand his partner could be in grave danger and on the other all he could think about was how timothy mcveigh had been captured by an alert highway patrolman shortly after the oklahoma city bombing while everyone had been looking for arabs that officer had been smart enough to realize that mcveigh and the circumstances under which he was stopped warranted a closer look it was just as true here the cop couldnt let these people go id or no id no dice everybody stay where you are harvath couldnt believe it our suspects getting away and your partner could be dying or dead for all you know onebakereleven this is onebakertwelve talk to me frank god damn it talk to me harvath was about to appeal to the officer again when a voice came over the earpiece attached to his motorola he listened to it for several seconds and then said to the patrolman ive shown you my id and im going to stand up now if you want to shoot a fellow law enforcement officer thats up to you but im not going to lose that suspect i swear to god said the cop if you move i will shoot you i dont think so replied harvath as he slid his hands off his back and placed them palmsdown like he was about to do pushups this is your last warning barked the patrolman as he steadied his weapon and took aim suddenly the welltrained police horse reared up on its hind legs the officer was taken completely by surprise as tracy hastingss deftly wielded tree limb connected with his chest and knocked him from his mount to the mans credit he managed to hold on to his weapon but it made little difference cates got to the patrolman before he could find his feet and quickly stripped him of his gun cuff him said harvath as he approached the startled horse grabbed the reins and swung up into the saddle what the hell are you doing im going after our suspect fortyeight it had been a long time since harvath had ridden a horse and he quickly discovered that riding one on pavement was nothing at all like riding on grass or sand racing out from under the delacorte clock the horse slipped and harvath thought for sure they were going down but the animal righted itself and then lunged forward on the north side of the armory harvath saw the other horse and just beyond it the second patrolmanboth had been shot both were on the ground and neither was moving harvath radioed the information back to tracy hastings and kept riding toward the parks th street exit once he emerged onto the sidewalk at fifth avenue he looked in every direction but couldnt see the suspect then he noticed two black suvs identical to the ones from the satellite imagery turn down th street and head east it had to be them with their flashing red and blue strobes the blackedout tahoes looked one hundred percent authentic it was incredibly brazen but in a city where both residents and law enforcement were used to getting out of the way of such vehicles the ploy made perfect sense after almost getting killed crossing fifth avenue harvath galloped up th street and tried to close in on the suvs had the street been wide open there was no way harvath could have ever caught them but with the traffic impeding the suvs getaway he actually had half a chance of catching up as soon as there were only four car lengths separating him from the nearest tahoe harvath drew hiscaliber h ampk usp compact and tried to synchronize himself with the rhythm of the horse they were on the sidewalk and the last thing harvath wanted was for one of his shots to go wide and for some innocent bystander to get caught in his line of fire squeezing off at least three rounds harvath blew out the rear window and drilled two holes through the tahoes rear tailgate doors if he didnt have the terrorists attention before he definitely had it now in fact he had everyones attention the drivers of the cars behind the tahoe panicked at the gunshots and slammed on their brakes causing a dangerous chainreaction collision from the backseat of the suv two men in black balaclavas raised submachine guns and opened fire harvath pulled up on the horses reins and as he did so the animal caught a round to the neck the beast slipped and once again lost its footing this time though it didnt recover harvath followed it headfirst straight down into the pavement fortynine when harvath came to the first thing he saw was bob herrington so much for operating as a team harvath didnt want to hear it and ignored his friend as he tried to move take it easy said bob dont try to get up too fast are you okay anything broken harvath slowed down and tried moving his fingers next he moved his toes and then worked his way through the rest of his body i think im okay what about the horse herrington looked over his shoulder then back at harvath and shook his head nope how about the cop by the armory asked harvath two rounds to the chest morgan had one of those quickclot sponges in his bag and got it on him right away probably saved his life i think hes going to make it harvath pushed himself into a sitting position and leaned back against a parked car he rubbed his brow along his shoulder to get some of the sweat out of his eyes and then saw that it wasnt sweat but blood dont worry said morgan the teams selfappointed medic as he pulled some supplies out of his pack including a tube of medical krazy glue known as dermabond youve got one hell of a road rash on the left side of your face but as long as we can get those cuts closed up i dont think its going to be too serious so much for me being the only pretty face in this group said hastings harvaths smile quickly turned into a wince as morgan swabbed his wounds with antiseptic we heard the shots from the park said cates were you able to hit any of them i dont think so what about faces or something distinct about the vehicle asked herrington at least four faces said harvath all covered and as for the vehicle its a latemodel black tahoe which now bears the distinction of having lost its rear window while gaining a bullet hole in each of its rear tailgate doors thats a start said herrington trying to remain upbeat and bolster his buddys spirits not a very good one but a start nonetheless so what youre telling us is that you got an nypd horse killed and yourself beat to shit for nothing asked cates as morgan began applying the dermabond to close his wounds harvath surrendered to the inevitable they had just blown their last and only lead holstering his weapon which hastings had found and now handed back to him harvath said yeah i guess it was all for nothing fifty washington dc please tell me youre calling because youve got something good to report said gary lawlor from his office at the pentagon lieutenant colonel sean olson replied ill let you judge for yourself how good this is lawlor grabbed a pen after finding a clean sheet of paper on his desk he said go ahead the men your agent identified in new york city are definitely activeduty marines at least they were as of their last fitness reports which was when eighteen months ago eighteen months ago replied lawlor dont the marines conduct fit reps every twelve yeah said olson but for some reason the paper trail on these marines stops exactly eighteen months ago any idea why based on what youve told me i think thats when someone took them off book that would make sense said lawlor were you able to find out anything else they were all marine security guard school graduates and had been doing embassy security where pretty much all over the place but one thing they had in common was that they each had requested highrisk postings what do you mean by highrisk they wanted to serve embassies that were operating under very high threat levels like bogotá athens kabul baghdadyou name it and these guys were not only willing but wanted to go can you place them together at msg school or in one of the embassy postings there must be a bigger connection that was one of the first things i looked for but they all graduated from different classes and never served at the same embassy at the same time either so whats that leave us with asked lawlor those avenues in particular dont leave us with anything but i dug a little deeper and found something that may be helpful im all ears olson pulled a file up on his computer and said while theyre deployed the marines are under the operational control of the state department but their coordination logistics and training is still handled by the marine security battalion out of quantico and heres where it gets interesting the battalion maintains a lowkey group of force readiness officers responsible for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of marine security guard details in over one hundred and thirty embassies and consulates worldwide the same force readiness officer filed very complimentary reports for the three marines whose names you gave me as well as at least fifteen more all of whom had their trails wiped clean as of eighteen months ago you think this guy recruited these marines into whatever offbook operation were looking at in new york all i can say is that i think its worth checking into fiftyone captain bill forresters small english tudor was on a quiet street in an equally quiet neighborhood in north arlington virginia everything about it suggested it was inhabited by a normal unassuming citizenright down to the greengray subaru outback parked in the driveway what gave him away as something more were the marine corps and pow flags hanging from a pole above the front door parking his car in the street and walking up the flagstone pathway gary lawlor hoped the subaru meant that somebody was home he rang the doorbell and waited moments later a solidly built man in his midfifties with saltandpepper hair cut high and tight answered the door and said can i help you gary raised his id and said captain forrester yes replied the marine im agent lawlor from the department of homeland security im investigating the terrorist attacks of this afternoon and i need to ask you a few questions why would you want to talk to me may i come inside please forrester opened the screen door and showed lawlor inside to a bland kitchen with cheap cabinets and yellow wallpaper he pointed to a table with a view of the backyard and told his visitor to have a seat can i get you something to drink he asked ill take a beer if youve got it replied gary its been a long day forrester didnt know what to make of a federal agent having a beer on company time but something told him this dhs operative was not all he seemed to be you want a glass he asked as he withdrew two beers from the fridge please forrester poured the beers handed one to lawlor and said what can i do for the department of homeland security gary slid the printouts of three service photos olson had emailed him across the table do you recognize these men the captain studied the photographs for a moment slid them back across the table and said no i dont if you need a little more time thats okay im pretty good with faces agent lawlor if i say i dont recognize someone i dont recognize them from your glowing assessments i would have thought these marines unforgettable the man was toying with him and forrester didnt like it what do you want removing the rest of the photos and sliding them across the table lawlor replied i want to talk about the recruiting operation youve been running out of the marine security battalion i dont know what youre talking about ive read assessment reports for each of the marines in those pictures and they were all written by you forrester took a long swallow of beer using the time to carefully craft his response as he set the glass down on the table he looked at lawlor and said i assess hundreds of marines every year so what not like these these marines were exceptional and eighteen months ago the ones you gave the highest marks to dropped off the grid the captain rolled the base of his glass on the tabletop and fixed his guest with a steady gaze youre talking to the wrong guy why because you really dont know what im talking about or you were just following orders captain forrester i dont have a lot of time so im going to cut to the chase of those marines the first three i showed you are dead they were killed today we think by the same group responsible for blowing up the bridges and tunnels in new york and something tells me that more marines are going to die very soon if you dont help me out fiftytwo east th street new york city satisfied asked mike jaffe as he turned off the monitor brad harper was stunned so those were female dia operatives dressed to look like his kids why do you think the camera never made it into the bathroom until their heads were already bent over the edge of the tub why didnt you just tell me because you wouldnt have given it the same reaction replied jaffe it was perfect worthy of an academy award but i wasnt acting i know thats why it was so perfect mohammed would have smelled the good copbad cop routine a mile away right now he thinks youre terrified of my methods if he thinks you believe im unstable and will stop at nothing then hes going to start believing it too harper didnt like being used so are we good here asked jaffe in response to the marines silence harper wasnt quite sure how to respond to that are we good repeated jaffe slowly and deliberately the subtext was obvious jaffe wanted to know if harper was going to continue to play ball or if he had some sort of a problem that needed to be addressed harper had some serious doubts as to how jaffe might handle any dissension after all the man had pointed a loaded pistol at his head pointblank as long as the kids were out of the picture and no longer potential casualties he figured he could go along with almost anything else jaffe had up his sleeve harper nodded his head and said yeah were good excellent ive got three large rolls of visqueen in the office at the end of the hall i want you to go get them its going to get pretty bloody in there excuse me replied the young marine visqueen repeated jaffe rolls of plastic sheeting i know what visqueen is what are we going to need it for i just told you right after you told me we were good did i misunderstand something no said harper no sir corrected jaffe harper wanted to deck this deranged piece of shit but he choked the impulse back and responded no sir good because id hate to think you were going soft on me harper i asked for marines on this assignment because marines are tough marines have got guts and were gonna need all the guts we have to face down these two shitbags in the other room i understand said harper but plastic sheeting are we really going to need it its not for us its for the two foreign intelligence agents who are assisting us they requested it rashid and hassan what are they going to do with it theyre probably going to use it to keep blood off the walls and off the carpeting harper had figured things were going to really get ugly at some point but the ugly he had anticipated was from psychological stress applied to their captives they were in new york city for christs sake not some thirdworld torture chamber jaffe could read the young marines mind just by looking at him whatd you think this was going to be son we call them a few names withhold everything but highsugar foods keep them up for days on end until they eventually crack tell us what we want to know and then we go home to sleep in our warm beds with crystal clear consciences is that how you saw it going down because if you did youre not the manwait scratch thatyoure not the marine i thought you were sir i respect your command but im going to ask you not to impugn my integrity as a united states marine fuck that said jaffe getting into the taller mans face duty honor courage fuck all of that thats why guys like humpty and dumpty in the other room are beating us in the war on terror the man was nuts harper was sure of it and because he was nuts harper also knew that he couldnt be reasoned with you dont believe me said jaffe no sir i believe whatever you say replied harper bullshit marine its written all over your face you think im a few cans shy of a sixpack dont you no sir i didnt say quit lying to me son i can smell it from a mile away you think im nuts thats fine by me i probably am to have taken this job and stayed with it as long as i have but ill tell you one thing if we dont start executing this war on terror in the correct fashion were going to be overrun were fighting for our civilizations very survival here they might not talk about it that way in the newspapers or on the evening news but that is exactly whats happening your country is depending on you its depending on us you and me and thats why what were doing here matters it matters bigtime because if we dont stop these guys from going nuclear thousands if not hundreds of thousandsmaybe millions of innocent people are going to die so keep that in mind the next time you want to question how im running this interrogation are we clear yes sir replied harper flatly good now go get the visqueen fiftythree the white house i know youre distraught over amandas surgery but you cant be serious tell me youre not serious pleaded charles anderson i couldnt be more so chuck replied the president the chief of staff threw his hands up in defeat of course you are youve declared war on islam and then you fired the secretary of homeland security a trip to new york with the terrorists still at large would be the icing on the cake itll be a public relations trifecta should i get geoff in here to draft a release first of all i didnt declare war on islam weve already been through that secondly i didnt fire driehaushe resigned no you didnt fire him but you didnt prevent him from resigning either semantics what difference does it make it makes a lot of difference to you to this presidency id also make the case that to have him step down in the middle of all this erodes public confidence in our government that certainly wasnt the case when the fema director bowed out in the aftermath of katrina the key word there mr president is aftermath besides the fema chief was inept and everyone knew it i think letting driehaus go in the middle of a horrific national crisis is a very bad idea the hell it is chuck dhs isnt working and we all know it im not going to let alan driehaus bully this office he calls himself a patriot well let me tell you something a patriot doesnt pull petty political gamesmanship in the middle of a crisis you put your personal problems aside and you put the welfare of your country above all else he couldnt do that so hes out anderson thought about it maybe there is a way we can use his resignation to our advantage anyone with half a brain will read between the lines and believe he resigned because he mishandled the terrorist threat that could work for us no way said rutledge were not going to throw driehaus to the wolves just to divert attention away from what happened why not you think the american people wanted accountability after theyre going to be packing the streets demanding a lot more than accountability this time theyre going to want blood and plenty of it and why shouldnt they their government has failed to protect them again so why shouldnt driehaus be the first one to the guillotine with each one we throw them the bloodlust will ebb or itll surge blood is a funny thing chuckespecially in politics once people get a taste of it they often want more and more and more so were not throwing anyone under the bus yet im going to personally call for full and open hearings when the dust has settled i want total transparency the american people are going to agree to nothing less its the only thing that is going to help restore the sacred trust because ill tell you what today that trust has been utterly shattered now lets get working on my visit to new york i want us to be under way asap with all due respect sir shes my daughter for christs sake chuck this is what fathers do fathers maybe but not presidents sir rutledge wasnt going to be swayed asap fine said anderson the resignation in his voice thick with sarcasm should we use air force one or do you want me to see if the tooth fairy is flying up that way i think we may actually have her cell phone number watch it chuck not only does my daughter need me the american people need to see their president in new york city im sorry sir i agree with you but all of this should and will be put together in due time right now we cant even get the national guard into manhattan the terrorists have the entire island locked down including the air space how are we supposed to accomplish what even our military cant do at this point thats not my problem its yours talk to the secret service i dont need to talk to the secret service i already know what theyll say in fact wait a second opening the door anderson stuck his head into the hall and said carolyn can you come here a moment please yes sir mr anderson what do you need replied the head of jack rutledges protective detail as she stepped into the doorway the president wants to go to new york city stated the chief of staff manhattan to be precise of course were already starting to plan the logistics i dont think you understand the president wants to go now tonight looking up secret service agent carolyn leonard saw the presidents face and realized he was serious im sorry sir but thats not possible not just yet at least why not demanded rutledge its a war zone the fact that the terrorists have snipers with highpowered rifles and rpgs makes it an absolute nogo what do you want me to do carolyn sign a release absolving the secret service of any and all responsibility should something happen to me of course not sir i just want you to understand that theres no way we can guarantee your safety at this point youd make too attractive a target and not only to the terrorists are you suggesting there are americans who would want to harm me i cant say for sure sir all i know is that the situation on the ground is starting to heat up a bit heat up how asked the president there are reports that scattered looting and mob violence against immigrants and arabamericans has begun rutledge looked at his chief of staff its in the next briefing i didnt think youd want me bring you updates every three minutes we want to nail down whether these are isolated incidents or if were seeing some sort of groundswell said anderson rutledge was not happy with that answer all the more reason i should make a direct appeal to the people of new york from new york sir said leonard as she tried to suggest a compromise we could arrange for you to be someplace maybe upstatemaybe in the capitaland then take you in to manhattan once things cool down once things cool down whens that a week from now a month leonard understood the presidents anger everyone was angry right now the hard thing was directing that anger in the appropriate direction she knew the president didnt mean to take it out on her and she was enough of a professional to let it roll off her back what she needed to do was to persuade him against making the tripat least for the time being sir my job is to advise you of the risks and what course of action the secret service feels is best to assure your safety and wellbeing and if it were up to you id be locked in a bunker someplace right now yes sir but its not up to you its up to me thats correct sir carolyn my daughter is there i know sir but how do you think it would look to the people of new york if the president could get in to see his daughter when even the national guard hadnt been able to make it in yet to help assure order it might not look like you were truly there for the people of new york city she had a point and rutledge knew it frustrated he quietly pounded his fist on top of his desk and then nodded his head youre right thank you carolyn said the chief of staff as he showed her back into the hallway closing the door anderson looked at the president and said if you want another opinion ill get general currutt in here and let him give you the joint chiefs take on trying to get into new york at this point the president sat down exhausted and replied that wont be necessary ill stay put for now but chuck yes replied the chief of staff as he stopped his hand on the doorknob i want results and i want them soon or i am going to new york even if i have to pilot my own plane to get there fiftyfour national security agency fort meade maryland mark schreiber dropped the printout onto joseph stantons already overcrowded desk and said that makes three nowtranscon geneva diamond and the strong box beneath the lincoln tunnel are you still going to sit there and tell me we dont have a problem on our hands take it easy replied stanton as he looked over the printout even if we wanted to theres nobody we can call for help now anyway theres got to be somebody there isnt are you serious we dont have a contingency for this for what mark we still dont know what were dealing with schreiber looked at his boss like he was nuts weve got three substations that are unresponsive unresponsive but still processing as far as we can tell clarified stanton new york has been overwhelmed give it a little more time thats what you said the last time i came in here and as the director of this program thats going to be my answer no matter how many times you come in here and ask what if the sites have been compromised ventured schreiber then we wouldnt be seeing any processing at all you know how the systems work mark you also know what the communication protocols are listen were all angry with whats happened today and were all concerned about the people we know and work with in new york but im only going to tell you this one more time stay focused on your job but what if we began schreiber but he was cut off by the ringing of stanton s phone its from upstairs he said as he pointed toward the ceiling and reached for the receiver i need to take this in private once schreiber had left the room and closed the door behind him stanton said why the hell are you contacting me on this line because you havent exactly been answering your cell phone said the caller if you turned on your television set once in a while youd see weve got our hands pretty full today fuller than you think what are you talking about replied stanton not over the phone we need to meet thats impossible not today yes today said the caller and i want you there in a half hour thats insane said stanton do you know what the traffic is like between here and there use one of the company helos weve got a major national crisis going on helicopters are for emergency use only at this point this is an emergency somebody knows about athena fiftyfive northern virginia the bell jetranger helicopter touched down in the parking lot of a large warehouse and out stepped joseph stanton with his heavyrimmed glasses seersucker suit and suede bucks he looked nothing like gary lawlor had pictured superspooks came in all shapes and sizes but this was the first time hed ever seen one who was a dead ringer for a sloppy warren buffett once they were sure stanton had come alone gary and bill forrester got out of the car and met him halfway across the parking lot the marine captain made the introductions and as lawlor began to speak stanton said not here wait till were inside inside turned out to be a wellappointed office suite at the back of the structure that stanton and forrester used for their meetings sitting down on a leather couch stanton smoothed out his trouser legs picked a few pieces of lint from inside one of the cuffs and then said okay what the fuck is going on ever the marine nobody bullied bill forrester especially not some ivy leaguer in a seersucker suit why dont you tell us joe its your op what do you mean tell us as far as im concerned captain the only us that should be in this room is you and me well suck it up said forrester because agent lawlor here might just be the only one able to save your bacon who says my bacon needs saving to begin with listen joe i didnt come out here to get jerked around neither did i good so lets save the my dicks bigger than your dick but i cant show it to you because we dont work for the same agency crap for the time being if youre suggesting captain that we bring agent lawlor into the know regarding athena thats not going to happen forrester had a very short fuse and burned real quick three of my marines are dead so yeah it is going to happen wait a second said stanton i havent heard anything about any marines being killed that doesnt surprise me they never were a priority in your opinion now i want some goddamn answers had you given me a little more insight into why you called this impromptu meeting maybe i would have been able to prepare some for you it was pretty apparent these two were not going to get very far if left to verbally slug it out so lawlor decided to step in mr stanton what is the athena program im sorry agent lawlor but i am not allowed to discuss nsa business without proper authorization forrester was disgusted with his arrogance i wanted you to hear it from him but if he wont tell you i will no you wont if it means preventing any more of my marines from dying then just watch me turning to gary the captain said the program is named after the greek goddess of wisdom as apparently the greeks didnt have a goddess of blackmail its a deepblackdatamining operation using both the echelon and carnivore systems the nsa has been gathering otherwise overlooked intelligence that can be used as leverage against various foreign concerns like alqaeda asked lawlor not completely understanding what forrester was getting at no more like governments heads of state and influential foreign businesspeople basically the athena program collects and sorts extremely dirty laundry once they have their teeth into something particularly juicy like the princess diana crash twa or yasir arafats death they assign teams of operatives to flush out the big picture and uncover as much supporting evidence as possible that way when it comes time to use it they have the victim pinned against the wall so tightly theres absolutely no room for him or her to wiggle free and if they uncover a conspiracy involving several powerful foreign figures its like hitting the jackpot youre going to jail for a very very long time forrester said stanton as he solemnly shook his head lawlor ignored him and asked the captain tell me about the locations in manhattan you already know about transcon and geneva diamond they were the first two tiers most of the field agents worked out of transcon because a limited amount of sensitive data was handled there and because all of the employees were field rated and came to work armed it was decided by mr stanton here that they didnt need extra securitya position i had always been against subsequently none of my marines were stationed there geneva diamond was the next step up thats where most of the data coming in is sifted sifted how asked lawlor dont say anything more bill cautioned stanton im warning you youre already in way over your head forrester disregarded the admonition and plowed ahead whatever intelligence is deemed political in nature goes to a facility hidden beneath the lincoln tunnel known as the strong box the location had been conceived during the cold war as a means to evacuate highranking alliednation un personnel from the city via submarine in the case of a nuclear attack but the project was eventually deemed unfeasible and abandoned the nsa quietly took over the space and used it as a signals intercept and deciphering station a stairwell is hidden in the south airshaft and allows access to the facility via a bogus storeroom at the new york waterway bus garage like geneva diamond with the high value of the work that goes on there and the fact that the employees are predominantly analysts my marines provide roundtheclock security as for the personal intelligence side of things which is often significantly more damning it goes to a rather ingenious location very near i warned you said stanton as he drew an extremely compactcaliber paraordnance p pistol from his suit pocket pointed it at forresters head and pulled the trigger fiftysix gary lawlor didnt wait for stanton to point the pistol at him instead he bolted for the door stanton fired just missing lawlors head and splintering the doorframe the man was insane first he killed an officer of the united states marine corps and now he was trying to take out a homeland security agent gary didnt have to think about what to do next his reaction was instinctual it was either him or stanton belying his age yet again lawlor dove for cover behind a long wooden credenza in the outer office and drew his beretta px storm there was a wheeled desk chair next to the credenza and he sent it spinning into the center of the room to draw stanton s fire as tufts of batting wafted up into the air lawlor came around the credenza on one knee and sent a wave ofcaliber lead right where the nsa man had just been firing from the problem though was that stanton knew what he was doing and quickly moved to a new location he wasnt going to be easy to kill mr stanton yelled lawlor after he had ducked back behind the safety of the credenza im only going to give you one chance i want you to throw your gun and then come out with your hands above your head do you understand me the security of those installations was forresters responsibility replied stanton it was a very outofplace response considering the situation mr stanton said lawlor throw out your weapon come out with your hands up and well talk about it from the other room stanton laughed sure we will these terms at not negotiable mr stanton he shouldnt have been talking i dont care what good he thought he was doing his marines he knew better than that mr stanton i am ordering you to come out of that room with your hands up right now replied lawlor one of the most beneficial intelligencegathering programs this country has ever developed and that idiot is ready to let it all out of the bag to save his precious marines marines die thats their job as stanton continued ranting lawlor crept from around the credenza and tried to maneuver himself for a better line of fire forrester put his needs and the needs of his marines above the people of this country yelled stanton do you have any idea how many lives have been spared because of this program it might not be the prettiest way to do business but its goddamn effective lawlor now had a clean line of sight into the inner office by the sound of stantons voice he was somewhere over to the right if he had to lawlor was fairly confident he could take him out by firing through the drywall but now that the playing field was a little more level he wanted to take the man alive if at all possible your times up mr stanton no more talking i want you to slide your weapon out the door and then follow with your hands clasped on top of your head once again stanton laughed thats not going to happen agent lawlor and you know it only one of us is going to walk out of this building today the question is which one gary didnt bother responding like he had said they were done talking if mr stanton thought only one of them was leaving the building alive he was in for a very big surprise a company called guardian protective devices of new jersey had approached the department of homeland security a while back with a very interesting pepper spray device very intelligently dhs had snapped up as many as they could get their hands on as did many other branches of the military intelligence and law enforcement communities as lawlor removed the small threeounce can from the tiny holster on his belt he was grateful for the ingenious set it and forget it feature it contained unlike most pepper sprays that required a button to be continually depressed or a trigger to be pulled to dispense its contents the guardian device had a mechanism that allowed the canister to be primed and thrown into a room where seconds later a fog of pepper spray would pour out making the space completely uninhabitable lawlor triggered the device pitched it inside the inner office and with his beretta up and at the ready waited for the nsa operative to stumble out hacking and choking when he did stanton came out with his gun blazing shooting in all directions and gary had no other choice but to return fire fiftyseven new york city you couldnt have just winged him asked harvath i had no time his bullets were way too close for comfort replied lawlor from his cell phone back in dc whatever was going on he and forrester took it to their graves together everyone at the nsa is being incredibly tightlipped including my contacts and despite the urgency of this situation all theyve said is that theyll get back to me theyre not even prepared to admit that stanton was one of theirs this was exactly the kind of bureaucratic bullshit that was encouraging harvath to seriously consider resigning his position so they dont care if their next location gets hit he asked they wont even admit there is a fourth location much less a first a second or a third what are we supposed to do youve got all the information i was able to get before stanton killed forrester i think you should make your way to the third location as quickly as possible and see if you can find out anything there and if we dont asked harvath listen replied lawlor this has been a hard day for everybody just see what you can do ill keep working things from this side fine but gary what if stanton thought this program was worth killing to protect and his people know youve uncovered it youd better watch your back i will dont worry replied lawlor just get to that strong box location and let me know what you find when they found the bodies of the slain employees in the back of the new york waterway bus garage harvath knew they were already too late nevertheless bob herrington led the way down the hidden stairwellthe more senseless destruction he saw the more the demons from his last mission in afghanistan seemed to haunt him he insisted on being on point and out of all the members on the team he was starting to concern harvath the most after making their way down the metal stairs the first thing the team noticed was the enormous door that had been blown off its hinges as they carefully entered the facility they saw that shrapnel had pitted both the walls and the ceiling whatever kind of bomb had gone off in here had done incredible damage blood was everywhere and several bodies had been sawed completely in half as harvath tried to pinpoint how long ago the attack had occurred the one thing he was confident of was that it had happened before their botched ambush in central park they couldnt have made it here in time even if they had wanted to what the hell hit this place said rick cates as he stepped around the bodies of what looked like three more dead marines this was no fragmentation grenade this was more like the type of bomb suicide bombers use replied tracy hastings who had witnessed the aftermath of suicide bombers more times than she cared to remember are you saying somebody walked in here and blew him or herself up asked harvath tracy looked around some more and then replied maybe all i can say is that i think were looking at a tight and very powerful package of plastique packed with ball bearings as the projectile any idea how it got in here tracy shook her head maybe the pizza guy brought it said cates as he bumped the edge of a personal panpizza box still sitting on someones desk the team spread out and combed the facility like the others before it it was all computerized now though they knew the reason why morgan found a functioning workstation but without a password he couldnt gain access to the system not only that but as harvath studied the shiny dials built into the frames of the computer displays he realized they werent cameras as several on the team had suspected but actually retinal scanners the athena program took the handling of its data very seriously it was hard to tell if anything had been stolen from what harvath and the rest of the team could tell everything seemed to be there it was just shot to hellincluding the employees the only thing that had avoided the carnage was the server room just like in the previous two locations but why risk so much just to take out the employees what the hell was alqaedas game was it some sort of payback and what did any of this have to do with sayed jamal and mike jaffe none of it made any sense that said harvath had a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach that once he did uncover the answers he was looking for he wasnt going to like them as they left the server room everyone was helping collect identification from the dead when herrington swung his weapon into the firing position and yelled nobody fucking move harvath and the rest of the team had no idea what the hell he was talking about until they noticed two strangers at the far end of the room pointing a pair of very nastylooking shortbarreled m viper machine guns at them the strangers ordered bob and the rest of the team to drop their weapons and remain absolutely still it was a mexican standoffalthough this time they wouldnt be able to count on tracy hastings sneaking up behind their adversaries with a big leafy tree branch everybody stay cool cautioned harvath what do you guys want what do we want demanded one of the strangers why dont we start with who the hell are you my names scot harvath and im with the department of homeland security who are the rest of these people the man asked indicating the rest of the team with the barrel of his weapon theyre with me who you are homeland security bullshit dhs doesnt have anything to do with this facility we do since captain william forrester was shot and killed less than an hour ago replied harvath captain forrester is dead as a doornail said morgan as he shouldered his weapon and pulled a halfliter of water from his pack tracy saw the men tense and begin applying pressure to their triggers paul are you nuts she responded quit screwing around youre going to get us all killed no im not said morgan and you know why because marines dont kill other marines fiftyeight once the two strangers had lowered their weapons and downed the water morgan had given them harvath asked what are you guys doing here its our shift said the lead man who identified himself as staff sergeant steve gonzalez united states marine corps with all the shit going on in the lincoln tunnel why didnt you come earlier asked herrington orders believe me tommy and i wanted to come down here as soon as we heard but it was against the protocol whose protocol replied harvath captain forresters said lance corporal thomas tecklin he ran us through every contingency he could think of the last thing he wanted was for any of the security personnel to be caught in a secondary blast meant to target newcomers rushing to the scene wait a second interjected gonzalez the bodies of his marine corps colleaguesand the people they were charged with protectinglittering the floor lets start by talking about what the hell happened here thats what were trying to find out said harvath captain forrester gave us this location gonzalez didnt believe harvath he wouldnt have done that this place is above top secret he didnt have a choice replied herrington who appreciated the mans loyalty to his mission and his commanding officer he didnt want to see any more of his marines die more repeated morgan what do you mean he didnt want to see more marines die what marines two other sites were hit said harvath he chose the words very carefully as he wanted to see how much the marines knew gonzalez was very concerned which sites transcon enterprises and geneva diamond and jewelry exchange jesus christ said tecklin how bad equally as bad as this no survivors who was it we believe it was alqaeda alqaeda why we dont know why answered harvath we were hoping that was something you could help us with is there anything in particular about the information being processed here that could be beneficial to them officially replied gonzalez we didnt know anything about the information that flows through here our job is to guard this site and unofficially unofficially people talk you know you couldnt help but overhear things here it was all political stuff some of it runofthemill dirty dealing and some of it extremely volatile like wellplaced spies in foreign governments murder coverups assassination plots coup attemptsit goes on and on there is stuff even hotter than that if you can believe it but the hotter it is the quieter everyone here iswasabout it at the end of the day we actually overheard very little and none of it directly valuable as far as alqaeda is concernedat least nothing i can think of that would justify all of this said the lead marine as he took in the devastated facility three locations and zero leads it was driving harvath nuts the more they uncovered the less sense it all made no matter how many steps they took forward they still couldnt seem to catch up with whoever was behind these attacks what about the fourth site he asked what fourth site said gonzalez sergeant we know there is a fourth and final site captain forrester mentioned it before he was killed if were correct thats exactly where the terrorists are headed next gonzalez didnt respond hes right replied tecklin we need to warn them quiet ordered gonzalez why these guys know about the fourth site and theyre right that the terrorists probably do too we dont know that sarge theyve hit three out of four id say the chances are pretty good alqaeda knows about the last location we cant just sit here and let our guys get killed weve got to warn them gonzalez was torn on one hand there were the lives of fellow marines at stake and on the other were a set of orders that didnt seem to make much sense at this point nevertheless orders were orders will you at least call the fourth location and warn them asked harvath it doesnt matter i already tried from one of the pay phones outside before we came in here no answer all i got was a fast busy signal and a circuits are overloaded response did you try calling transcon and geneva diamond gonzalez again nodded his head same thing youve got to tell us where that fourth location is im sorry but i cant discuss any other location or locations bob herrington had had enough for fucks sake sergeant those people are going to die over there if you dont help us out make a goddamn command decision i cant the hell you cant your co has been shot by the nsa program manager and at this point you are the most senior marine on site you think theyre going to court martial you for trying to save that other location the nsa program manager remarked tecklin gonzalez didnt want to know anything further hed made up his mind im sorry i have my orders well you and your orders can kiss my fucking ass said herrington i thought marines were smarter than this i guess i was wrong as bob walked away in disgust harvath pulled gonzalez aside and said steve ive got a lot of respect for your orders but at least take morgan and get over there you guys might be able to help even the odds the terrorists have enough players on their team to fill at least two tahoes the sergeant shook his head no can do weve got to secure this site and make sure no one else gets in or out until help arrives you know that could be quite a while it doesnt matter this information needs to be protected even if that means other marines might die gonzalez looked at harvath and slowly nodded his head come hell or high water he was going to stand his post in the process though several of his comrades were most likely going to lose their lives for a fleeting moment harvath wondered if they could muscle the marine and get him to crack but he decided against it as wrong as he believed the mans decision to be harvath wasnt going to torture a fellow serviceman faithfully executing his duty he was about to make one more impassioned plea soldier to soldier when paul morgan caught his attention and signaled that he needed to talk to him whats up said harvath as he crossed over to where morgan was standing i know where the fourth site is harvath couldnt believe it how tecklin gave it to me we both went through basic at camp pendleton it turns out we had the same di so because of a drill instructor he just gave the information to you no replied morgan his brother is part of the security detail at the fourth location when they joined the marines together they promised their old man theyd do everything they could to make sure nothing bad ever happened to the other he respects gonzalez but the way he sees it the marines not only taught him how to follow orders but also to react when old orders didnt make sense anymore and lives were on the line thats why he wanted us to have the location but wait till you hear where it is at first i thought he was pulling my leg but he swears its for real where is it wheres the fourth location morgan held up a diagram made by lance corporal tecklin and it made such perfect sense that harvath almost couldnt believe it fiftynine abdul ali watched as sacha drew his paraordnance pistol affixed its silencer and finished off his wounded comrade they had done all they could to save him but it was clear to everyone that khasan wasnt going to make it he was slowing them down and that made him a liability as cold as the decision was they had no choice their own survival necessitated the act just like the man who had been killed during the assault on geneva diamond khasans payment would be made to his family including the bonus at the end of the job sacha would see to it personally ali knew that the lead chechen as well as the rest of his men held him responsible for this most recent death ali had almost walked into an ambush in central park and had brought whoever had orchestrated it out after them the man on horseback had fired his first shot through the rear window of one of their tahoes hitting khasan at the base of the throat the mans next shot had gone straight through the tailgate killing the chechens dog ivan while the third shot had punched through the other side of the tailgate and missed by a matter of millimeters one of their men gunning from the backseat as far as ali was concerned the first shot was all that mattered the team was down two men now and still had two more locations to go with the rear window shattered and the back row of seats covered in khasans blood ali decided they not only needed to get rid of both the bodies they were carrying they needed to get rid of the damaged tahoe as well first though they needed to find a suitable vehicle as a replacement nearby in the tony lenox hill neighborhood sacha saw what they were looking for the allblack gmc yukon denali was as close to perfect as they were going to get three blocks later they dumped the damaged tahoe the bodies of their two dead comrades and the body of the woman from whom theyd just carjacked the denali they drove south toward midtown east and their next assault with multiple breaching points some distance apart at this location timing was going to be everything though ali would have preferred to have been on one of the streetlevel breaching teams he had no choice but to go with the team that would be coming up from underneath theirs was the most perilous trek and it was also the most likely to encounter resistance from inquisitive police officers if push came to shove only ali and his grasp of american english could help the subterranean team pull it off the denali sped toward th while the intact tahoe pulled up onto the sidewalk of th street and alis team unloaded its equipment startled onlookers backed away as men in balaclavas and black tactical gear set up a utility companystyle screen sparked a gentec portable acetylene torch and began to cut through the sidewalk grating once the grating was pulled free a high tinsel tripod complete with enormous rubber feet and a pulley and winch system was suspended above the opening a rope was fed through and abdul ali prepared to be the first one down the goal was to fastrope in as quickly as possible that all changed when only halfway down an mta officer spotted ali and reached for the radio mic clipped to his shoulder with the laser sight of his mp ali painted a red dot on the mans chest and pulled the trigger quieting any premature announcement of their arrival when ali hit the ground it took him several moments to pull the officers body from the platform and hide it beneath one of the nearby trains once he was done he radioed for the rest of the men to hurry up though rappelling in made much more sense than trying to gain access to the tracks by walking through the middle of grand central terminal ali wasnt going to feel safe until they had left this location far behind them his sixth sense was speaking to him again and he didnt like what it was saying once the rest of the team had joined him ali led the way across the tracks toward th street and the waldorfastorias secret railway platform built in the early s the platform provided vip guests with their own private railway carsa covert alternative to penn station or grand central terminal the platform had been used to gain access to the hotel by such notables as generals douglas macarthur and john pershing as well as president franklin d roosevelt who appreciated yet another feature of what became known among the cognoscenti as the waldorfs secret station in the middle of the platform was an enormous sixfootwide freight elevator capable of transporting roosevelts pound armorplated pierce arrow from the waldorf station up to a highly secure and cleverly hidden section of the hotels garage which had its own private exit in addition to being the official residence of the united states ambassador to the united nations abdul ali prayed to his god that the waldorfastoria was housing one other noteworthy guestmohammed bin mohammed approaching the freight elevator ali looked at his casio and paused to catch his breath three minutes later he entered the code given to him by the troll and listened to the hum of the elevator as it made its way down to the platform when it arrived the team worked quickly to get themselves into place once they were all situated ali depressed the button for the elevators one and only other stop and the team began its ascent when the man sitting in the emergency hatch gave the command ali halted the elevator the torch was quickly lifted up and the man set to work on the grate covering the old airshaft tunnel once it had been removed the rest of the team crawled inside sixty the marines guarding the entrance to the grail site so codenamed because its analysts handled the most valuable of the athena program intelligence had no idea what hit them when ali and his team burst from a wallmounted air duct with their guns blazing two additional teams simultaneously appeared from a hallway and a nearby stairwell dropping to the floor of their bulletproof cubicle the marines scrambled for their assault rifles alis men though didnt let up for even a fraction of a second in a perfectly choreographed ballet of deadly fire the chechens assaulted the security hut in wave after wave never giving the marines a chance to return fire so engaged neither ali nor his mercenaries noticed when a heavy metal plate was slid open in the upper corner of the wall behind the marines and a largecaliber machine gun opened fire two of the chechens were mowed right down their bodies torn to shreds by the heavy lead rounds falling back the teams retreated to their breaching points as sacha yelled orders to his men as the chechens directed all their fire toward the marines in the security booth and the opening in the wall where the machine gun had appeared sacha loaded a fastarming m highexplosive round into the mm grenade launcher mounted beneath his assault rifle and let the golf ballsized projectile rip when it connected the explosion was deafening and it not only succeeded in knocking out the machine gun but it tore a huge hole in the upper corner of the wall one of the chechens raced toward the security booth armed with his mm pistol and a goodsized shape charge but neither did him any good the two marines inside had opened a narrow slot in the bulletproof glass and began to return fire killing the man before he could reach their position by focusing fire on the slot the chechens were able to push the marines back and keep them pinned down while another one of their teammates rushed forward and attached the shape charge to the side of the booth even if they had tried to escape the marines never would have had a chance the charge leveled the structure killing both of its occupants instantly while the team kept watch for any more peepholes or slide boxes through which weapons could be fired another shape charge was affixed to the facilitys main door retreating a safe distance away the team donned their gasmasks blew the charge and immediately launched a series of tear gas canisters into the series of rooms on the other side when the first of the chechens ran inside two marines fully outfitted with gas masks of their own were waiting for him and blew the man apart stunned at their mounting losses the chechens came to a momentary standstill but sacha and ali drove them forward they hadnt come this far to give up now by the sheer force of the resistance they were encountering ali felt in the depths of his soul that they had finally found where mohammed bin mohammed was being held captive all they needed to do now was put down the last of the resistance loading another fastarming m into his launcher and pointing it at the marines sacha looked ready to do just that the round exploded with an overwhelming concussion wave that knocked almost all of the chechens to the ground but when the americans eventually arrived to claim their dead theyd have to scrape what was left of their precious marines off the walls and the ceiling if they intended to have any sort of a burial for them regaining their feet the remaining chechens quickly and methodically made their way through the facility ali was filled with anticipation with each door he kicked open positive he would stumble upon mohammed at any moment but as the team swept into the last of the rooms the man again was nowhere to be found ali slammed a fresh magazine into his weapon beside himself with both rage and frustration how could they have hit four sites and not found him ali was about to share this thought with sacha when the redhaired giant took his small bag of electronic devices and headed toward the facilitys servers at that moment alis sixth sense began speaking to him again he probably should have pushed the outrageous thoughts from his mind but he let them stay something told him that what he was thinking might not be so far off the mark ali was developing more than a sneaking suspicion that he had been used as abdul ali seethed downstairs near the platform fatally wounded mta officer patrick odonnell had finally summoned enough strength to radio for help sixtyone the debate if it could have been called that was over before it began tracy hastings was right there was only one way they could cover that kind of distance in enough time to have a chance to catch the terrorists on the other end while the team had been able to somewhat weave in and out of traffic and even ride down the sidewalk when necessary it was still perilous and too often very slow going that was where tracy s idea came in when they got to times square they werent surprised to find that just like all the other subway stations in new york this one was closed too a heavy iron gate at the bottom of the stairs had been locked tight harvath looked at morgan as he dismounted from his bike and drew the mossberg gauge shotgun from his scabbard pack morgan ejected his shells replaced them with breaching rounds and headed down the stairs the subway system of the city that never sleeps had not intended its locks to ever be subjected to any real assault so morgan had the gate open with one deafening blast from his mossberg less than a minute later he had blown through a second lock on the handicap access gate near the turnstiles and returned to the bottom of the stairs to wave the rest of the team on down their motorbikes came clattering down the stairs and zipped past him once morgan had retrieved his bike and had closed the gate behind them the team rushed out onto the platform and zoomed down the access stairs into the tunnel harvath had smelled worse but this was still no garden walk rats and rotting garbage mingled with pools of urine and human feces even the relatively cool air a break from the oppressive heat on the streets above brought little comfort they chose the number flushing local line because it provided the straightest shot to grand central station they werent in the tunnel for more than three minutes when they heard a rumbling noise over their engines and saw a light appear up ahead they all knew it wasnt the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel so coming to a stop they all hugged the tunnel wall soon a slowmoving bloodred subway train passed carrying a mixture of survivors and exhausted emergency personnel from the number s tunnel that passed beneath the east river on its way to queens it was surreal men and women inside were covered from head to toe in gray ash their eyes no matter what color looked like dark hollowedout sockets giving their heads the appearance of being nothing more than skulls they looked like the undead and as they stared out the train windows they gave no indication of seeing anything other than their own morbid reflections they could have just as easily been recently departed spirits being ferried across the river styx toward the hereafter it was a chilling sight when the train had passed the team continued on their way at the grand central stop they emerged onto a single islandstyle platform the rounded ceiling above reminded harvath of the london underground or paris métro and he remarked again at how little he really knew of new york at the center of the platform they took one last moment to go over their plan they had no idea what to expect when they hit grand central terminal itself all they knew was that they were not going to stop for anybody or anythingthat included any police or military nodding his head harvath revved his bike and took off herrington cates morgan and hastings followed right behind according to tecklins diagram the secret waldorf station was located between tracks and it took them several minutes to find the right platform and twice they had to double back the entire station was easily deserted once they were sure they were in the correct spot they leapt their motorbikes down to track level and headed north harvath had never been this deep inside an underground train depot before much less one the size of grand central the amount of tracks equipment and machinery that filled the cavernous underground space was beyond incredible it seemed to stretch for miles the waldorf platform was more than six blocks away from where they had started as they neared harvath had the sinking feeling that they were already too late two mta officers were tending to a colleague whose chest was covered with blood as harvath pulled up alongside he displayed his credentials and asked what happened hes been shot and we cant get any medical personnel to respond down here theyre all tied up at other locations replied one of the officers harvath didnt need to say anything in a flash paul morgan was off his bike and had broken out his medical kit as morgan tended the wounded man harvath tried to get more information out of the other two officers but all they knew was that some sort of assault team had rappelled down from one of the sidewalk grates shot their colleague and had made their way upstairs via the waldorf platform freight elevator after morgan explained to the mta officers what to do until help arrived the team headed for the elevator harvath punched in the code tecklin had given them but nothing happened either the code was incorrect or the elevator had been locked down what now boss asked cates it was a strange way for any of them to be addressing him but apparently the mantle of leadership had been passed harvath looked up and down the platform according to the diagram there were two sets of stairs to the grail facility but they were locked behind heavy exitonly iron doors at the th and th street sides of the hotel there was also the hidden private garage exit but tecklin had made only brief mention of it to morgan and it wasnt specifically indicated on the diagram the marine had anticipated the team going in the way the rest of the grail facility employees entered via the waldorf platform harvath had a decision to make turning back toward the mta officers harvath asked for the quickest way up to the street level one of the officers pointed to a doorway at the other end of the platform and told him the stairs led to a service corridor just off the hotel lobby leaving their motorbikes behind the team ran for the door and bounded up the stairs when they hit the service corridor they raced toward the lobby door and thats when they heard the telltale sounds of gunfire sixtytwo abdul ali ejected his newly spent magazine and slapped in a fresh one they must have found the body on the train tracks it was the only reason he could think of for the police having found them but at the same time such a disproportionate response could only mean that the officer hed shot wasnt dead the man must have radioed in the details because what had just showed up was no ordinary police unit the heavily armed esu team laid down waves of suppression fire they were incredibly accurate and extremely disciplined through the fog of the firefight there was something else that was clearly evident these men were angry their city had been attacked fellow policemen and citizens had been killed and now they were prepared to fight to the death if they had to it made ali extremely nervous he knew that a motivated determined enemy was the most fearsome foe of all the esu team threw so much lead in their direction that even the five battlehardened chechen spetsnaz soldiers were showing signs of concern while an eventuality like this had been considered it hadnt been deemed very probable their plan from the beginning had been to tie up as many tactical units as possible and then never to stay in any one location long enough for any to catch up with them the esu team that had found them must have been attached to a nearby highprobability attack site maybe grand central itself whatever the case ali had no choice but to order his men back into the th street stairwell once everyone was inside sacha slammed the door shut as he followed his soldiers up the stairs he removed the last two fragmentation grenades from his tactical vest halfway up he rigged a crude booby trap though it wouldnt hold their attackers back indefinitely it would at least slow them down and hopefully thin their ranks by two or three men bursting into the grail facilitys entry corridor sacha began barking orders at his four remaining men in the event that they couldnt find another way out they were going to have to make a stand right where they were both sacha and ali knew that the longer they stayed there the greater the chances that the americans would be able to summon backup if that happened not only would abdul alis mission be in jeopardy but so would the lives of all the men on his team the escape route that seemed to make the most sense for them was the one they immediately dismissed if it was the mta officer who had drawn the esu team to the scene then it was very likely there were police on the train platform downstairs outside the freight elevator going back the way ali had come was definitely out of the question that left them with either the th street stairwell or the private exit from the garage staring at the carnage that had been created during the assault on the grail facility ali began to formulate a plan sixtythree by the time harvath and his team stormed through the waldorfs lexington avenue entrance the sound of gunfire had already stopped they couldnt help but suppose the worst running toward th street the team pulled up short just before the corner of the building peering around the side harvath saw a very well equipped nypd emergency services unit preparing to breach what appeared to be a grail facility stairwell door raising his id above his head harvath whistled to get the mens attention and began walking toward them seeing the weapon tucked into his waistband several of the officers spun and squared up on harvath ready to fire he didnt have to see the red dots painted on his chest to know that their laser sights were lighting him up like a christmas tree he moved purposefully but without making any sudden moves that could be misinterpreted department of homeland security said harvath as he came within earshot of the team commander the commander waved him off yelling weve got active shooters on site get the hell out of here now negative said harvath as he continued approaching my team and i have been on their trail most of the evening trust me youre going to need our help though reluctant to waste any more time or accept assistance from a federal agent he knew nothing about the commander was smart enough to realize that harvath might very well have intelligence that could prove helpful leaving a contingent of men to watch the door in case the shooters reemerged he moved behind the safety of a blackedout tahoe parked on the sidewalk to speak with harvath okay he said youve got about thirty seconds to tell me whats going on here harvath really didnt care about maintaining the secrecy of the nsa and its covert operation but nevertheless he remained circumspect the men inside that stairwell have hit three other government installations this afternoon three others replied the man whose name tab on his vest identified him as mcgahan this is a hotel not a government installation the closest thing weve got to government inside this building is the residence of the us ambassador to the un theres a special freight elevator from the train platform beneath the hotel said harvath it goes to a secret facility within the hotel that is being used by one of our intelligence agencies mcgahan looked at him like he was nuts are you for real harvath gave the commander the broad brushstrokes of what they had witnessed up to that point and then let the man make up his own mind it didnt take mcgahan long and youre sure about the diagram that marine gave you one hundred percent said harvath mcgahan walked over to one of his men relieved him of his radio and brought it over to harvath i wish i had more but thats all i can spare our truck is two blocks over and i dont think either of us want to waste any more time you mean this isnt your truck asked harvath as he took a step back from the tahoe this belongs to whoever the shooters are harvath should have known they wouldnt leave their escape vehicle too far away with its lights left flashing who would have suspected it was anything other than a very official vehicle on very official business it really was a clever idea did your people look through it we were just wrapping up a quick cursory when the shooters came out of the stairwell and began firing at us did your men find anything no its pretty clean harvath nodded his head a more thorough search of the truck would have to wait hopefully though it wouldnt be necessary pulling the larue tactical knife from the sheath on his vest harvath punctured both passengerside tires one could never be too careful okay then said the commander get your team over here i want to brief them and be inside that building in less than three minutes harvath signaled herrington who brought the rest of the team from around the corner and up th street to where he and the commander were standing compared to the special response unit harvaths team was woefully underequipped but there was nothing they could do about it even if the nypd officers had wanted to help out it wasnt as if they drove around with duffels full of extra helmets kneepads and body armor what they did have though were explosives after synchronizing their watches the emergency services unit breacher tapped harvath on the shoulder handed him a small canvas bag with det cord and everything else necessary to blow a heavy metal door off its hinges and said just in case sixtyfour the white house pulling the secretary of defense to the side of the situation room the president demanded wheres general waddell hes still tied up at dia and asked me to give you his regrets regrets what the hell does he think this is a tea party of course not sir but the president cut him off dont defend him bob this situation has gotten way out of control its worse than i could have imagined how the hell did alqaeda figure out we have mohammed bin mohammed in new york in the first place again sir we dont know that the intercept specifically referred to mohammed it could have been referring to sayed jamal like hell it was replied rutledge it only happened this morning and you and i both know that scot harvath conducted a perfectly clean grab he dragged the man back through the woods to get him across the border for crying out loud nobody was following them this attack on new york is in retaliation for mohammed either way someplace theres a leak and were working overtime on identifying it what about the operation itself whether alqaeda knows about jamal or mohammed doesnt matter they know we have one of their people in new york how do we know theyre not mounting some kind of rescue operation hilliman chuckled and said i think thats highly unlikely sir the president didnt find any of this amusing what should have been highly unlikely is anyone finding out that we had either one of those men in new york in the first place but it still happened didnt it the smile fell from the secretarys face yes sir it did so whats being done to help reinforce the men running this operation nothing replied hilliman nothing what are you talking about sir in all fairness the intercept didnt specify a location all it referred to was our taking a subject to new york city what about the man whos running the operation for uswhat does he think mike jaffe from what i was told he wanted immediate evacuation so why wasnt it granted sir the only way we can preserve mohammeds legal status is to make sure he doesnt touch us soil until were ready to close out the interrogation phase and move him to trial if we evac him wed have to position an appropriate vessel outside our territorial waters and airlift mohammed back out to sea when that nypd helicopter was shot down a bubble was placed over manhattan no air traffic in or out but that was hours ago and in that time jaffe and his team have reported no problems whatsoever said hilliman as a bit of a cocky smile crept back across his face what are you saying asked rutledge im saying that if alqaeda knew where we were holding mohammed they would have tried something by now theyre not coming mr president these horrible attacks on new york were just thathorrible attacks alqaeda was doing the only thing they could do in retaliation for our grabbing mohammed it shows you how devastated they are by his capture the secretary waited a moment for that to sink in and then said i know its an incredibly high price to pay and i know it doesnt look like it now but we beat them mr president the nuclear attacks mohammed was spearheading would have been a significant turning point in the war on terror and it would have turned the war in their favor but we cut them off at the knees what we saw today was their death knell weve clamped the lid down and as soon as we break mohammed well begin nailing that lid to the top of their coffin the president wanted desperately for his secretary of defense to be right he wanted to be able to tell himself that as horrific as todays attacks were the americans who had perished hadnt died in vainthat their deaths meant something and that they marked a longawaited turning point in the war on terror but as much as the president wanted to believe bob hilliman a man who in over five years had never steered him wrong on matters of national security he had learned early on in his presidency that things were never exactly as they seemed especially when it came to terrorism sixtyfive while a twoman contingent of mcgahans officers used the gear from the back of the tahoe to rope down through the sidewalk grate and cover the waldorf platform harvath and his team ran back up lexington toward the th street stairwell when they arrived they found not another tahoe but a black yukon denali doubleparked on the sidewalk it had the same dashboardmounted lights that flashed bright halogen strobes of blue and red as harvath carefully peered inside he saw crushed cd jewel cases south beach diet bar wrappers and a stack of textbooks littering the floor two or three hair scrunchies were wrapped around the gearshift and a pink snowflake air freshener dangled from the front passenger door handle the terrorists had been driving two identical tahoes but not anymore harvath must have caused more damage than he thought to force them to steal a new vehicle judging by the thin mist of blood that had been spattered on the driversside headliner the owner of this vehicle had not met with a very pleasant end removing his knife once more he plunged it to the hilt in two of the tires just in case the terrorists were able to slip by them the bad guys had blown the lock out of this door just like the one on th street when hastings realized the door was open she replaced the det cord and slung the demo bag over her shoulder backing away she signaled everyone to take their places harvath radioed mcgahan and told him that his team was ready roger that came the commanders voice teams one and two in place listening to mcgahans countdown over his headset harvath counted backward on his fingers from five when he closed his fist and pulled it down like a trucker blowing an air horn hastings pulled the door open with harvath in the lead this time they all poured into the stairwell and took the stairs as quickly and as quietly as they could simultaneously mcgahans breaching team hit the door on th street and bounded up the stairs by the time the lead man noticed the booby trap it was too late shrapnel ripped through the tightly packed stairwell killing two officers and wounding three more it was complete pandemonium despite barely being able to hear as a result of the explosion or breathe because of the smoke mcgahan radioed his teams situation to help warn the others after hearing the details one of the specialresponse officers below on the platform responded that he was leaving to get the medical kit from their truck harvath told the man to remain at his post but the nypd officer ignored him he didnt take his orders from dhs he had injured colleagues who needed immediate medical attention and thats what he was focused on with the th street assault team out of commission and the team on the platform down to only one tactical officer and two mta patrolmen the brunt of the assault had just fallen squarely on the shoulders of scot harvath and company harvath held up a closed fist to stop his team so that he could relay the information it was then that a man in a black balaclava appeared at the top of the stairs with a grenade and all hell suddenly broke loose sixtysix with their vehicle on the th street side compromised by the presence of the police exiting by the th street side made the most sense but somehow something just didnt feel right about it for abdul ali if the police knew about the railroad platform and the th street entrance then they very likely knew about the th street stairwell too ali could be running right into another trap and so he made sure to choose their method of egress very carefully because the grail facilitys private garage entrance let out onto the th street side of the building it was immediately ruled out that seemed to leave them with no alternatives until ali realized that the hotel had at least two more perfectly acceptable exit pointsthe main doors at the rear of the hotel on lexington avenue as well as those at the very front of the waldorf on park avenue the only question was how they were going to get there as the secret garage exit opened only from the inside of the facility ali was fairly confident that they would not find a swarm of police officers waiting for them on the other side once in the garage they could locate a service entrance to the hotel and from there make their way to either the park or lexington avenue exits considering that everything was happening at the east end of the hotel near lexington ali leaned heavily toward making an escape via park avenue they could decide what to do next once they were safely out of harms way as ali put the finishing touches on one of the little surprises they planned on leaving behind sacha dispatched men to check the status on each of the stairwells osman was the first to report from what he could tell the booby trap in the th street stairwell had been triggered and the police had been forced to retreat yusha reported not seeing any signs of pursuit via the th street stairwell but then he suddenly broke off when sacha asked him what was going on the man quietly spoke into his microphone to say that he thought he heard people approaching sacha told him to fall back and wait that they were coming to support him but the overconfident warrior told his commander not to bother he had the high ground and could handle it himself it was the very last sacha heard from him sixtyseven with the man at the top of the stairs lined up right in the center of his sights harvath yelled grenade and lunged backward knocking his team down the stairs as he fell with them harvath repeatedly squeezed the trigger of his weapon until its magazine was empty the team hit the landing in a pile of twisted limbs and then scrambled to descend farther to safety when the grenade detonated they were pressed against the opposite wall a story and a half down harvath had quite literally saved their lives as the stars began to clear from their heads harvath inserted a fresh mag and they remounted the stairs twice as fast knowing that the terrorists colleagues couldnt be far behind when they reached the uppermost landing and stepped over what was left of the mans corpse they could see he was probably dead before the grenade even detonated most of harvaths shots had found their marksin both the mans head and chest area falling to the ground the grenade must have rolled backward into the corridor where a few feet later it detonated and tore huge chunks away from the concrete walls and ceiling as the team stared at the dead body they all noticed that it appeared too pale to be arab he almost looks caucasian said hastings not realizing that in the truest sense of the word she was absolutely right who the hell are these people asked herrington as he removed the mans balaclava so they could get a good look at his face are we sure were dealing with alqaeda harvath went through the mans pockets but found nothing helpful he was just as in the dark as his team was all he knew was that they were less than a step behind the terrorists now and he didnt want to lose any ground the group fell into a stack formation pushed on into the corridor and got ready for the fight they all knew was waiting for them just up ahead when they hit the grails entry chamber it looked like a scene straight out of iraq or afghanistan the charred walls were riddled with bullet holes the floor was covered with spent shell casings blood and body parts off to the side three more caucasian corpses their balaclavas removed were lying facing the lexington avenue wall or had they been positioned that wayfacing east toward mecca harvath filed that part of the scene away and once they had gone through the dead mens empty pockets he led the team deeper into the facility the carnage inside was just as bad if not worse than what they had seen at the three previous sites the marine guards were all dead as was each and every facility employee and for what what were these people after why risk so much just to attack these sites no matter how hard harvath tried he just couldnt wrap his head around it the other thing he couldnt understand was where the rest of the terrorists were including the man he had gunned down in the stairwell there were five corpses in the grail facility all dressed in the same black nomex fatigues with patches identifying them as members of the fbis hostage rescue teamyet another ingenious ploy with everything going on today the cops were even less likely to question federal officers than their own emergency service personnel whats more the nypd for the most part knew very little about the makeup of hrt the chances of the terrorists being uncovered as frauds at least in the short run seemed pretty minimal as harvath and his team continued to clear the facility they readied themselves for the inevitable there had to be more men somewherethe satellite photos had shown at least two teams of four to seven men would the four dead men have needed to come here in two separate vehicles there had to be others and they had to be close harvath could feel it walking back into the center of the main room harvath took another look at its raised floor platform it was about thirty by thirty and similar to those hed seen in brokerage houses as well as in the fbi and dhs crisis management centers framed within the polished aluminum railings that defined the platforms edges were the facilitys computer workstations on the first pass harvath had thought hed heard something strange and now as he stood still he could almost make out what it wasa strange beeping coming from one of the computers as he hopped up onto the platform he radioed the special response officer downstairs on the train siding since no one had come out the th street stairwell and he knew that even the wounded mcgahan and his remaining officers had their eyes on the th street stairwell and the adjacent garage the only remaining egress the terrorists had was via the elevator the officer reported back that not only had they not seen anything they hadnt heard anything either wherever the elevator was it hadnt movedhe was certain of it harvath was pretty sure of it too just as he was sure they hadnt finished off the last of the terrorists but if they hadnt taken the elevator where the hell were they the question was still banging on the front door of harvaths mind as he approached the beeping computer suddenly tracy hastings yelled stop as harvath looked at her she added whatever you do dont move sixtyeight the beeping of the computer had been joined by something elsesomething barely audible just below the surface of the first noise harvath hadnt been able to hear it until he neared the work station it sounded like the highpitched whine a professional photographers flash makes as it charges back up the funny thing was tracy hastings had heard it too and she wasnt even standing on the platform that could mean only one thingthe whining noise hadnt actually begun until harvath neared the computer stay put cautioned tracy dont even shift your weight do you understand me whats going on tracy i think you tripped a pressure switch a pressure switch repeated harvath are you sure eods all about attention to detail right you said so yourself as tracy tried to find an access panel to get under the floor and see what they were dealing with the rest of the team stood there not knowing what to do harvath looked at herrington and said if you want to watch me wet my pants we can do it later once i down that bottle of louis xiii you owe me in the meantime why dont you guys figure out how our terrorists got out of here if this ends badly id rather face allah by myself speaking of which those three outside replied herrington yeah i noticed they were all left facing east towards mecca what do you think if theyre caucasian muslims allied with alqaeda then theyve gotta be chechens i was thinking the same thing said harvath bob was just staring at him wordlessly so harvath said something for him get the hell out of here cant you see tracy and i want to be alone for a while herrington forced a smile and replied see you soon harvath nodded and watched as cates and morgan followed him out of the room once they were gone harvath asked how are we doing down there several moments went by without a response so harvath tried again talk to me tracy what are we looking at still nothing hey tracy how about a situation report already the waiting was interminable especially when it was his ass on the line and he could do absolutely nothing about it he was about to call out again when hastings popped her head up over the edge of the platform harvath was going to ask her if it was actually a bomb and if she could handle it but he didnt have to the look on her face said it all its a bomb a big one great replied harvath as he began to shift his weight to his other foot and then caught himself just in time so whats the bad news i dont think i can defuse it oh yes you can hastings turned her scarred face away tracy you can do this stuff in your sleep said harvath lets just take it one step at a time i cant scot did i ever tell you what a good dancer i am she looked back over at him unable to keep the smile from her face what does that have to do with any of this it has everything to do with this he replied i was going to wait for a more romantic opportunity to ask but i was hoping i could take you out when were all finished with this you want to take me out dancing that depends if you dont defuse this bomb i think our budding friendship is going to be a little bit strained hastings smiled again that was what harvath needed to see you can do this tracy get back down there and tell me what you see i can tell you right now she replied the smile disappearing from her face its almost identical to the last bomb i handled then it should be a piece of said harvath who suddenly realized what she was saying the last bomb tracy hastings had attempted to defuse had detonated taking her left eye half her face and life as shed known it along with it sixtynine walk me through what you did on the last bomb said harvath trying to help tracy hold it together it was pretty unsophisticated she replied unsophisticated how everything the plastique the initiator everything okay if it was so unsophisticated textbook what went wrong i dont know i never knew i did everything right but it didnt make a difference harvath had to work on keeping his cool he was no good to himself or tracy if he lost control for both of their sakes he had to remain calm lets just focus on this device can you go back under the platform and pop up one of the adjacent panels so i can see what youre doing or at least talk to you a little more easily hastings nodded her head and disappeared back below a few seconds later a floor panel next to harvath popped up and tracy slid it out of the way perfect he said now we can talk is there any way we can immobilize the pressure plate i already checked that said hastings we cant then were going to do everything from scratch okay do it for me just check it one more time hastings did as he asked but her response was the same the pressure plate is a dead end excellent choice of words tracy sorry what about the main charge can you separate it she looked at the device and then back up at harvath slowly shaking her head do you see any place to insert a safety pin of any sort hastings scoured the device but came back with the same answer none at all harvath was running out of options what about minimizing the damage then what can you tell about the projectiles she took several moments before responding it looks like a lot of it has been cobbled together on the spot theyre using broken glass and bits of lexan for the projectiles is it a directional device no the projectiles are set to radiate out in all directions effective range about two hundred meters id say apparently they didnt want anybody getting out of here the same thought had gone through harvaths mind the fact that the bomb appeared to be cobbled together with materials found on the scene was also running through harvaths mind there was something else but he couldnt put his finger on it the rational part of his brain kept avoiding it blaming the stalemate on hastings a trained eod technician who should know what to do because he couldnt stand the silence he posed a very stupid and very obvious question is there a way to interrupt the detonator cmon scot like rick said back at the va i might have lost my job but i didnt lose my training that was one of the first things i looked for he didnt know what it was but something about what hastings had just said raised a heavy curtain in his mind a fraction of inch teasing him with the answer he was looking for damn it it had been so long since he had worked with explosives the majority of his explosives training as a seal had been in the detonation not the diffusing department the joke in the teams had been the only explosives equation a seal needed to remember was p for plenty even in the secret service there were dogs and specialty technicians to handle the bombs and yet something kept knocking at the back of his brain what the hell was it harvath looked down at hastings and said youre sure the device looks rudimentary totally why is that what weve seen of these guys so far is anything but simple they seem pretty sophisticated and definitely know what theyre doing correct yeah so so why are you not seeing the same level of tactical sophistication in that device down there who knows replied hastings there could be a million reasons they were probably in a pretty damn good hurry people often resort to the basics when theyre pressed for time harvath shook his head i dont think so not these guys i think they want you to believe that bomb is paintbynumbers what for so that youll miss something something you wouldnt have missed if you were being extracareful just then something clicked but it wasnt for harvath it was for hastings jesus youre right she said what is it hold on was the last thing she said before disappearing once again beneath the floor standing on top of a pressure plate even a few minutes could seem like a lifetime harvath had not heard anything from hastings and he was beginning to wonder if maybe she had lost her nerve and was lying beneath the platform completely paralyzed with fear not that he could blame her after having a bomb go off in her face he couldnt even begin to image what it was like tackling one again much less a device almost identical to the one that took her eye and scarred her appearance for life when hastings did reappear it wasnt beneath the open floor panel just to his right she rolled out from beneath the platform and stood a wary distance away she seemed stunned her expression was hard to read was it anger fear suddenly harvath wondered if maybe it was regret whats going on he asked but hastings didnt answer as she turned away from him she ran out of the room muttering there are only two rules rule number two see rule number one immediately harvath was transported back to the conversation hed had with samuel hardy phd each person reacts to the stresses of war in different ways but what if things get ugly theres no way to predict you wont know until something happens at which point it could be too late hardy had nodded and said many symptoms exhibited by soldiers outside the realm of combat have more to do with adjusting to the real world than anything else put them back into the stresses of combat and nine out of ten times their symptoms disappear and that tenth time harvath had specifically asked him how do you deal with that you cant only that soldier can it comes down to facing his or her personal demons and thats a battle that requires more courage than anything you might ever face on the other end of a gun or on the other end of an ied thought harvath as hastings disappeared out the door and he realized that she had just left him aloneto die seventy harvath had begun gauging the weight of objects within an arms reach wondering if he could fool the pressure plate into making it think he was still standing on top of it he knew it was useless but he also knew that this was not how he wanted to die his mind flashed to the descriptions of bob herringtons wounded men and he remembered his friend saying that sometimes being wounded in combat was worse than dying harvath had seen men shredded by land mines and different explosive devices and at this moment he found it hard to envision living the rest of his life without the use of his arms or legs to a certain degree hed rather the bomb kill him than maim him by the same token harvath had been trained to recognize this counterproductive defeatist selftalk and he slammed an iron door down on the inner conversation the only thoughts he could afford to entertain were how to get out of the situation and do so without being killed or injured wiggling the thin metal cubiclestyle partition next to him harvath was seriously considering using it as poormans body armor when he heard a voice at the other end of the room i told you not to move he looked up to see tracy hastings marching right toward him she was armed with a small toolbox and a look of pissedoff determination what she said seeing the look on his face did you think i wasnt coming back the thought had occurred to me i wouldnt have blamed you if you didnt what and miss an evening of dinner dancing and sparkling conversation i dont know about sparkling conversation neither do i but it doesnt matter i never leave a soldier behind especially another anchor clanker hooyah replied harvath with as much confidence as he could muster as tracy disappeared back beneath the platform once she was situated she said those fuckers are pretty clever you were right it is too simple but i couldnt see it couldnt see what this is exactly how they got me in iraq i can see that now two of the most important rules we learned in handling ieds were never to assume there was only one device and rule number two see rule number one said harvath finishing her sentence for her finally the curtain had lifted from his mind but he had to give hastings the credit for it no matter how positive you are that there isnt another device you always always always assume the presence of at least one more i blew that in iraq and i almost blew it here if id touched the one youre standing on right now wed both have been wall covering the magic lies in the second device which youve found yeah i found it goddamn these guys are good how good asked harvath the tentativeness evident in his voice not as good as me you and i are going dancing and trust me the conversation is going to be sparkling now be a good boy and zip it so i can do my job you sure that things not going to detonate no and thats why i need absolute quiet discovering the second device is only half the battle the hard part is making sure neither of these things go off seventyone strategic information and operations center fbi headquarters washington dc director sorce summed up his command in two words as he left his secure sioc conference room do it his deputy director stan caldwell wasted no time first he ordered a chopper then he called gary lawlor and told him to be ready as the pair flew toward fort meade caldwell gave lawlor the highlights for children version of what the fbi had learned the nsas director lieutenant general richard maxwell had called the fbi director personally for interrogation assistance he explained that the nsa had been running a highly classified intelligence gathering operation out of new york city and that three of its four facilities there had been taken out and all the personnel killed of course none of this was news to lawlor he was the one whod informed the nsa of the situation including how hed shot and killed joseph stanton after the man had killed captain william forrester and was in the process of trying to kill him what was news was that the nsa had already identified the person who had leaked the locations of the crush depth facilities they had a strong suspicion that the attacks on their facilities and the attacks on new york were connected which made them doubly angry and desirous for justice the final piece of information which lawlor could have seen coming a mile away was that the fourth nsa crush depth location was now unresponsive since his was the only qualified tactical team with relatively current top secret clearances lawlor was the obvious choice to bring along what still wasnt making sense to gary was what the dias role in all of this was he couldnt help but wonder if his pending visit to the nsa might reveal more than just who had leaked the classified locations of the new york facilities now that he was facetoface with stan caldwell he had one question in particular he was very anxious to ask but he was smart enough to know that he should save it until after the interrogation seventytwo lieutenant general maxwells assistant met gary lawlor and stan caldwell at the helipad and steered them inside to the directors office it had been said that the letters nsa actually stood for no such agency or if you were an employee never say anything so far the national security agencys wellknown penchant for obfuscation was holding up quite well what would be interesting to see was how candid dick maxwell was actually prepared to be they were shown into a modestly furnished office hung with photos of maxwell in a variety of desolate farflung locations around the world it was the first time lawlor had met the man and when the lieutenant general stood up and walked around his desk to welcome his guests lawlor was immediately struck by how much he resembled george pattonhis facial features his bearing almost everything about him the only things missing were the ivoryhandled colts and a bull terrier trotting alongside if he wasnt sure that it had been remarked upon a thousand times already lawlor might have said something but it wouldnt have been professional and it had nothing to do with why they were here lawlor was here for answers not to become buddybuddy with the enigmatic head of the puzzle palace thank you for coming gentlemen maxwell said as he showed caldwell and lawlor to a seating area at the far end of his office can i get anybody anything coffee tea something a bit stronger maybe no thanks dick replied the fbis deputy director nothing for me either said lawlor okay then lets get right to it based on information we have received we now believe that all four of our program facilities in new york city have been hit what sort of information asked gary the facilities are not responding correctly to specific computergenerated requests from this end someone apparently wanted it to appear as if it was business as usual but weve been able to figure out that its not now they were getting to the heart of what gary wanted to know and what exactly is business as usual for this program thats classified replied maxwell you mean it was classified no said the nsa director even though the operation has apparently been compromised its still classified as is the reason one of your senior operatives believed it was worth killing for maxwell shook his head unfortunately theres not much i can tell you there either but not because i dont want to joe stanton went off the deep end be that as it may lawlor needed more information and he knew maxwell had it exactly what type of information was being processed at the new york facilities im sorry but as i said thats classified then why are we here deputy director caldwell is here to conduct an interrogation i agreed to allow you to be present out of professional courtesy not only was lawlor a fairly good judge of people he was also better than average at reading between the lines but maxwell was very difficult to figure out in fact so was stan caldwell they both in their own fashions were helping him out but why to a certain degree he could understand maxwells motivations the man knew that lawlor had the only team on the ground that was hot on the trail of the group responsible for killing his nsa employees as well as their marine security details caldwell s motivations though were much less clear lawlor had no choice but to go along for the ride his only hope was that if any leads were to come of this that they came soonreal soon seventythree before showing lawlor and caldwell into the small thirdfloor conference room chosen for the interrogation director maxwell led them into another room across the hall like a caged tiger he remarked as he pointed to a bank of monitors that showed a very agitated mark schreiber pacing back and forth after stanton he had the greatest access to the operation it wasnt difficult to put two and two together the failed polygraph sealed it once he felt the men had seen enough the lieutenant general said go and work your magic for some reason maxwell just rubbed lawlor the wrong way he wanted to tell him what he could do with his magic but instead kept his opinions to himself and followed caldwell out the door and across the hall when they walked in schreiber stopped pacing he looked the two strangers over as he tried to figure out who they were caldwell wasted no time in enlightening him my name is agent stan caldwell he said as he held his credentials straight out from his shoulder in perfect forma bit of bureau conditioning hed never really been able to shake i am the deputy director of the fbi and this gentleman he continued as lawlor did a casual flipopen flipclosed of his badge and id is agent gary lawlor from the department of homeland security were going to ask you a few questions are you okay with that schreiber nodded his head good replied caldwell as he and lawlor sat down across the table from him why dont you take a seat the young man did as he was told while caldwell flipped open the file folder maxwells assistant had given him and pretended to read through it hed already memorized the salient details as they made their way from the directors office i see youve been with the nsa for five years yes sir replied schreiber do you like your job it has good days and bad how would you characterize today asked caldwell not bothering to look up from the file lawlor though had his eyes locked on the suspect today would definitely be a bad day the young man answered at that caldwell looked up from the file and responded id be inclined to agree with you do you have any idea why were here schreiber hesitated a moment and then stated i would imagine it has something to do with the impromptu polygraph i was given earlier and youd be correct listen mark you can save us all a lot of time here just tell us why you did it i did it because stanton wouldnt listen listen to what asked caldwell to me with all the computer geeks employed by the nsa the deputy director of the fbi wasnt surprised that this case was quickly boiling down to attention while most of these people could be brilliant at manipulating data or analyzing intel many of them lacked the rudimentary social skills necessary to properly function in the real world theyd rather hack sites write code or play video games in their off time than go out in the world and interact with other human beings they served a vital role for the nation especially with how rapidly technology was changing but then something like this happened it had long been caldwell s belief that a lot of these people were ticking time bombs it was only a matter of when not if they would explode and then the results were anybodys guess based on stans experience it happened in one of two ways either the violence would manifest itself in a physical form such as a workplace shooting or it would be more intellectual the classic ill show them how much smarter i am betrayal was exactly what they were witnessing right now caldwell was sure of it it was one of the worst ways an employee who handled sensitive information could lash out and it could prove just as deadly as if schreiber had managed to smuggle in an automatic weapon and a backpack full of pipe bombs to take out as many of his superiors and coworkers as possible before turning the gun on himself so you decided to make joseph stanton listen to you is that it asked caldwell in a way i dont blame you in fact why stop with stanton why not make all of the nsa listen to you schreiber looked confused is that what this is all about what do you think did you actually believe the rest of the agency wouldnt find out what youve done it wasnt that big of a deal and definitely not something that should involve the fbi and dhs caldwell placed his arms on the table leaned forward and said ive got news for you treason is a very big deal treason replied schreiber what in the hell are you talking about im talking about leaking the location of four top secret nsa facilities in new york city to enemies of the united states i never leaked anything mark you failed not one but two polygraphs and youve already admitted that what you did was because stanton wouldnt listen to you so lets not play any more games too many people have died because of this if you agree to fully cooperate im prepared to offer you a deal schreibers chin was pulled back almost to his chest and his eyes were wide he looked like a frightened horse whose reins were jerked hard people have died you mean people at the new york facilities yes mark and depending on the depth of your involvement that means you are also an accessory to the murders of multiple federal employees i know for a fact that the government will seek the death penalty schreiber was panicked and beginning to sweat now the only thing im guilty of he pleaded is violating a few server security protocols not treason and definitely not murder im not a computer person replied caldwell but if what youre telling me is that you knowingly violated security protocols and that those violations led to the exposure of four classified locations then you are in very big trouble but i didnt expose those sites schreiber insisted all i exposed were their servers and even then it was only for a couple of minutes someone would have had to have been waiting right there to have been able to gain anything by it they would have had to know that i was going to do it but i didnt tell anyone not even stanton now it was caldwell s turn to be confused what are you talking about part of my job is to monitor the four locations in new york when two of them started acting funny i brought it to stanton s attention but he brushed me off he could be that way especially if he had other things going on he thought were more important he told me not to worry about it and to try to help out elsewhere he said that on account of the terrorist attacks the nsa was going to have everyone working overtime what was funny about the two locations asked gary nobody was responding to my emails it didnt make sense why not after the attacks a lot of the infrastructure was overloaded and went down i know replied schreiber like the telephones but all of our data transfer operates via satellite uplinks and downloads have you seen the news theres hell of a lot of smoke and ash in the sky it doesnt matter only water molecules can wreak enough havoc to interrupt transmission and it wasnt raining in new york even if it was we had contingency systems in place so people werent responding to your emails stated caldwell so what you dont think people were focused on the attacks the young nsa employee looked right at him thats the problem according to the information we were receiving our people werent focused on anything but their computers everyone was working everyone was processing data just like they should be but nobody was on the email system so what did you do asked lawlor nothing not until the third location went unresponsive and stanton blew me off about it again i had pinged all the servers and everything seemed normal but it didnt make sense and thats when you violated the security protocols schreiber nodded his head i ran a series of remote diagnostics over an unsecured channel what did you find i didnt find anything i wanted to talk to stanton about it but hed left the building somebody told me hed gone somewhere via helicopter and that was the last i heard of him until security came down to my office asked for my id and took me to the polygraphs did you test the fourth location of course i did it came up the same as the other threethe servers appeared to be working but i couldnt establish any human contact and thats all you did asked lawlor yes thats all i did i swear to god gary gave schreiber a long hard stare and then signaled caldwell to pick up the file and follow him out of the room seventyfour a few minutes later director maxwell exited the monitoring station across the hall and said so what do you think lawlor handed the polygraph transcripts back to caldwell and replied i think your polygraphs are inconclusive what are you talking about we asked all the right questions sure but you asked them in all the wrong ways mark schreiber is guilty but not of treason then who released those locations demanded maxwell stanton it would explain why he wanted to silence forrester and then tried to take me down i dont believe it stanton s been with the agency a long time believe it responded caldwell i think we should have one of our polygraphers out here to retest schreiber but if i were you id put my money on him passing what do you think gary lawlor nodded his head id have to agree if hes conning us then hes one of the best ive ever seen his story makes sense and it also better explains stanton s behavior caldwell looked at the nsa director and said i think your leak plugged itself dick maxwell didnt know who or what to believe until your people polygraph him i want to keep schreiber isolated thats fine by me i can think of about a hundred provisions under the patriot act thatll back you up you can put some of your own people on him or have him transferred to the base stockade its your call the director thought about it for a moment and then said until im absolutely sure hes not a security risk i dont want him in the building then the stockade it is im sorry to interrupt broke in lawlor as he thought of something but id like to talk to schreiber one last time if i could caldwell shrugged his shoulders and said i dont know what good itll do you but ive got no problem with it what about you dick no problem here replied maxwell as long as deputy director caldwell accompanies you i want this done by the book just in case as long as that works with you then be my guest im going to go back to my office and get ahold of the base co to arrange for schreibers transfer if you learn anything new i want to know about it of course said gary as he thanked the director for his time reluctantly shook his hand and watched with relief as he disappeared down the hallway back in the conference room and with stan caldwells permission gary shifted from interrogation mode to questioning what might be the only witness they had mr schreiber id like to ask you a few more questions about joseph stanton am i under arrest the young man asked no replied lawlor youre not so im free to leave this room and return to my office then not exactly stated caldwell listen as far as were concerned your story seems to make sense director maxwell though needs to be absolutely certain before he reinstates you i am sure you can appreciate that i guess so said schreiber good replied lawlor as he continued the first thing i need to tell you is that joseph stanton is dead the young man couldnt believe it dead how what happened i shot him this afternoon schreiber couldnt believe it was there anything unusual about him anything that someone could use as leverage against him for instance did he gamble did he like women a bit too much drinking drugs wait a second responded the young man as he put two and two together you think it was joe stanton who exposed the new york locations its a possibility were considering is there anything you saw or heard in the office which might be relevant schreiber was quiet as he thought about the question anything at all said gary anything that might put us on the trail of who he could have been working with it doesnt matter how small or inconsequential you think the detail might be the young man glanced at his watch are we keeping you from something asked caldwell no sir replied schreiber im just trying to get a fix on the date what date said gary a few weeks ago stanton gave me a pretty weird assignment he said it was a loose string the nsa was running down he dropped it on my desk told me to get on it right away and not to talk about it with anyone else what was it he wanted me to track all sales over the last few months of a very highend dialysis machine did he tell you why or what it was in reference to no just that it had to do with a case involving national security and then he reminded me again not to talk about it with anyone what did you find out i found out that the machine was one of the most expensive of its kind anywhere in the world and that it was the number one choice for the premier hospitals involved with treating very particular forms of advanced kidney disease why the hell would he want information like that asked caldwell i dont know responded schreiber he wouldnt say he wanted me to provide him with a list of individuals or organizations who had taken delivery of the machine in the last three months and what did you find out asked lawlor nothing at first the company that makes the machines is called nova medical systems theyre extremely tightlipped about everything they do lawlor paused there was something about that company name that he recognized but couldnt place synapses were firing all across his brain as he tried to connect the dots and jump ahead to some sort of conclusion why was the company name so familiar hoping the young analyst could knock the answer loose lawlor beckoned schreiber to keep going i was finally able to hack their private sales information and discovered that theyd sold only one of these superhighend machines in the last three months the young man said who bought it asked lawlor the libyans the libyans it had to be a dead end lawlor was ready to write the entire thing off until schreiber said but thats not the weird part the weird thing is that the machine wasnt sent to libya it wasnt where was it sent schreiber leaned forward over the table and replied to their united nations mission in new york seventyfive new york city how much time is that going to give us asked harvath when tracy gave him the update and told him her plan dont worry she replied all you have to do is jump off the platform and make a run for it im the one who has to get out from underneath how much time he repeated probably not enough thats no good tracy its unacceptable if thats the way you feel then i guess its a good thing im in control im not going to let you do this hastings eased over and looked up at him through the removed floor panel youre going to have to accept the fact that youre not the boss here not this time mr harvath thats agent harvath to you lady he chided and this is still my operation but this is my bomb she was right and he knew that no matter how hard he tried to dissuade her she wasnt going to change her mind this was how tracy had been called to face down her demons if the bomb did go off and take her with it at least it would do so on her terms she wasnt running away not anymore she was sick of hiding her scars sick of people trying to make her feel better about her appearance and sick of feeling afraidafraid of what had happened and how things might have been different if shed just been able to defuse that last ied no there was no changing tracy hastingss mind she was in this game till the end no matter what its outcome for his part harvath couldnt let her take all the risk upon herself she didnt deserve to die shed already been through enough in iraq and with everything else shed suffered since that failed ied disposal assignment but what could he do the answer wasnt easy to accept but it was perfectly clearnothing your insubordination has been duly noted for the record said harvath he could hear hastings stifle a laugh beneath the raised floor really she said as she began quoting him almost word for word well seeing as how im neither a federal employee nor a recognized activeduty eod tech and my participation in this operation is in an unofficial unrecognized and most definitely unsanctioned capacity i fail to see what the downside of that might be harvath thought about it for a moment and then said insubordination on one of my teams comes at a pretty high price youre going to have to pay for our dinner now lieutenant hastings laughed again though this time it seemed forced if we both get out of this alive then im going to be thrilled to pay for dinner in fact well go anywhere you want im going to hold you to that he said good she replied now when i tell you i want you to take one step back off that floor panel and then run like hell what are you going to do hopefully ill be looking over my shoulder and laughing as you get beaten in a footrace by some girl this time it was harvaths turn to laugh youre anything but some girl tracy id tell you flattery would get you everywhere but somehow encouraging you at such an awkward moment doesnt seem right just focus on getting ready to run yes maam hastings looked up through the hole in the floor and said thats lieutenant to you agent harvath harvath smiled back at her and prayed to god she was going to make it he didnt know whymaybe it was her vulnerability or maybe it was her smartass attitude but she had really grown on him and he was one hundred percent serious about taking her out for dinner and dancing okay on three she said once shed squirmed back beneath the raised platform to where the secondary bomb was located harvath took a deep breath and waited then he heard her one two three leaping off the raised floor platform all scot could think about was making sure tracy hastings made it out alive something told him that if she didnt hed carry that burden for the rest of his life he turned expecting to see her sliding out from beneath the platform but she wasnt there he looked back toward the opening next to where hed been standing but she wasnt there either where the hell was she suddenly there was a splintering sound near his feet and he realized she must have crawled beneath the floor to the far side to have a better shot at the door as the panel broke open she yelled run you idiot run harvath ignored her and leaning down gripped the panel and tore the rest of it away he pulled tracy out from underneath and onto her feet to her credit or more than likely her exceptional survival instinct she didnt bother to stop and thank him she ran like hell and true to her prediction she looked back over her shoulder and saw harvath losing a footrace to some girl it might have actually been funny except for the fact that five seconds later both bombs detonated and sent shards of glass and bulletproof lexan screaming through the room seventysix hitting the entry corridor tracy spun grabbed ahold of harvaths tactical vest and tried to pull him out of the doorway the blast wave that came through the passage slapped him so hard it felt like hed gone off a high dive and had landed right on his back tracy lost her footing and they both stumbled to the ground when harvath looked up he found hastings sitting against the wall while his head or more appropriately his face was in a rather ungentlemanly position right between her legs i suppose most guys probably just would have said thank you he joked hastings eyes were wide you dont feel that she asked looking down harvath had no idea what she was talking about feel what your back it hurts like hell but itll pass not if i dont do something about it she replied as she pulled a pair of needlenose pliers from her pocket it wasnt until harvath glanced over his right shoulder that he saw what tracy was talking about do you have something to bite down on she asked harvath looked at hastings s very toned inner thigh beneath her pants and remarked maybe i should just focus my mind in another direction make it quick would you all right mr macho seal here we go can i get a hooyah the pain was amazing for such a relatively small hunk of lexan harvath accompanied its extremely nasty extraction with a very long and very loud navy hooyah the minute it was out hastings tore open one of the quickclot pouches morgan had handed her when they were treating the mounted patrolman in central park and shoved it into harvaths wound without any gauze to cover it she reached for the next best thingduct tape she still had several pieces hanging from her shirt from dealing with the ieds and after tearing back part of harvaths shirt she was able to perfectly cover the wound and flatten out the tape so it adhered to his skin you want to keep it as a souvenir she asked as she showed him the piece shed pulled from his back ive got my eye set on another trophy he said hastings looked down at him still poised between her legs and raised her eyebrows harvath shook his head and began to get up im talking about the people who are responsible for all this a smile came to tracy s face and she was about to say something when harvaths radio crackled to life it was bob herrington scot scot do you read me over i read you bob said harvath as he swung the lip mic back into place and pushupstyle raised himself off the floor and then backed away from tracy hastings we heard an explosion are you okay roger that replied harvath only slightly worse for wear hastings shot a glance at the makeshift bandage across his back and harvath ignored her what have you got bob they gained access via some ductwork off the elevator shaft and went out via the concealed garage exit harvath found that hard to believe mcgahan and his men are on th street they never would have made it they didnt go out th street they found a service entrance and cut back through the hotel where are you now right behind them theyre headed for the park avenue exit do you have a visual negative how are you following them youd be amazed at the stuff they dragged in on their boots from the garage replied herrington gasoline oil brake fluidharvath could only imagine god bless bob herrington urban tracking was an absolute bitch and something harvath had never been that good at realizing that it was safer to go out the th street stairwell than to slowly creep down the th street side and hope that mcgahan and his men would recognize them as friendlies and not jump the gun and open fire on them harvath relayed his plan to herrington if they could get to the park avenue entrance in time they might be able to finally put an end to the terrorists killing spree once and for all what they were learning though was that things didnt always go as planned seventyseven washington dc gary lawlor had first boarded the helicopter in dc with no idea what to expect from the nsa interrogation or why stan caldwell had invited him along on a day like today the deputy director should have been glued to the strategic information and operations center at fbi headquarters it made little sense that he would break away to personally conduct an interrogation even if it was at the behest of the nsa director regardless lawlor had kept his mouth shut and had gone along for the ride hoping that something would come out of it that could help his own investigation and scot harvaths efforts on the ground in new york city but now that the schreiber interrogation was complete and lawlor had nothing more to gain he wanted answers out of caldwell once the sikorsky sc lifted off gary turned to the deputy director and said i want to talk about why you asked me to come along on this stan had known this was coming and hed hoped to avoid it by getting on the phone right away and keeping busy with headquarters until they got back to dc realizing he was stuck he turned toward his mentor and said i told you it was a professional courtesy i thought it might help with your current investigation just like the interrogation you threw our way in manhattan caldwell nodded his head we finally got someone over there but apparently the guys not talking did your guy do any better dont change the subject said lawlor why the largess i told you right professional courtesy you know stan you always were a bad liar caldwell smiled it still didnt stop me from inheriting the deputy director position after you left though did it apparently not now do you want to tell me whats really going on no bullshit bureau guy to bureau guy caldwell would have liked nothing more than to answer that question but he knew he couldnt stan americans in manhattan are actively being slaughtered were talking about government employees along with a significant number of marines if you know something anything that might be able to help me put a stop to it you need to tell me let it go gary all four nsa locations have already been hit whatever the bad guys came for they already got lawlor couldnt believe what he was hearing let it go ive got a team hot on their trail im not letting anything go who are you trying to protect im not protecting anybody whatever information your team has compiled i want it turned over to me the bureau is now the lead agency on this and were going to take it from here like hell you will right now my people are the best and the only chance we have caldwell hated to do it but he looked at his mentor and said im not asking you gary as deputy director of the lead agency in charge of investigating the new york city attacks im giving you a direct order for a moment lawlor was at a loss for words finally he said i must be scraping a very raw nerve just do it all right stan you realize that when the initial shock wears off and the dust starts to settle in new york people are going to start calling for blood caldwell didnt respond and the loudest cry of all is going to be for the blood of the people who let our country get attacked again the commission will look like a joke compared to the investigation thatll follow this and ill tell you right now itll have teeth toobig sharp shiny ones the american people wont let anything get swept under the rug not this time no long blackedout sections to protect ongoing intelligence operations no political cronyism making sure the most influential asses are covered not even the president will be safe on this one theyre going to climb up the bureaus ass so far itll be sneezing shoe leather when they get to you the deputy director theyre going to look at how you spent every minute up to and after the attacks including this little joyride out to the nsa theyre going to want to know exactly what we talked about and i guarantee you ill be there to testify the only question is what am i going to tell them and thats up to you either im going to say the fbi did everything they could to help apprehend the terrorists or they let the best chance any of us had slip through their fingers can you imagine the repercussions of that the bureau would look like the keystone kops it probably would never recover congress might even call for shutting it down wouldnt that be something caldwell stared out the helicopters window he knew gary was right it was a possibility the fbi had been privately discussing for some time there had been whispers about dismantling the bureau in the wake of the fiasco but they had managed to cut it off at the knees before it gained too much momentum after what happened today though there was no way theyd be able to stop something like that once the wheels were set in motion the american people were going to want revenge even if it meant tying an entire government agency to the stake and watching as it was roasted alive caldwell couldnt let that happen it seemed ironic that a choice between what was best for ones government and what was best for ones country had to be so diametrically opposed but the deputy director knew what he had to do and turning away from the window to face gary lawlor he did it but with one condition seventyeight new york city harvath and hastings exited the waldorf via the th street stairwell and took off at top speed for park avenue as they neared the corner they heard what sounded like a car crash followed by spurts of automaticweapons fire bob what the hell is going on up there demanded harvath over his headset weve got em they carjacked a minivan but collided with a cab and it got stuck on the median theyre headed for st bartholomews church on the corner whats your eta were thirty seconds out theyre going through the outdoor café area hurry up as they ran harvath relayed everything to tracy when they arrived at the church herrington morgan and cates were waiting for them what do we have asked harvath i count five tangos said bob all in black nomex with automatic weapons like the ones we found at the grail facility the hrt patches are the only way you can tell them apart from the good guys do we know where they are inside negative only that they went in this way harvath switched over to his police radio to raise colin mcgahan whom hed already given a report to as they were on their way down the th street stairwell i read you replied the esu commander we heard shots fired whats going on over theyve just entered st bartholomews but were going to need help with containment can you spare anyone to cover the exits over ive already sent a couple of guys your way but that wont be enough to cover every exit over tell your men to place themselves so that they can cover more than one door at onceeven if it means they have to stand in the middle of the block and make sure they know that were after five tangos dressed exactly like you guys except with hrt patches on their vests over roger that replied mcgahan who then signed off the st barts outdoor café had been converted into an openair aid station with waiters and waitresses providing bottled water and snacks to anyone who needed them the sound of gunfire followed by heavily armed men running into the church had everyone terrified approaching someone who looked like a manager harvath identified himself as dhs and said i need a map of the inside of the church with exits stairwells and elevators and i need it right now the manager nodded her head and quickly retrieved a narrow red binder from beneath the hostess stand she withdrew a piece of paper labeled fire evacuation plan and handed it to harvath other than your staff is there anyone inside no she replied the church is closed only the café is open harvath thanked her and after asking her to get everyone off the terrace and as far away from the building as possible he and the team went inside knowing that the men they were chasing were very fond of booby traps they made their way very carefully st bartholomews was a romanesque church based upon the cathedral of st marco in venice and had been built in a traditional crucifix pattern with the altar at the top facing east it was an incredible structure and on any other day this would have made for a perfect place to while away several hours but they werent here to sightsee they were here to take down a team of highly efficient killers having been one step behind for so long it was tough for harvath to now place his mind one step ahead he knew very little about his enemy but he did know they were disciplined well armed and obviously very well trained they were chechen soldiers some of whom probably had even been russian spetsnaz at some point while they didnt shy from conflict they did seem to avoid it whenever possible as they had in the waldorf harvath knew this meant that they would probably be looking for an exit on the north side of the church away from their pursuers looking at the floor plan hed been given by the manager of the café harvath figured the exits that made the most sense were the emergency ones on the northernmost side of the sanctuary falling into their conga line they raced forward toward the doors that led into the main church structure no sooner had they opened them than they were greeted with a searing wave of deafening weapons fire seventynine jesus christ said morgan as they retreated back into the hallway and he looked up at the pockmarked wall just above their heads flechettes the word was french for tiny arrows and thats exactly how they had gotten their name they were finstabilized steel projectiles that looked just like little arrows which could be fired from a twelvegauge shotgun significantly increasing the weapons lethality herrington looked at the wall and said even so watch your language in here cates asked am i the only one who finds it ironic that were in a christian church duking it out with muslim terrorists so far theyre the only ones doing the duking replied harvath now heres the plan bob tracy and i are going in on my command cates and morgan youre going to provide cover fire everybody ready the team nodded its assent harvath readied his weapon and said now rick cates kicked open what was left of the door leading into the sanctuary and he and morgan laid down a vicious curtain of cover fire crouching low and moving as fast as they could harvath herrington and hastings raced for the nearest row of pews they went as far as they could until the men at the end of the church began returning fire and then they hit the deck harvath pulled the fire evacuation map from his vest and tried to get a fix on where their opponents were as best he could tell they were within spitting distance of an exit at the north end of the transept but why werent they using it grabbing his police radio harvath tried to raise mcgahan with the roar of the gunfire filling the cavernous church it took a moment before he could hear anything over the radio finally he could make out mcgahans voice are your men in place yet affirmative replied mcgahan ive got one on fiftyfirst who almost got his ass shot off but he just pushed the targets back inside that explained it and it also gave harvath an idea if he could get mcgahans men on the north and south ends of the transept they could execute a classic pincer movement confident for the first time that they might have the terrorists all but in the bag he radioed his plans to mcgahan and then used his motorola to radio cates and fill him in crouching near herrington and hastings harvath prepped them on the plan as they nodded their heads he then radioed mcgahan and told him to get ready harvath glanced at his suunto counted down thirty seconds and then over both radios gave the command go go go right on cue cates and morgan laid down as much cover fire as they could muster as they did the terrorists returned fire and retreated into the back of the nave harvath didnt need to look at his evacuation plan to know they had them trapped there was no way out eighty reloading abdul ali looked toward sacha and commanded find us a way out of here now it had been the chechens idea to flee into the church where he had legitimately expected little to no resistance but what the enormous warrior had not planned on was for the men chasing him to be reinforced so quicklyat least not in such a manner as to hinder their escape they needed to put a lot of distance between themselves and their pursuers as quickly as possible while he was incredibly adept at thinking on his feet the chechen disliked being put on the defensive and being forced to react a hasty retreat was hard to turn to ones advantage especially when you had no idea where the hell you were going the most deadly mistakes in combat often came from operating too quickly and without enough information in this case though sacha had little choice near the altar he found the door to the sacristy and ruptured it from its hinges with a kick from one of his enormous boots signaling to the rest of the team he took up position in the door frame and tried to pin down their opponents as one by one his men ran past him as the last man came through he took a grenade from him pulled the pin and threw it toward the center of the church when the device detonated showering st bartholomews with its deadly shrapnel sacha and his men were already running through the sacristy and into a narrow service corridor the chechen knew that if not already the church would soon be surrounded and that heading back out could be suicide they needed another route and as his eyes fell upon a small steam radiator along one side of the corridor allah blessed him with an idea once sacha located the correct door he opened it careful not to leave any signs of entry and sent ali and the rest of the team down the stairs before he could join them though he needed a diversionsomething that would send the men chasing them in a completely different direction moments later he found it sacha didnt bother opening the glass case instead he smashed it with the butt of his weapon and tore the ax from its mounting bracket with one swing he was through the window and with two more he had torn away the security wire he then threw the ax out the window into the narrow groundlevel courtyard and ran back toward the stairwell with any luck he and the rest of his team would be long gone before their pursuers had any idea what had really happened eightyone the first thing harvath heard when the ringing in his ears subsided was paul morgan cursing at the top of his lungs as bullet bob had done to cates earlier scot was about to admonish the man for spewing obscenities in a church until he saw the reason whymorgan had been hit the team ran to where he lay blood oozing from several wounds to his chest along with cates he had advanced up the south wall of the sanctuary but unlike his partner he had failed to drop fast enough when the huge chechen pitched his grenade into the center of the church in a flash harvath had undone morgans vest drawn the benchmade knife from his pocket and sliced through the marines bloody shirt as harvath looked at the wounds he asked can you breathe coughing morgan replied it feels like somebody whacked me in the chest with a bat but can you breathe repeated harvath morgan coughed again and said yeah i can breathe but it hurts like hell why didnt you duck dumbass demanded cates i had that fucker in my sights there was no way i was going to let him go so much for discretion being the better part of valor discretion is for pussies when you go back there youre going to find that clown on the ground fifty bucks says you missed him responded cates morgan coughed out a laugh as he tried to stand up youre on lets go whoa whoa whoa said harvath as the marine winced and fell back down you need medical attention these wounds are pretty bad you want the coppers to get all the credit for collaring these guys harvath ignored him and quickly fished through the pockets of his vest for some gauze and a quickclot pouch tearing it open he pressed the rapid coagulation sponges against the worst of the wounds and then had herrington lean him forward so that they could wrap his chest with gauze the pain from the piece of lexan that had been lodged in harvaths shoulder grew so intense as he did this that he had to back off are you okay asked bob fine replied harvath as he sucked it up and went back to rapidly dressing morgans injury once the gauze had been wrapped tight harvath leaned him up against the wall and crossed his arms encouraging him to continue applying pressure thats it asked hastings thats all youre going to do for him its all we can do harvath responded as he radioed mcgahan told him they had a man down and gave him morgans position the marine looked up at him and forcing a smile coughed lets hope this is the worst thing that happens standing up harvath turned to the others and said lets go with harvath at the lead the team raced toward the nave while mcgahans esu officers from the north and south ends of the transept were already well ahead of them when they exited the sacristy and charged into the service corridor they saw the two cops standing in a pile of glass on either side of a broken window using hand signals one of the officers indicated for harvath and his team to hold up because the terrorists they were chasing had gone out the window harvath didnt like it it was too dangerous as they went through that window the terrorists could pick them off one by one they needed a better plan harvath hugged the wall and began creeping forward he wanted to tell the esu guys to back off when he heard something pop beneath his boot and bob herrington grabbed his arm raising his leg harvath looked down at what hed stepped ona tiny piece of glass herrington didnt need to say a word harvath knew what it meant whoever had broken that window had come back down the hallway in their direction maybe his urban tracking skills werent as bad as he thought and maybe they had just caught a significant break eightytwo the floor of st barts service corridor was covered in linoleum tiles not the most inspired decorating choice but as far as harvath was concerned they were absolutely beautiful whoever had broken the glass fire cabinet and the window had managed to get another small piece of glass wedged in the sole of his boot studying the floor herrington and harvath soon discovered the true route by which the terrorists had exited the corridor once tracy gave them the thumbsup indicating that the door wasnt rigged they slowly made their way down the stairs keeping their eyes open for booby traps the entire time despite harvaths discovery mcgahans two esu officers opted to tackle the window they were going with their guts and harvath couldnt blame them though his gut told him it was a dead end the real trail was the one he and his team were following right now down an old metal staircase as they descended the brick walls on either side grew slick with moisture the air was dank and moldy a series of bare lightbulbs lit their way down until finally at the bottom they encountered a large iron door marked utility tunnel access keep out authorized personnel only cates who was bringing up the rear smiled and raising his weapon said i brought my authorization shut up rick replied tracy she didnt like what she was seeing the fact that the door had been left ajar put her on edge it was almost too inviting harvath though doubted that it was rigged whoever had gone through the trouble of breaking the window upstairs hadnt expected to be followedat least not right away once tracy finished checking the door over and gave the okay the team filed though rusting pipes of varying sizes lined the fetid walls while water dripping from the ceiling created a patchwork of stagnant puddles along the floor even their breathing seemed to send echoes bouncing off in all directions and as they made their way forward harvath hastings cates and herrington took great pains not to make any unnecessary noise the tunnel curved to the right and then intersected with another the light wasnt very goodeven so when harvath looked into the new tunnel he could see movement way down at the other end holding his hand up in a fist he froze his team in place tunnels were very bad places to get into gunfights the walls had a very nasty habit of funneling rounds right at you turning he used hand signals to let the others know what he was looking at herrington queried him on range and harvath relayed what he thought the distance was raising one of the m vipers theyd taken from the geneva diamond location bob indicated what he wanted to do nodding his assent harvath peered back around the corner just in time to see the terrorists disappear from view eightythree abdul ali had no idea where the access door led he knew only that this was the one they needed to take whether it was precognition a gut instinct or divine intervention he had no idea but an overwhelming sense of urgency had overtaken him and it told him to get out of the tunnels as quickly as possible he sometimes wondered if it was allah himself speaking to him it made no difference where it came from when the voice spoke to him he did what it said and he knew that was one of the reasons he had lived as long as he had crashing through two more doors the team found a set of stairs and followed them up into a large commercial laundry area from the uniforms of the startled staff as well as the stenciled letters across the large canvas carts the team realized that they had stumbled into the bowels of the doubletree metropolitan hotel one of the chechens raised his weapon as if he was going to fire but sacha quickly pushed it back down and shook his head no they hadnt been hired to kill civilians that was what the arabs did not them it was a pointless waste of ammunition and would draw too much attention ali waved the team forward and they threaded through the carts and stacks of laundry to a small corridor and a bank of elevators at the end as he pressed the button sacha withdrew his map of new york and tried to figure out where they were lexington and fiftyfirst he said as a set of elevator doors opened and they filed in ali did the calculation in his head and replied about five blocks from the final target as sacha was not the leader of this operation he simply raised his eyebrows in response as if to say how should we proceed his index finger hovering in front of the elevator buttons ali tried to decide the best course of action they had never planned on losing their vehicles their dangerous carjacking attempt in front of the waldorf had almost cost them their lives but might be worth trying again confident that he would come up with something he pressed the button for the lobby level and stated allah shall provide little did he know that what allah chose to provide were four very well armed and extremely dangerous american special operations personnel eightyfour bursting into the laundry area harvath and the rest of the team swung their weapons from side to side but saw no trace of the terrorists save for a few barely detectable wet footprints they had tracked in with them the team kept their weapons up and at the ready harvath identified himself to the nearest employee he saw as a federal agent and quickly asked about the men who had just come through the woman who apparently spoke no english could only stare rick cates then tried in spanish seconds later he translated five men they went down the hall to the elevators and just my luck theres a stairway right next to it herrington glanced at harvath who could barely hold up his weapon his shoulder was obviously giving him increasing trouble im going to take point he said harvath shook his head no lets catch that elevator herrington had a bad feeling about letting harvath remain on point in his condition but he didnt argue this was harvaths operation kicking it into gear he and the rest of the team took off for the elevators as they approached they could see one of the elevators was already on its way up to the lobby with no time to spare they headed for the stairwell everyone including cates took the stairs three at a timethe adrenaline coursing through their bloodstreams hitting the lobbylevel landing harvath paused for a moment to let the team regroup and slowly cracked the door to see what was happening on the other side a line of hotel guests were backed up against a wall near a bank of elevators staring at something that must have just rushed by harvath knew it could only be one thing nodding his head he pulled open the door and the team rushed out in pursuit of the terrorists with its swanky sixties retro feel it looked like they had fallen down the rabbit hole and landed in the private lair of auric goldfinger the only thing that kept the scene from being completely surreal were the looks on the faces of the hotels guests as they closed the distance with the terrorists coming around the corner into the stainlesssteel lobby the team fanned out into a wedge formation and not a moment too soon the chechen bringing up the rear of his groups escape spun just in time to see them yelling a warning to the others he raised his weapon and began to fire immediately harvath and company took cover behind anything they could find they then all began to fire all that is except for harvath suddenly he could no longer lift the heavy troy cqb assault rifle dropping it to the floor he transitioned to his pistol and let the rounds fly hotel guests screamed as they ran from the mayhem several of them cut down by stray rounds in the process realizing the chechens were wearing body armor tracy hastings yelled for her team to go for head shots and seconds later herrington and cates had one kill apiece the remaining terrorists emptied their magazines and reloaded their assault furious and unrelenting a thick cloud of cordite hung in the air and though less than a minute had passed it seemed like a lifetime down to only three men sacha wanted to get the hell out of the hotel and motioned to ali and his remaining comrade to make for the exit ali nodded his head and the trio laid down a swath of fire to cover yet another hasty retreat as they did so harvath and company continued to reload and pull their triggers completely shattering the glass doors at the front of the lobby arriving at the exit sacha and ali continued to fire as they slipped out of the hotel toward the street the remaining chechen wasnt as fortunate when his weapon jammed he fumbled with it just long enough to catch a very well placed bullet through his throat courtesy of scot harvath the chechen fell to the floor gurgling blood as his associates on the sidewalk searched for a way to make their escape ali pointed his gun at a shuttle van approaching the hotel on lexington avenue and when the van refused to stop he put two rounds through the windshield killing the driver who slumped forward over the steering wheel as the van picked up speed veered up onto the sidewalk and slammed into the front of the hotel with no regard for the lives of the people inside or for his surviving comrade ali began firing in the direction of the gas tank sacha barely made it away before the vehicle exploded and sent a roiling fireball deep into the lobby of the metropolitan the mammoth chechen had a million curses he wanted to hurl at ali but he held his tongue now was not the time while the mans rash actions had almost cost sacha his life the alqaeda operative had just created the distraction they so needed to escape heading south on lexington avenue they made a left on th and kept moving until ali found a spot where he could remove his balaclava and wiggle out of his tactical gear what are you doing said sacha ali responded by raising his weapon and asking a question of his own wheres your bag sacha what are you talking about we need to get away from here now he replied the electronics bag you used at all the other locations its gone i threw it away why because theres only one location left we dont have to worry about them alerting anyone else is that it said ali or is it something else something else are you mad demanded sacha as his hand tightened around the grip of his own weapon we dont have time for this we need to go now you knew all along we wouldnt find mohammed at those other locations didnt you a minute change in expression swept briefly across sachas face it was all that ali needed to see pulling the trigger he shot the chechen right between the eyes the troll must have known all along that mohammed bin mohammed was being held at the fifth location that was why he had insisted on taking the others down first and sacha had been a part of that plan from the outset what a fool ali had been the locations had indeed been secret government facilities but not for the holding and interrogating of prisoners they had to do with the trolls stockintradeinformation it explained all the computer workstations and arrays of sophisticated servers the first four locations were all about collecting information for the mans evil little empire ali now wondered if the troll had ever intended for him to succeed maybe he and mohammed werent even supposed to leave the city alive there was no telling what the troll had planned for them but ali was now more determined than ever before that the man would die an unspeakably painful death it was a mistake to have trusted the troll especially after alqaeda had discovered he was the one who had given mohammeds whereabouts in somalia to the americans it didnt matter now though ali had been prepared for this eventuality in fact he had envisioned several different outcomes the afternoon might bring and he had prepared for all of them moments later like a snake that had just shed its skin ali returned to the street anew matching his pace to the other pedestrians he proceeded east to one of the many strategically placed hotels he had taken rooms in looking more italian than arab he had little fear of being stopped or accosted along the way the passport he carried would identify him as an italian businessman and though no one should have any reason to examine him any further than that he had a complete backstory or legend as it was known in the intelligence community which would explain who he was and what he was doing in new york city even though this was an exceptional masquerade it wasnt his best the best was yet to come eightyfive on some subconscious level harvath had understood what the rounds plinking off the side of the shuttle van meant and had been able to knock his team to the ground moments before the explosion now the lobby was engulfed in flames and survivors stampeded in search of exits at the back of the hotel herrington picked up the troy cqb slung it over his shoulder along with his own weapon and gently shoved harvath toward the back of the hotel lets get outside and see if we can find these guys harvath knew that wasnt going to happen but he grabbed onto the suggestion nonetheless as a reason to get moving as he did the fog of battle began to lift and his adrenaline was replaced by a budding anger with himself for having lost the two remaining terrorists cutting through the hotel gift shop the team exited onto st street and pushed their way through the crowd of stunned hotel guests signaling rick cates to come with him bob herrington suggested the team split up harvath nodded his head and took hastings around the front of the hotel the damage was bad very bad and several civilians lay dead or dying near the stillburning shuttle van even if theyd had medical supplies with them there was little they could have done from what harvath had seen just before the explosion the terrorists had looked like they were prepared to head south on lexington and so thats the direction they decided to go he and hastings crossed the intersection at th street and continued moving south but to no avail the remaining two terrorists could be anywhere they had a decent head start and there was just too much ground to cover on foot at th street harvath radioed bob and asked anything nada replied herrington harvath instructed him to come up th street and meet them at the corner in front of the lexington hotel several of the hotel staff were standing in front passing out bottled water to anyone who needed it new york was an amazing city harvath marveled at how the absolute worst of times in a rather rough city could bring out the absolute best in so many people instead of hoarding supplies for themselves or even for hotel guests which would have been understandable the hotel was helping anyone who walked by seeing harvaths and hastingss weapons and realizing they must be plainclothes police the hotel manager offered each of them extra bottles of water and thanked them for what they were doing the manager of course had no idea what they were doing and in harvaths opinion how poorly they were actually doing it but he was grateful for the water as well as the opportunity to rest while they waited for herrington and cates to catch up with them less than a minute later a man ran up to the front of the lexington and relayed to the hotels manager the details of the shootout and the shuttle bus explosion in the metropolitans lobby taking their luggage carts from near the front door the manager and three of his doormen loaded them up with water and ran off toward the other hotel harvath watched them leave when they had disappeared harvath realized how utterly exhausted he was his shoulder was killing him and he probably should have sought further medical attention but he ignored the pain as best he could and closed his eyes eightysix when harvaths eyes snapped back open he had no idea how long hed been out nearby hastings sat on the hotel steps talking with cates and herrington as she tried to shake pieces of ash and charred soot from her hair across the street a greek restaurant had taken over handing out bottled water to thirsty passersby a group of businesspeople standing near the restaurant even managed a smile as one of them apparently said something worth smiling at new yorkers were an amazing bunch and as terrible as it had been they seemed to know that this day too would pass harvath was about to close his eyes again when he felt something vibrating between his elbow and his hip and realized it was his blackberry pulling the device out of its cradle he saw the icons indiciating that he had new voicemail and email messages as well as an incoming call from his boss putting the phone in his left hand he raised it to his ear and said harvath scot its gary replied lawlor ive been trying to reach you for the last half hour whats going on scot filled him in as best he could and then fell into an exhausted silence listen i may have some good news for you said gary there isnt much id consider good at this point but go ahead shoot the terrorists may be hitting a fifth location not far from where you are right now hearing that harvath sat up straight what location where wait a second how do you know this do you remember all the reports that bin laden was on dialysis of course it was a rumor based on the pakistani president claiming alqaeda had smuggled two dialysis machines into afghanistan right exactly then one of our delta force teams discovered a sterile facility used for dialysis treatments at bin ladens tora bora base near jalalabad so so they also found a patient log and discovered it wasnt bin laden getting treatment it was mohammed bin mohammed aka abu khabab alfari wait a second said harvath m ampm alqaedas master bombmaker he was the head of their entire weapons of mass destruction committee until he disappeared a couple of days before nobody has seen him since the dia has said lawlor harvath was floored and smoke was nearly coming out of his ears as his mind raced to put all of the pieces together whats this have to do with them grabbing sayed jamal from us apparently theyre relatedas in family the dia wanted to use jamal as leverage in their interrogation of mohammed the dia has mohammed harvath couldnt believe it who told you this stan caldwell replied lawlor how does the deputy director of the fbi have that information according to caldwell it was dias chief of staff who coordinated the joint terrorism task force ruse and then swore the bureau to secrecy based on what what kind of sway does the dia have over the bureau i dont know said gary thats all he would tell me in fact i was surprised to get that much from him harvath thought back and replied that highlevel alqaeda operative the us took downthe one with the exploding laptop do you think that was mohammed the timing on it would be right then that intercept about the us grabbing a bombmaker and bringing him into america against his will and in violation of international law wasnt about jamal after all it was about mohammed i think so said lawlor and you believe hes here in new york im almost certain of it but whats the connection with the nsas deep black intelligence sites replied harvath i dont get it i dont get it either the only one who might have been able to explain it to us is joseph stanton and hes dead so how do you know theres a fifth location and that its here in new york it all comes back to the dialysis machines we interrogated one of stantons analystsa young man who worked closely with him on the athena program and he told us that stanton was very interested in recent sales of highend units sold by a company called nova medical systems the name sounded familiar to me but i couldnt remember why when i got back to my office i did some checking and the machines found in the treatment room at the tora bora complex were the exact same kind stanton had his analyst searching for and did he find any yup and thats where i think the fifth location is though some of the dots still needed to be connected there were enough of them lining up at this point to make harvath believe that lawlor really might be on to something were on it where is it thats the problem we cant touch it what do you mean we cant touch it its recognized as the foreign soil of a sovereign nation were not allowed in unless they invite us in more bureaucratic bullshit thought harvath all he wanted was an address hed let the hacks back in washington mop up the fallout gary if thats where these terrorists are headed trust me whatever sovereign nation were talking about theyre going to be begging us to come inside and help them i wouldnt be so sure the libyans can be incredibly stubborn when they want to eightyseven libya house east th street mike jaffe bent down in front of his prisoner and whispered you are one heartless bastard arent you mohammed bin mohammed looked over at the bloody slumped body of his nephew but said nothing jaffe stood up and said thats okay though because im a heartless bastard too this is a battle of the wills mohammeda clash of the titans but ive got to tell you i dont know if youve got what it takes to go the distance lately you havent been looking so good mohammed tried to stifle it but a chuckle escaped his lips jaffe smiled at him the mans got a sense of humor how about that tell me mohammed all those little boys youve buggered over the years how do you think their senses of humor have fared do you think theyre pretty happygolucky think they look back on having your flabby sweaty body hovering over them pumping away as a characterbuilding experience the smile vanished from mohammeds face we found a lot of interesting souvenirs in that house of yours in somalia said jaffe and that got me to thinking ive been going at this the wrong way havent i like we say in arabic i want you to hold me close to your heart but how do i get there walking over to the table near the door jaffe reached into a twopocket olivedrab pouch and removed a small canister with a long piece of clear flexible tubing attached to the nozzle holding it up so his prisoner could see it he said youve seen one of these before right its pepper spray its been around a long time but it took a very clever man in new jersey to realize that wed been limiting ourselves in how we used it mohammed shifted nervously in his chair unraveling the tubing jaffe continued suppose youre in your hotel room and somebodya bad guy lets saycomes knocking on your door at three in the morning we know hes a bad guy because what nice guy pounds on a door at that hour right anyway youve got your pepper spray in this hand you unravel the hose with the other slide it under the door hit the button and presto all of a sudden the hallway is uninhabitable pretty neat huh but wait theres more i know the guy who makes these things hes sold tons to our government one night were sitting down having a beer and were talking about all the different tricks his stuff can do and suddenly it dawns on me pepper spray is biodegradable if it enters your body eventually itll be flushed out with no trace left behind now if im close to your heart i figure youll tell me what i want to know the problem is though that were running out of time so whats the quickest way to a mans heart well in america we say its through his stomach but in your case i think its just a bit lower mohammeds gaze dropped to his groin eightyeight i havent tried this yet said jaffe as he stuck the tube into his mouth to moisten the tip but i gotta believe its going to hurt like hell removing a pair of emt shears from his pocket he threw them to brad harper and said prep him i want him as naked as the day allah made him even if the two libyan intelligence officers rashid and hassan were called back in to do the actual procedure harper knew prepping mohammed for this made him a direct accessory to the mans torture up until this moment neither he nor jaffe had actually touched either of the prisoners in all fairness theyd danced dangerously close to the line of what was allowed but theyd always stayed on the proper side of it now though jaffe was telling him in no uncertain terms to jump right across it hello marine said jaffe when harper failed to act anybody home shouldnt our two colleagues be handling this he asked who frick and frack theyre on their coffee break lets not bug them besides i think im going to add this to my repertoire and i want to know firsthand how it works youre talking about shoving that tube up his harper paused the image incredibly ghastly even for a marine jaffe looked at him and said whats wrong cat got your tongue you can say it son im going to shove that tube right up his piss pipe his urethra franklin if you want to get clinical once its up as far as itll go then im gonna gas him with the pepper spray if hes ever had gonorrhea itll feel like the worlds best blow job in comparison to this looking at mohammed jaffe then asked you ever catch gonorrhea from any of those little boys you buggered he wasnt expecting a response and when none came he turned to harper and said what are you waiting for the marines mind was made up with all due respect sir im not able to do what you asked jaffes eyebrows went up and he replied what i asked son i didnt ask you for anything i gave you a direct order and i expect it to be carried out now prep this prisoner negative sir jaffe was quickly losing his temper you want to piss in the tall grass with the big dogs but you dont want any to land on you im disappointed son he said as he grabbed the shears back from harper i thought you had more backbone walking over to mohammed jaffe plunged the shears into his trouser leg narrowly missing his thigh and began cutting as he did he said the problem all along with this interrogation has been respect i can see it in our friends eyes here he doesnt respect us do you mohammed youve got nothing but contempt for us because when it comes down to the real dirty stuff the physical stuff we let our libyan pals do it for us well if i dont have your respect i just dont think i can take it it was obvious from the look on mohammeds face that jaffe had hit the nail right on the head the alqaeda man wasnt afraid he felt nothing but contempt for his captors but that was all about to change now that he was naked from the waist down he could see the american was serious very serious for a man who took so much pleasure from life via the organ between his legs the torture mohammed was about to face was hideously personal in his most disturbing dreams he doubted he could have ever come up with something so repulsive when the american came back with the device he writhed in his chair and struggled against his restraintsanything to stop the tube from entering his penis his struggles though were entirely in vain the american grabbed his organ in a death grip and inserted the tubing most violently once the tip was in the man began feeding the rest of the tubing after it when jaffe felt it was in deep enough he looked at mohammed and said you know the information i want go to hell mohammed screamed jaffe raised the guardian protection devices canister so that mohammed could see his thumb slip under the safety mechanism and said i cant go to hell today i still have so many more things to do the shrieks of wretched agony were instantaneous so horrible were they that even the two libyan intelligence officers burst into the room certain that the americans were either filleting or disemboweling their prisoner alive as jaffe sent another shot of pepper spray into the terrorists penis mohammed screamed at the top of his lungs for it to stop his body absolutely rigid from the pain tears streamed down his face and no matter how hard he tried he couldnt seem to catch his breath jaffe had no intention of letting up the pain this piece of human waste was prepared to unleash upon america was nothing compared to what he was being subjected to at this moment jaffe had never known hate as strong as he felt it right now what god could ever support what alqaeda did in his name jaffe wanted nothing more than to watch this man die because he knew if anybody was going to hell it was mohammed bin mohammed jaffe let up for a moment only to watch the mans body go slack against his restraints and his chest heave for air then without warning he gave the man another blast mohammeds body tried to leap off the chair as if it were a thousand degrees jaffe should have worn earplugs mohammed had the lungs of a lion he kept the button depressed on the pepper spray determined to drain every last drop into the monster in front of him until in addition to the screaming he suddenly heard another soundgunfire eightynine with his phony diplomatic libyan passport abdul ali found the security at the twentyfourstory libya house easily navigable when he arrived his libyan dialect was flawless and he demanded that the man behind the reception counter pick up the phone and dial the ambassadors office straightaway when the ambassadors assistant answered the receptionist spoke several words waited for a response and then satisfied hung up after being offered a seat and told the assistant was on his way down ali berated the man by asking how anyone could sit at a time like this libyans placed a high value on courtesy and to berate another in public was considered extremely rude the receptionist was not stupid hed met this mans type before and he knew that regardless of what his passport said he was no diplomat in fact hed met enough arrogant intelligence agents to know thats exactly what this man was the receptionist had long ago developed a theory that there was a farm somewhere back in his homeland where they grew these insufferable assholes by the truckload moments later the elevator doors opened and out strolled the ambassadors assistant accompanied by a rather large man who ali assumed was part of libya houses security detail the assistant walked over to the reception desk chatted briefly with the man behind the counter and then studied the visitors passport scanning through it a page at a time finally he made his way over to ali after exchanging the customary libyan greetings the assistant offered his hand and introduced himself he did not offer the passport back i thought i knew all of the haiat amn al jamahiriya operatives stationed in new york he stated why is it we havent met ali remained calm as well as somewhat aloofthe attitude he felt best suited the role he was playing because i am not stationed here he replied im based in washington the assistant brushed the explanation aside you stated you have business to discuss with the ambassador correct i hope you can appreciate that with everything going on today the ambassador is quite busy why dont you share the nature of your business with me and i will pass it along ali feigned a smile the weapons he had hidden beneath his specially crafted suit weighed heavily on his tired body if the business i have been sent to conduct was at the level of an ambassadors assistant i would happily do so but my visit is for the ambassadors eyes and ears only the assistant was not fond of the visiting intelligence officers smug attitude and why is it that we were not alerted to your arrival ali was more than prepared for the assistants questions at our diplomatic missions abroad especially when it concerns matters of state security it is not uncommon for messengers to arrive unannounced you and i both know this now please stop wasting my time and direct me to the ambassador interesting continued the assistant determined to scrape some of the arrogance off this man but what is uncommon is for a messenger to show up in the midst of such unfortunate circumstances i would think it more appropriate to have waited before making yourself known here this is not a time for the us missions of arab nations to be holding clandestine meetings ali nodded his head waiting of course would have been a more prudent course but the information i bring for the ambassador is extremely time sensitive im sorry replied the assistant but without some idea of what this is in regard to the ambassador cannot be disturbed we have been placed on our highest security alert ali smiled and this time it was for real tell the ambassador tripoli no longer wishes this facility to be used as a hotel a hotel what are you talking about looking at the detail agent ali said radio the agent with the ambassador right now and relay my message tell him that the americans and their package are no longer welcome here the security agent looked at the stunned assistant who though he couldnt believe what he was hearing nodded his head and gave his assent the agent spoke into a microphone in his sleeve and once a response came back over his earpiece he turned and whispered it to the assistant looking at ali he reluctantly replied the ambassador will see you now please follow me ninety sizing up the two men as they ascended in the elevator ali thought about taking them right there but forced himself to wait his attack was only moments away getting the ambassadors undivided attention turned out to be the easiest part of the entire plan once the man had foolishly dismissed both his assistant and his security team from his private office ali stopped answering questions and began asking ones of his own once he had everything he needed he forced the ambassador to call his assistant back into the office when the smarmy little man appeared ali fought the urge to make his death long and painful and instead broke his neck delighting in the rather delicate pop as it finally snapped there was no other sound in the world like it nor was there any greater feeling of power than to take anothers life with your bare hands a little too high from the kill ali took a few deep breaths and relaxed the next several minutes had to be perfectly smooth and without incident he had come too far to fail now only one floor above where they now stood the ambassador had confirmed that mohammed bin mohammed was being held and interrogated the thought of how the troll had betrayed him had betrayed alqaeda once again entered his mind but he quickly pushed it away there would be time to deal with him later right now ali needed to concentrate on the task at hand there were still the ambassadors security guards to deal with and then the two libyan intelligence officers and four americans guarding mohammed knowing he was about to be killed the ambassador made a run for the door and began yelling for his bodyguards he had taken less than two strides when ali felled him with a single silenced round the damage though was already done the security agents came charging into the room with their weapons drawn and upon seeing the ambassador and his assistant sprawled on the floor opened fire thankfully their shots went wide as ali dove for cover behind the desk the security agents managed to get off several more rounds before ali found his opportunity rolled from behind the desk and took out each of them with exceptionally clean head shots with the bodyguards down ali leapt from behind the desk he had no idea if the shots had been heard by anyone else but he didnt want to wait around to find out this would be his one and only chance to free mohammed bin mohammed and either he would succeed or they would both die trying ali quickly found the items he needed and once he had retrieved his diplomatic passport he wheeled his little surprise toward the freight elevator one of the few pieces of useful information hed been able to squeeze out of the ambassador as the man blubbered for his life was that the americans had welded their stairwell doors shut and that the only way to gain access to their floor was via the freight elevator though they were many things stupid was not one of them they had gone to considerable lengths to ensure their security and who could blame them the last thing they wanted was for someone like abdul ali to spoil their party after prepping the door upstairs with the remaining plastique he had hidden inside his specially made belt ali returned to the ambassadors floor and using the mans keycard swiped it through the card reader and summoned the elevator when the elevator arrived ali looked up and saw that the hatch had been welded shut he smiled the americans really had thought of everything but he doubted they had a contingency plan for what was about to happen next swiping the card again on a reader inside the elevator ali punched the button for the next floor positioned his surprise aboard and headed for the stairwell things were about to get very interesting ninetyone from the streaks of blood on both the floor and along the wall of the elevator it looked as if the ambassador had stumbled inside after being shot and had managed to swipe his keycard and press the button for their floor before collapsing dont touch him commanded jaffe as the two libyan intelligence agents rushed into the elevator until he knew what the hell was going on he wanted everything taken very slowly that plan though fell to pieces when the agent they called hassan leaned down close to the ambassadors face and could hear the sound of breathing hes alive he shouted jaffe gave a rapid series of orders and after sending harper for the medical kit and telling the two libyans to back out of the elevator he stepped inside to have a look for himself shouldering his weapon jaffe carefully approached the ambassador to check on his condition the man was in bad shape and what hassan had thought to be the sound of breathing was actually the sound of the ambassador choking on his own blood if they didnt do something and fast the man was going to die calling rashid hassan and his two other marines back into the elevator jaffe placed them along both sides of the ambassador and prepared them to carefully turn the man while he supported his head on three they began to roll him over and thats when jaffe realized he hadnt been cautious enough the ambassador was indeed choking on his own blood but he was also desperately trying to warn them not to move him by the time jaffe realized what was happening it was too late the improvised device rigged to the ambassador exploded in an enormous fireball ripping the roof off the car shearing the cables and sending it plummeting into the basement ninetytwo upon hearing the explosion ali ran back up the stairs and detonated a second device blowing the welded door right out of its frame he stepped into the freight area and saw the blackened elevator doors standing open but nothing else it was like an enormous gaping mouth with smoke billowing from its throat his weapon up and at the ready ali began his search for mohammed moving quickly he swept into the first three offices along the hall and finding them empty moved on in the fourth he found a television set a cooking area with a sink as well as a table chairs and some couches but nothing more the next door was marked with both the english and arabic words for washroom he pushed the door open and quietly slipped inside having looked inside every stall and confident that they were all empty he exited and continued his search there were only about five offices remaining the next was empty as was the next after that as ali quickly moved toward the last three rooms he found the next one he approached was locked a handwritten sign identified its function as a sterile treatment room and listed a set of instructions to follow before entering abdul ali kicked it open and inside found a surgical table a medical recovery recliner a wheelchair various first aid supplies and right in the center of it all a highend nova medical systems dialysis machine the next room was the nerve center of the interrogation operation the walls were covered with dryerase boards maps of the middle east and africa multiple photographs of the alqaeda hierarchy as well as various organizational and relationship diagrams desks were laden with audio and video equipment as well as monitors tuned to cameras that must have been positioned all over the floor seeing the image on the largest monitor abdul ali turned and fled bursting into the room across the hall he was ready to weep with joy there bound to a small wooden chair was mohammed bin mohammed next to him unconscious and severely beaten was a man ali had never met but most definitely knew of the last hed heard the man had been in canada he had no idea mohammeds nephew sayed jamal had been taken prisoner as he rushed to mohammeds side he saw that he was naked from the waist down his penis red and swollen beyond belief what unspeakable acts have they done to you my brother he asked as he removed a knife and begun cutting away the restraints at first mohammed didnt want to believe his eyes his body was so racked with pain and his mind was clouded by the horror of his torture surely it was some sort of trick then he saw ali holster his weapon and remove a knife to help cut him free it was ali wasnt it at this point he didnt know what to believe is it you he asked his voice hoarse from his screaming yes mohammed it is i i have come to take you home replied ali looking in the direction of his nephew mohammed asked and sayed ali reached over and felt the mans pulse it was weak too weak im sorry there is nothing we can do for him he is not going to make it mohammed hung his head at least his family is already waiting for him in paradise what do you mean the americans took each one of his children and killed them then they took his wife they made us both watch it on television hoping it would force me to tell them what they wanted to know and what did you tell them asked ali concerned that everything he had been through everything they had risked might now be for nothing mohammeds face was a block of implacable granite i told them nothing even while they killed sayeds family one by one i told them nothing ali looked at jamal once again his trouser legs had been sheared away and his knees were a mass of bloody pulp what did they do to him they used a drill he croaked ali had no intention of making his colleague relive any more of the brutality can you stand he asked as he helped mohammed to his feet i have a safe place i can take you mohammed shook his head my pain is too great they stopped my dialysis as a part of the torture youre too late soon i will follow sayed ali shook his head i have a hotel room near here with a small dialysis machine you are not going to die my brother not today but we must get to safety quickly i fear i wont be able to walk very far i have grown too weak ali thought about it for a moment and then told mohammed not to move leaving him ali went back out into the hallway and made his way to the dialysis room after unfolding the wheelchair he rifled through the cabinets until he found a pair of surgical scrubs big enough to fit mohammed he gathered a few additional supplies and was putting them all in a small bag when he heard a voice from behind him say dont even think about moving ninetythree though abdul ali had been meticulous about clearing the otherwise empty rooms what he didnt realize was that as in many consulates and embassies around the world hidden passageways as well as escape exits were often part of the architecture it was just such a passageway that had allowed the surviving marine brad harper to create an advantage and assume the upper hand he had already been on his way back with the medical kit when the blast from the first explosion had knocked him to the ground when the second smaller explosion detonated he wisely rushed back to the control room to see what was happening on the closedcircuit monitors now as harper held his modified m viper on the man who had just assassinated his entire team he was very tempted to administer justice himself all it would take was a simple pull of the trigger and this entire nightmare would be brought to an end but harper knew better he also knew the man he had in front of him was extremely dangerous and could have any one of a hundred possible tricks up his sleeve ive got every reason in the world to kill you right now try anything stupid and i will pull this trigger do you understand me ali had no idea how he had missed this man his eyes darted around the room as his mind scrambled for a way out harper shifted his sights a fraction of an inch to the right and he pulled the trigger sending a quick burst of fire over the mans shoulder and into the sheetrock in front of him do you understand he repeated ali nodded his head i want you to raise your hands slowly thats it nice and easy now interlace your fingers behind your head once ali had complied harper ordered him onto his stomach with the man fully prone the young marine cautiously leaned down to cuff him it was at that moment that mohammed bin mohammed snuck up behind him and with the very last reserves of strength hit the large marine not once but twice across the back of the head with a fire extinguisher knocking him to the floor unconscious ninetyfour as harvath and the rest of his team rapidly made their way to libya house things were beginning to make sense in the united states made headlines when in exchange for agreeing to lift its sentence of roguenation status and restart diplomatic ties with libya the libyans agreed to abandon their weapons of mass destruction discontinue any support of terrorism and enact sweeping social and democratic reforms such unprecedented cooperation in the war on terror might very well have been just the surface of a much deeper and much quieter deal it was no wonder that even with his polo step clearance harvath had not been able to learn which top alqaeda member the united states had taken into custody somewhere at state or the department of justice somebody was walking a very thin legal line the only way harvath could figure they had pulled it off was to have brought m ampm up to the edge of international waters on a private craft of some sort and flying him the rest of the way by chopper then dropping him on the roof of libya house where the libyans took over though he was sure the american involvement was supposed to be nothing more than observer status he knew who was really running this show in fact he had a pretty good feeling he knew the person by name mike jaffe what he didnt have a good feeling about was their being able to get access to libya house gary was right it was sovereign territory and without an invitation the only way they were going to be able to get inside was by force but as it turned out that wasnt necessary when they arrived the few people who were in the lobby were in an absolute panic harvath flashed his dhs credentials and was told by a man who identified himself as the mission receptionist that there had been an enormous explosion from somewhere within the building and that they couldnt raise their ambassador his assistant or the ambassadors security team after harvath explained that they were there because terrorists had targeted the building and they believed that an attack was eminent the receptionist assigned them the buildings only security guard and sped them into one of the lobby elevators for the ambassadors office on the twentythird floor the moment the doors opened the guard showed them into the ambassadors office where they came upon the bodies of the assistant and the two bodyguards borrowing the guards radio harvath called down to the receptionist to ask how long it had been since the man had last had contact with the ambassador his assistant or any members of the protective detail the man filled harvath in on everything he knew including the unannounced visitor with the diplomatic passport he provided a full description but when harvath asked his next question the receptionist became very quiet the entire staff of libya house had been told that the twentyfourth floor was absolutely offlimits and even its existence shouldnt be discussed with anyone the receptionist had suspected it had something to do with the two sternfaced intelligence agents who had joined the mission from tripoli faced with the very real fact that the building was under siege the man shared the rest of what he knew before the receptionist was even done speaking harvath and company were rushing for the freight elevator they were halfway there when the receptionist came back over the radio based on what he could see from his security panel the freight elevator was no longer operational whats more even though the rest of the building was supposedly empty one of the main elevators had unexpectedly risen to the twentysecond floor and was now beginning to descend though he couldnt put his finger on why harvath had a very bad feeling about who was inside that elevator shrugging off the pain in his shoulder he made for the stairway but bob herrington and tracy hastings were already in front of him relieving the lumbering security guard of his radio and with rick cates and his bad knees bringing up the rear harvath hit the stairwell and barreled down as fast as he could go the landings which he normally would have taken by gripping the handrail with his right hand and swinging his body around were nearly impossible because of his wounds and so he took the tight turns as best he could relying only on his feet more than once his excessive speed caused him to slam his left side up against the wall before he could regain his path and tackle the next set of stairs invariably he lost sight of bob and tracy who were making much better time than he and considerably better time than cates who was sucking up the pain and moving as fast as he could twice herrington and hastings stopped on random floors to depress the elevators call button in hopes of stopping it but without a keycard it was no use once they finally realized they couldnt stop it the pair tore back into the stairwell and continued their mad dash down the stairs within ten floors of the ground level harvath radioed herrington on his motorola bob whats your status he asked it was a moment before herrington replied at the lobby now were going to intercept that elevator negative said harvath wait for me what floor are you on eight ill be right there youre not going to make it the elevators already on four wait for me bob repeated harvath listen theres a mail room kittycorner from where youre going to hit the lobby said herrington thats where we are you can give us fire support from the stairwell when you get here harvath who was now touching one maybe two steps in between each landing as he flew down the stairs was about to remind herrington who was in charge of the operation when bobs voice came back over his radio he was counting down the elevators arrival two one bingo based upon the scene in the ambassadors office harvath knew that if this was their guy he wasnt going to come easily and based on mohammed bin mohammeds extremely bloody history neither was he harvath expected to hear gunfire the second the elevator opened but nothing came instead herringtons voice crackled over his earpiece shit its not stopping theyre going for the garage im coming up on the fifth floor said harvath his chest heaving for oxygen wait for me in the stairwell were going to lose him replied herrington youve seen what this guy can do were all going in together harvath waited for bob to reply and when he didnt harvath knew it meant that bob had decided to go without him if he could have run any faster he would have but as it was harvath was tackling the stairs faster than anyone in their right mind should have hed be lucky if all he got out of it was a bruised shoulder from bouncing off of each of the landing walls harvath was at the second floor when the earsplitting thunder of automatic weapons fire started and filled the narrow stairwell when he hit the lobby level just one floor from the garage tracy hastingss frantic voice came over the radio yelling man down man down ninetyfive harvath hopped the railing from one set of stairs to another and landed hard on his right foot twisting his ankle bursting through the garage door he could immediately see where bob lay ribbons of crimson spreading out from beneath his body and flowing downhill toward a metal floor drain several yards away harvath ran to where they had taken cover alongside several dumpsters hastings was covered in blood up to her elbows her hands pressed hard against bobs chest seeing harvath approach she looked up and the tears began to roll down her face he didnt need to ask he knew bob was gone and at that moment time stood still for harvath it was tracy pushing at his good shoulder yelling scot go go that brought him back to reality at the far end of the garage an engine had roared to life pulling an extra magazine as delicately as he could from one of the pockets of bobs vest harvath ignored the pain throbbing throughout his body and half limped half ran toward the sound he felt guilty beyond words and while part of him wanted to bend over puke his guts out and mourn the loss of a friend who had been like an older brother to him another part wanted to bathe in the blood of the people who had just killed bob herrington it was from that part of himself that he summoned the strength to keep moving the vehicle was accelerating now and the rev of its engine was quickly joined by another unmistakable soundthe heavy metal garage door rumbling open harvath used his other radio to hail the receptionist and tell him to override the door but the man said his system wouldnt do that dropping the radio harvath ran faster trying to close the distance with the unseen vehicle his adrenaline all but spent the troy cqb assault rifle hed taken back from bob began once again to feel like a hundredpound barbell harvaths back his arms and his shoulders begged for him to drop it but he refused having tapped the last of his reserves he used his rage to push him forward but it did little good he finally closed on the ramp leading out of the garage and up to the street only to see the taillights of a green mini cooper crest the top and pull a hard left its tires screaming as they bit into the sidewalk and it disappeared from sight undeterred harvath stumbled up the ramp and as his legs began to fail him he willed them to keep going he could not let the terrorists get away out of breath his chest heaving harvath hit the top of the ramp and pivoted to the left the cooper halfway down the block raising the weapon to his injured right shoulder harvath aligned the car in his sights and with no breath to hold squeezed the trigger the rounds flew down th street and when harvath saw the vehicle swerve its brake lights illuminating the night he knew hed made contact the tires squealed as it careened and scraped along several parked cars harvath lined up another shot tried to control the desperate filling and emptying of his lungs and then pulled the trigger again he heard the distinct pop that indicated that he had fired his last round and without even thinking about it pressed the magazine release slapped the new mag to make sure the rounds were seated and slammed it into the weapon he ripped back the charging handle and let go of it just as fast with the car nearing the end of the sidewalk this was harvaths very last chance firing in short bursts he kept the mini cooper in his sights as its driver swerved back and forth trying to avoid being hit as harvath began to squeeze the trigger once more the vehicle hit first avenue pulled another tight left turn and disappeared from sight the whitehot anger swelled up inside him once more based on the little he had seen he knew these people were incredibly professional and would have put just as much effort into mohammed bin mohammeds evacuation as they had his rescue it was a bitter pill to swallow but harvath had to accept that they were gone ninetysix it was not hastings or cates who found harvath propped up against a parked car and unable to move outside libya house but the receptionist without saying a word the man bent down and helped harvath to his feet when harvath had trouble balancing on his damaged ankle the man offered his shoulder he tried to steer him toward the steps leading to the front of the building but scot shook his head and motioned toward the garage at the bottom of the ramp he thanked the man and told him to return to his post what harvath had to do now he wanted to do without strangers present it took him several minutes to limp back to where he had left hastings and herrington but when he got there he saw rick cates covering bobs body with a tarp cates looked up expectantly and harvath shook his head he knew the question and unfortunately the answer was no he didnt get the people who had done this to bob scot and tracy and rick stood there staring down at the tarp and said nothing they had lost not only a teammate but also an exceptional fellow soldier who was an even better friend there was no telling how much time had passed when harvath finally said lets go back upstairs i want some answers the receptionist provided them with a keycard but it got them only as high as the twentythird floor from there they walked up one more floor and realized why the freight elevator wasnt working its charred doors stood wide open and it didnt take much of an imagination to realize what had happened a severed hand and a lone quantico boot with part of a leg sticking out of it suggested at least one person or probably more had been standing near the elevator when it exploded what was left of the car was probably in the basement and harvath didnt envy the forensic team that would have to go through it later as they continued on each of the rooms they cleared was empty until they reached the one that must have been used for bin mohammeds dialysis treatments there they found another mana marine by the looks of him who had taken a couple of severe blows to the head but who was still alive with no choice for the moment they quickly made him as comfortable as possible and then continued with their sweep at the end of the hall they found one last survivorsayed jamal he was flexicuffed to a chair and had been beaten almost beyond recognition because this was jaffes operation harvath didnt need to recognize the prisoner to know who he was he felt for a pulse and found one it was weak and even with immediate medical attention the man was probably not going to make it leaving him alone they went to clear their last and final roomthe interrogations nerve center after deeming it to be safe they stared at the sophisticated electronic equipment as well as the dryerase boards the relationship diagrams and the multiple photographs that had been taped up along the wall seeing one that bore a resemblance to the prisoner across the hall cates asked is this what the guy in the other room used to look like harvath looked at the photo and nodded they really did a number on him who the hell is he his name is sayed jamal hes an alqaeda bombmaker who suddenly cates spun around and seeing that hastings was no longer in the room said oh shit what the hells going on demanded harvath as cates ran for the door sayed jamal was the man behind tracy s last bomb in iraq harvath was about to echo catess oh shit when the crack of a single round being discharged in the interrogation room stopped him dead in his tracks without even seeing it he knew that tracy had killed him ninetyseven grace church brooklyn heights july searchandrescue efforts throughout new york city had turned to search and recovery because of the overwhelming number of dead needing to be buried churches were conducting group funeral masses but in the case of one of their distinguished parishioners grace church had made an exception at a special request from the family of master sergeant robert herrington traffic around the church had been blocked off by mcgahan and several officers from various nypd emergency service units the media respectfully kept their distance as a dark blue hearse rolled forward and came to a quiet stop in front of the church a lone bagpiper played supported by his teammates who had all been granted leave from afghanistan to attend the service bobs family watched as his flagdraped casket was removed from the vehicle and carried up the stairs by pallbearers in full military dress there were a significant number of soldiers in attendance many from some of the worlds most elite fighting unitsmen bob had had the pleasure of either training or fighting with more than a few of them owed their lives to the brave man who had so tragically lost his life just a week before some of the soldiers harvath had known previously and some of them he didnt but he had gotten to know almost everyone the night before at bobs wake where despite the sad circumstances and aided by lots of cocktails everyone seemed to be able to come up with several funny stories about bob as a result most of the tears that were shed were not tears of sadness but actually bittersweet tears of joy remembering what a wonderful and inspiring person bob herrington had been for harvath it was cathartic and something he desperately needed his entire assignment in new york had been a catastrophic failure mohammed bin mohammed had gotten away as had the man who had been leading the chechens whom harvath suspected was also the man who had helped spring mohammed from libya house killing bob herrington in the process the seals have a saying that the only easy day was yesterday but nothing about yesterday was easy nor were any of the six days before that for the last week harvath had remained alone convalescing in his hotel room after having been patched up at the va he ran the operation through his mind again and again and again each time trying to figure out a way he could have done things differently no matter how hard he tried he couldnt think of anything he could have said or done that might have saved bobs life this realization though did little to assuage his guilt harvath let that guilt simmer and it invariably turned to anger which he focused directly on the bureaucracy back in washington like most people he wanted answers but not even gary lawlor had them for him he urged harvath to be patient but harvath had no patience left he called his pal at valhalla and began negotiating the terms of his new job inside the church the guilt the anger and the sheer exhaustion with the system still weighed heavily on harvath as he sat alongside tracy hastings rick cates and paul morgan who had told the va doctors to go to hell when they refused to discharge him for bobs funeral in the end it was sam hardy who finally stepped in and made it happen it was good to be there with them and harvath tried to let go of everything he was stewing over so he could say a proper goodbye to his friend as the reverend introduced both himself and the military chaplain who had come from fort bragg to assist in the service he informed the mourners that the program was going to be short and simplemarked not by saying goodbye but by saying hello as bob was welcomed into the kingdom of heaven with a smile on his face the man then apologized for not having enough holy water or wine on hand to make his service as enjoyable as the irish wake from the night before the crowd many of who were still hung over chuckled goodnaturedly the invocation was given and then came the readings most of which were given by bobs teammates the final reading was one harvath had heard umpteen times but which had never really hit him as hard as it did today there is no greater love than this that a man lay down his life for his friends as harvath turned to look at tracy rick and paul he could see they were each fighting a losing battle to hold back their tears when the priest finished his sermon one of bobs teammates a man named jack kohlmeyer was invited to share some of his reflections kohlmeyer was the perfect speaker and spoke eloquently and with the right degree of humor to help ease the sadness everyone was feeling i only knew bob for a short time he and i met about three years ago in a valley beneath the mountains of afghanistan there i was at eight thousand feet packing an eightypound rucksack about to head up into the mountains and bob just sat on his cot laughing at mein front of everyone nope you dont need that hed say or that or that nope you dont need that either harvath had had the same experience with bob just days earlier and he couldnt help but laugh but bob could get away with it continued kohlmeyer he could get away with laughing at us for looking silly bobs trick was that he laughed not at us but with us he didnt laugh to make us look foolish he laughed to win us over and to make us his friends and in that he was successful its a testament to his success with people that so many of us have traveled so far to be with him today for the sum of the miles traveled by all of us reach into the tens of thousands bob loved people and we loved him back we sustained him and he sustained us especially when we were down bob reminded me on more than one occasion that life isnt fair so get over it and keep doing the best that you can do a few weeks before bob left to come home the team that i had been assigned to suffered several casualties the job of packing their bags was given to me it was one of the hardest things i have ever had to do bob though sat with me and talkedand he talked and he talked and he talked he knew what he was doing he was keeping my mind off the job at hand he was a natural with people and he knew it so bob kept my mind occupied and when i was done he put his arm around my shoulder and reminded me once more life isnt fair keep doing what youre doing and make sure youre doing the very best you can as harvath sat there it was almost as if bob was speaking to him hearing those words harvath knew he wasnt going to quit his jobhe couldnt as much of a pain in the ass as it often was harvath knew why he was doing it it wasnt for the politicians he had grown progressively more disenchanted with it was for the people of this country brave and good people like bob who along with their honorable way of life were worth fighting for harvath was going to keep doing what he was doing and he was going to continue doing it the very best he couldfor himself and also for the memory of bob herrington when the service had ended the reverend asked if everyone would follow the procession outside onto the steps of the church the street was still devoid of traffic the esu officers dutifully at their posts chairs had been set up on the sidewalk for family members and those who needed to sit it was hot and humid but a faint breeze blew in from across the river and though the air had gotten much better it still wasnt one hundred percent the scent of death and destruction still hung over everything it was a smell harvath would never be able to forget like everyone else in new york it had become a part of him bob herrington was given a twentyonegun salute by seven special forces soldiers from across the street and as taps was played the flag covering his coffin was folded and handed to his parents the coffin was then placed inside the hearse and the rear door closed everyone stood or sat in silence a minute maybe two passed the birds of brooklyn heights the only accompaniment to peoples private thoughts and remembrances of bob herrington there was a faint noise from somewhere off in the distance and harvath wrote it off to the ongoing s ampr efforts on manhattan until it began to grow much louder looking up from the hearse harvath watched as a uh black hawk helicopter came in and hovered directly overhead a heavy black rope was lowered and it was then that harvath realized what he was seeing someone probably one of bobs teammates had arranged for a symbolic final extraction the helicopter then flared and flew off toward the river as the mourners watched when it was gone from view harvath and everyone else looked down to see that robert herringtons hearse had already driven away ninetyeight so are we going to the reception or not asked harvath as the crowd outside the church began to break up we thought wed do our own private sendoff for bob replied cates what you mean just the three of you no the four of us said morgan after all were a team right harvath smiled as he did tracy hastings removed a bottle of louis xiii from her bag and said bob mentioned he owed you a drink we all chipped in and bought this in his honor harvath smiled even wider as they had all paid their respects to the family at the wake last night and had stayed well into the early morning hours drinking nobody could fault them for missing the reception in fact few would probably even notice their absence besides swapping stories while they consumed a bottle of cognac was the kind of sendoff bob would have approved of they decided theyd take the fulton landing ferry back over to manhattan and find a quiet place in battery park where they could look out over the hudson and maybe forget at least for a while about everything that had happened a block from the church a black limousine pulled up next to them and when the tinted window rolled down harvath thought he recognized the voice of the man calling his name as he turned to look he saw robert hilliman the us secretary of defense waving quite a moving ceremony he said beckoning harvath over to the vehicle i need a couple minutes of your time would you mind harvath told the others hed meet them at the ferry and then climbed inside the limousine howve you been scot said hilliman once the door was shut fine sir he replied not exactly happy to be sitting in a limo in the middle of brooklyn heights talking to the secretary of defense fit for duty the shoulders okay the ankle the shoulders about eighty percent but the ankles okay now good glad to hear it sir what are you doing here asked harvath hilliman smiled i knew robert herrington not well but i knew him he was a good man he was part of my protective detail the first time i visited afghanistan there was a situation it never made the news but suffice it to say that if it wasnt for bobs efforts in particular i might not be here right now i paid my respects to his parents earlier this morning and kept a low profile in the back of the church during the service and the black hawk was that your doing his team had asked for it and were getting some static with everything thats happened in manhattan there were certain people that felt a funeral flyover was an inappropriate diversion of resources i disagreed bob herrington was a hell of a guy and one of the finest warriors this country has ever seen hilliman removed a folder from his briefcase and handed it to him i read the debriefing they did on you while you were getting patched up at the va i thought you deserved to have some of the blanks filled in as harvath looked through the file the secretary of defense continued scot youve been in this game long enough to know why certain operations must remain classified sometimes its of vital national security that the right hand not know what the left hand is doing sometimes though we begin with the absolute best of intentions and clarity of purpose but the walls we build to protect our operations can actually prevent us from sharing strategic information of paramount importance its clear now thats what happened last week and we lost a lot of good people because of it though i have some incredible resources at my disposal i cant change the past i can though have a significant impact on the future harvath wasnt listening anymore when he looked up from the folder the anger was chiseled across his face i cant believe what im reading you were actually getting ready to let him walk after everything we know about mohammed bin mohammed after the incredible amount of manpower and money that went into tracking him down what about the people who were killed trying to apprehend him what about what he is planning to unleash on this country you dont know the full story you know what mr secretary i dont see how that could possibly make a difference listen to me and ill tell you harvath tossed the file onto the seat next to him and prayed the man had a good answer if not he was going to rip his throat out right in the back of that limousine hilliman took a deep breath and replied nobody can withstand torture indefinitely not even a man like mohammed bin mohammed the problem lies in knowing when youve truly broken them to know that you have to verify the intel a subject gives you and that can take time time was not something we had on our side in mohammeds case making matters even more difficult were his extensive dialysis treatments therefore it had been agreed that if we couldnt make measurable progress within a certain window we were going to transport him to another nation that collaborates with us in interrogations a nation we knew his associates might be likely to subvert to help facilitate his escape i still dont understand why youd do that so we could track him but it took you guys years to find him in the first place what makes you so sure you wouldnt lose him demanded harvath thats the thing we were over ninety percent certain we wouldnt lose himand in our business thats a percentage we were willing to bet the house on how were you going to track him through a radioisotope wed been administering as part of his dialysis treatments it creates a very specific signature which can be tracked via satellite youve got to be kidding me the secretary held up both hands and said so help me its a very new technology but it works wed seen the data but we went a step further and did a slew of comprehensive tests ourselves the bottom line is that it works ninety percent of the time clarified harvath correct so do you know where mohammed bin mohammed is now hilliman looked at him yes we do so what are you waiting for why dont you grab him because we need to know who alqaeda is about to get their nuclear material from and once you do what then hilliman pulled two more files from his briefcase handed them across to harvath and said thats what i want to talk to you about ninetynine gibraltar three days later of all the places harvath had ever traveled to hed never had a reason or a desire to see gibraltar as his plane circled on its approach he quickly realized that hed been missing something extraordinary the enormous limestone rock of gibraltar rose dramatically from the mediterranean sea forming one of the two ancient pillars of hercules which once marked the very edge of the known world staring out the planes window harvath could make out the various grassy glens that were home to the only freeranging monkey in europe the barbary ape he could almost smell the aloes capers cacti and asparagus that grew wild along the nearly foothigh rock and though he barely knew her he could already tell this was the kind of place tracy hastings would likea lot after the secretary of defense had dropped harvath at the ferry he had joined her along with rick cates and paul morgan to make the somber trip across the east river to manhattan as a way to ignore the searchandrecovery efforts happening up and down the river they staked out a piece of turf on the aft deck and cracked open the bottle of louis xiii the minute the ferry set sail cates ever the procurement specialist had secured small plastic cups and by the time they reached manhattan the bottle was half empty the balance of it was drained as they made their way up first avenue and deposited paul morgan back at the va from there harvath hastings and cates proceeded to bobs favorite watering hole the same tavern he and harvath had been on their way to when all hell had originally broken loose there already well lubricated and fueled by their shared sense of loss they toasted bobs memory again and again and again the next morning when harvath awoke he did so as slowly as possible it was unlike him to tie one on so bad that he couldnt remember where he was or what he had done knowing that the moment he opened his eyes the wicked machinery responsible for ushering in his inevitable hangover would kick into gear he lay there and tried to figure out where he was the first thing he noticed were the silk sheets and because he could feel the sheets with all of his body he was relatively confident that he was naked that fact made his next observation a little more uncomfortablethe smell of perfume reaching out his hand he had first felt a welltoned calf and then a firm yet feminine thigh as his hand slid farther up his bedmates body he felt a taut midriff leading to a pair of perfectly sculpted shoulders slowly opening his eyes he saw tracy hastings lying next to him and instantly decided she had one of the most beautiful bodies he had ever seen for all of the jokes she made about her face harvath found it just as beautiful looking into her eyes he saw that she was awake and they both smiled after recounting the balance of the evening and telling him that he was indeed a good dancer but that their conversation had been a bit below sparkling they laughed and made love again they spent the next fortyeight hours together and were inseparable right up until harvath had to leave for his operational rendezvous point in europe for his part harvaths only regret about the entire experience was that after being patched up at the va he had blown a whole week recuperating in his hotel roomalone tracy had offered him the guest room at her parents house as they had decided to remain overseas while manhattan got back on its feet but harvath had politely declined somehow somewhere inside himself he had known this was bound to happen now that it had they were both okay with it whether there was a future for them was another question harvath knew well enough not to get his hopes up but he also knew that he was looking forward to spending more time with tracy and getting to know her much better as the plane came in for its landing harvath saw traffic being halted in both directions as one of gibraltar s main thoroughfares actually cut right across the airports landing strip a rocky promontory at the southernmost tip of spain gibraltar occupied an area of only square miles but what it lacked in measurable terra firma the minuscule british dependency more than made up for in the size and scope of its international intrigues it was one such intrigue that had brought scot here a joint ciadia team had been tracking mohammed bin mohammed since he had returned to africa they had followed him up to tangiers and onto a ferryboat for the quick jaunt across the straits to gibraltar they now had him under surveillance in a sumptuous yet discreet villa near the harbornot far from the hotel where harvath was booked once mohammeds deal for the rogue nuclear material went down the team had their orders to immediately back off from that point forward the alqaeda terrorist belonged to scot harvath and scot harvath only no bullshit no bureaucracy and absolutely nobody but himself to answer to for two days mohammed played the merry holidaymaker hitting the beaches by day and then prowling the openair restaurants and discos for young boys at night it made harvath sick he couldnt wait to put a bullet in this scumbag the only thing worse than seeing him pick up the boys was joining the ciadia team in its daily sweep of his villa while he basked on the beach and the staff ran errands the man was quite the budding cinematographer and watching him actually in the act made harvath want to vomit it was on the third night in gibraltar that things finally started getting interesting forgoing his usual nightclub trolling mohammed picked one of the more upscale restaurants in town where he put away a considerable amount of food accompanied by an incredibly expensive bottle of bordeaux afterward he headed down to the marina and a vintage riva runabout which once he climbed aboard sped off into the open ocean with a host of airplanes watercraft and helicopters at his disposal the lead ciadia agent immediately mobilized all of his assets to follow mohammed out into the mediterranean when offered the opportunity to tag along harvath declined he had a strong feeling that if mohammed didnt plan on coming back he never would have abandoned his newly minted video library back at the villa so while the joint task force pursued their man out into the darkening mediterranean sea harvath returned to his hotel room and for the hundredth time since hed arrived disassembled and oiled his weapons listening to the radio set in his room he followed the teams progress as mohammeds landing craft spirited him out to a large yacht with an innocuous bahamian registry the minute the highly sensitive nuclear materials aircraft zeroed in on it their monitoring equipment started bouncing using the advanced microwave devices aboard the various covert pleasure craft that had sailed within listening range the team was able to monitor almost the entire transaction convinced they had what they were looking for they informed harvath that mohammed bin mohammed was on his way back to the marina and that the suspect was all his leaving his hotel harvath threw his gear into his rental car and headed toward the marina something told him that mohammed might just be in the market for one last night of pleasure before leaving gibraltar little did harvath know that someone else was banking on the exact same hunch one hundred the troll disliked leaving the comfort and security of eileanaigas house and had done so only because mohammed bin mohammeds escape from american custody had made it absolutely necessary never in a million years would the troll have believed abdul ali able to pull it off but looking back on the operation he realized it was his own plan that had been flawed once sacha had helped ali locate mohammed bin mohammed the chechen was supposed to kill them bothsomething that never happened the troll had underestimated ali but for the moment none of that mattered what mattered was that mohammed be decommissioned once and for all the fact that the bearded grease tub had forced unspeakable sex acts upon the troll decades earlier in the black sea resort of sochi made his reasons for killing the man all too personal having searched for him for years and finally locating him the troll had hoped that the americans would do the job for him the fact that there had been a fivemilliondollar bounty on mohammeds head had only been icing on the cake now though the man was free once again and from what the troll had observed over the last several days among the bars restaurants and discotheques of gibraltar this leopard had no intention of changing his spots customized by a reclusive gunsmith in southern france the diminutive weapon the troll was carrying had been specially designed to accommodate his exceedingly small frame chambered for the devastating lapua round its optimal range was between and meters with anything below that necessary only when very deep penetration was called for to use it for any other reason at close range was considered overkill to say the least while the troll prided himself on being a master of subtlety he had no reservations about taking mohammed at even pointblank range if that was what the situation called for while the pedophile had frolicked on the beach by day and had cruised the nightclubs for conquests at night the troll had familiarized himself with routes both to and from his potential sniping areas as well as the routes that could be used for egress from gibraltar as with everything else in his world the troll was ready for any eventuality that changed though when he noticed mohammed bin mohammed was under covert american surveillance the team tracking him was exceptional but not so good that the troll couldnt detect their presence even so he decided to remain in play there was a slight problem though the team had an additional man on boarda hitter the troll was sure of it but who was he charged with taking out was it mohammed was it the people he was doing business with was it both parties while the thought of leaving the job to the american assassin was tempting the troll knew that if he wanted this done right he would have to do it himself and if the american hitter got in his way he would have to take him out as well attaching a lightweight silencer to the front of his weapon the troll reaffirmed to himself that the only thing that mattered was taking down mohammed bin mohammed once and for all if that meant sawing through one or two americans who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time to do so then that was just the way it would have to be one hundred one though harvath had been provided with an extremely efficient sniper rifle he left it in the trunk deciding instead on several tools designed for upclose work when he took mohammed bin mohammeds life he wanted to look the man in the eyes and see the expression on his face he had watched the cctv footage the libyans had given the united states from new york over and over again from what they could piece together mohammeds accomplicea man the cia had tentatively identified as abdul aliremoved a wheelchair from the medical room helped mohammed down two or three floors via the stairwell and then rode the elevator the rest of the way to the garage while ali pushed the wheelchair bin mohammed cradled the shortbarreled m viper of the marine they had overpowered brad harper and had used it to kill bob herrington that was why harvath wanted to look into bin mohammeds face when he killed him he owed bob that much the only challenge was deciding where to make the kill while harvath was confident that mohammed would return to the villa to retrieve his clothes and cache of xrated vacation footage there was a possibility that his exploits might keep him out all night if that was the case and he was pressed for time the next day he might abandon the footage the way harvath saw it his best bet was to wait for mohammed at the harbor and quietly follow him trusting that the right opportunity would present itself for someone who liked to have all of the angles completely plotted out beforehand this marked quite an operational departure for harvath but at the same time this was not his usual kind of assignment this was extremely personal hearing from the joint ciadia team that mohammeds boat was on its way back in harvath mentally checked the first obstacle off his list how many were left though was anybodys guess so as not to be forced to potentially pursue two targets over the water it was agreed that the team would wait until mohammed had set foot back on dry land before taking down the yacht as the alqaeda operative stepped off the dock and headed for casemates square harvath radioed the ciadia team leader gravedigger this is norseman mickey mouse has dry feet i repeat mickey mouse has dry feet roger that came the reply good luck harvath removed his earpiece turned off his radio and began to stalk his prey one hundred two forgoing casemates square altogether mohammed bin mohammed walked up to the main post office where he turned onto bell lane and headed for a long set of stairs known as castle street partway up on the left was a large sign that read charles holeinthewall harvath had only to observe a couple of the customers heading inside to know what kind of a club it was on the bright side he figured a handsome single man with his eyes constantly scanning the room wouldnt be that out of place there he gave mohammed a few minutes to get himself settled and then headed inside the dimly lit interior was awash in a fog of cigarette smoke eighties dance music blared from the sound system while patrons danced drank or made conversation at a small table on the other side of the room mohammed bin mohammed sipped a cocktail and surveyed the scene harvath would have preferred to have taken him in a dark doorway or between a couple of parked cars somewhere outside but it was high season in gibraltar and the streets were just too crowded that was okay with harvath though he could just as easily do what he needed to do here the only thing different would be which weapon he used and he had plenty to choose from with his untucked linen shirt hiding the deadly array of tools affixed to his carbonfiber belt harvath leaned back against the bar and tried to decide how best to make his move because he wanted to make this as personal as possible a knife seemed the best choice considering how dark the bar was he could slide up right next to the man plunge the weapon in and tear it right across his abdominal cavity with no one near mohammed bin mohammed being any the wiser harvath would be able to sit with him and maybe even have a drink as he watched him die then all harvath would have to do would be to gently lay the mans head on the table and it would look like hed passed out from too much to drink it wouldnt take too long for the other patrons to notice something was wrong but by the time they did harvath would be long gone as he stood up to make his move a young man entered the establishment and after flitting around for a moment or two made his way over to mohammed bin mohammeds table and sat down with no choice but to wait it out harvath ordered a beer and kept his eyes glued to the table there was no way he could kill mohammed when there was a witness present after two more rounds of cocktails mohammed and the boy stood up to leave harvath left some money on the bar and once the pair had passed him he counted to twenty and followed them outside as the two walked mohammed slid his hand down the boys back and let it linger on his rear end harvath hoped that when he dispatched mohammed to the hereafter allah would have a very special cell waiting for him when they arrived at the villa harvath took up the post he had been using to surveil the house for the past couple of nights he would wait until the boy left and then hed sneak inside and take mohammed out though he wasnt crazy about having to wait there was nothing he could do about it harvath had no desire to kill an innocent bystander and while he could probably take a shot through one of the open windows he wanted to be as close as possible as he watched the very last drops of mohammed bin mohammeds life drain away the alqaeda operative led the boy out onto the veranda then stepped back inside to make another cocktail as he did so harvath noticed movement at the other end of the house as his eyes swung in that direction he couldnt believe what he was seeing inside were two enormous white wolves that were carefully making their way toward bin mohammed one hundred three when harvath looked closer he realized that what he was seeing werent wolves at all but rather two extremely large dogs they resembled the type of animal hed seen the russian army use they also appeared to both be wearing harnesses of some sort and where there were dogs harvath knew there was normally a handler though for the moment he couldnt see one he watched as the animals silently crept forwardobviously taking great pains so as not to be detected harvath was marveling at their discipline when he finally saw the handler it was only a glimpse at first and then as one of the animals turned he could make the figure out in its entirely it was amazing from harvaths vantage point the man couldnt have been more than twoandahalf to threefeet tall max the dogs towered over him harvath focused on the bizarre weapon the man was carrying it looked like it was crafted of plasticstyle polymers and some kind of alloy obviously it had been custommade to accommodate the dwarfs small size but who the hell was he and what did he want with mohammed bin mohammed were the people mohammed was doing the nuke deal with trying to doublecross him leaping the small wall at the far end of the veranda harvath took cover just as mohammed bin mohammed stepped outside with a drink in each hand oblivious to the threat quickly advancing on him from within the villa handing one of the cocktails to his guest mohammed prepared to lie down alongside him on the chaise when suddenly he heard a terrible growling from behind spinning around he saw a hideous little dwarf flanked by two of the most viciouslooking dogs hed ever encountered in his life the sight was such a shock that the mans large glass slipped from his hand and shattered on the flagstone terrace who are you demanded mohammed what do you want the dwarf signaled for the boy to rise from the lounge chair and step away from his host mohammed was surprised to see the young man so readily comply his confusion evaporated as the young man approached the dwarf stuck out his hand and was given several large bills before quickly leaving the villa at the dwarfs command the dogs fell silent who are you repeated mohammed what do you want the troll smiled you dont remember me do you of course not weve never met i have absolutely no idea who you are you may not remember me but surely you remember the black sea there was a brothel near the town of sochi what little color remained in the alqaeda operatives face now completely drained away could this be the same dwarf if it was then yes he did remember him he remembered the brothel too mohammed had wanted a very young boy not a dwarf but when the madam and her husband said that the dwarf was the best they were able to do he had decided it was better than nothing and had had his way with him afterward he had felt so disgusted with himself that he had beaten the little creature almost to death if it hadnt been for the quick thinking of one of the whores who was able to give the dwarf the breath of life and compress his chest until his heart restarted he would never have returned to the realm of the living i paid dearly for that misunderstanding replied mohammed the proprietors silence did not come cheap you might have paid them but you never paid me answered the troll i spent a good part of my life looking for you when the americans took you into custody i was prepared to let you rot but then you escaped so tonight i will recoup what is owed me with interest how did you know i was held by the americans because he was the one who turned you in said abdul ali as he stepped from the shadow of the villa as exceptional as the dogs were they had never even detected the assassins approach now they began barking at both mohammed bin mohammed and abdul ali shut them up said the assassin as he pointed his silenced beretta at the troll and drop your weapon when the troll hesitated ali turned his weapon on the nearest caucasian ovcharka and pulled the trigger the troll felt the round just as surely as if it had pierced his own heart he wanted to cry out but he retained his composure and signaled his remaining animal to be still then he dropped his weapon even from where he remained hidden harvath could see enough of the newest party crasher to recognize him he was the man from the cctv footage at libya house the man who had not only helped mohammed bin mohammed escape but who was responsible for the deaths of the nsa employees the marines and all the other victims of the terrible terrorist attacks on new york even more important to harvath it was this man the one the cia was calling abdul ali who had armed mohammed bin mohammed and helped him to kill bob herrington harvath had expected a long hard hunt for ali but now the man had been delivered right to him the promise he had made to bob the night he was murdered was going to be easier to carry out than he had thought with a silencer already affixed to his own weapon harvath raised his h ampk pistol and took aim at the most logical primary targetthe only other man holding a gun though it wasnt the long and painfully drawnout death he would have wished on ali it was what the circumstances dictated taking a deep breath he squeezed the trigger and watched as alis brains exploded out the other side of his head and with that shot pandemonium instantly erupted mohammed bin mohammed threw his considerable bulk to the ground and began crawling for the villa as fast as he could to help slow him down harvath put a round in the back of each of his legs as the alqaeda operative screamed in pain harvath swept his pistol from left to right searching for the dwarf who had suddenly disappeared at the last minute he found him with the bizarre weapon slung over his shoulder the tiny man had leapt onto his gargantuan dog and holding on to the beasts harness was riding him as if he were a thoroughbred the last glimpse harvath had of them was as the amazingly agile animal leapt the high wall at the other end of the veranda and disappeared once more from sight while he didnt have any immediate reason to kill the man or his dog there were a lot of questions he would have liked to have had answeredquestions he was sure that mohammed bin mohammed wouldnt be willing to answer on the other hand harvath wasnt really in the mood to ask what he was in the mood for was payback one hundred four grabbing bin mohammed by the back of the neck harvath dragged him inside and threw him against a large white column as he removed two pairs of flexicuffs and secured the mans hands behind the pillar harvath said ten days ago you killed a very good friend of mine im here to repay the favor the man looked up at harvath i am not afraid to die i was hoping youd say that said scot as he removed two glass vials from a pouch on his belt and showed them to mohammed each of these little things are known as dermestes maculatus museums use them to strip flesh away from carcasses so the skeletons can be studied once they start eating they just cant seem to stop unscrewing the top of the first vial harvath grabbed mohammed in a headlock and inserted the vial into his ear instantly the man began screaming harvath removed a lighter from his pocket and heated the vial until the beetle ran scurrying into mohammeds ear canal once he was sure the creature was in good and deep he repeated the process on the other ear and stood back like a rabbit trapped by a cavein beetles will dig furiously to try to extricate themselves if they happen to be in someones ear the resultant frenzy is enough to drive that person mad harvath had read about it in a book a long time ago and though he wasnt one to stay up late at night devising new means of torture this had always been one of the things he thought would be exceptionally worth trying stepping back harvath watched as the man writhed and shrieked trying to shake the insects from his head he was in the grip of sheer terror though it delivered a certain degree of satisfaction it still wasnt enough to make up for everything else the man had done raising his pistol harvath pulled the trigger and sent one searing hot round into mohammeds stomach it was considered one of the most painful ways a person could die and victims could languish for many hours in unbearable agony until their bodies finally succumbed as far as harvath was concerned it was still too good for mohammed bin mohammed he was contemplating kneecapping the alqaeda terrorist when a noise from the veranda caught his attention having affixed a makeshift pressure bandage to the wound in the dogs chest harvath gently slung the enormous beast over his shoulders and stepped right over mohammeds twitching body as he carried it from the villa outside he had the very real feeling that the only thing preventing a bullet from being fired at him from a rather bizarre weapon was that hidden somewhere out in the dark night the dying dogs owner understood that harvath was trying to save his animal one hundred five the white house washington dc and the dwarf asked harvath as the meeting was drawing to a close what was his role in all of this the president looked at his newly appointed director of national intelligence kenneth wilson and said do you want to take this wilson nodded his head and clearing his throat said we actually know very little about the man you saw in gibraltar but based upon your description of him and in particular his two dogs we believe hes a figure known as the troll the troll rumors of his existence have pervaded the intelligence world since before the fall of the berlin wall its said he deals in the purchase and sale of highly sensitive information we think hes the one who bought off joseph stanton to get the athena locations in new york city what makes you think that after the sites were secured a thorough sweep was conducted to search for any signs that the intelligence being gathered and analyzed there had been compromised and had it asked harvath significantly everything the nsa had on their servers at those locations is gone nothing at this point surprised harvath removing a small silicon device from his pocket wilson held it up and said we found remnants of devices like this one here at each of the locations they can be programmed to covertly transfer a servers data to a remote location while making it look like the servers themselves are still carrying out their normal functions which is why nobody at nsa suspected anything and the alarm was never raised exactly our best explanation is that the troll traded alqaeda the location of where mohammed bin mohammed was being held in exchange for them breaching the athena program locations and planting the devices for him which by the way selfdestructed after the data was transferred and which is why we only found remnants we also believe the troll managed to get to someone inside the defense intelligence agency who revealed where we were keeping mohammed bin mohammed the circle of people in the know is pretty small so we expect to have something soon director wilson continued on but harvath was no longer listening after killing abdul ali and mohammed bin mohammed he thought he had fulfilled the promise hed made bob herrington but now there was one more name he was going to have to cross off his listthe trolls once wilson had wrapped up the president asked scot if he had any other questions this was a relatively rare event because he was not always privy to the entire intelligence picture there were many instances when he was unaware of the full impact of the success of his assignments sometimes out of sheer gratitude he was allowed access to information that otherwise never would have been made available to him on days when this magnanimous flow of intelligence occurred harvath was able to forget if only for a moment how fed up he was with washington politics today had turned out to be just such a day the president didnt have to gather his top people to spend an hour and a half spelling everything out and answering all of harvaths questions but he had and harvath appreciated it he did though have one final question how is amanda rutledge smiled and said shes doing much better thank you a collapsed lung is pretty serious the president nodded i think the death of her friends and so many of the agents on her detail was harder for her to handle than anything else im sure it was replied harvath ill tell her you asked about her thank you mr president always uncomfortable with the presidents fulsome praise of his efforts on behalf of his country scot thanked him for both his time and his candor and then prepared to stand up if you wouldnt mind id like you to stay for a few more minutes said rutledge as he excused the rest of the people in the oval office once they had gone the president removed an envelope from his desk and handed it to harvath whats this scot you are a tremendous asset to this country harvath tried to interrupt but the president stopped him it often seems to me that we should be doing more in return to thank you i dont do it for the thanks sir i know you dont and i also know you dont do it for the money there certainly are places that would pay you a lot more for what you know harvath couldnt tell for sure but he had a sneaking suspicion that the president knew he had been looking for another job lately he made a mental note to get in touch with his contact at valhalla out in colorado to let them know that for the time being he was going to remain in his current position well said rutledge snapping scot back to the here and now looking down harvath realized the president was talking about the envelope he was holding in addition to signing the leasehold were going to need to amend your file to show you as caretaker rutledge added harvath looked up and said im sorry caretaker i dont understand two days ago i spoke with the secretary of the navy are you familiar with the navys federal preservation office no sir i cant say that i am at that moment the presidents chief of staff charles anderson knocked and poked his head into the oval office after saying a quick hello to scot he pointed at his watch and indicated to rutledge that they needed to get going the president pointed at the envelope and said all the informations in there take a few days and then let me know what you think not really knowing what he was thanking the man for harvath shook the presidents hand tucked the envelope inside his breast pocket and left the oval office once he got outside he opened the envelope and read its contents halfway through the first page harvath couldnt believe his eyes exiting the white house grounds he made his way down pennsylvania avenue to where hed parked his trailblazer and then got on the road and headed toward fairfax county virginia he had to see this for himself one hundred six on several acres of land overlooking the potomac river just south of george washingtons mount vernon estate was a small eighteenthcentury stone church known as bishops gate during the revolutionary war the anglican reverend of bishops gate was an outspoken loyalist who provided sanctuary and aid to british spies which resulted in the colonial army attacking the church and inflicting great damage bishops gate lay in ruins until when the office of naval intelligence or oni was established to seek out and report on the enormous postcivil war explosion in the technological capabilities of other worldclass navies several covert oni agent training centers were established up and down the eastern seaboard to instruct naval attachés and military affairs officers on the collection of technical information about foreign governments and their naval developments because of its isolated yet prime location not far from washington dc bishops gate was secretly rebuilt and funded as one of the onis first covert officer training schools as the oldest continuously operating intelligence service in the nation the oni eventually outgrew the bishops gate location the stubby yet elegant church with its attached stone rectory was relegated to a declassified document storage site apparently the fate of bishops gate was not out of the ordinary as harvath read the letter he learned that the navy often was forced to mothball assets that served no immediate need but might at some point in the future this laying away of properties many of them historic like bishops gate might be for a short term an intermediate or an undetermined period regardless of how the properties might once again be used while still under the jurisdiction of the navy the navy was obligated to protect and preserve their historic significance as well as maintain their physical integrity most of the navy properties suitable for use as dwellings were saved for highlevel defectors and other political personages the united states government found themselves responsible for in harvaths case the secretary of the navy a former oni officer was apparently quite pleased to see such a distinguished american entrusted with the property the fact that harvath was an exseal probably didnt hurt his standing with the secretary either bishops gate in its entiretythe church building and the rectory that had been converted into a nicesized house an outbuilding that had been converted into a garage and the extensive groundswere deeded to harvath in a ninetynine year government lease with a token rent of one us dollar due per annum all that was required of harvath was that he maintain the property in a manner befitting its historic status and that he vacate the premises within twentyfour hours if ever given notice with or without cause by the united states navy it had been over fifty years since the navy had any use for bishops gate other than as a file graveyard but harvath was still stunned to have been offered it not including the garage the unique house formed by the church and the attached rectory came to over four thousand square feet of living space and all harvath had to do was make sure the grass was mowed and his onedollarayear rent was in on time he couldnt help but wonder at what he might do with the real rent payments he wouldnt have to make anymore if he accepted the presidents generous offer of course the practical side of harvath would plow as much of the windfall into investments as he could but there was also part of him that had always wanted a sailboat and now that he had the opportunity to live right on the potomac it didnt seem like such an unreasonable goal he spent the better part of the day wandering the property and exploring the old church buildings as he tried to make up his mind though not a particularly spiritual person he hoped somewhere along the way hed be shown a sign it was in the rectory attic that he found oneliterally on a beautifully carved piece of wood was the motto of the anglican missionaries it seemed strangely fitting for the career harvath had decided to remain intransiens adiuva nosi go overseas to give help at that moment harvath knew he was home whats more he didnt need emily post to tell him that turning down a gift any gift from the president of the united states was not only impolite but also a very bad career decision for a federal employee though he still had reservations about accepting such a lavish reward bishops gate had taken hold of harvath and it seemed a shame to allow it to go uninhabited for another day with the help of a few buddies including kevin mccauliff harvath rented a truck and spent that following saturday moving his belongings from his small apartment in alexandria over to bishops gate while his friends marveled at his luck they were unanimous in their agreement that harvath had a lot of work to do on the place his pal gordon avigliano even joked that it looked to him that the navy had actually gotten the better part of the deal not only did they now have a free night watchman in harvath but the sap was also paying them for the privilege it didnt matter that it was only a dollar a year nobody believed harvath anyway once the last of the beer had been consumed and all but the pizza boxes had been eaten harvath politely gave his friends five minutes to vacate his new estate before he threatened to release the hounds it got a good laugh and as he let them go he secured promises that theyd be back to help him with the renovation work there was a lot that needed to be done after a quick shower he pulled on jeans and a polo shirt then hopped into his car for the airport on a lark he had decided to call tracy hastings to see if she wanted to come down and spend some time with him at his new place hastings was thrilled and had booked one of the last seats on the shuttle for that night they picked up takeout from a la lucia in alexandria and had a wonderful dinner picnicstyle in front of the rectorys fireplace the next morning tracy allowed harvath to sleep in he was exhausted from his last assignment as well as the move and was still recovering from the injuries he had suffered in new york in all fairness she hadnt exactly gone easy on him either damn they were good together with a smile on her face and a cup of coffee in her hand tracy opened the door and stepped outside it was a gorgeous summer morning and she took in a deep breath and tried to pinpoint the wonderful smells that seemed to be coming at her from all directions she was worlds away from manhattan and being here with scot was like nothing she had ever known if their lives would let them she could stay here forever and never leave as she bent down to pick one of the flowers growing wild alongside the rectory she noticed that someone had dropped off a beautiful wicker hamper a large satin ribbon was tied to the top and she could hear rustling coming from inside lifting the hampers lid tracy discovered a beautiful white puppy along with it was a book on caucasian ovcharkas and a note picking up the puppy and holding it to her chest she read the crisp white card thank you for saving argus i will forever be in your debt a friend tracy had no idea who the note had come from but she figured scot might either way he was absolutely going to love this dog she just knew it it was time that both of their lives started being filled with things that were good nuzzling the puppy under her chin tracy hastings turned to go back inside but before she could cross the threshold a bullet with her name on it came ripping through the trees as the weapon was disassembled the assassin from scots past took a perverse pride in knowing that this was only the beginning of the pain and retribution that was coming harvaths way harvath was about to learn that you never buried anyone unless you were absolutely certain they were dead authors note i make no secret about the deep respect i hold for the brave american men and women who selflessly serve our nation in our military law enforcement and intelligence communities as someone who wanted to do more than just write
