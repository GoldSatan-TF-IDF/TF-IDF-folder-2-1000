mom was too embarrassed to tell the truth she never said a word but im not entirely stupid i figured it out on my own i was born under an evil star maybe an evil galaxy with zigging mad lights quarreling all over angry lead skies the planets had tove been so cruelly misaligned that no equally malignant conjunction will be possible for another hundred lifetimes i have a feeling though that my partner will be there to gloat when those celestial maladroits again foregather to conspire grumbling head aching empty mug in shaky hand i stomped toward the front door some soontobe sporting an iron hook for a hand pest refused to stop bruising the oak with his knuckles the air shivered with amusement that only rendered me more glum anything my partner found entertaining was bound to be unpleasant for me in the small front room the goddamn parrot harangued himself in his sleep his language fit to pinken the cheeks of amazons i had to preserve the woodwork personally because dean was out visiting his gaggle of homely nieces and the dead man wont get off his can and answer no matter what the circumstances might be hes had a severe attitude problem for about four hundred years he figures just because somebody stuck a knife in him back then he doesnt have to do anything for himself anymore i peeked through the peephole i cussed some which always makes me feel better when that old devil sixth sense tells me that things are about to stop going my way nowhere in sight for as far as my eagle eye could see was there even one tasty morsel of femininity i was so disappointed i grumbled but it always starts with a girl my seventh and eighth senses started perking they couldnt find a girl either then my natural optimism kicked in there wasnt a girl around there wasnt a girl around there wasnt anybody out there but my old pal playmate and a skinny gink who had to be a foreigner because there was no way a karentine of his type could have survived the war in the cantard no girl meant no trouble no girl meant nothing starting no girl meant not having to go to work all was right with the world after all i could deal with this in about ten minutes then draw a beer and get back to plotting my revenge on morley dotes for having stuck me with the goddamn parrot another ghost of amusement tinkled through the stale air it reminded me that the impossible is only barely less likely than the normal around here it was time to air the place out then i made my big mistake i opened the door playmate isnt really nine feet tall he just seems to fill up that much space though he did stoop getting through the doorway and his shoulders were almost too wide to make it and there wasnt an ounce of fat on the not really nine feet of him playmate owns a stable he does the work himself including all the blacksmithery and most of the pitchfork management he looks scary but hes a sweetheart his great dream is to get into the ministry racket his great sorrow is the fact that tunfaire is a city already hagridden by a backbreaking oversupply of priests and religions hey garrett he said repartee isnt his main talent but he does have a sharp eye thats me garrett six feet and change inches of the handsomest most endearing former marine youd ever hope to meet the super kind of fellow who can dance and drink the night away and still retain the skill and coordination to open a door and let a friend in at barely the crack of noon the next day thats not your usual homily buddy ive had a listen or two on occasions when i wasnt fast enough or sly enough to produce a convincing excuse for missing one of his ministerial guest appearances or amateur night sermons at some decrepit storefront church playmate favored me with a sneer hes got a talent for that which exceeds mine with the one raised eyebrow the right side of his upper lip rises up and twists and begins to shimmy and quiver like a belly dancers fanny i save the good sermons for people whose characters would appear to offer some teeny little hint of a possibility that theres still hope for their salvation over in the small front room the goddamn parrot cackled like he was trying to lay a porcupine egg and that amusement stuff was polluting the psychic atmosphere again the dark planets were shagging their heinies into line playmate preempted my opportunity to deploy one of my belated but brilliantly lethal rejoinders this is my friend cypres prose garrett cypres prose was a whisper more than five feet tall he had wild blond hair crazy blue eyes a million freckles and a permanent case of the fidgets he scratched he twitched his head kept twisting on his neck he invents things after what happened this morning i promised youd help him why thank you playmate and im glad you came over because i promised the metropolitan that youd swing by the dream quarter to help put up decorations for the feast of the immaculate deception playmate glowered he has serious problems with the orthodox rite i gave him a look at my own secondteam sneer it dont dance you promised him for me thats what friends are for eh uh all right maybe i overstepped his tone said he didnt think that for a second sorry youre sorry oh thats good that makes everything all right then youre not presuming on my friendship the way morley dotes or winger or saucerhead tharpe might i would never presume on them not me no way the scrawny little dink behind playmate kept trying to peek around him he never stopped talking he strengthened his case constantly with remarks like is that him play he aint much from the way you talked i thought he was gonna be ten feet tall i said i am kid but im not on duty right now cypres prose had a nasal edge on a cracking soprano voice that i found extremely irritating i wanted to clout him upside the head and tell him to speak karentine like a man oh boy after closer appraisal i saw that prose wasnt as old as id thought now i knew how hed survived the cantard by being too young to have gone playmate put on a bigeyed pleading face hes as bright as the sun garrett but not real long on social skills the boy managed to wriggle past playmates brown bulk ah this child was definitely the sort who got himself pounded regularly because he just couldnt get his brilliance wrapped around the notion of keeping his mouth shut he just naturally had to tell large slowwitted overmuscled swifttempered types that they were wrong about whatever it was they were wrong about what would not matter i observed and the truth shall bring you great pain you understand playmate sighed but dont hardly sympathize i grabbed the kid as he tried to weasel his million freckles into the small front room not with somebody who just cant make the connection between cause and effect where people are concerned i shifted my grip brought the kids right arm up behind his back eventually he recognized a connection between pain and not holding still the goddamn parrot decided this was the ideal moment to begin preaching i know a girl who lives in a shack playmates friend turned red i said why dont we go into my office my office is a custodians closet with delusions of grandeur playmate is big enough to clog the doorway all by himself we could manage the kid in there if i dragged him inside first in passing i noted that my partner had no obvious immediate interest in participating beyond being amused at my expense same old story everybody takes advantage of mama garretts favorite boy in there kip playmate is a paragon of patience this kid though was taking him to his limit he laid a huge hand on the boys shoulder pinched that would smart playmate can squeeze chunks of granite into gravel i turned loose went and got behind my desk i like to think i look good back there playmate set cypres prose in the clients chair he stood behind the kid one hand always on the boys shoulder as though the kid might get away if he wasnt restrained every second for the time being though the boy was focused totally he had discovered eleanor shes the central figure in the painting that hangs behind my desk that portrays a terrified woman fleeing from a looming shadowy manor house that has a lamp burning in one high window the surrounding darkness reeks of evil menace the painting has a lot of dark magic in it once upon a time it had a whole lot more it helped nail eleanors killer at one time if you were evil enough you might see your own face portrayed in the shadowy margins eleanor had poleaxed my young visitor she startles everyone at first glimpse but this reaction was exceptional i take it he has a touch of paranormal talent playmate nodded showed me an acre of white teeth mouthed the words there might be a wizard in the woodpile somewhere i raised an eyebrow now playmate mouthed father unknown ah our lords from the hill do get around often playing no more fairly than the randier gods in some of the less upright pantheons offspring produced without benefit of wedlock are not entirely uncommon not infrequently those reveal signs of having received the parental gift i asked am i going to grow a beard before i find out whats on your mind i heard a thump from upstairs katie must be awake she would boggle the boy too all right like i told you thiss cypres prose kip for short ive know him since he was this high hes always hung around the stable he adores horses lately hes been inventing things another black mark behind the kids name horses are the angels of darkness and theyre clever enough to fool almost everybody else into thinking that theyre good for something and this matters to me because that air of amused presence became more noticeable kip definitely felt it his eyes got big he lost interest in eleanor he peered around nervously he told playmate i think theyre here i feel something he frowned but thiss different thiss something old and earthy like a troll ha i chuckled more like a trolls ugly illegitimate uncle nobody had compared the dead man to a troll before except possibly in reference to his social attitudes i felt him starting to steam up the boy getting the dead mans goat shouldve told me something but instead left me a tad openminded at a when my finances didnt at all require me looking at work money had been accumulating faster than i could waste it ill give you five minutes playmate talk to me playmate said it would be better if kip explained but can he pay attention long enough to do it somebody please tell me something patience is not one of my virtues when ive got a sneaking suspicion that somebody wants me to work kip opened and closed his mouth several times he was trying but hed become distracted again i sighed playmate did too he lives in his own reality garrett so it would seem you know him long time know him yes yes you tell me horsepooperscoopinman he invents things yes yes youre here yes yes why somebody and i have a feeling it might actually be more than one somebody has been following him around he claims theyve been trying to dig around inside his head then this morning somebody tried to kidnap him i looked at kip i looked at playmate i looked at kip again heroic me i managed to keep a straight face but only because i deal with these problems myself on a regular basis particularly threats of mental vandalism and larceny another cascade of remote amusement kip jerked in his chair i suggested tell me why anybody would bother playmate shrugged he seemed a little embarrassed no longer sure seeing me was the best idea because he invents things thats what he thinks so whats he invent ideas mostly lots of ideas for devices and mechanisms that look like theyd work just fine if we could get the right tools and the proper materials to build them weve been trying to put a couple of the simpler ones together in practical terms hes mainly made little things of not much value like a writing stick that doesnt crumble in your fingers like charcoal can but that doesnt have to be dipped in an inkwell or water every few seconds eliminates the problems you have with wet ink and there was a marvellous tool sharpener and a new style bit that isnt nearly as hard on a horses mouth im already using that one and its been selling pretty well and he has all sorts of ideas for complicated engines most of which i just dont understand kips head bobbed a little agreeing with playmate but about what i have no idea what about family playmate winced that wasnt a question with which he was comfortable not in front of the kid anyway kip is the youngest of three he has a sister and a brother his sister cassie is the oldest she has four years on his brother rhafi who has a couple on kip his mother is unusual he tapped his temple their father is missing he held up two then three fingers to indicate that multiple fathers had to be considered possibly cypres wasnt aware in such matters sometimes mothers can be less than forthcoming the war playmate shook his head he rested both of his hands solidly on kips shoulders it was impossible for that kid to sit still he had begun rifling through the stuff on my desk reading snippets he could read that was not common amongst youngsters i was willing to bet his literacy was playmates fault i pulled my inkwell out of harms way while thinking that eliminating wet ink might be an amazingly wonderful trick when i get going i get the stuff all over the place the boy said there are more of them all the time you know theyre looking for lastyr and noodiss theyve hired a man named bic gonlit to help them garrett playmate demanded what i know bic gonlit know of him anyway and you look puzzled only because i am bic gonlit is a bounty hunter he specializes in bringing them back alive why would he be interested in kip kips tone told me he wondered why everyone else in this world had to be so thick hes not looking for me they dont care about me they want lastyr and noodiss theyre only bothering with me because they think i know where those two are and do you lastyr and noodiss no not entirely convincingly i thought those names didnt fit any recognizable slot not quite elvish maybe upcountry dwarfish possibly ogreish if they represented nicknames noodiss sounded like something scatological in ogre dialect who are they kip said you cant tell them from real people they make you think youre looking at real people unless you look at their eyes they cant disguise their eyes who cant what the hell is he talking about play im not sure garrett i cant get any more sense out of him than that thats why i brought him to you thanks your confidence makes me feel warm and fuzzy all over playmate ignored my sarcasm he knew me too well i thought he was mental too at first thiss been going on for a while and i never saw anything to convince me that he wasnt making up another one of his stories but then somebody broke into his flat while some of his family were there which is weird because the proses dont have a pot to pee in then next day this morning they came to the stable three of them three strange shiny women ive been letting kip use a corner of the smithy for a workshop he does his projects there they tried to drag him off you didnt let them of course i didnt let them he was offended because id even asked though it wasnt all me they seemed extremely distracted by the horses afraid of them even that just sounds like basic common sense to me you shouldnt joke that way garrett playmate just will not believe the truth about horses these guys know horses mean trouble and theyve got a beef with this kid and those things are somehow a surprise to you some people view the world through a whole different set of spectacles playmate chose not to pursue the debate their eyes were weird garrett almost like holes or like there were little patches of fog right there hiding them when they looked straight at you i tried to imagine the encounter playmate abhors violence yet for a nonviolent idealist he can be totally convincing in any argument that steps on a banana peel and slides off the intellectual plane playmate has sense enough to understand that not everyone shares his views there are some people that need hammering and others that just plain need killing there are people out there even a mother couldnt love these visitors some new kind of breed all the races infesting tunfaire seem capable of interbreeding often the mechanics arent easy to visualize but the results are out there on the street at times nature takes a very strange turn and some of the strangest are among my friends kip shook his head playmate told me give me a sheet of paper ill draw you a picture he produced a small polished cherrywood box with silver fittings when opened it revealed a battery of artists tools he took out a couple of sticks i decided had to be kips inventions another unsuspected talent i pushed over a torn sheet of paper id only just started using its back side i recalled seeing charcoal drawings around playmates place but i never wondered enough about them to make a direct connection this detecting business requires great curiosity and attention to the tiniest details i was amazed once playmate got started youre in the wrong racket play not much call for this kind of thing garrett his hand moved swiftly and confidently maybe in a carnival he was a lefty of course they always are the guy who did eleanor probably had two left hands the portrait took shape rapidly the original mustve been one ugly critter it had a head like a bottomup pear it had a mouth so small it was fit to eat nothing but soup no ears were evident but playmate was still drawing his hand moved slower and slower a frown creased his forehead pinhead sweat beads appeared he strained mightily to get his hand to do something it didnt want to do he gasped less call than there is for new preachers whats wrong this wont come out like what i saw i wanted to draw the woman in charge a small woman averagelooking with ginger hair cut off straight above her eyes and straight all the way around the rest two inches down from where her ears shouldve been the thing he had drawn owned no ears he was drawing something that wasnt human its head was shaped something like an inverted pear its eyes were oversize bulgy teardrops shaped evidently without pupils he did not put in a nose instead there were slits unconnected forming an inverted y i observed there isnt any nose and what about ears i thought they were hidden under her hair i guess not therere these dark bruiselooking patches down here practically on the neck maybe they do the same job that was weird i couldnt think of a race that didnt have ears of some kind in fact most races have ears that make our human ones look like afterthoughts great hairy pointy or dangly things all covered with scales and warts old bones youve got to help us out here why cant play draw what he really saw grumpy atmospherics kip squeaked the dead man observed mr playmate appears to be reproducing what was actually in front of him rather than what he believes he saw it is possible he was gulled by some illusion the illustration does resemble the boys recollections of his elven acquaintances wonderful play ill bet colonel block wishes he had somebody who could draw pictures like this of the villains he wants to catch the guard can go on wishing you know im a simple man garrett not greedy at all but i do have to point out that a secondrate stable operator like myself still makes a better living than the bestpaid honest policeman most everything pays better than being honest you want to work for block and relway youd better have a bonedeep law and order calling now what kip was making noises he wasnt as impressed with the sketch as i was the eyes arent right play they wouldnt be would they playmate growled since whenever they look straight at you they go all smoky and they arent eyes like ours anyway they dont have any eyelids its not that its their shape theyre bulgier garrett the kid jumped squealed went paper pale in an instant scattered the documents on my desk he moaned theyre here theyre trying to get into my head again he tried to jump past playmate hang on to him i said thats just old chuckles deciding to pick on me for a minute old chuckles demurred he sent the young man is entirely correct garrett there is an unknown creature in the alleyway out back trying to look into the house i am confusing it and blocking it but that is extremely difficult the work requires most of the attention of most of my minds the dead man belongs to a rare species known as loghyr they have that knack of having multiple minds capable of parallel and independent function ive heard that some develop multiple personalities i cant imagine old bones is a complete horror show being just one of himself simultaneous shrieks sounded upstairs and in the small front room i dont know what katies problem was but it was audibly obvious that the goddamn parrot had decided to focus his powers of persuasion on convincing the world that he was about as sane as a drunken butterfly the creature is now confused by what i have done which is to connect it to a couple of marginally sensitive but completely empty minds perhaps it will become equally lost thats no way to talk about my girlfriend the dead man was able to make the air sneer and i suppose he had a point nature endowed katie with countless delicious attributes at first glance excessive intellect doesnt appear to be one of those but actually bimbo is a survival strategy that she has let get out of control the kid began babbling soft nonsense not unlike that of yon inebriated megamouth it sounded suspiciously like some of the nonsense katie whispered when she was about halfasleep and purring i asked playmate kip have a history with booze or drugs the kid was now not speaking any form of karentine i recognized my place isnt the neighborhood ranting ground for any of those cults that specialize in speaking in tongues even so soon every fourth word out of kips mouth sounded vaguely familiar they may even have been real words completely out of context no never he doesnt have that kind of imagination but thiss exactly the way he got when those elves came looking for him elves what elves are we suddenly starting to get somewhere no i just feel more comfortable calling them elves say they were elfsized but they werent like any elves that we know they were female you ever see a female elf who didnt look like the devils disciple not my choice of descriptives but i knew what he meant even the ugly elf girls are pretty enough and wicked enough to melt your spine with a wink and a smile and a wiggle if the fancy takes them no never have these girls werent they were almost asexual how did you know garrett i do not enjoy such an oversufficiency of mindspace that i can waste any following your digressions save that for later the creature is in the alley it is confused it can be captured will you please see to that and cease this passing the time of day with mr playmate play my sedentary sidekick tells me one of your elves is skulking around in the alley out back why dont we go invite him to the party we can smack him around a little to break his concentration old bones can ransack his mind while hes distracted which means ill be able to find out what thiss all about and youll find out if theres any real reason for you to worry damn that wasnt the best word to use playmate worries all the time and his worrytosuccess equation is an inverse proportion he only gives up worrying and fussing when things get truly awful garrett all right hes so damned lazy he cant be bothered to die but he expects me to scurry like bees getting ready for winter and sees no inconsistency all right heres the official plan play playmates job was to come into the alley from its wizards reach end being younger and more athletic i took the longer way around so i could close in from the other direction i trotted west on macunado then ducked into a narrow fetid breezeway where i kicked up a covey of pixies who were living under an overturned basket poor new immigrants obviously i knew before i saw their ragged country costumes you folks better find yourselves someplace where you wont have to fight off the cats and dogs and rats though tunfaires dogs and cats do mostly know better than to bother little people but rats while cunning arent always real bright and as for the others hunger has a way of overwhelming even the most pointed of past lessons these little folk thanked me for my concern by swarming around me cursing in tiny voices while threatening to stick me with teensy poisoned rapiers when i entered the breezeway the goddamned parrot was a passenger on my shoulder he was behaving but once i started leaping and swatting at those damned mosquitoes he flapped toward a perch high above whence he spouted gratuitous advice to the pixies stay to his left he doesnt see as well on that side awk the racket had attracted the interest of one of those leatherwinged flying lizards that sometimes nap up on the rooftops between pigeon snacks they arent common anymore mostly because they have trouble outthinking large rocks they make rats and pigeons look like shining intellectuals they are very slow learners this one looked particularly shopworn the trailing edges of its wings were tattered it had patches of mold on its chest when it looked at the goddamn parrot it saw the answer to all its prayers it was the scruffiest flying lizard id ever seen but it still looked like the answer to a prayer or two of my own life would be so much simpler if i got rid of the chicken in the clown suit as long as i could manage it in some way that wouldnt aggravate the dead man or morley dotes morley had gifted me with the jabbering vulture accompanied by a strong suggestion that no harm should come to the monster at my hand or through my negligence the pixies lost interest in me the moment the lizard started trying to get into the breezeway they knew a real threat when they smelled one a chorus of squeals preceded a general surge of the flock toward the scrofulous flyer the goddamn parrot dropped back down to my shoulder he was shaking for once in his sorry existence he was fresh out of smartass remarks as i got out of there the pixies proved that theyd been playing with me all along as i left the breezeway a matron zipped over to ask which cuts interested me theys good eatin on them things bigun the giblets is real tasty when theys grilled you people keep the whole thing i brought my lunch i jerked a thumb at my shoulder ornament ooh pretty one small voiced piped another wanted to know kin we have some of the feathers i sensed a onceinalifetime opportunity something came over me my jaw locked up i couldnt mouth the offer i make almost every day as many as a dozen times i wanted to shriek i couldnt turn loose of the dodo in the clown suit the air seemed to tinkle and sparkle with invisible chuckles so old bones wasnt quite as preoccupied elsewhere as he wanted me to think i shouldve gotten suspicious when the painted jungle buzzard demonstrated such exceptional manners interesting the dead man hadnt ever before touched me directly this far from the house maybe he was distracted maybe distracted so much that he couldnt be as careful keeping the full range of his abilities concealed or maybe he just liked the goddamn parrot too much to let him go wish i had time to experiment after our initial divergence of viewpoint the pixies and i went our ways on friendly terms meaning they were too busy harvesting everything but the flyers squeak to waste time tormenting a bigun though a couple of youngsters did follow me mainly to get out of doing chores i headed east down the alley afraid my delays might have allowed my quarry to give me the slip though if id thought i wouldve realized that my foulbeaked companion wouldve been barking like the wolf at the end of the world if the dead man had suffered a moments disappointment something buzzed behind my ear not the family birdbrain who was on patrol now or more likely hitting on some nitwitted pigeon i started to swat the sound held up just in time a pixie girl definitely a little inexperienced unwittingly drifted forward far enough to be seen from the corner of my eye one key to success in my racket is making friends lots of friends in as broad a range of stations races and professions as is possible a pixie ally would be a huge resource i started sweettalking no telling what i might have accomplished if fate hadnt decided to roll my bones the pixies let out startled shrieks at the same moment that the goddamn parrot barked my name i got about a tenth of seconds glimpse of a man who fit his name perfectly unusual he was all rounds he had a round head with dwindling thickets of hair sagging to the south leaving a blinding shine behind he had a round mouth with puffy round lips round eyes and a nose that was almost round as a hogs snoot he had a round body too i didnt get a good look at his feet the whole globular package didnt stand but maybe five inches over five feet tall this was bic gonlit bounty hunter a man youd peg as an applecheeked little baker addicted to his own products or a guy who cracked feeble jokes in place of real entertainment in some dive harboring upwardly mobile aspirations toward the lower lower class he was a man who had to wear elevator boots to get up enough altitude to cork a big handsome boy like me had to be the boots he was known for the boots legend said he had had them specially made by a dwarfish cobbler in a sleazy little shop off bleak on the southern edge of the tenderloin so rumor would have it because the boots had been made into gonlits signature inside the tunfaire underworld or maybe hed brought a ladder since ordinarily he was way shorter than me the boots only made him two inches taller i didnt get a real gander at the infamous boots i didnt see any ladder either i did get a vague glimpse of what looked like an overweight donkey behind my assailant then an outstanding look at an upwardly rushing alley surface after gonlit leaped up and whacked me across the back of my skull the one tap turned my bones to jelly i sagged into the muck like a candle left out in the summer sun the goddamn parrot and the pixie girl cheered me on or jeered me or something they made a lot of noise i think the donkey started laughing playmate was fanning me when i opened my eyes hoping for some blond angel of mercy good friend that he is he had dragged me into the shade and propped me against a wall all before anyone found me and explored my pockets for hidden treasure i made a crippled kitten sort of sound to express my appreciation and ask when the angel would arrive playmate said i wouldnt move around was i you i am me and i dont plan to even breathe hard my head and i didnt drink a drop this morning ive got to get ahold of a warsurplus helmet one of the kind with that bigass spike on top youd still have to remember to wear it what happened i was going to ask you i dont know i heard your bird screaming made me suspect that youd found yourself on the short end again youve got a talent for that i charged up here behold you really were in trouble a rolypoly little bald guy who looked a lot like bic gonlit was strutting around you measuring you for a hearty whack with the great hairy club he was packing it was bic gonlit i caught a glimpse before the lights went out he mustve been wearing his extra special tall boots though this isnt his normal style garrett you know him i for sure wanted to know him better than i did now what little i did know was hearsay he was a bounty hunter who brought them in alive he had quirks and unusual personal habits and magic boots id seen him just often enough to recognize him you failed to mention that when the name came up before i didnt need to mention it kip told you all you needed then i only know his reputation anyway which doesnt include murder he grew up in my part of town hed be a little older than me hes supposed to have a big taste for fine food and good wine including the tunfaire gold when he can get it but if that really was him hes sure gone downhill since the last time i saw him that was him or his evil twin maybe hes been eating so high hes had to expand his repertoire he wouldnt just bushwhack a guy why the hell not could playmate be that naive even i would bushwhack a guy fifteen inches taller and fifteen years younger than me not to mention fifteen stone lighter assuming that i was adequately motivated the quality and the nature of the motivation is whats worth debating on reflection playmate decided he had no ready answer i asked where is he now he took off when he saw me coming jumped on a burro not much bigger than him and rode off covering his face think he recognized you i expect thats why he bothered to hide his face i mean how many people of my size and coloring are there and how many of those are likely to be caught hanging around with you if bic gonlit knew who we were he was about to become scarcer than lizard hair good points i wonder did he know whose head he was bopping before he tried to brain me i have a reputation partly for lacking humor about things like headbashing when its my melon involved partly for having acquired a number of close friends whose responses would be unpredictable if something unpleasant happened to me that wasnt my own fault some might start sharpening their teeth its hard to imagine it being my own fault but in the laws of obligatory revenge there are exit codicils about he asked for it and he needed it playmate might be one of those friends my partner is definitely i like to believe that saucerhead tharpe and morley dotes are others along with several powerful wealthy family chieftains ive helped in my time those include the beermaking weiders the shoemaking tales and the wedonttalkaboutwhatwedo contagues the contagues would be the real worry for any villain though the least likely avengers the contagues captain the outfit the syndicate the commission the central committee of the citys organized crime their strength and reach and savagery when roused are legendary even our wizardly overlords on the hill concern themselves about needlessly rousing the ire of chodo contague and his daughter belinda chodo and belinda do not allow themselves to be constrained by traditional legal customs or the normal rules of evidence they hurt people and they kill people theyre supposed to be my friends and they scare the whiskers off me at the time it did not occur to me that bic gonlit might have wanted to collect a bounty on me what do you want to do playmate asked besides find bic gonlit and whip fifty pounds of lard off his broad butt go home and get cleaned up tunfaires alleyways arent paved neither are they kept clean where they exist at all theyre little more than broad shallow trenches where refuse can accumulate in anticipation of eventual rains heavy enough to carry some of the waste down into one of the storm channels that drain into the river it takes a conscientious sort willing to make an extra effort to take advantage of the travel opportunities offered by tunfaires alleys the kings good and lazy subjects employ them when theyre too shy to dispose of something in the street out front so by the grace of bic gonlit i made the intimate acquaintance of some of my neighbors greatest embarrassments most of which of course would seem trivial to a disinterested witness often the secret vice that concerns you most is of no interest whatsoever to anyone whose opinion you dread the main problem exists inside your own head thats one of those things most of us learn too late a lifeskills version of the destroyer comeback that pops up wearing a big goofy grin three hours after some boor qualifies for a sound verbal caning thanks i told playmate your timing was perfect we aim to please wheres the other one who the guy we came out here to watch the weird elf playmate shrugged if he was still here he had a knack for the invisible maybe the dead man was able to keep track probably wouldnt admit it if he did lets say im cynical about his ability there was no sign of the goddamn parrot either nor any of pixies did some smallsize skulls get cracked too might be worth the headache if somebody capped that dodo did you notice what happened to mr big my bird playmate shook his head never mind i wouldnt bet two dead flies on tripping over the amount of good luck necessary to get me shut of that magpie cleanly lets get out of here playmate grunted he was uncomfortable there he was a preacher not an adventurer and unwanted adventures seemed to bubble up around me maybe its my diet though if complained at id point out that hed brought this one on himself we abandoned the alley brokenhearted over our failure folks on wizards reach raised eyebrows pinched their noses and turned away but nothing helped me it didnt matter which way i turned my head or how tightly i pinched my nose i could still smell me and i was way past ripe maybe a sudden thunderstorm would come up and wash me down to the river maybe they ought to put all the unemployed exsoldiers to work cleaning the city never happen makes too much sense and it would cost public monies that can be put to better use lining somebodys pockets the neighbors lost interest in me when somebody hollered there goes one and everything came to a halt while the entire population stared at the sky i was a couple beats late i saw nothing what the hell is that all about playmate looked at me like hed just flipped a boulder and discovered a new species of fool where have you been thereve been strange lights in the sky and weird things hurtling around overhead for weeks longer than that if you believe some people i thought everybody in tunfaire knew about them and was watching for them well not me tell me playmate shook his head you have to get out of the house more garrett even when youre not working you need to know whats going on around you i couldnt argue with that what the hell my front door stood wide open maybe kip ran away from the vantage of his superior altitude playmate surveyed macunado street uphill and down which would be stupid he cant find his own way home i gave him a raised eyebrow look where do you find them hes worse than dean is dean being the antediluvian artifact who serves as my livein cook and housekeeper who has several huge personality flaws those include acting like my mom and my dad and having a soft heart bigger than my often somnolent sidekick but dean does confine his overweening charity to kittens and strange young women playmate will take in anything including birds with broken wings and nearly grown boys who need a guide to get around their own hometown playmate was too concerned to talk he charged up my front steps and into the house i followed at a more dignified pace i wasnt used to all that exercise hey garrett hes right where we left him absolutely kip was nailed to the clients chair wearing an expression like hed just enjoyed a divine visitation the dead man was holding him there but that couldnt account for the goofy expression then who left the door open your lady friend became distressed when she could find no one willing to make her breakfast when the boy just stared at her and drooled she stormed out that sparkling sense of amusement hung in the air once more rich and mellow with welldefined edges but you had plenty of brainpower left over to hold and manage this nimrod being dead had corrupted somebodys sense of relative values the streets are swamped with goofballs but katie is unique katie is like a religious epiphany and what happened to the talking buzzard he would know the goddamn parrot was almost a third arm and extra mouth for him anymore hes going to weep great tears when that vulture bites the dust though morley is fond of reminding me that parrots can live about a million years if something doesnt wring their scrawny necks ill weep myself when hes gone tears of joy mr big is tracking the creature you failed to capture because you were unable keep your attention on the matter at hand you mean bic gonlit the guy who made his escape on a galloping donkey because nobody bothered to warn me that it was him hanging around in the alley leaving me unprepared apparently an oversight on my part i detected no second presence out there which is no longer of any consequence now anyway but i would be remiss if i failed to point out that you should have been better prepared knowing there could be difficulty no consequence difficulty you arent the one the little porkball whapped upside the head spare us your unconvincing histrionics garrett unconvincing i was convinced i took a deep breath id never gotten in the last word yet but like an oldtimer married fifty years im an eternal optimist it could happen there might come a day it might be today actually itll probably come when im on my deathbed and the reaper snatches me before old bones can come back at me except that chuckles might decide to come after me hes already got a head start death now theres a guy who knows how to have the last word mr big is following the creature i sensed in the alley garrett not any sad little manhunter named gonlit i had thought you would understand that a most unusual creature this is too nothing like it has entered my ken before most notably it seems capable of rendering itself invisible by fogging the minds of those around it it is amazing and you keep telling me theres nothing new under the sun playmates scrawny young buddy finally collected himself enough to notice us what happened to you guys you smell awful my good and true friend playmate announced what you smell is garrett i myself am redolent of roses lilacs and other sweet herbal delights i glared at playmate we ran into bic gonlit i turned my glower on the boy he did not leap at the opportunity to have a chuckle at my expense maybe he wasnt a total social disaster at all times maybe he retained some rudimentary skewed sense of selfpreservation thats mama garretts big boy he can find a silver lining inside the ugliest sows ear maybe he didnt have any sense of humor at all kip looked to playmate for confirmation playmate told him it was gonlit then he told me do something about your sweet self i have a strong feeling were about to get out amongst the people i wouldnt want you to embarrass yourself yet again the stardust of amusement twinkled in the air i would propose that mr playmate has offered excellent advice garrett i smelled doom i smelled it like id smelled leaf mold in the jungle every time itd rained while i was in the islands it was in the air sneezing thick i did not have to sniff to catch a whiff i was about to be cursed squirm as i might i was about to have to go to work all because i had been dim enough to open my door and let trouble walk in i whined where on the gods green earth is the beautiful girl itd never failed before id always gotten some wonderful eyecandy out of yike old dean who pretends to be the chief cook and housekeeper around here but who is really the wicked stepmother had stuck his bitter persimmonsucking face into the office mr garrett why is it that i return home to find the front door standing wide open it was an experiment i was trying to learn if crabby old people will kick a door shut before they start complaining about it having been left open of particular interest are crabby old men who live in a household where their status more closely approximates that of a guest than something more eternal so you tell me do you have any idea wheres the girl dean doesnt have much of a sense of humor he offered me the full benefit of his hard grayeyed stare as always he was rockconfident he could demonstrate to the world that my second greatest flaw is my frivolous incautious nature he believes my greatest failing to be my persistent bachelorhood that from a character who never got within rockflinging range of matrimony himself i put up with him because he is a wonderful cook and housekeeper when the mood takes him and because hes cranky enough to hold his own with the dead man though when he has his druthers he has nothing to do with old bones at all lets not fuss i told him i have a client here bad word choice that brightened dean right up little pleases him more than knowing that im working i ground my teeth a bit then continued so lets get this sorted out quickly ive got to catch up with katie before she developed an attitude toward me that i was sure to regret dean scowled as he headed toward the kitchen katie isnt one of his favorites he doesnt approve of katie he hasnt been able to charm her the way he did my few other occasional female friends i fear miss shaver will have to wait garrett no not hardly right now theres nothing more important than miss shaver playmate and kip appeared startled old bones hadnt included them in his message though kip did look baffled and kept rubbing his head and looking around like he knew something was going on i have exceeded myself somewhat ethically in reviewing the boys memories there being so many questions accompanied by so few answers it seemed possible that the best course was to see if he might not know something without being aware that he knew it plausible if prolix i had used that argument on him a time or three trying to prod him into becoming a little more aggressive in mining the thoughts of visitors and suspects and what did you discover you have to give him his line or he wont communicate very little to tell the truth this boy has no more than two toes anchored inside our reality his head is occupied by a totally eclectic jumble of fantasic nonsense and it is amidst that that he lives most of the time he is always the hero in his own tale well arent we all some of his fantasies recall wellknown epics and sagas some have their genesis in common storytellers tales some are mutant versions of historical events and even a few things might possibly have some basis in truth behind the fantasy stuff he has built on top of genuine events inside his head it is impossible to discern the real from the imagined if most of it concerns girls it sounds like the inside of a normal boys head you would think that way and you would be incorrect while it does concern girls some of it it does so principally in the clever and daring methods by which he rescues the enchanted princess or other damsel in distress while there are several of them i have yet to discover any of his fantasy women less than chastely clad or treated i gave kip a quick glance consisting of about eighty percent worry and twenty percent accolade though i suspected that respect for women was not a real part of the equation naïveté would be the real culprit the dead man continued he is acquainted with creatures he knows as lastyr and noodiss they are not human but the boy has not cared enough about the answer to find out what they really are the images in his mind are not familiar to me the image that appeared in my mind then was unfamiliar to me as well inbreeding or interbreeding you need only stroll around tunfaire a few hours to see the incredible range of natures artistry and her bottomless capacity for the cruel practical joke perhaps and perhaps they are something never before seen in this world lets not turn alarmist i growled alarmed once upon a time not long ago i got into a headbutting contest with something never before seen at that time very nasty neverbrushtheirteeth and talkbacktotheirmamas foul elder gods who thought that the god racket would be a lot softer if they could bust out of the dark place where they were confined and could come set up shop in our world there was nothing supernatural about the watcher in the alley garrett quite the opposite i think there was no magic in it at all it seemed as though it stood entirely outside the realms of the magical the metaphysical and the supernatural i gobbled a couple pints of air while i tried to make sense of that trying to sort through the countless implications a world without magic a place of order and predictability with all evil fled darker possibilities occurred to me as well playmate began to poke and prod me with a singletree forefinger garrett i know its a big empty wasteland without many landmarks but how about you dont get lost inside your own head right now i shook the gourd in question the waste space was anything but empty right now most of that speculation seemed to be leaking over from the dead mans secondary minds suggesting that the puzzle had him sufficiently intrigued that he had become incautious where his thoughts strayed sorry chuckles got me going for a minute twould seem that hes gotten kip going too the boy was as rigid as a fence post all the color had drained from behind his freckles his eyelids were closed when i lifted one i found his eyeball rolled up so that he seemed to have no pupil what did you do here smiley the dead man launched a longwinded paean of selfexoneration i sensed its complete lack of substance right away and focused on playmate so cut the bull and tell me what you want from me i suppose what i really want is for you to look out for him kips a royal pain sometimes garrett but thats mostly because nobody ever taught him how to get along with people he befriended a couple of strays lost souls in the physical sense he took care of them they were grateful that made him feel important same as i feel when i take care of him and the horses he shouldnt get hurt for that playmate was right the world needed more helpful and considerate people but i was looking at something else some very complex things seemed to be going on inside playmate right now he was taking this more personally than he should you wouldnt be the missing father here would you that stunned playmate he chomped air a couple of times in a way that left me wondering if i hadnt somehow struck nearer the mark than id thought possible one glance and even the most cynical student of human folly would understand that cypres prose was no kin to playmate dont try to provoke me garrett huh provocation isnt my style not with my friends not very often anyway not the ones thatre three feet taller than me and strong enough to hold a horse under one arm while using the off hand to change the monsters shoes im sorry i apologize this mess is keeping me on edge why is that by now i had resigned myself to not being able to make peace with katie anytime soon why dont you just lay this whole thing out so we dont have to pick you guys apart just so we can assemble enough information for me to start ive found that clients never want to tell the whole story never another given is that theyre going to lie to you about half of what they tell you they want results without having to reveal anything embarrassing they lie about almost everything the worst offenders are those who have fallen victim to their own greed or stupidity they expect results too playmate was not a bad client his fib quotient was pretty low probably as much because he knew about my partner as because hes naturally a good guy he talked a good deal but failed to tell me much more than i had gotten already kip had become friendly with a pair of oddballs named lastyr and noodiss no other names given he had helped them learn their way around after a while other oddballs turned up looking for the first two inasmuch as they never explained their interest that was not taken to be benign especially considering recent events at the stable and kips home not all of the oddballs were necessarily the same kind of oddball lastyr and noodiss had been around for most of a year those hunting them had shown up only recently all the elves seemed very determined kip nodded a lot and didnt add anything i trusted the dead man would collect anything that reached the surface of the boys thoughts playmate told me it may be coincidence kips always made up fantastic stories but it was right after those first two characters showed up that he started inventing things i mean things that worked or looked like maybe you could make them work the boys head is bursting with the images of the most amazing mechanisms garrett he seemed completely thrilled i asked what would you suggest i do just stick with us for a while playmate said investigate investigate what let your experience be your guide and whatever else you do do try to catch one of those creatures and bring it here to see me im the miracle worker of tunfaire arent i arent i there was no sign of katie when we stepped out the front door me freshly bathed and cleanly dressed in handmedown apparel that approached the respectable my sweetie had an hour head start now and would be boiling like an overheated teapot katie was going to require some cautious cooling down i definitely didnt want her getting too cold i did spot dean headed home where the hell had he been he wasnt carrying anything he dropped a coin a coin that belonged to me because hed never give away a chipped copper of his own onto the tattered blanket of a streetside fortuneteller that caught her completely by surprise nevertheless she gave him a toothless blessing there was an idea i ought to hang out a shingle proclaiming myself a great psychic old bones could rummage around inside their heads and feed me the items i would use to impress them enough to make them turn loose of their money an open mouth precludes open ears what the hell does that mean i hadnt said anything i hate it when you talk that ancient wisdom stuff the butterfly is silent when the eagle walks upon the sand i patted myself down i was equipped with an arsenal of mostly nonlethal tools of mayhem lead on play playmate descended the steps and turned left i followed keeping kip between us dean met us at the foot of the steps where you been i asked running a couple of errands ah i said no more no point letting him know he gave himself away whenever he was sneaking around doing something on the dead mans orders let us continue friend playmate i studied the street as we resumed moving i saw nothing out of place macunado street is a busy thoroughfare day or night a ferocious downpour or bitter winter weather are about all that will clear it the street was particularly busy today but it was conventionally busy not one known villain nor a potential riot was anywhere in sight who was that playmate asked after i waved to a neighbor mrs cardonlos the police spy sometimes tormenting her is the only fun to be had therere occasions when i despair of you garrett therere times when you appear to be your own worst enemy why on earth would you want to taunt someone who has the power to tell lies about you to people whod just as soon feed you to the rats because relways bunch would be more suspicious if i didnt deal relway is the master of tunfaires unacknowledged secret police force i know him because i was there when that particular terrorbird hatched its existence has become an open secret anyway i do get nervous sometimes knowing what i do know about some key individuals relway wouldnt hesitate to bend or break the law in his determination to maintain law and order he might not hesitate to bend or break me playmates livery establishment was less than an hour away we reached it without running into trouble once we did i borrowed his kitchen to brew myself a fresh mug of headache medicine kips little workshop didnt tell me much it was evident the kid knew his tools though he had a hell of a collection half of which i didnt know what they were he had a hundred unidentifiable projects going as soon as we walked in he grabbed a file and went to work on notches in a round metal plate about eight inches in diameter it took him only a few seconds to become totally focused what the hell i asked playmate shrugged i dont know part of one of his machines i can show you the picture he had me draw i meant how come he suddenly goes from being something you have to keep on a leash to being somebody whos blind to the whole damned world another expressive shrug playmate showed me into his forge area which had expanded considerably since my last visit and which was an amazing clutter of junk and what looked like things halfbuilt i wondered how he got any shoeing done from some niche playmate produced a leather folder filled with dozens of sheets of good linen paper he shuffled through unsuspectedly good bits of artwork until he located the piece he wanted i glimpsed my own likeness in passing now that was a goodlooking young man playmate grunted i think that was meant to be neutral but failed to sound like it when he observed the operative word being was there were more portrait sketches they were all good i recognized several people how many hidden talents did playmate have he surprised me every few months the portfolio contained more sketches of devices than of people some were really complicated highly unlikely mechanisms and a few didnt seem complicated at all one of those was a little twowheeler cart with a pair of long shafts sticking out in front a man had been sketched in as pulling it conveying another seated in the cart something like that without the shafts sat about ten feet from where i stood youre trying to build some of these things unh oh yeah all of them eventually but therere problems with that thing im having trouble finding long enough poles thatre still light but we did test it itll work why because we have an extremely lazy complement of wealthy people in this town and a lot of unemployed young men who need something to keep them out of trouble my notion is to build a fleet of those things and rent them out at nominal fees so some of those young men have a way to make a living which will keep them out of trouble at the same time having a way to make a living didnt keep me out of trouble that was playmate though finding a way to get rich doing good deeds except that then he would end up giving away any wealth he acquired next to the cart stood a second mechanism i could not figure it out it had three wheels two were about a foot in diameter and were mounted at the ends of a wooden axle the other was about two and a half feet in diameter turning on a hardwood pin which passed through the ends of a twolined wooden fork that rose through the upper end of an arc of hardwood that curved down to the twowheel axle a curved crossbar above the hardwood arc allowed the larger wheel to be turned right and left i did not see a sketch of that in playmates folio what is that we just call it a threewheel let me finish showing you this then ill let you see how it works here check this its a twowheel its a more complicated cousin of that he extracted a drawing this mechanism had two wheels of equal size fore and aft with a rider perched amidships as though astride a horse im not sure i get this oh i dont either kip explains these things when he has me draw them but i seldom understand however everything he finishes putting together does what he says it will do and sometimes it seems so obvious afterward that i wonder why nobody ever thought of it before so i take him on faith this engine and that one there gets around on power provided by the riders legs if you want to know much more than that youll have to ask kip hell turn human after a while come here he led me to the threewheel climb up here and sit down the wooden arc part of the mechanism boasted a sort of saddle barely big enough for a mouse when i sat on it my butt ached immediately so what is it some kind of walker with wheels if so my legs were too long ive seen lots better wheelchairs chodo contague has one that is so luxurious it comes with a crew of four footmen and has its own heating system put your feet up on these things he used the toe of a boot to indicate an lshaped bar that protruded from the hub of the big wheel up front the one on the other side too good now push with your right foot your other right foot the threewheel moved i zipped around in a tight circle hey thiss neat my foot slipped off the end of the iron l clipped my anklebone i iterated several words that would have turned mom red i reiterated them with considerable gusto were working on that that cant be much fun were going to drill a hole down the center of a flat piece of hardwood i got the hang of the threewheel quickly but there wasnt enough room to enjoy it properly in there how about i take it out in the street id really rather you didnt im sure thats why weve had the trouble weve had kip took it out there racing around and before he got back he had several people try to take it away from him and right afterward the strange people started coming around i scooted around the stable for a few minutes more then gave up because i couldnt enjoy the machines full potential under such constrained circumstances are you planning to make threewheels too because if you are i want one if i can afford it playmates eyes lighted up as he saw the possibility of paying my fees without having to part with any actual money i might but honesty compels me to admit that were having problems with it especially with getting the wheels and the steering bar to move freely lard doesnt seem to be the ideal lubricant and it draws flies plenty of those were around but the place was a stable after all that too and the kinds of hardwoods we need to make the parts arent common not to mention that wed have to come up with whole teams of woodworking craftsmen if we were to build even a fraction of the number of them we think wed need to satisfy the demand thered be once people started seeing them in the streets hire some of those outofwork veterans to make them how many of them you figure are likely to be skilled joiners and cabinetmakers uhn not to mention wheelwrights i walked around the threewheel that geekoid kid over there actually thought this up this thing and a whole lot more garrett itll be a mechanical revolution if we ever figure out how to build all of the things he can imagine i slid down off the threewheeler what do you call this like i told you just threewheel there had to be something that sounded more dramatic heres a notion you could train your veterans just to do what it takes to manufacture threewheels that wouldnt be like them having to learn all about making cabinets and furniture and then id have guild trouble i stared at the threewheel sighed told playmate i guarantee you somebodys going to get rich off this thing my knack for prophecy is limited but that was a prediction i made with complete conviction i had no trouble picturing the streets of the better neighborhoods overrun with threewheels someone with fewer ethical disadvantages than i have you mean that wasnt what i was getting at but its a fact as soon as you get some of those things out there youre going to have people trying to build knockoffs i had a thought lest it get lonely i sent it out into the world you said kip took this one out and somebody tried to take it away from him playmate nodded could it be that kips having problems because somebody wants to steal his ideas im sure that im not the only royal subject bright enough to see the potential of kips inventions playmate nodded that could be going on too but theres definitely something to the trouble with the weird elves and right now im more worried about them stay here and keep an eye on kip while i make us all a pot of tea ever civilized my friend playmate in the midst of chaos hell take time for amenities all with the appropriate service kip tired of filing his metal wheel he put it aside and started fiddling with something wooden i watched from the corner of one eye while i thumbed through playmates drawings and sketches the man really was good more so than with portraits he had a talent for translating kips ideas into visual images there was a lot of written information on some of the sheets inscribed in a hand that was not playmates how do you come up with this stuff i asked kip i didnt expect an answer if he heard it at all the question was sure to irritate him creative people get it all the time they get tired of questions that imply that the artist couldnt possibly produce something out of the whole cloth of the mind it was a question i wouldnt have asked a painter or poet kip surprised me by responding i dont know mr garrett they just come to me sometimes in my dreams ive always had ideas and a head full of stories but lately those have been getting better than they ever were before he did not look up from the piece of wood he was shaping he had become a different person now that he was settled in the sanctuary of his workshop he was calm and he was confident i wondered how much puberty had to do with his problems and creativity tucked into the back of playmates folio folded so i nearly overlooked them were four smaller sketches of strange elves would these be some of the people whore giving you a hard time the boy looked up from his work those two are noodiss and lastyr left and right theyre the good ones i dont know the other two they may be some of the ones play ran off playmate arrived with the tea they are i told you your talent would be a wonderful tool in the war against evil see we have two villains identified already do we then no we doednt doed we we had sketches of a couple of likely baddies about whom we knew nothing whatsoever i wasnt even sure they were the same kind of elves as the other two they didnt look like the same breed in the sketches i changed the subject i have an idea too man and boy looked at me skeptically it can happen i insisted look you see how much work it was making the steering handles for your threewheel you could use ox horns instead you could get them from the slaughterhouses though the two of them began to look aghast i warmed to greater possibilities you could get them to save you the whole skull with the horns still attached you could produce a special deathshead model threewheel for customers from the hill playmate shook his head drink your tea garrett and plan to go to bed early tonight you need the rest i offered him a hard glower guess i need to practice up he wasnt impressed he just smiled and told me youre starting to hallucinate and i should leave that to the experts all right why dont i do some work what can you tell me about these maybe elves that you havent told me already they eat a lot of ugly soup playmate told me my drawings dont do them justice none of them appeared particularly repulsive to me and i said so those homely boys didnt know it but i was looking out for them call it an inner glow kind of thing youll see what i mean when you meet one he sounded confident that id do so kip anything you can say to help out here its really your ass thats on the line playmate advised despite earlier events kip still isnt quite convinced that hes in any trouble himself most people are that way they just cant believe that all this crap is raining down on them not even when somebody is using a hammer to beat them over the head and they particularly cant believe that its because of them we talked while we enjoyed our tea i asked more questions lots of questions most of them not too pointed i didnt get many useful answers kip never said so of course but now that he was where he felt safe himself his main concern was his friends with the absurd names he had decided that not telling me anything was the best way to shield them its not me you need to protect them from i grumbled its not me thats looking for them he might not know exactly where they were hiding but i was willing to bet he had a good idea where to start looking playmate offered nothing but a shrug when i sent him a mute look of appeal so he was going to be no help playmate is a firm believer in letting our young people learn from their mistakes he had enlisted me in this thing because he wanted to keep kips educational process from turning lethal now he was going to step back and let events unfold instructionally you do know that im not real fond of bodyguard work i told playmate i do know youre not fond of any kind of work that doesnt include the consumption of beer as the main responsibility of the job possibly but asking me to bodyguard is like asking an opera diva to sing on the corner with a hurdygurdy man i have more talent than that if you just want the kid kept safe you should round up saucerhead tharpe tharpe is so big you cant hurt him by whacking him with a wagon tongue and so dumb he wont back off from a job as long as hes still awake and breathing it was your remarkable talents that brought me to your door playmate responded his pinky wagging in the wind as he plied his teacup saucerhead tharpe resembles a force of nature powerful but unthinking rather like a falling boulder unlikely to change course if the moment requires a flexible response unlikely to become proactive when innovation could be the best course i think that was supposed to be complimentary youre blowing smoke arent you you cant afford saucerhead id begun roaming through the junk and unfinished inventions growing ever more amazed hed want to get paid up front just in case your faith in him was misplaced well there is that too the rat hed counted on the dead mans curiosity to keep me involved with this nonsense whether or not i got paid dont you hate it when friends take advantage of you i picked up the most unusual crossbow id ever seen i used to be pretty good with one of these things whats this one for shooting through castle walls instead of the usual lever this crossbow was quipped with a pair of hand cranks and a whole array of gears cranking like mad barely drew the string back which was a misnomer that was a cable that looked tough enough for towing canal boats were trying to develop a range of nonlethal weaponry too playmate told me thats meant for knocking down a man in heavy armor without doing any permanent injury i didnt ask why youd want to do that didnt mention that sooner or later the guy was going to get back up and get after you with renewed enthusiasm i just hefted the crossbow supposed to be a manportable ballista eh it had some heft to it the bolts are there in that thing that looks like a pipe rack huh i wouldnt have recognized them otherwise they looked more like miniature deformed jugglers clubs two had padded ends again i refrained from telling playmate what i thought i believe i understood what morley feels each time i shy off what i consider gratuitous throatcutting playmates boundary of acceptable violence was as much gentler than mine as mine was gentler than friend morleys i loaded one of the quarrels looked around for a target shrugged when playmate grumbled not inside garrett exactly as he no doubt had at kip a few hundred times all right i said kip you never did tell me why these elves want to catch your friends with the strange names i dont know he didnt look at me he was a lousy liar it was obvious that he had some idea i looked at playmate he gave me a little shrug and a little headshake he wasnt ready to push it i asked so where do we go from here playmate shrugged again i was looking at doing the trapdoor spider thing thatll work the trapdoor spider hunkers down in a hole under a door she makes and waits for somebody edible to come prancing by then she jumps out and has lunch playmates reference though was to an ambush tactic used by both sides in the recent war in the cantard employing the same principle he meant he was going to sit down and wait for something to happen without going headlong i kept after kip about his strange friends he frustrated me with his determined loyalty he could not fully grasp the notion that i was there to help i needed more time with the dead man i needed to figure out what old bones knew as well as how to insert myself into the fantasy worlds where cypres prose lived apparently his fantasy life was so rich that it influenced his whole attitude toward real life after a half hour of mostly polite tea conversation during which my main discovery was that cypres prose could avoid a subject almost as slickly as my partner i was getting frustrated i was prowling like a cat poking at halffinished engines and mysterious mechanisms again garrett playmate exploded he pointed his eyes had grown huge a small hole had appeared in the stable wall it glowed scarlet a harsh beam of red light pushed through it swung left and right slicing through the heavy wooden planks hardwood smoke flooded the stable overcoming the sweet rottedgrass odor of fresh horse manure it made me think both of smokehouses and of campfires in the wild campfires do not have a place in any happy memories of mine campfires in my past all had a very nasty war going on somewhere nearby they always attracted horrible bloodsucking bugs and starving vertebrates with teeth as long as my fingers hardwood smoke gets my battle juices going lots more often than it makes my mouth water i picked up the overweight crossbow and inserted the quarrel that had no padding the wall cutout collapsed inward sunlight blazed through an oddly shaped being stood silhouetted against the bright i shot my bolt i used to be pretty good with a crossbow somebody found out that i still was i got him right in the breadbasket with plenty of oomph because the recoil was enough to throw me back a step and spin me halfway around the villain folded up around the blunt quarrel out of action unfortunately he was not alone his friends did not give me time to crank the crossbow back up to full tension a shortcoming of the instrument that i would have to mention to playmate its cycle time was much too long i snatched up a smiths hammer it seemed the most convincing tool i was likely to lay hands on the things i had hidden about my person wouldnt have nearly as much impact two shimmering forms came through the hole in the wall unremarkable street people who flashed silver each few seconds the one i had shot lay folded up like a hairpin outside entirely silver now another silvery figure ministered to it briefly flashing into the form of a bum every ten seconds only the fallen one didnt shimmer like i was seeing it through a lot of hot air my bolt must have disrupted a serious compound illusion sorcery playmate stepped up and tried to talk to them in playmates universe reason should be able to solve anything ive got to admire his courage and convictions my own response to those critters was the only behavior i could imagine one invader had something shiny in his right hand he extended it toward playmate the big man folded into himself as though every muscle in his body had turned to flab i let the hammer fly ever since i was a kid ive had a fascination with the hammer as a missile weapon i used to enjoy playing at throwing hammers when i could get my hands on one without anyone knowing that i was risking damage to something so valuable i knew that in olden times the hammer had been a warriors weapon and the little bit of cypres prose resident within me had woven mighty legends around garrett the hammer garrett the hammer was dead on with his throw but his target saw it coming and shifted its weight slightly just in time so that the speeding hammer brushed its shimmer only obliquely ricocheted off and continued on in a rainbow arc that brought the metal end into contact with the back of the head of the silvery figure trying to resurrect the villain id knocked down earlier that blow shouldve busted a hole in the things skull no such luck though the impact just caused it to fling forward and sprawl across the creature that was down already these were playmates elves it was obvious but equally obvious was the truth of his contention that his sketches did not capture their real nature the one who had downed playmate closed in on me the other one chased kip kip demonstrated the sort of character i expected he had great faith in the patron saint of every man for himself he made a valiant effort to get the hell out of there kips pursuer extended something shiny in his direction the kid followed playmates example he demonstrated substantially less style in his collapse i avoided the same fate for seconds on end by staying light on my feet and putting great enthusiasm into an effort to saturate the air with flying tools but too soon i began feeling like i had been drinking a whole lot of something more potent than beer i slowed down the dizziness didnt last long i do not recall the darkness coming my next clear memory is of morley dotes with his pretty little nose only inches from mine hes reminding me that to stay alive one must remember to breathe from the corner of my eye i see saucerhead tharpe trying to sell the same idea to playmate while the ratgirl pular singe scuttles around nervously sniffing and whining the disorientation faded faster than the effects of alcohol ever do without leaving much hangover but none of those clowns were willing to believe that highpotency libations hadnt been involved in my destruction when people go on a nag they arent the least bit interested in evidence that might contradict their prejudices pular singe ratgirl genius was my principal advocate what can you do you two are a couple of frigid old ladies i told morley and saucerhead thank you for your faith singe oh my head i didnt have a hangover from this but i did have one from last night the latest headache powder wasnt helping and youd like us to believe that you dont have a hangover morley sneered weakly one side of his face wasnt working so good not a lot of time had passed since the advent of the silvery people smoke still wisped off the cut ends of some of the wall planks i suppose it was a near miracle that no fire had gotten going perhaps less miraculously that was due to the sudden appearance of dotes tharpe and pular singe i barked at the ratgirl where did you guys come from she was likely to give me a straight answer whyre you here bellows that morley and saucerhead would accept indifferently could rattle singe deeply ratfolk are timid by nature and singe was trying to make her own way outside her native society ratfolk males dont yell and threaten and promise massive bloodshed unless they intend to deliver they dont banter when singe is around i usually tread on larks eggs because i dont want to upset her its like working with your mom wearing a rat suit she didnt get a chance to answer morley cracked this ones all right he woke up cranking whatre you guys doing here morley thank you mr dotes for scaring off the baddies thank you mr dotes for scaring off the baddies see you can learn if you put your mind to it i was doing pretty good there on my own the side of his face that wasnt working well had a sizable young bruise developing thats gonna be a brute when it grows up what happened morleys stylish clothing was torn and filthy too which would hurt him more than mere physical damage could i had a special request from the dead man round up singe and a squad of heavyweights come over here and keep an eye on you youre a major trouble magnet my friend were not even in place yet and we find the excitement already happening what were those things with more help from singe than from morley i made it to a standing position wheres the kid there was a kid maybe thats who your silvery friends were hauling away who were they garrett i dont know you didnt stop them let me see no i was too busy being bounced off walls and rolled through horse excrement you couldnt hurt those guys he looked as sour as he could manage with only half a face cooperating i broke my swordcane on one of them i couldnt resist a snicker morley is a lethally handsome halfbreed partly human but mostly dark elf hes the guy fathers of young women wake up screaming about in the wee hours of the night his vanity is substantial his dress is always impeccable and at the forefront of fashion he considers disarray a horror and dirt of any sort an abomination dirt seems to feel the same way about him it avoids him religiously i snickered again it must be the concussion morley grumped i know my good friend garrett would never mock me in my misfortune mockery i couldnt resist another snicker hehheh misfortune i glanced around damn whered he go i only looked away for a second too bad youre stuck with his evil twin instead of a friend i hate it when that happens singe had seen us in action often enough to discount most of what she heard but she still couldnt quite grasp what was going on she watched us now long fingers entwined so she could keep her hands from flying around her myopic eyes squinted her snout twitched her whiskers waggled she drew more information from the world through her sense of smell than with any other she tended to be emotional and excitable but now remained collected if she had learned anything from me it was better selfcontrol i felt it to be a cruel miscarriage of propriety that my companionship hadnt had a similar impact on the rest of my friends she took advantage of a lull to inquire what is this situation garrett i did not understand the message i received from the dead man and yet she had come out of hiding because she had a chance to help me morley smirked i would hear about that as soon as singe wasnt around to get her feelings hurt she had an adolescent crush on me and morley known to have broken the bones of persons having thrown ethnic slurs his way thought it was great fun to torment me about being mooned over by a ratgirl he could commit every crime of prejudice he hated when they were directed toward him yet would never ever recognize any inconsistency because ratpeople were a created race products of the malificent sorcerous investigations of some of our lords of the hill during the heyday of the last century most people dont even consider them people morley dotes included i told her anything you heard from his nibs makes you better informed than i am singe her particular line of ratpeople place their personal names second just to confuse things other lines do the opposite in imitation of local humans he didnt tell me anything not that he was interested in whats happening here nor even that he was planning to make you a part of things what is happening here morley asked can you handle that one playmate saucerhead had the big stablekeeper up on his hind legs now i don tink playmate mumbled i tried to tell everybody what i knew not holding back anything the way my partner would well some little details maybe like about how good the dead man was at sneaking peeks into unprepared minds nobody needs to know that but me you sure you aint been jobbed saucerhead wanted to know that sure aint much play you runnin a game on my man garrett i waved him off its not that chances were good the dead man wouldve clued me in if that were the case my concern was more that kip and playmate were being manipulated but i do wonder if someone isnt running a game on kip play you ever met lastyr or noodiss not formally not to talk to ive seen them a few times not so much recently though they used to come around here a lot when they thought kip would be here alone i grunted irritated atop all the aches and pains it looked like the only way i was going to learn anything of substance would be to catch me a silver elf and squeeze him which was a conclusion my partner must have reached before i left the house else how to explain singes presence besides being my only friend from tunfaires lowest lower class pular singe is the finest tracker amongst a species known for individuals able to follow a trail through the insane stew of foul odors that complement the soul of this mad city singe you find a scent yet i knew she was sniffing she couldnt help herself and she was clever enough to understand why she had been invited to the party she tried to shrug then to shake her head ratfolk find both human gestures difficult singe wants to be human so bad each time i see it i hurt for her i get embarrassed because most of the time we arent worthy of imitation failing she spoke no not the elves though there is a unique odor where the two fell but that exists only there it does not go anywhere and it does not smell like any odor from a living thing wow her human speech had improved dramatically since last i had seen her it was almost free of accent except when she tried a contraction her improvement was miraculous considering the voice box she had to use no other rat in my experience had come close to matching her yet she was said to suffer from a hearing deficiency according to the rat thug reliance who first brought her to my attention youve even mastered the sibilants determination can take you a long way her sibilants still had a strong serpentine quality but singe needs a lot of encouragement to keep going she gets almost none of that from her own people so what do we do now morley asked he wasnt interested really not much he was trying to work out how he could get back to the palms and get cleaned up and changed before anyone noticed his disreputable condition i had a feeling that any minute now i would find my best pal missing singe said i cannot follow the strange elves but garrett taught me to follow the horses when i cannot follow a target who becomes a passenger in a vehicle that horses are pulling what a talent that garrett guy after a moment i confessed the student lost even the teacher on that one singe she looked at me like she knew i was just saying that so shed feel good getting to explain the elves took the boy him i can track so i will follow him wherever he stops moving there will we find your elves the girl is a genius i said lets all go raid playmates pantry before we go on the road that idea was acclaimed enthusiastically by everyone not named playmate or morley playmate because his charity is limited when its wannabe beneficiaries are solvent morley because the weasel wasnt around to vote ah well my elven friend would be out there somewhere a desperate fugitive fleeing the wrath of the goodgrooming gods saucerheads impatient pacing took him across the narrow street and back three times as he tried to establish a safe passage around a particularly irritable camel no owner of the beast was in evidence i was surprised to see it camels are rare this far south possibly no one would have this one possibly it had been abandoned it was a beast as foul as the goddamn parrot it voided its bowels then nipped at saucerhead i muttered thats what i feel like right now which end singe asked testing her theory of humor she giggled so bold this ratgirl who came out in the daytime then dared to make jokes in front of human beings take your pick you know what that thing really is a horse without its disguise on even singe thought that was absurd and she has less love for the fourlegged terrors than i do you could say a state of war of low intensity exists between her species and theirs horses dislike ratpeople more than most humans do playmate said one day i fully expect to find you on the steps of the chancery between barking dog amato and woodie granger foaming at the mouth as you rant at the king and the whole royal family because theyre pawns of the great equine conspiracy garrett the chancery is a principal government building where traditionally anyone with a grievance can voice it publicly on the outside steps inevitably the chancery steps have acquired a bevy of professional complainers and outright lunatics most people consider them cheap entertainment i said you shouldnt talk about it theyre going to get you now singe started looking worried frowning all right maybe i exaggerate a little but theyre still vicious nasty critters theyll turn on you in a second the resident nasty critter spit at saucerhead saucerhead responded with a jab to the camels nose it was a calm professional blow of the sort that earned him his living but he put his weight and muscle behind it the camel rocked back its eyes wobbled its front knees buckled tharpe said come on once we were past the camel he added sometimes polite aint enough you just gotta showem whos boss we walked another hundred feet and stopped the street didnt go anywhere it ended at a wall which was improbable what the hell saucerhead demanded when did we start blocking off streets he had a point tunfaire has thousands of deadend alleys and breezeways but something that happened in antiquity made our rulers issue regulations against blocking thoroughfares possibly because theyd wanted to be able to make a run for it in either direction and while what we were following wasnt much of a street it was a street officially complete with symbols painted on walls at intersections to indicate that its name was something like stonebone exactly what was impossible to tell the paint hadnt been renewed in my lifetime the wall ahead was old gray limestone exactly like the wall to our left needing the attention of a mason just as badly but something about it made all four of us nervous it sure dont look like something somebody threw up over the weekend i said believe it or not some karentine subjects are wicked enough to ignore established regulations and will construct something illegal while the city functionaries are off duty nobody stepped up to the wall until singe snorted the way only a woman can do when shes exasperated with men being men she shuffled right up till her pointy big nose was half an inch from the limestone the track of the boy goes straight on garrett and this wall smells almost the same as the odor i found where the two elves fell on one another playmate took a few steps backward found a bit of broken brick that hadnt yet been scrounged by the street children he started to wind up but paused and said garrett have you bothered to look up i hadnt why would i none of the others had either we all looked now that wall wasnt part of anything it might not even be stone it just went up a ways then turned fuzzy and wiggly and lizards belly white then it turned misty then it turned into nothing its an illusion playmate chucked his brickbat the missile proceeded to proceed despite the presence of a wall that appeared completely solid if improbably cold and damp when i extended a cautious finger to test it saucerhead tharpe isnt nearly as careful as mama garretts only surviving son he reached out to thump that wall and his fist went right on through we all stepped back we exchanged troubled looks i said thats an illusion of the highest order singe said i hear someone calling from the other side playmate observed an illusion that persists that can be used as camouflage requires the efforts of a master wizard i grunted in this town that meant somebody off the hill it meant one of six dozen or so people who are the real masters in karenta singe said there is somebody over there yelling at you garrett i asked playmate what do you think i admit to being intimidated by hill people but ive never backed down just because they stuck a finger in somewhere i wouldnt back down now kips kidnapping had me irked and interested of everyone i asked anybody want to walk away nobody volunteered to leave though saucerhead gulped a pail of air playmate seemed to go a little green and singe started shaking like she was naked in a blizzard and didnt have a clue which way to the warm she made some kind of chalk sign on a real wall maybe to ward off evil youre the marine playmate said show us your stuff saucerhead pasted on a huge grin he was exarmy too and he had heard my opinions concerning the relative merits of the services more often than had playmate he refused to see the light its a debate that seems doomed to persist forever because army types are too dim to recognize the truth when it kicks them in the teeth saucerheads whole face threatened to open up i thought the top half of his head was going to tip over backward onto his shoulders he gasped out yeah garrett lets see some of that old marine corps hey diddle diddle straight up the middle ominously singe said there is no yelling anymore im thinking about giving you some of that good old big boy i took a deep breath and squared off with the illusory wall saucerhead chuckled he knows id never come straight at him if i did think i had to get after him business led us to butt heads briefly once upon a time long ago the results had been far from satisfactory from my point of view i whooped like i was going in back in my island warfare days straight up the middle indeed something that we did not actually do very often as i recall us and the venageti both very much preferred sneaking around stabbing in the back to any straightforward and personally risky charging that wall was more than just an illusion it resisted me hitting it felt a little like belly flopping though with more stretch and give to the surface which popped after a moment and which felt as cold as a gods heart until it did my efforts evidently weakened the wall considerably because the big army types followed me through as though there wasnt any resistance at all and the civilian followed them but i wasnt really keeping track wed overtaken our quarry where theyd holed up temporarily either so they could interrogate kip or so their injured buddies could recuperate there was another imaginary wall beyond them that one had a bricklike look even though it was semitransparent from my point of view my heart jumped our approach had to have been noticed in that instant i sensed movement the corner of the eye kind of movement you get when your imagination is running wild only what i wasnt imagining was happening right in front of me and i couldnt get a solid look at it then for a moment i saw silver elves and kip with something clamped over his mouth and i realized that singes sharp ears mustve caught his cries for help back when shed kept talking and nobody had bothered to listen a shimmering silver elf extended a hand toward me i dodged i didnt move soon enough once again i didnt feel the darkness arrive morley dotes was right there in my face again when i woke up some kind of party you must throw garrett blitzed into extinction again and the sun still hasnt gone down he looked around as i tried to sit up my head pounded worse than before but in an alley even if it is a pretty clean one for this burg gods my head i dont know what they did to me but its enough to make me consider giving up liquor you give up your beer dont try to kid a kidder kid i said liquor nimrod beer is a holy elixir one shuns beer only at the risk of ones immortal soul i see youre all freshly prettied up howd you find us two of morleys henchmen had accompanied him i didnt know them they were clad in the outfits waiters at the palms usually wear but they were much younger than sarge and puddle and morleys other traditional associates maybe the old guys were getting too old your girlfriend left us a trail to follow standard rat chalk symbols you didnt notice a trained detective like you pride made me consider fibbing no i didnt not really ten years ago i couldnt have admitted any failing which at times had left me looking just a whole lot stupider than a simple confession wouldve done people are strange and sometimes i think i might be the strangest people i know morleys boys didnt lift a finger to help anybody dotes himself didnt do anything but talk which told me he thought none of us had been hurt badly what happened to the illusion what illusion i explained morley wanted to disbelieve but dared not in the face of saucerheads confirmation tharpe doesnt have the imagination to dress himself up with excuses as complex as this so you scared them into running when theyre not really up to it they have two casualties and a prisoner to manage we dont know that any of them were hurt yes we do garrett use that brain the dead man thinks you have if they dont have someone injured they dont have any reason not to just drag the kid straight off to wherever it is they want to take him lets get back on the trail they cant have gone far maybe he was right maybe the villains were just around the corner but i didnt have any way to track them right now singe was still out stone cold i wonder if they understand how we found them i was afraid the elves mightve given singe an extra dose of darkness because of her nose me im wondering why they didnt hurt you a lot more than they did morley countered his cure for most ills is to exterminate everybody involved for some reason theyve slapped you down twice without doing any permanent harm he has difficulty comprehending that kind of thinking he emphasized permanent because my expression revealed the depth and breadth of the temporary harm i was suffering you all right saucerhead got a miserable headache tharpes voice was gravelly his temper would be extremely short best not to disturb him at all how bout you play what he said and dont yell makes it hurt even more he didnt need to yell back maybe i was lucky all the practice ive had dealing with hangovers i turned to singe seems a shame to disturb her she did look rather peaceful kiss her and lets get on with it morley grumped without having been blessed by the elves what he opened his mouth to crack wise about the sleeping beauty thought better of it beckoned me i followed him for as far as he felt was far enough to keep his remarks from being overhead by sharp rat ears she isnt really out garrett shes giving you a chance to show some special concern the fact that he didnt make mock let me know that he was serious that he was concerned about bruising singes tender ego though the motives behind his concern were probably wholly selfish understood i told him though that wasnt entirely true i dont like the responsibility that piles onto me when singe gives way to these juvenile urges to manipulate me that smacks of emotional blackmail in fact it is emotional blackmail she just doesnt understand that it is and im not all that well equipped to deal with it more than one lady of my acquaintance would suggest that im not far enough away from adolescence myself i went to the ratgirl dropped to my knees beside her singe she didnt respond i thought her breathing was too rapid for someone who was supposed to be unconscious though how do you tell someone that their relationship fantasies can never become anything more than that everything i could possibly say to singe would be true but would sound so stupidly cliché if said that i could do no good talking to her she was important to me personally and professionally she had become one of the half dozen closest friends i had i enjoyed teaching her how to cope in a world where she was less than welcome but she could never be anything but a friend a business associate and a student and i have no idea how to make her understand that without causing her pain when she first broke away from the dominance of her own people where females have fewer rights than do horses amongst humans i considered letting her move into my place i thought of making her part of the team i still think well of that idea but the dead man did assure me that in her desperation to be wanted and liked and loved pular singe would give the offer far more weight than i intended i touched her throat her pulse was rapid i glanced around there was no immediate salvation apparent morley was grinning exposing about a thousand bright white needle teeth in a silent taunt you want i should carry her garrett saucerhead asked there went tharpe being thoughtful despite his pain like most human beings he can be a mess of contradictions that might be good any of you guys know anything about doctoring ratfolk if we cant fix her up ourselves well have to take her back to reliance that ought to be the perfect medicine the very philosophers stone reliance is a sort of ratman godfather a highly respected and greatly feared leader of that community whos involved in a lot of questionable and some outright illegal activities reliance believes that pular singe belongs to him theres a chance hes right within the rules of rat society there is some sort of indenture involved but rat society isnt paramount in tunfaire and that guy garrett dont much care about anybodys customs or rules when he makes up his mind whats right and whats wrong she wouldnt be real happy about the boss rat getting his paws on her again garrett tharpe assured me with a wink showing hed gotten it he tried to hire me once to bring her back he grinned a grin filled with bad teeth well maybe i was going to get some help with this after all from the least likely source saucerhead really can be a sensitive kind of guy and singe wonder of wonders was stirring suddenly so why didnt you take the job old reliance hes too damned cheap for one thing he just cant get it through his head that it aint just a matter of rounding up one dumb female and dropping her off where he wants her delivered he cant get it through his skull that she can actually think for herself and that she can have made friends whod be willing to look out for her he just figures youre trying to hold him up on your fee when you try to explain it to him youd think hed have figured it all out from direct experience whoops look here its alive hi sleepyhead youre the last one awake singe mumbled something were just waiting on you singe smiled a weak rat smile she probably thought she heard relief in my voice possibly she did i was relieved that her problem wasnt real pular singes recovery was dramatically swift once she decided that she needed to get healthy reliances name made a great whip morley told one of his waiters to make a bread and cheese run while the rest of us sat around staking claims on being in worse shape than the other guy food was a great idea i thought but when the man came back with a basket filled with chow i didnt feel much like eating a similar lack of appetite afflicted saucerhead playmate and singe and none of those three liked it even a little either they loved their food singe in particular always ate like a starved alley cat or one of her feral cousins everything in sight steadily gobbling so fast that the bugs never got a share i grumbled i think weve got us an invention right here a new weight loss program for the lords and ladies nobody else in this burg ever gets fat soon enough heads still aching and stomachs still empty we proceeded as singe picked up kips trail though it had begun to get dark she had no trouble finding the way sight was never her master sense though it did become more important after nightfall she could see in the dark better than morley and morley has eyes like an owl this time the chase didnt last twenty minutes this time the camouflage didnt catch us unaware either though it existed as an addition to a building rather than as something thrown across a street from the viewpoint of the silver elves the trouble was that the building theyd scabbed onto was one that saucerhead and i knew and had we not known it ourselves there were at least twenty local tenderloin folk hanging around in the gloaming trying to figure out what was going on that addition hadnt been there half an hour earlier playmate observed these people arent very good at what theyre doing are they i get the feeling that this isnt anything theyve had to do before what do you say we just charge in there and grab the kid back i wasnt eager to get myself another bout of sleep because of my habit of waking up afterward with a ferocious hangover i didnt need another one of those i was working on a couple already still they had the boy obnoxious though he was which didnt incline them to throw him back out apparently they wanted him pretty bad i suppose a throbbing headache can impair your judgement and a friend like morley dotes can have a similar effect once he had winkled out the complete details of our last encounter he was ready to go they arent going to kill anybody garrett there are six of us singe bristled knowing she hadnt been included in the count they cant get all of us they got all of us most of the bystanders quite a few passersby and even a handful of people inside neighboring buildings who didnt know what was going on and never knew what hit them i came out of it faster than before my head pounding worse than last time the first thing i saw was my eager beaver buddy morley dotes yet again only this time he had his temples grasped tightly and looked like he was working real hard on trying not to scream or was possibly contemplating the delights of suicide i grumbled now we know why they didnt ask you to be a general during the recent scuffle with venageta though considering the performances of some of the generals wed had whod earned their bells by picking the right venue as a place of birth morley mightve fit right in dotes whined something irrelevant about the whole thing having been my idea and registered a plea for a lot less vocal volume pussy i wake up feeling like this three or four times a week and i function what the hell are those people roaring about neighbors not struck down were rushing into the street in normal times their voices would have been considered restrained not so now they all stared at the sky i looked up just in time to see something large and shiny and shaped like a discus disappear behind nearby rooftops heading north what the hell was that i glanced at morley never mind dont tell me your cousins just got away in one of those flying lights that people keep seeing cousins those things werent elves garrett not elves of any kind their mouths and eyes were all wrong they didnt have elven teeth maybe theyre some kind of foreign deformed humans you might look into that but theyre definitely not elves playmate came around between groans he asked did we get him back kip we didnt even get a wink this time lets see what we did get maybe that whore fate has a heart of gold after all we managed to collect a few scraps of silvery cloth and nearly a dozen other items of wildly varying shape and no obvious utility those included several small torn bags made of a silvery somewhat paperlike material the rest resembled smooth gray rocks with a very unrocklike feel that came in varying regular shapes most had markings in green and red and yellow that looked like writing but which were in no familiar alphabet one of morleys men came up with a bag that hadnt been opened its contents turned out to be two thick biscuits the texture of oatmeal cakes they had a sorghum molasses odor food playmate said we broke up a meal i could use something to eat saucerhead said by way of announcing his recovery we still got that cheese basket he rubbed his forehead as he looked around he has an amazingly high threshhold of pain but now he had begun to respond to it what happened he reached out and helped himself to the elven oatmeal cakes he wolfed them down before anybody could remind him of the legends about fairy food nobody answered his question because nobody had an answer lookit there somebody shrieked in a second half the crowd were pointing skyward again the silver disk was back and it was in a big hurry it left a thunderclap behind as it streaked off southward hey theres another one one turned into three in a matter of seconds only these werent disks they looked like giant glowing gas balls on a smaller scale id seen something similar in the willothewisps of the swamps on the islands id visited during the war the glowing globes chased the silvery disk morley murmured ive been hearing about these things for weeks but id about made up my mind that they were pure popular hysteria i looked around for an easily accessible high place i wanted a clear line of sight to the west toward the heart of town toward the hill to discover if those lights ended up there because this looked like the sort of thing those people would pull squabbling amongst themselves using experimental sorceries while the folk of the city got run over morley asked you think your friends the unemployed gods might be back garrett that hadnt occurred to me i doubt it they were more reserved they didnt show themselves unless they wanted to be seen mainly because they couldnt be seen by nonbelievers unless they made a huge effort i dont think that these people would attract attention if they were given an option something intense is going on with them sufficient to make being noticed the lesser concern probably i did think he was right logically if you were a foreigner running around in an alien town you wouldnt let yourself be noticed unless it was unavoidable you think saucerhead is going to croak on us tharpe had turned several indescribable colors near as i could tell by torchlight torches and lanterns were turning up now that the curious felt safe enough to come out of their homes just as well that they hadnt before too wed have awakened to find ourselves plucked of everything but our toenails i think he might want to die morley said i think we ought to discover ourselves in another location sometime soon this much activity is bound to attract lawmen and he wouldnt want the notice however much he protests his innocence of the illegal of late maybe old habits die hard these days with the postwar economic depression becoming entrenched the new secret police are very interested in any center of excitement a minor bit no more scary than a street party can turn into a riot at the bump of a belly between an unemployed human and almost any nonhuman he might suspect of having moved into a humans job while human soldiers were away risking their lives on behalf of the kingdom these are social problems that arent going to go away anytime soon i said we do have everything we need for a blowup morley nodded he understood he shared my concern he has become very sensitive in these changing times he doesnt like the way things are headed though it isnt the conflict that bothers him that can be exploited to produce big profits what he abhors is the growing power of the crown and its determined interference in our everyday lives an elven trait to believe that that government governs best which doesnt govern at all chaos is more fun anarchy is the ideal and only the strong survive morley would admit that a sustained harsh dose of genuine anarchy most likely would result in the extinction or expulsion of every species of elf currently calling tunfaire home i told morley that was an absolutely marvelous suggestion old friend can i assume that itll be you carrying pular singe what singe was still unconscious but i wasnt concerned about her morley i just saw bic gonlit he was watching us from across the street so lets get singe put back together and see if she can get on his trail he just might know where to look for playmates kid you dont think she can track kip from here not if he got carried away inside a giant flying wheel i dont an excellent point not one id wanted to look at close up yet though you hope you can catch an occasional break singe was getting her feet under her now with a little help from playmate lets see about traveling on then i told morley i just spotted another familiar face this one i recollect seeing in the vicinity of colonel block and deal relway in a none too distant past i made a big effort to remember such faces so i can exercise some sort of exit strategy when i see one again ill help with singe the secret police evidently didnt have an interest strong enough to pursue us at the moment but i was willing to bet that id hear from westman block if anyone in the tenderloin had recognized me colonel westman block erstwhile acquaintance of that handsome marine named garrett oversaw all police forces and functions in tunfaire that included the secret police theoretically on paper we gathered in a dark place half a mile from the excitement and considered what now singe said i cannot possibly follow a man who flew away through the air inside a flying boat made out of metal she then wondered aloud why are you looking at me like that because morley said almost exactly the same thing just before you woke up we decided to chase bic gonlit instead she knew the name from discussions of what was happening back when we were tracking kip as soon as we were sure wed shaken the police you must tell me more about this bic gonlit playmate and i both tried to explain bic gonlit and his place in what was happening a challenging task of course since we had almost no idea ourselves i added only im not sure if hes actually part of what happened this afternoon you people like to think you are so much smarter than us but sometimes you are really dumb garrett you start talking before you think how do you expect me to follow someone who is just another face in a crowd shes got you there morley said content to leave all the blame with me i could use a little more information myself bic gonlit is only a name to me hes this little round fat guy who wears funny boots there was a little round fat man with hugely thicksoled boots i saw several times on the way down here i thought he might be doing something for you because your parrot was right there near him i didnt see him playmate said not the bird either nor did i i confessed my parrot following me around and i never noticed it might be time to consider alternative careers i noticed the bird singe said i saw the fat man too but i did not know mr big was following him i thought he was following you garrett he is still around i saw him just a minute ago yes over there where we came from up on that cornice thing where the pigeons are sleeping ive made up my mind im going to see weider and tell him im taking the security job at the brewery i felt completely blind and useless it was so dark i couldnt find the end of my arm there is a short little fat man over there watching us too singe told me he is hiding behind those steps right under the parrot like anybody could see all that if they just looked grrr the only thing i could see was a glow in the distance about where wed lost track of kip i really was inclined to tell max weider i was ready to come on board truly at that moment but before i hung it up i had to try another stunt or two i have a thought were all tired why dont we head for my place if gonlit really is following us we can lead him to the dead man i was past ready to go home i was desperate for something to take the edge off my headache and i was hungry and i was tired getting knocked unconscious regularly takes the vinegar out of you fast even if youre not going out by getting bopped on the head my plan as proposed didnt stir a word of protest much to my amazement morley is naturally contentious hell get involved in arguments just to entertain himself but all he said was im wornout too and the palms is headed into its busiest time and i left puddle in charge i got a thing going myself saucerhead said i need to get back too unless something starts happening even playmate was willing to shut it down for the night and to desert me when he did nobodys been at the stable all day i need to get back there before the animals get so upset they he stopped i think he was about to let slip something terrible about the conspiracy amongst horses but realized that me finding out might turn out to be bad luck for him he changed the subject and somebodys going to have to tell kips family whats happened a while later after a period of silence playmate asked you wouldnt consider taking care of that for me would you garrett not likely old buddy not likely after todays adventures youre not real high on my please god let me do him a favor list the tiniest flicker of a smirk crossed playmates features before he settled on an expression of stolid resignation i had the feeling that id just gotten jobbed but couldnt figure out how i never saw the goddamn parrot before he dropped onto my shoulder in wizards reach two blocks from home or one block through the alley to my back fence by then the only companions i had were the bird and pular singe none of us were inclined to lose any sleep looking for cypres prose anymore maybe i was just telling myself what i wanted to hear when i reasoned that kip was in no physical danger because the silver elves had shown no inclination to do anyone any permanent harm so far kips personality might trigger the extra effort the bird said nothing his presence was the message the dead man knew we were coming and he knew that bic gonlit was on our trail now we would see how well the little fat man had done his homework if he knew much about the dead man he wouldnt get too close to the house not as close as hed gotten in the alley though how close is really too close is something even i dont know the goddamn parrot whispered he has stopped garrett he has positioned himself behind the bailnoc stoop from there he can see the front of our house while he stays far enough removed that i cannot read much more than his moods he didnt seem to mind singe finding out that he could chat with me through the ugly rooster i didnt think he was dumb enough to believe that she was too dim to catch on so he trusted her completely handy to know just how trustworthy your associates are i looked back i couldnt see a thing i wondered how gonlit could be watching me i wondered about his connections hed have to have some potent ones helping right now otherwise he wouldnt be able to follow me around unnoticed that takes some advanced magic i think im pretty good at this stuff i do i dont normally get tailed without noticing unless the tail comes armed with some pretty potent sorcerous tools as singe and i climbed the stoop a sleepyangry tittering broke out somewhere up under the eaves something as fast as a hummingbird dropped down and circled us several times too swiftly to be seen clearly my front door opened dean mustve been alerted by the dead man he stood there in his nightshirt scowling holding a lamp above his head disapproving of birth death and most everything in between early night i asked the nightshirt was for commentary only it wasnt yet time for him to retire he doesnt change until hes ready to slide into bed unless he wants to make some point that will remain obscure to everyone but him he grunted and rewarded me with an even blacker scowl whats with the gang of pixies up there i expected their presence would keep us arguing like pixies for weeks ask the thing hes the one who decided to adopt them ah live and learn and discover the real root of deans bad temper the dead man had done something to offend his sense of rectitude dean was aggrieved further because id been all set to blame him because thats the kind of thing hes likely to do every time i turn around hes trying to take in another stray this might require some untangling ill talk to him i promised i wasnt really happy either living near pixies is like setting up housekeeping inside a colony of sparrows the squabbling never stops and this bunch was making themselves at home right above my bedroom window none of that would bother old bones hes dead he doesnt have to listen to the racket darkly i added failing him seeing reason i know where i can come up with a nest of bumblebees bumblebees and the smallest of the little people were feuding before the appearance of the first men if you credit the legends of the wee folk dean growled something about then how do we get rid of the bumblebees he grows ever more pessimistic as he ages one step at a time brother one step at a time right now weve got trouble on a grander scale i lost the boy who came here looking for help today in circumstances surpassing strange make some tea slap together some sandwiches bring everything in with his nibs and ill fill you in the old man headed for the kitchen id triggered his concern for the lost and the hopeless earlier hed been ready to stuff kip into a gunnysack with a couple boulders so the boy could have a closeup look at the lost treasures on the bottom of the river somewhere off the landing singe watched while i took the goddamn parrot to his perch in the small front room the dead man had withdrawn his control and inhibiting influence the feathered weasel was returning to normal he muttered like a stevedore but his big interest at the moment was food not obnoxious chatter meant to get his owner crucified he let singe stroke his feathers as long as she didnt interfere with his dining singe was pleased normally that jungle buzzard is less kind to her than he is to me she looked up at me and tried to smile wish you wouldnt do that am i doing it wrong no but youre not people be content to be the brightest and best ratwoman who ever lived be true to yourself i felt like somebodys dad spouting clichés then of course i felt really awful because i was old enough to understand what the clichés were all about embarrassment followed that as i remembered the cocksure boys wed been when we were getting showered with the stupid stuff that turned out to be joe everymans way of trying to pass along his accumulated wisdom she is young garrett and she has only just escaped a state closely approximating slavery she will need time and numerous opportunities to shore up her belief in herself old bones has a soft spot for singe too though hed never admit that if it were suggested aloud hed never confess to any form of emotional vulnerability or sentimental weakness i kept thinking about old men and clichés and i kept trying to avoid considering how often the dean man threw those things my way because i resented his advice almost as much as id resented advice from men of my fathers generation when i was fifteen i guess neither the old men nor the young men ever learn but they keep on trying dean nearly beat us to the dead mans room with the refreshments i got a lamp going singe dragged in a special chair id had made that let her sit without having to worry about her troublesome tail in moments she and i were hard at work on the tea and sandwiches damn i woofed around a glob of bread and ham i didnt realize how hungry i was the effects of that knockout spell must be all the way worn off now singe grunted she didnt have time for anything else once she gulped down everything dean didnt nibble and i didnt devour she looked around like she hoped there was still a whole roast pig shed overlooked i knew a reinforced battalion of young women whod gladly kill and whod certainly hate singe for her ability to eat and eat and never gain an inappropriate ounce there are no fat ratpeople the dead man had me tell my story first i have a knack for accurate recollection i provided the details i believed were necessary for an understanding of events while the dead man observed those events as memories drifting across the surface of my mind he asked only a handful of questions waiting until i was finished talking to go to the first he seemed particularly interested in even the most minute details of the silver elves sorceries at first blush i would have to agree with mr dotes assessment that those people are not elves garrett perhaps they belong to a single family of unusual breeding a mixture of human and kef sidhe sounds plausible considering their descriptions though their apparel seems most unusual let us examine the materials you managed to recover at your last contact site all three of you please so that i may have the benefit of three divergent viewpoints and minds and sets of eyes once scattered atop the little table that is one of the few pieces of furniture in the dead mans room my plunder did not appear especially exciting because he was able to see the inside of my head anyway i admitted it seems to be mostly trash having contemplated the take through our several viewpoints old bones responded you are correct garrett the silver people did abandon what they considered to be waste how did he know through exactly the same process you used to come to that identical conclusion supplemented by experience and unlimited intellect it is a pity however that neither of you can recall the exact circumstances of the kidnappers final escape a huge pity i grumped my headache remained on duty totally devoted singe though smitten harder at the time had recovered completely already the dead man mustve been more interested in events than he let on when i started feeling sorry for myself and lusting after a beer he interfered with nature he reached inside my head and did something that made the pain fade away some enough though a reminder remained in the background eager to come back what can we tell from the kidnappers trash the dead man asked i couldnt tell a thing other than that they were no more fastidious than any other karentine subject singe sniffed each item yet again before carefully showing us her best imitation human shrug from its look shed practiced a lot ratpeople dont move like that normally she said this all smells very cold very sterile there is no soul in it there is no magic that was an interesting observation considering what wed seen and suffered but i kept my thoughts to myself singe needed her confidence and for all i really knew she was right on the mark she might be indeed garrett i scowled his way he was not supposed to eavesdrop on the inside of my head when i wasnt reporting i am not prying into your mind i just know how you think i believe that it is now time to interview mr bic gonlit his place in all this appears to be anomalous though i do have several hypotheses about what could be transpiring his testimony should tell me which of those i can reasonably discard why do i get the feeling that im going to do all the work inviting him in perhaps because you are irrationally pessimistic your part will require very little work garrett i will be the one forced to stretch himself to his limits after you have invested just a few minutes in rounding him up and bringing him here be sure you take your convincing stick never leave home without one thats my partner like some kind of priest or professor his vegetating is hard and honorable work all my sweat and agony is barely worth a mention because what i do involves occasionally engaging a muscle bic gonlit had no intention of cooperating bic gonlit could pick his dogs up and put them down when he was scared whod have thought a little round guy with chubby stubby legs could lead me on such a long chase not me not before i lived it after several blocks i was glad the dead man had insisted on sending the goddamn parrot out to scout for me by then it was obvious that bic gonlit could see in the dark and i could not which wasnt a major news flash and the people of my neighborhood arent rich enough to maintain adequate streetlamps the multicolored chicken did his part he kept up a running lot of howling and cursing some evidently adapted from the cant of oldtime formal hunts highbrow and embarrassing and likely everybody he woke up would assume that it was all my fault thered be complaints thered be angry presentations thered be intemperate talk about chasing me out of the neighborhood that would be followed by calmer heads appealing for reason the older residents all know i share my place with a cranky dead loghyr an irritated cranky dead loghyr can make life a lot more unpleasant for a lot of people for a long time why go looking for trouble i needed to stop playing around i needed to put on a burst of speed that would nail the fat man i shouldve planned for this phase before i let everybody go home just off the arsenal high street a little my way from the brewery district is a small remnant of oldtime imperial tunfaire that wasnt consumed in the great fire its known as prune tastity for reasons nobody recalls anymore prune tastity is a sort of museum of ancient times all crampedtogether buildings and covered alleyways barely wide enough to let the air circulate following the fire wider alleys and streets were mandated by law there is less disease in areas where the buildings are farther apart too the wonder buzzards shrieks told me my quarry was going to try to lose us both by ducking into prune tastitys tangle of covered alleyways ive been in there a few times the place is a maze at times rising five stories high what gonlit apparently didnt realize was that i was familiar enough with prune tastity to know that therere only a handful of entrances to the maze hed gone in the far side hoping id follow and get lost if he meant to leave without running into me again hed have to come out not far from where i stood listening to the goddamn parrots progress report i got myself into position with minutes to spare i used every second to get more wind back into my lungs i needed my breathing under control if gonlit wasnt going to hear me puffing for a block before he arrived i neednt have worried bic was puffing so hard himself that he couldnt have heard the ringing of the bell thats supposed to announce the end of the world his head was down his arms and legs were pumping and he wasnt even making a fast walk anymore but he was still moving he sounded like he was going to expire if he didnt take a break and concentrate on his breathing i timed my move caught his collar as he shuffled past he made one feeble attempt to get away then gave up and i mean gave up completety he just folded up on the street and refused to do anything but gasp for air ten minutes later he was still curled up like a pillbug daring me to make him do anything he didnt want to do he seemed confident he knew enough about me to be sure i wouldnt kill him for being uncooperative morley is right i need to become less predictable and i need to develop a more savage reputation because of the dead mans reminder i had not left the house without my convincing stick eighteen inches of oak with a pound of lead in its active end it proved useful on this unfriendly night i tapped my new friend just below the kneecap on each leg not hard enough to break anything just hard enough to turn his legs to water temporarily i didnt want him able to put up much of a fight when i took his precious boots he understood before i got the first boot off he started yelping he called for help he begged for mercy the goddamn parrot came down and chimed in carrying on loudly in several obviously nonhuman voices not that any witnesses were likely to drop their street sense in order to jump in and rescue any of us that was not the way of the city you sonofabitch you want to keep your pretty boots youd better get real cooperative real sudden i thumped mr gonlit once atop each shoulder briskly not far from the sides of his neck instantly bic began to have trouble lifting his arms the little man was tough in his way he never stopped struggling until i dragged the second boot off him then he went limp again without volunteering to make my life any easier bic im gonna take your shoes home with me maybe give me a good shine it had been my intention to drag him along with me too but id just heard a troubling sound one id honestly never expected to hear but rumors had been circulating for weeks so i recognized it in plenty of time the sound was a whistle rather like the shrill of a boatswains pipe somebody from the guards foot patrol wasnt far away and hed heard that there was trouble he was summoning assistance changing times relway and block just have way too many ideas for advancing the case of law and order not that i mind too much when they interfere in someone elses business but my business is mine i said my friend and i have to run ill take good care of your boots you know where to find them when the mood hits you drop by the house you can pick them up i was drawing to an inside straight betting his boots were that important to him i wouldve talked more but now whistles from several sources were sounding closer and closer i headed for home i was halfway there before i realized that the goddamn parrot wasnt with me when i got home i went straight to the dead man to find out why the manner in which you dealt with the exigencies of your situation seems well chosen however it did leave considerable leeway in the hands of mr gonlit it seemed prudent to keep watching eyes and a nagging voice somewhere near him lest he surrender to a fit of common sense and just abandon his boots you do have those still excellent would you summon miss pular she is in the kitchen helping herself to a snack dean has retired for the night we will try to discover why the boots mean so much to our rotund nemesis did you by the by discover how it was that he was able to see in the dark fraid not the question went right out of my head when i heard those whistles old bones was wideawake and in rare form nothing escaping the notice of his several minds i wasnt going to be allowed anything less than wideawake myself until he sucked up all the outside information he wanted singe sniffed gonlits boots that wasnt a task i envied her their fragrance had been less than appealing while i was toting them even carried at the ends of their strings but ratpeople dont seem to be repelled by odors the same way we humans are nor are they offended by the same scents hard to credit in some cases but ive been around singe long enough to know that its true the famous gonlit boots had soles layered more than two inches thick they had fake glass emeralds and rubies and little brass rivet heads all over them i thought they looked pretty shabby these days maybe old bic was farther down on his luck than rumor suggested he wasnt so bigtime that popular interest tracked his every step at one time the boots had been white at one time so the story went bic gonlit had dressed all in white even unto the extremity of an allwhite widebrimmed version of the unorthodox missionarys hat that would have been years ago though when bic would have been more prosperous because he was less well known that would have been during the days before he learned that having a signature look was no advantage in the bountyhunting business your quarry would see you coming the boots themselves by reputation were enchanted how so remained an open question they hadnt added anything to his getaway speed but on the other hand hed been able to see in the dark maybe wed winkle out all the facts when bic came to reclaim his treasures the dead man and singe communed about those boots i jumped suddenly my eyes had fallen shut i dont know for how long long enough for the lamp to have gone out now just a single candle burned on the top shelf of the dead mans memorabilia case he and singe werent troubled by the shortage of light garrett i heard a racket up front one of the two nuisances had awakened me the dead man wasnt going anywhere i got up and stalked to the front door the racket there persisted i began thinking that maybe mr gonlit needed a whipping just to remind him of his manners i used the peephole for its dedicated purpose surprise that wasnt bic gonlit trying to make my neighbors dislike me even more that was three or four guys who had no manners to be reminded of the loudest was none other than our beloved chief of the city guards colonel westman block himself itd been a while since we two had crossed paths he seemed to have grown in that time both in stature and in confidence i turned away on the theory that he could use a little deflation allow the colonel to enter garrett that will serve us better in the long run took you long block snarled as i swung the door inward damn garrett he barked when i swung it right back shut bruising his nose garrett just a little courtesy lesson i opened the door again colonel block appeared more flustered than angry and his goons three gorillas damned near as big as saucerhead tharpe wore dazed looks as though they were asleep on their feet with their eyes open good evening colonel how can i help you evidently the shock had been enough to startle block into a case of the courtesies that or some light touch from the dead man yes weve had reports of some unusual events garrett thiss tunfaire we have wizards and priests enough here to supply the world with weird i led block into the dead mans room while we talked his goons remained outside still as memorial pillars he replied but in this instance theres reason to believe that you might be involved what me how come i get blamed for everything because someone fitting your description accompanied by persons fitting the descriptions of known associates of yours including a cursing parrot was seen near the sites of several unusual incidents im disinclined to accept the explanation that your evil twin was out there trying to scuttle your reputation you dont have one go ahead and tell him the truth garrett ive cooperated with the authorities on most occasions it rankles but to be honest its never been that huge an inconvenience so i told him the whole story sort of almost in the young peoples abridged form then he told me a story his was a lot shorter coming up here we ran into a crowd of ratpeople twenty or thirty of them trying to work up their nerve for some villainy when they recognized us they scattered like roaches a couple of my guys mentioned seeing a little fat man running with them either one of you want to say something about that i would if i could boss but i dont have any idea the dead man had no comment at all block asked any ideas about these lights in the sky these flying helmets and whatnot people keep seeing them and getting upset about them so other people keep telling me that i have to do something about them nobody has any suggestions about what the hell that might be and i dont have any brilliant ideas of my own youve started to regress you had your language so cleaned up you couldve fit in at court thats whats causing it polite society those folks have more demands and can make bigger pains in the ass of themselves than any three normal human beings whos telling you to do something about those things do they really think youd interfere in wizards experiments get real its wizards doing the demanding garrett they cant figure out whats going on so they expect colonel westman block of his majestys royal tunfairen civil guards to unravel the mystery for them meantime wes block cant keep his own feet untangled but they dont need to know that how much does the prose kid know id been afraid wed get to that as soon as hed mentioned the failed investigations of our lords of the hill i dont know not much more than squat but hed like everybody to think hes in on the secrets of the universe hes a loon eighty percent of what he says is complete iwantyoutothinkimspecial hooey does he know where to find those stray elves he picked up my guess is he can get in touch somehow if its critical but we dont know where he is yes thats right isnt it that other bunch snatched the boy up so you say he gave me a look filled with suspicion he was succumbing to relways disease trusting no civilian sometimes i think deal relway divides the population into three categories the smaller two consist of known criminals and of policemen with a very fuzzy boundary in between the other largest category includes all the rest of us and were all just crooks who havent been found out yet and we should be treated accordingly block eyed the dead man is he asleep again old chuckles had shown no sign of sentience since the colonels arrival an excellent question lately im getting random moments of nonsense but nothing consistent im worried he may be on that last level ground before he hits the slippery slope down block scowled still suspicious he had heard this one before i said indulge my curiosity how come youre out prowling the streets yourself i thought you guys had a division of labor where the colonel stays back at the alkhar snoozing and harassing prisoners while the rest of the guys do all the real work block didnt respond right away he glanced at the dead man again definitely wondering if he could get away with telling me less than the whole truth when your name came up i knew it was bound to get exciting it made sense to get close to the center of the action right at the beginning i didnt need the dead man to tell me that block was dealing me a steaming hot load the hill might not be behind the flying lights and pots but somebody up there wanted to be involved and when the hill wants something even its biggest detractors put on a show of flashing heels and flying elbows not many people relish the notion of spending the rest of their lives dead and being tortured which is no contradiction where the topranked sorcerers are involved you might by a stretch be able to say that colonel block and i are friends not thick and thin hell and high water blood brother friends but guys who like and respect one another who are willing to lend a helping hand to one another where its possible to do so it was conceivable that block was doing so at the moment so that i wouldnt walk into something entirely blind and so that in return he could tap me for a little information that would keep him in good odor with the people prodding him from behind i can do that for him its worked out for us in the past the tricky part is keeping outsiders from forming the idea that we can get along block observed you really are a big old barrel of nothing arent you what the hell is that the pixies out front had declared war possibly on themselves they were so raucous theyd been silent since my return so much so that id begun to suspect an evil influence at work pixies i told block i seem to have adopted a mob against my will id better see whats got them excited inasmuch as the dead man didnt seem inclined to inform me i heaved out of my chair and headed up front in the small front room the goddamn parrot was asleep already muttering in his diabolical dreams no doubt he had protested his recent utilization by making a mess dean would nag me about for weeks block followed me through the peephole i watched one of his escorts fling something upward i said your boys are tormenting my pixies id better get them out of here before it gets out of hand then dont hesitate to let me know if you learn anything useful you wouldnt accidentally let slip which sorcerer types are interested in my problem would you not hardly not even if i knew but i think you can safely assume that just about anybody up there would be interested in gaining the secrets of flight he opened the door went out growling what the devil do you men think youre doing they started it they were throwing chunk the door cut it off i returned to the dead mans room so how come we needed to chase block and his pals away and how the hell did the goddamn parrot get back in the house mr bic gonlit is out there awaiting an opportunity to reclaim his magical boots colonel block was unable to add anything more to our meager knowledge miss pular opened the door for mister big while you were napping did block add anything to our meager knowledge i didnt like that business about singe opening the door with nobody to back her up old bones isnt always attentive to detail only internal confirmation of most of what he told you the people on the hill have become exceptionally interested in unusual celestial events of late in blocks mind theyre convinced the flying objects represent a threat from foreign sorcerers although a minority believe that a rogue cabal of karentine wizards are behind what has been happening hoping to elbow the rest out of the inner circles of power whatever the truth the root concern is those peoples fear for their positions oh they wouldnt like to lose their power would they do i need to go out and catch bic gonlit because i was bonetired i was ready to hit the sack skipping the evenings last five or six mugs of beer judging by your stunning success in that direction before perhaps your ideal course would be to wait for him to come to you he does seem to be extremely superstitious about his boots they are a controlling factor in his life singe came in from the kitchen carrying a tray shed hidden out there while block was in the house and she hadnt wasted her time shed made more sandwiches and had drawn me a mug off the keg in the cold well i gave her a look at my raised eyebrow trick as i went to work on a sandwich her whiskers twitched and pulled back in the ratkind equivalent of turning pink its all right singe youre welcome old bones im not going to be able to keep my eyes open much longer if i get him in here can you handle the interview his exasperation with mortal weakness became palpable get him in here that is the key first step then you two can run off to bed whilst i labor singe squeaked her whiskers went back so far it looked like they were about to pop out he doesnt mean that singe he just means sleep you take the guest room on the third floor she was familiar with it shed used it before ill see if blocks gone he is though an observer remained behind and is seated on mrs cardonlos stoop pretending to be drunk he is about to fall asleep at his post i went to the front door certain that any sleepiness being experienced by colonel blocks man had an artificial origin unlike my own singe followed me she carried a lamp its light silhouetted me when i opened the door bic gonlit arrived five minutes later he was about as hangdog as its possible for a man to look bic old buddy i said whyd you want to go and bring a bunch of ratpeople around to my place you still got my boots theyre in a place of honor but im going to burn them and scatter their ashes on the river if i dont hear some explanations you dont have a reputation for being that hard garrett youve got a rep as a bring them in alive kind of bounty hunter bic so besides the answer to my ratpeople question which i want to hear real soon now id sure like to know why youre hanging around me but where are my manners come on in we dont want to do business out here the guard keeps a watch on me gonlit jumped he looked back nervously he sure was a worried little man and barefoot too he slipped past me taking one final troubled look back as he did so tell me about the rats bic he stared at pular singe because theres a huge reward out for her reliance wants her bad i thought id get my boots back during the confusion when reliances gang were grabbing her plus youdve made a few marks i said i appreciate your honesty so im not going to hold a very big grudge all you need to do is explain why you were hanging around in the alley out back and just had to slug me were going in here i held the door to the dead mans room bics boots were in there sitting on the table next to singes sandwiches but i had a feeling it would be a while before they enjoyed a loving reunion with bics feet take a seat brother i just want my boots garrett we all have dreams bic sometimes we have to give a little something to attain them what about the alley what alley now were going to play tough exasperated i snapped the goddamn alley behind my house where you bushwhacked me and pounded me over the head with a sap gonlit looked at me like id just sprouted antlers garrett i jumped so did bic and singe yeah bizarre as it may seem the man really does have no idea what you are talking about i now find myself examining the hypothesis that the bic gonlit you encountered in the alley was not the man who is here with us now either this man has a twin or what you ran into was the creature i sensed and set you to collect somehow projecting an illusion based upon the expectations of cypres prose i now agree that it is time you went to bed have the man sit down bic hadnt yet accepted my invitation then go i will see that he dozes off too pular singe made an offer that was difficult to refuse because she was so fragile emotionally not tonight singe im so tired id fall asleep in the middle of things and youd get your feelings hurt while you kept telling me that it was all your fault she was getting used to hearing me yell at her about embracing blame for what other people did that wasnt as honest as i shouldve been but it did buy me time to think about an answer that would leave singe with her tender dignity intact feeling good about herself the more i considered it the more i suspected that id need the dead mans help to work this one out singe was at an age and stage where she wasnt going to hear much from me that she didnt want to hear though i must say my not tonight another time response certainly seemed to ease her anxieties for the moment maybe she wouldnt find the nerve to bring it up again those damned pixies woke me up twice during the night and both times i got a touch from the dead man indicating that we had a prowler outside he didnt trouble himself enough to report what kind of prowler and i was too groggy to care the pixies made good watchdogs yet if that was what i wanted id just as soon get something big but quiet that would eat the prowlers without waking me up or disturbing my neighbors it was near the crack of noon when i stumbled downstairs and found a sullen dean sharing his kitchen with pular singe singe was at the table eating she had dragged her custom chair in from the dead mans room dean was doing dishes and wrestling with his prejudices not many folks have much use for ratpeople ive always belonged to the majority myself but i do try my best to contain my dislike thats been a lot easier since singe came along i mumbled youre going to get fatter than the dead man singe i flopped into my own chair my head still hurts though a lot less than it had dean said ive warned you and warned you to ease up on the beer garrett it wasnt beer this time dean rattled some dishes and snorted not believing me its not singe can tell you i got knocked out by some kind of wizardry a few times yesterday and every time i woke up i had a worse headache than before then explain why i had to send out for a new keg this morning it hasnt been ten days since you finished the last one new keg but the old one shouldnt be singe had developed a fierce interest in a fly doing acrobatics from the ceiling and you dont have a bit of a hangover from all that either do you girl she shook her head tried one of her wanttobe human smiles gah thiss the cruelest of all cruel worlds i wouldve teased her about selling her back to reliance or something but shed probably have taken me seriously dean took his hands out of the water long enough to pour a mug of tea and set a breakfast platter in front of me that was mostly seasonal fruit accompanied by small chunks of cold ham a typical meal really which left me wondering how dean managed to produce so many dirty dishes pots and pans i downed a long slug of tea there was something in that cup besides plain tea it left a bitter taste underneath the honey so dean had counted on me showing up with a headache since he doesnt coddle my hangovers he mustve been forewarned so his fuss was all for form so the dead man was good for something after all though he wouldnt have coddled a hangover either singe tried to fuss over me dean looked disgusted i showed him my evil eye of all the females to pass through my kitchen the one hed pick to dislike actively would be the only one who was willing to treat me special he was plenty willing to climb all over me when it came to me not treating every girl as if she was uniquely special i tossed back some more tea while thinking my house was turning into a nest of cranky old bachelors the pixies started acting up out front dean ignored them he had his cutting board out and was getting ready to mutilate vegetables you going to check that out i asked no happens every fifteen minutes if it means anything the thing in the other room will let us know if he wasnt asleep the dead man has a habit of falling asleep sometimes for months usually at the most inconvenient times businesswise i finished feeding the medication in the tea had begun its work the world seemed a less dark and cruel place already singe lets go see old chuckles got to keep that premature optimism under control and he was just the boy to rein it in hey old bones whats on the table today bic gonlit how you doing this morning man dean get you something to eat whatever dean put into the tea maybe he used a little too much i got no response from the dead man gonlit did respond with a big scowl i want my boots garrett im sure you do they say youve got your whole personality tied up in those things so why do you want to get them all filthy romping around in the alley behind my house bic rolled his eyes not again i have exhausted that line of inquiry garrett mr gonlit sincerely believes that he has never been in that alley there is no shaking his conviction on that count therefore i am inclined to believe him however he cannot account for his whereabouts at the time of the alley event he is more troubled about that than we are i wasnt troubled at all maybe it was him being used by one of the silver guys the way you use the goddamn parrot that possibility occurred to me there is no residue in mr gonlits mind of the sort i would expect to find if he had been manipulated what is there consists of hints that he may have been asleep inasmuch as he does not recall sleeping we might reasonably suspect that the sleep was induced perhaps by the same means as were used on you yesterday all right and the boy cyprus prose brought mr gonlits name into play first id just been thinking that had kip set us up somehow could the dead man have missed that while the kid was here no bic did anybody hire you to hunt down a couple elves name of lastyr and noodiss im tired of that one too give me my damned boots he believes he never heard those names before he came in here last night i growled the excitement and optimism were beginning to fade then how come he was following me and you were following him with the goddamn parrot are you genuinely certain you want mr gonlit to hear more about my abilities than you have given away already all right i wasnt thinking not a first i might note you might you might also answer me he was following miss pular garrett mr big was following you insofar as i have been able to determine their appearance of being together was caused by the proximities of yourself and miss pular thereve been too damned many coincidences already old bones you know i believe in them but i dont like them next thing youre going to tell me is that good buddy bic just happened to stumble over singe as she and saucerhead were coming to help me out and being the ingenious fellow that he is bic just latched right on seizing the day as it were that is quite close to the truth as mr gonlit knows it except for the fact that he was hunting miss pular long before we became involved in events he had traced her to the area where we had her hidden my call for assistance unfortunately brought her out just in time to be spotted i generated harrumphing old man noises i didnt like the way things were going you never do but you have a knack for blundering around knocking things over until everything works out i harrumphed some more practicing i have plans for an extremely extended old age i was profoundly embarrassed by the fact that it took me so long to discover mr gonlits presence on your backtrail ohoh the dead man seldom admits lacks flaws or shortcomings he is after all the most perfect of that perfect race the loghyr just ask him when he messes up its always someone elses fault behold then i began to understand the description i had was entirely inadequate so you didnt figure it was unusual for a guy to be turning up everywhere singe and i did it really is pointless to indicate the holes in his excusemaking at best he just ignores you i should like to engage in a much deeper look into your encounter with the false bic gonlit of the alleyway it is entirely possible that you may have noticed something we passed over as trivial when we were confident that we knew who your conqueror was the real bic gonlit had grown very restless let me give the man his soles back so he can go on his way charged up with uncertain ideas about his place in the grander scheme his head a nest of confused false memories turn the bird loose once mr gonlit is a block down the street of course theres always hope hell run into a parroteating eagle bic herere your boots get going stay away from me and stay away from pular singe i guarantee you reliances reward isnt worth it belinda contague used to be my girlfriend bic went pale hed heard that rumor i was still alive so maybe i could conjure the helpmate of death foolish garrett he was right that was a stupid threat if word got back to belinda i could end up on crutches if she happened to be in a generous mood i waved byebye from the stoop then i flung our lowlife lowprofile spy into the air then i rejoined singe and the dead man returning to life after having the dead man dig around in the muck in the cellars of my mind was less painful than getting whomped unconscious by a silver elfs spell but it did leave me feeling just as lousy emotionally it left me wanting nothing more than to go back to bed where i could curl up in a ball and suck my thumb that kind of invasion doesnt happen often and never happens without my permission but each time it does i swear ill never let it happen again no matter how desperate the crisis but when the time comes i always go ahead trusting him and knowing ill get through it and maybe its even good for me in the long run that dark unhappy memories always seem to settle a little deeper and a little more comfortably like a bucket full of gravel when you shake and beat it i took some cleansing breaths some of that martial arts stuff of morleys really does work if you let yourself believe in it i found a place removed from my center by just a few miles did we learn anything that makes it worth all my misery i believe we did though it is indeed a small thing at first glimpse he didnt go on he wanted me to ask him to show off his brilliance i wasnt feeling patient enough to get involved in the usual games and that was the bic gonlit in our alleyway was not wearing the signature boots you had mentioned missing seeing them earlier but at that time i overlooked the chance that you had not seen them because they were not there at that time there was no reason to look beyond the obvious also the gonlit you met out back was several inches taller than this specimen even without the leather lifts so where does that leave us essentially still lost but now forearmed with the knowledge that the opposition might appear to us in the guise of someone we know but not in the form of a perfect replica grumble dont tell me its shapeshifters again i promise there are no shapeshifters here there does seem to be some remarkable illusory sorcery however you said there wasnt any sorcery in the alley i did i do not believe there was it is a conundrum is it not great so good old bic is innocent of everything more sinister than trying to score the bounty on singe stipulating that i want to know how come kip knew the name and thought gonlit was after his strange friends and id like to know how that elf got to know bic well enough to masquerade as him without bic knowing there was anything going on all excellent questions garrett you are learning to think unfortunately mr gonlit does not have any of the answers we will have to flush those out somewhere else inasmuch as we have no hope of uncovering a direct trail to the boy i suspect a visit to the mother has some chance of being productive you think she might know i see anything she can give us could be a thread to pull or a pointer to a path that might lead to somebody who does have an idea where to look for the boy indeed which is why i suggest the mother she may even have an idea where to find the mysterious noodiss and his associate a possibility that no doubt mustve occurred to the people already in that hunt i get the feeling these others are real amateurs how much less gentle would have been the hunt had the outfit been seeking the missing elves true miss pular should remain here it is a certainty that reliance has people watching the house relway too probably just so then maybe i shouldnt go out there either a career in the homebased beertasting industry sounded good at the moment you are too concerned about your reputation i will ensure that any spies remain ignorant of your departure once again a hint that he had greater abilities than those to which he admitted though this was a trick he had used before several times ive never been sure how it works it might blind everyone in the neighborhood to my movements which would be handy if i had to raise some cash real fast i had been considering a career change why not become an invisible pickpocket the air seemed to crackle like the sharp whispering of river ice just starting to break up my partner didnt approve of my thoughts not even with those being entirely in jest when this day was done i was going to get away from all these people maybe id get me off to one of the taverns where old marines gather to slough off the dust of lesser mortals or possibly somewhere where i might glimpse a shapely ankle garrett there will be no diversions neither of the heart nor of the mind nor of the flesh if you do not get out and try to find some threads that i can unravel while you are reviving your reputation as a rogue a rake and a wastrel he did have a point i went to playmates stable first hed have to show me where to find kips family i dont know if thatll do any good playmate said when i explained what i wanted i guarantee you his mother doesnt know anything useful if she did shed already have been out there wherever yanking those elves ears till they talked thought they didnt have ears maybe they ran into kayne prose already hardcase eh a very determined mom you dont mess with her kids otherwise shes just a hardworking widow looking for enough work to get by therere a lot of those in tunfaire though in the final few most desperate years of the war the crown tried taking younger conscripts so there wouldnt be as many widows created uh i said i must be confused you didnt say anything about her being a widow yesterday playmate looked at me like he wondered if i was really that dumb widow is a euphemism as old as mothers without husbands she wouldnt brag about having three outofwedlock children by three different fathers one of them maybe off the hill though two of the fathers really are dead and the maybe wizard probably is he hasnt been seen since the supply boat he was aboard left the tunfaire waterfront when kip was still a bun in the oven the leitmark never made it to full harbor pirates playmate shrugged at this date it doesnt matter kayne has bad luck with men they die on her or they go away but shes an unswerving optimist she keeps on trying after kip came along i finally managed to convince her she should invest in avoiding any more pregnancies she owed that to the kids she already had you sound like you might have a little emotion invested in the prose family yourself i like the kids they turned out pretty good considering and kayne is a good woman who doesnt really deserve everything shes suffered but she does bring it on herself selfdestructive eh i might know a little about that myself definitely but mainly in the area of men she keeps rejecting everybody who might be good for her and welcoming the villains whore sure to treat her badly there mightve been a slight hint of disappointment there if so it was so faint that i didnt think it was worth pursuing time would tell me about playmate and kayne prose i was about to see how they acted around each other leaving playmates stable we walked about a mile toward the river skirting prune tastity to reach the southwesternmost fringe of the garment district which actually takes up less land area than prune tastity it was on the fringe that we found kips mom kayne prose was doing seamstress work in a small coop operated round the clock by teams of women whose situations were all much the same they were all dirtpoor with children without husbands without other salable skills and most with too many miles on them to compete as prostitutes or taxi dancers i found the atmosphere inside that place oppressive the walls had become impregnated with despair but every woman there had an air of grim determination they were survivors those women doing what they had to do same as me back when it was crocodiles on the one hand venageti rangers on the other and poisonous bugs snakes spiders and bats everywhere else neither we then nor these women now would let the despair work its seduction these ladies would battle on until doom sounded its final bell give them the supreme compliment they wouldve made good marines there were eight women sewing when we arrived i picked kayne prose out immediately there was a lot of her in kip only damn play shes a looker you sure that womans got three kids one of them nineteen years old no doubt the weak light did her a favor but she didnt look much older than me if that old she could have competed in the flesh markets and wouldve done pretty well id guess maybe it was the long blond hair that shone like that of a girl half her age maybe it was her skin which seemed far too smooth for a woman of mature years maybe it was her face which the hardships of poverty hadnt etched nearly as deeply as i wouldve expected maybe it was some sort of inner fire there are those oneinathousand people who just never seem to get old i guess i stood there stunned maybe dribbling from the corner of my mouth for a while because i heard this whisper thats exactly how everyone reacts when they meet her for the first time everyone male i figured kayne proses sparkling baby blues met mine the twinkle there told me she could read my mind as surely as the dead man could a tiny smile told me she didnt mind my sort of thinking either oh the gods had been generous when theyd shaped kayne prose and some real artists had gone in on the architecture nor had childbearing been unkind there would be plenty of women ten even fifteen years younger whod just plain hate kayne prose for existing seven of that sort were planted right there in that room hello play she said and oh my her voice was as deep and husky and sensual as katies it turned my spine to water and i was there on business feeling guilty because id let her son get spirited away and she was fully aware of the effect she was having it was an effect shed been having on men for twentyfive years probably i was willing to bet there was elven blood in her no further than a grandparent away she said i cant get up i fell behind yesterday whos your friend she looked me over like she was checking out vegetables at the market yet from her it was flattering rather than offensive and the same from me right back she definitely liked being looked at which was probably a symptom of her problem playmates expression soured proof that there was substance to my earlier suspicion i tried to rein in my boyish charm playmate said kayne thiss garrett the man who was going to help kip now hes going to help us find kip for a moment kayne prose turned entirely into a worried mother she turned up a look i remembered from childhood which left me nose to nose with the scary speculation that my mother might have been capable of that other nonmotherly behavior too no never she was mom whatever i can do to contribute i will mr garrett she said all business now im afraid well almost all business kayne prose was incapable of stifling her sensual side man i said im here because i dont know where else to start can you talk while you work the place wasnt a sweatshop it was a coop but none of the women were pleased to have playmate and me upsetting their routine though a couple of them eyed playmate like they were measuring him for a wedding suit it being a coop there wouldnt be killer piecework quotas but still for the women to make much income theyd have to put in fourteenhour days theyd have some formula for a fair division of the coops income talk away but there aint much i can tell you if i knew anything i probably wouldntve lost my kid those two goofballs dont mean anything to me noodiss and lastyr we know any other goofballs in this mess the four who werent those two that took your son and the three who tried and failed earlier i didnt think the two crews were the same but i hadnt seen playmates female elves then inspired i said tell me about bic gonlit if kip knew the guy then so might she pay dirt her needle slowed for a moment possibly snagging somehow she studied her last stitch for half a second then she glanced up at playmate her stitching fell back into rhythm what do you want to know everything there was something here maybe nothing id find useful but definitely a connection again she glanced at playmate so i did the same only to have him shrug in response then ask will you be more comfortable if i go outside kayne kayne prose winced i doubted that the woman was long on sensitivity life wouldnt have afforded her the luxury but she had something on her mind she thought playmate would be disappointed or hurt she cherished his good opinion or maybe needed it as an emotional foundation stone whatever she could see some value in a man who was too good to become an active accomplice in her game of selfdestruction playmate is one of those guys who is just too damned nice for his own good and everyone in the place recognized that playmate felt that his good could be the woman who looked like she had made a pact with the agents of darkness except for kayne prose herself of course kayne prose told playmate you dont need to go play if im embarrassed by something i tell mr garrett then i deserve the full impact mr garrett i enjoyed for want of a more appropriate description a brief relationship with bic gonlit not long ago her fingers flew sewing a sleeve onto something for a child maybe six years old something for a little girl who would never suffer the miseries and indignities so intimately known to the woman who had assembled her dress i dont believe he saw it in the same light as i did though with an intonation implying that they never do interesting the dead man hadnt mentioned this tantalizing tidbit did he want me to find out for myself or wasnt there anything interesting there or maybe bic hadnt remembered because it wasnt important to him was this anytime recently kayne nodded i ended it three days ago when i realized he was using me damn the woman made the act of breathing a sensual promise no wonder old bic took her wrong the rest of the women adjusted their positions as kayne finished each commenting without saying a word possibly unfairly i didnt get the feeling that kayne prose made herself a public utility only that she really enjoyed men but always conspired with her own inner devils to make sure she picked the ones who would be bad for her i see this was a good idea play ive learned more in the last three minutes than i did up till then kayne did it get physical did he ever take his boots off rumor suggested that bic might not kayne prose turned bright red something her coop pals probably found amazing i wondered if that would have happened had playmate not been with me he he had a problem he said what do you mean about boots bic gonlits big legend revolves around his custommade hugely ugly possibly magical boots theyre boots a ratman wouldnt steal theyre white with fake gems all over them they have thick elevator soles youre probably a good four inches taller than bic in his bare feet hes as tall as me and i never noticed any special boots or shoes or anything else i exchanged glances with playmate what kayne demanded i told her that wasnt the real bic gonlit then that was one of the elves whore looking for kips friends he uses some kind of sorcery to make people think theyre seeing bic gonlit but the illusion doesnt include the boots or enough of the short you know youre right i never thought about it before when we were kids bic always had a thing about his shoes youve known him a long time not well but since i was kips age we grew up on the same street i saw him around sometimes we said hi i never paid him much attention and he never paid me any i thought that was because he might be a little fey like maybe he didnt know what he wanted to be and he was always kind of a jerk but a month ago he started coming around and acting like he was really interested hed gotten a case of the manners and he could talk a pretty good game but he never did nothing else sooner or later and mostly sooner the conversation got around to kip and his friends he was always asking questions a man who never does nothing but talk about your kids dont stay real interesting and aint much fun you hear that play i thought this one has a me streak and its what keeps causing her problems clever men would play to it and would think less of her because they were able to i stand cautioned but i do have to bring the brats up some in order to get my job done one of the women groaned dramatically playmate blessed the lot with a righteous glower he drew himself up stiffly erect like he was about to go on a rant about hellfire and sin and chucking first rocks i asked kip did know this bic too better than i did he figured out right away that bic just wanted to get next to the two spooky critters lastyr and noodiss still the ones buddy the furnace wasnt burning nearly as hot as it had id managed to work myself down off the a list you have any idea how i could find this bic gonlit could you get ahold of him somehow if you wanted she thought about her answer for a while id begun to suspect that her lights didnt burn too bright and that the woman was something of a flake besides more factors contributing to her string of failed relationships the substance behind the beauty and the intense sensuality was thin which i wouldnt find all that big a handicap most of the time but businesswise it makes for endless problems from the corners of my eyes i noted the other women watching to see how long it would take me to catch on and if it would matter maybe with a touch more malice toward me than toward kayne prose in some ways they might live vicariously through kayne kayne wasnt afraid to indulge herself she let me look and think for a while probably so i could reflect on what i was talking myself out of before she said yeah play take mr garrett over to my place rhafi can show you guys where bic used to hole up and if the creep is still there break a couple limbs for me all of them if he dont give kip back i was about to explain that it wasnt likely the false bic gonlit had the boy playmate nudged me that was irrelevant it was time to go good idea too because atop everything else kayne prose had a kind of narcotic quality to her i could see myself sliding into addiction just like my dusky pal i kept thinking that if she hadnt had so many incompatible personality quirks she couldve set herself up for life by getting into the mistress racket in a prime position that she was where she was looking as good as she did never having done better was one more warning flag about the woman inside that marvellously attractive shell a long time ago almost a whole day now playmate had told me that cypres proses mom was different and had pointed to his temple based on information gleaned id say the man was right but that didnt stop me from wanting to turn right around and go back and try to score some points for the future playmate asked what did you think of kayne honest answer play i never saw her before in my life but i wanted to trip her and beat her to the floor and ten seconds after that i just wanted to beat her and ten seconds after that i was completely confused about what i wanted and right now the animal side of my soul is screaming at me not to walk away from this wonderful chance theres a perverse selfdestructive urge in there somewhere that she just shrieks out to he wasnt offended thats how a lot of men react you a little faster than most but thats just you being you and after years of studying kayne prose i think its all because of whats going on inside her she doesnt just hurt herself in these doomed relationships and the harder it is on the guys the harder they try to make it work we were strolling playmate needed to air out some thoughts it was clear that he was a kayne prose addict and willing to risk destruction and maybe kayne prose thought too much of playmate to give him a hit of poison people are the strangest creatures whats it all mean i asked just to keep open the windows of his mental house i think it means that kayne has a lowgrade form of what the dead man has the mind thing which could mean another wizard in the woodpile a generation further back just enough to read you faintly and to touch you just as weakly without knowing it on a conscious level but using it all the time when men are around in such a way that whatever is going on inside her will be reflected right back at her from outside and maybe itll feed on itself if it starts running into something dark i considered you could be right i started trying to compare in my head kayne proses impact with the jolt my friend katie could deliver katie can reduce this man to jelly with just a look when katie gets interested there are no distractions katie is the closest ive ever come to having had a religious epiphany id just considered that to be a matter of focus but maybe it was something more maybe there was a weak crude mental connection involved playmate said its just a hypothesis with a tone so defensive that an apology was implied a damned good hypothesis id say you ought to get completely alone with her sometime no distractions whatsoever and test it out he sputtered play youre embarrassed im not that kind of guy garrett maybe you ought to be tell me about kaynes other kids are they problem folks like their mother and brother not like their mother and brother but problems enough youll like cassie he didnt tell me much more but he was right about cassie cassie was a very likeable child indeed cassie doap was nineteen physically cassie was her mother a decade and a half younger with the overpowering sensuality less controlled cassie doap would break hearts just by going out where men could see her and understand that they would live out their years never having gotten any closer than they were at the moment when first they spotted her cassie doap filled up a room with her presence but didnt spark the confusion that came with being around her mother cassie doap was smarter than kayne too she understood the impact she had on men but had no intention of letting that define who and what she was if kayne prose had done one useful thing for her daughter it was to set an example of how not to live her life all that i understood before cassie doap and i exchanged a word because cassie doap was an easy read she wanted it that way i wondered what hidden horrible flaw had a poor woman as gorgeous as this still living with her mother at her age a hyperactive sense of selfworth playmate performed the introductions i managed to shake hands while avoiding stepping on my tongue distracting myself by concentrating on business im able to do that occasionally though therere some who would have the world believe otherwise its just that the kaynes and cassies of the world make it so hard with cassie there i almost overlooked her brother rhafi he wasnt the sort to attract much attention i told cassie were trying to find kip we think if play hadnt guaranteed it was the real thing i wouldve bet the little twerp staged the whole damned thing why would you think that i noted that unlike her mother cassie did nothing to make sure i understood just how much woman she was because thats the way his evil little pea brain works brother rhafi nodded his head vigorously he lives inside his own imagination everything in there is high drama perilous chases deadly duels narrow escapes beautiful princesses and monstrous villains playmate chuckled sounds like your life garrett he quipped except for a severe shortage of princesses beautiful or otherwise you wouldnt be a longlost princess left in a basket on your mothers doorstep would you cassie longlost anyway if that was intended to be a compliment you get points for being a little more subtle than the usual gods youre beautiful lie down because i think i love you mustve been army type guys marines are all smooth and crafty had we just gotten a hint of why cassie doap hadnt wriggled her way into the sweet life everybody knows thats a girls easiest way out of the poor side of town or was she in a constant rage because fate had decreed she should be so beautiful that everybody wanted her i dont recall ever having run into a woman who resented her own appeal only women who hated their sisters for having more of it than they did but i could understand the notion in principle in someone who could genuinely separate self from body possibly kaynes past behavior had loaded cassie up with outside expectations as well perhaps the whole neighborhood figured like mother like daughter thats the sort of ignorant thinking you can expect from human type beings and the sort that would park a big old chip on somebodys shoulder playmate said kayne told us you could show us where bic gonlit stayed when he was coming around here his tone was strained neutral and cassie heard that and she understood i cant i stayed away from that creep he was always trying to get me to go somewhere with him when kayne wasnt around but kayne had told us that bic hadnt shown any physical interest in her if he hadnt gone for the mom why would he take a run at the daughter make the assumption he wasnt a good redblooded karentine boy and you might think he could want something else maybe hed had a notion that snatching cassie would give him a lever he could use to get kip to tell him what he wanted to know hard to imagine just wanting cassie as a hostage she was the kind of girl you have to keep away from the old men or youll have them dropping like flies from strokes and heart attacks hell i was having palpitations myself and i was just there looking for her nimrod brother i had trouble seeing anything else especially not brother rhafi who vanished in cassies glare that poor kid didnt even have kips unpleasant character traits he was just there a gangly sixfooter with unkempt dark hair brown eyes a ghost of a mustache the beginnings of a set of bad teeth and no meat on his bones i got the impression that hed rather be somewhere else that like his brother he had a preference for the habitués of worlds of his own devising physically it was obvious that rhafi did not share a father with kip cassie she might pass as kips full sister if anybody wanted to pretend but she did have that different last name no matter as pleasant a task as it was staring at cassie and drooling i was in the business of rescuing obnoxious teenagers rhafi im garrett like maybe hed forgotten but id decided to deal with him the way i dealt with singe carefully he seemed of an age to be volatile i specialize in finding things that get lost or about anything else that needs doing that clients dont want to do for themselves and that i dont think is wrong like bic gonlit well sure though the reason i want to find him is because he may know where to find your brother petulantly i mean bic gonlit finds things thatre missing he said so the real bic gonlit specializes in finding people for other people people whore willing to pay well to have them found playmate told me lets dont complicate things garrett rhafi please show us where bic gonlit stayed he tried to get me up there too you know like he did cassie and you found out where he stayed good job playmates approach was the same as mine but the boy responded better probably because he knew and trusted playmate playmate does exude trustworthiness ive seen total strangers entrust him with everything but their souls playmate kept talking and rhafi responded the boy did not enjoy kips one redeeming quality he wasnt bright and he was spoiled as much as a neardestitute child can be spoiled i stepped back and let the master work shall we i asked cassie offering her my arm and a glimpse of my raised eyebrow the trick that kills them dead i think ill just stay here whimpering every bone crushed i dragged my battered carcass out of the prose flat following playmate and rhafi playmate said i told you youd like cassie hell i love her but im not so hot for the thing thats inside of her wearing her like a suit rhafi started laughing i mean he got one of those cases of the giggles where you just cant shut it off no matter how hard you try i didnt think it was that funny i said playmate agreed it wasnt funny at all rhafi gasped but you dont know cassie you dont have to live with her you dont have to suffer through it when she tries on different personalities like some rich bitch trying on different clothes he hacked and gasped all the way through that i know it isnt that funny but it was just so perfect for the bitch that shes trying to be this week shes always been an actress playmate said demonstratively not using the word in its pejorative form which means whore thats her way of coping ever get the idea that the dysfunctional folks outnumber those who arent every damned day im more of the opinion that everybodys knot is tied too loose or too tight and some just cover it up better than others its only a matter of time except for me and thee of course and sometimes we wonder about thee garrett im sorry you feel that way you might consider surrounding yourself with different people excluding myself naturally or you might find a different line of work one less likely to turn you cynical me cynical thats impossible i am one with the universe i have the perfect life except for the fact that i do have to work once in a while you shouldve picked a mother who lived on the hill that was a little shortsighted of me wasnt it rhafi in a moment when the giggles were under control observed you guys must be getting older than you look outside of the prose flat out of the shadow of his intimidating sister he developed some substance yeah how come do you say that that was a bitter draught even from a kid as strange as he you both think too much the little philosopher damn i said theres an accusation that hasnt been flung in my face for a long time possibly never playmate opined i recall the opposite fault getting mentioned with some frequency however hello what do we have here clumps of people occupied the street ahead staring down a cross lane and pointing at the sky i have an uncomfortable feeling rhafi how far to bic gonlits place next block i bet theyre looking at one of those oh yeah the crowd all made awed noises everyone pointed reminding me of crowd scenes in paintings of the imperial circus the people saluting as the emperor arrived a silvery discus that i guessed to be pretty high up in the air had appeared from behind a tile rooftop it drifted our way for a few seconds then moved back out of sight again some of the watchers complained bitterly because it hadnt come closer i supposed similar groups of gawkers could be found all over town i overheard several people claiming to have had contact with creatures who lived inside the silver disk one insisted that he had been a captive of creatures who lived inside the balls of light i had seen last night that turned into a contest who could concoct the tallest tale about the outrages done them by the silver elves the human imagination is very fertile and exceedingly grotesque did i say something about them outnumbering us i asked play you heard of those silver things coming out in the daytime before sightings had been going on for at least a month but i hadnt paid much attention theres always something weird going on in tunfaire like most of his majestys subjects if the something weird aint happening to me i dont worry about it oh sure just as often as at night as i recollect all of the earliest sightings over a year ago now came during the daytime i do remember it was one of those oneday wonders nothing happened so i forgot about it these people are getting a little thick here i grumbled i eased into playmates wake he had little trouble pushing through the crowd many of them probably recognized him he was always out here doing the charitable side of the ministry thing always something weird happening these flying things the silver elves people catching on fire and burning up up on the north side the other day news that another juvenile male mammoth had wandered in through an unwatched gate and was creating havoc also on the north side if one of blocks people was supposed to have been on duty there hed better be prepared to eat the mammoth dereliction of duty was close to a capital crime in the eyes of colonel westman block and deal relway it might behoove me to keep better track since so much of the weird stuff pulls me in eventually is something the matter mr garrett rhafi asked from behind me you jumped id thought about voluntarily creating work for myself that was what was the matter no need to share that with the kid though arent we there yet the yellow brick dump and dump it was the tenement in question easily more than a hundred years old was a hideous fourstory memorial to the disdain lavished on housing for the poor during the last century when they actually still built tenements with the idea that poor people needed housing i knew the inside perfectly before we ever passed through the doorless entry stepping over and around squatters trying not to inhale too deeply the nearest public baths would be miles away cooking smells heavy on rancid grease did help suppress the body odors somewhat every room in the structure would be overcrowded entire extended families would occupy a space at most ten feet by eight some members possibly sleeping standing up leaning on a rope certainly sleeping in shifts the majority always on the street trying to score an honest or dishonest copper when youre that poor that distinction is too fine to notice its the way of much of the world and once youve looked into a place like that tenement you tend to appreciate your own better fortune a good deal more that tenement made kayne proses situation appear considerably less awful i asked rhafi you know where he stayed here the boy shrugged upstairs i think he said the top floor oh my aching knees not exactly the digs youd expect of the bic gonlit who enjoys gourmet dining and fine wines playmate observed definitely not you think bic maybe used this place as a safe house i stepped over and past several bigeyed ragamuffins the eldest possibly four all huddling on the bottom steps of the stairs i knew the answer to my question the bic gonlit who had come to see me in search of magical boots knew nothing about the other bic the dead man would have winkled that out right away the opposite of course could not be true possibly the real bic had a relationship of some sort with the artificial bic and didnt know it puffing i asked playmate bic have any brothers or cousins only child of an only child far as i know top floor how come youre having so much trouble breathing which room rhafi rhafi didnt know rhafi wasnt bright but rhafi was cunning enough not to let himself be lured into something by someone weird unless that someone happened to be flashing coin there were eight doorways on that fourth floor the one farthest back on the right had an actual door in its frame several others had rag curtains hung up a couple had nothing and the doorway on the right next forward from the one with a real door had been boarded up so well that no entrepreneur had been able to pry the boards off and return them to the local economy i said has to be the one with the door play curious faces poked out of neighboring doorways most of them low to the floor and dirty only a couple of older people had the nerve to be nosy in tunfaire nosiness can be a deadly disease playmate said look at that a key lock he knocked there was no response looks like the one you have over at your place thats because it was made by the same crooked locksmith after having suffered dean to spend a young fortune to buy and install a lock id learned that the machine could be picked easily i knew how myself having had to develop the skill because once he got the lock installed dean used it without regard to my location in relation to my front door or whether id remembered to take my key when i went out i knocked too there was no response to my magic knuckles either i felt the door like maybe that would clue me in to what was going on behind it it wasnt hot or cold or wet so the weather was fine the door did rattle in its frame which was no surprise in that dump it was a replacement door likely to vanish as soon as some entrepreneur could get on the other side and reach its hinges i tried the knob it turned what the hell the door wasnt locked it wasnt barred or chained on the inside it creaked inward at the slightest shove with our backs to the wall either side of the doorway playmate and i exchanged looks of surprise there were whispers down the hall tenants kicking themselves for not having noticed and seized the day if you want to live alone in a place this low youd better have a pet thunder lizard or be able to leave some really nasty booby traps behind when you go out nothing with lots of teeth and bad breath came to see who was calling i produced my oaken headknocker i used it to push the door open a little wider the room behind it appeared clean and neat almost sterile its plaster was in perfect repair and had been painted gray the wooden floor had been sanded and polished overall the place appeared to be in better shape than it had been the day it first accepted a tenant there were rugs on the floor the furniture included a small table and two wooden chairs one of those sat in front of a fine cherrywood writing desk cluttered with paper and both quill and metaltipped pens there was an overstuffed chair that faced the one small window that window had real clear glass in it a little table beside the chair supported a topquality brassandglass oil lamp i whispered looks like our man does a lot of reading there were shelves beside the cherrywood desk those held at least thirty books a veritable fortune the bindings on the bound volumes suggested old and expensive and rare which almost certainly meant stolen playmate grunted this fellow isnt poor makes you wonder dont it be careful going in there whats this army telling marines how to play the game heres an idea why dont i just toss rhafi in we can wander on in after the smoke clears away i was beginning to suspect sorcery i couldnt think of any other reason for anybody to have so many books do that and youll ruin your chances forever with kayne and cassie both right now im not sure thatd bother me a whole lot play i must be getting old im taking morley seriously im losing my taste for women whore crazier than me i dropped down reached inside with my stick felt around slowly and carefully the setters of traps like to put their triplines down where youre less likely to notice them i didnt find the threads i expected which is what id have used if i was rigging a setup like this i cant find anything here play but it still dont smell right this time army didnt have any advice this time army awaited marine corps professional assessment the marine chose to use his magic wand some more there was a very small throw rug lying right inside the doorway i started to push it away to see what was underneath it i heard the sound of water falling into a vat of boiling grease then came a blinding flash of light accompanied by a baby thunderclap i flung myself sideways dragged me upward until i was sitting with my back against the wall when my vision cleared and my hearing returned i saw rhafi swatting at a smoking patch of wall across the narrow hallway a couple of tenants were yelling for water the precursors of a human stampede were taking shape i smelled the stench of burnt hair playmate told me my man youre going to have to wear a hat for a while i felt the top of my head i spoke a few syllables that my mom wouldnt have approved even on this occasion ill just have dean give me a haircut im sure he thinks im overdue anyway i got back down on my belly and poked that little rug again crackle flash clap but all much less energetic than before i slithered into bics place disturbing that little rug as i went the booby trap barely popped and that was the end of that this guy had a whole lot of time on his hands i said wed been over the place three times we hadnt found anything to help us trace kip but we knew this bic gonlit liked to read books about tunfaire and karenta modern and past and we knew he must enjoy rehabilitating rundown property because hed completely redone this room and the sealedup place next door which he reached through a doorway hed cut through the separating wall not to mention having enough spare change to afford several expensive hobbies those had to include paying someone to steal all those innocuous texts we need to interview the neighbors they arent going to say anything none of their business you just have to know how to ask play theyll sing like a herd of canaries if you happen to have some change in your hand while youre talking dont look at me all right tell me something then whos the client in this case i didnt come to you and kip am i getting my head shaved by some kind of lightning just for the exercise i dont like exercise am i short the most focused and talented girlfriend ive had in a while because id rather be out rolling around in the slums with the lowest of the lowlifes spending my own money so that theyll maybe give me a clue how to find a kid who probably shouldve been sewn into a sack with some bricks and thrown in the river ten years ago dont go getting cranky on me garrett i need some time i honestly didnt think it was going to get this complicated you didnt think youre an idealist play and like every damned idealist ive ever met you really think that things should happen and will happen because theyre the right things to happen never mind the fact that people are involved and people are the most perverse and blackheartedly uncooperative creatures the gods ever invented garrett thats enough logs on the fire im just getting going never mind youve made your point so well start talking to people out in the hall you will i didnt want anyone else getting into our quarrys rooms thered be too much temptation to make off with inexplicable trinkets there were unknown items everywhere that resembled the little oblongs and soap barsize boxes that had been left behind when kip was snatched they had foreign writing on them which in itself is a big so what in tunfaire where almost everyone speaks several languages and maybe one in ten people can even read one or more they had little colored arrows and dots i assumed they were some sort of sorcerers tools and left them alone there wasnt much else to see in the first room the second was used as a bedroom and was set up pretty much like my own with the wall where the hallway door used to be concealed behind a curtain which made a closet that contained clothing in a broader range of styles than youd find anywhere else and a rack of sixteen wigs the diversity amongst those told me our boy enjoyed going out in disguise but nothing i uncovered ever moved us one step closer to finding cypres prose i gave playmate what coins i had after a careful count dont be generous these people wont expect it what should i tell them when they ask me why we want to know dont tell them anything were collecting information not passing it out just let them see the money if somebody tells you something interesting give him a little extra if he sounds like hes making it up to impress you kick his ass and talk to somebody else ill listen in from back here rhafi wanted to know how come you want play to do all the asking on account of he looks more like a guy they can trust it was that preacher man look he cultivates i look like a guy whod send for the guard if i heard anything interesting if im not underground guard myself the simple existence of deal relways secret police gang was making life more difficult already people were paranoid about those in authority no doubt with good reason in most cases i continued to potter around the place while playmate and rhafi held court in the hallway i invested a fair amount of time examining the door lock it exhibited no scratches to indicate that it had been picked there was no damage to show that the door had been jimmied there was nothing else to make me think anything but that our man had gone out without locking his door i found that hard to credit this is tunfaire despite having heard a thousand times from country folk how they never had to lock their doors at home i couldnt believe that anyone would do it here but there was no evidence whatsoever to indicate otherwise unless the man who lived here wanted somebody to walk in and maybe get blasted i called rhafi in from the hallway is there any way you know of that bic gonlit couldve been warned that we were coming huh how could anybody know that how indeed id caught a whiff of a red herring and in less time than it takes to yell im a dope i sold myself a duffel bag full of wrong ideas lucky for me somebody came along before i invested a whole lot of time and anger in trying to figure out how kayne or cassie or somebody had gotten word over in time for a trap to be set first hint came when the fourth floor hallway suffered a case of illuminated roaches effect in less than a minute without explanation to anyone whatsoever the entire population of the ugly yellow tenement took cover in their home rooms i beckoned rhafi and playmate into bics room go hide out in the bedroom and stay quiet i pushed the door shut behind them locked it then recalled that it hadnt been locked and undid that then i nudged the little throw rug into place just behind the door we waited i wasnt yet sure what for when a whole crowd of people suddenly do something all together like a flock of birds turning and you dont get it youd better lie low and keep your eyes open that was my master plan for the moment the door handle jiggled as a key probed the lock i tensed the tenant was home was that why everybody had scattered playmates interviews hadnt achieved much but to reveal that the denizens of the tenement were scared of him though nobody had produced a concrete reason how would he respond to finding his door unlocked probably with extreme caution unless hed left it unlocked i continued to nurse a paranoid streak on that matter the door opened nobody came in right away i held my breath i was thinking that only a blind man couldve overlooked the scorching on the wall across the hallway only a man with no sense of smell would miss the stink of burnt hair but then somebody did a little hop forward over the throw rug i shoved the door shut play playmate popped out of the other room before the man finished turning toward me he considered his options and elected to do nothing immediately he was trapped in a confined space between two men much bigger than he he was just a little scrub maybe fivefootseven and skinny he was much too well dressed for the neighborhood i asked playmate you know this guy playmate shook his head rhafi how about you i seen him around i dont know him sit friend i directed hands on top of the table playmate moved the chair for the elf then positioned himself behind it mindful of what wed found in the other room i said pull his hair his hair came off and when it did bits of flesh began to peel back along the former boundary between hair and naked skin the part of the head that had been covered by the wig was hairless and pale gray i tugged at the peeling edges of the face it came off what lay beneath was a ringer for one of playmates elf sketches the gray face betrayed no more emotion than had the motionless human mask when that had been in place holy shit rhafi burst out it really is one of them things kip was always talking about i never believed him even when he got mom to say shed seen them too he was always making up stories ive seen them too playmate said so has mr garrett but never quite this close which one is this i knew it wasnt any of the ones id seen before it had more meat on it i dont know not one of kips friends though it might be the first one who came looking for them i considered the elf socalled because we didnt know what he really was the dead mans suggestion of kef sidhe halfbreeding didnt seem more likely than true elven origins maybe it hailed from the far north or from the heart of the cantard some strange beings have been coming out of that desert since the end of the war with venageta the elf seemed calm even relaxed without a concern i said a little something to playmate in the pidgin dwarfish i could manage playmate nodded he thought the elf was too confident too i told the critter i owe you one for bopping me in that alley guy but im going to try not to remember that while were talking my words had no effect in fact i got the distinct impression that the elf felt that he was in control of the situation that he was playing along just to see how much he could find out i said rhafi go into the other room and see if you can find something we can use for a bag a pillowcase for instance anything will do rhafi was back in seconds with an actual bag it was made of that silvery stuff we had found right after kip was taken i said just start throwing in all the little odds and ends and knicknacks keep your back to us when you do and stay between whatever youre bagging and our friend i wasnt quite sure why i was giving him those instructions but it sure seemed like the right thing to do and rhafi was a good boy who did exactly what he was told i told playmate kayne maybe did her best job with this one dont be fooled he whispered youre on him at a good time he can be more trouble than the other two put together i jerked my head toward our captive does this guy talk i expect so hes been getting by by pretending to be human cant manage that without saying something sometime a touch of tension seemed to have developed in the elf he wasnt pleased with rhafis activities good job rhafi i said when that bag is full i want you to take it downstairs and leave it in the street it shouldnt take more than a few minutes for the contents to disappear forever whether or not anyone could figure out any use for the trinkets i watched the elf closely so did playmate this would be the time when he would try something if he was going to do so the gray elfs strange yshaped nostril opened wide air whistled inside the nostril closed the elf s skinny little mouth began to work though no sounds came forth the elf exhaled then drew a second deep breath i got the notion hed tried something he hadnt expected to work and had been disappointed by the results the elf spoke mr garrett mr wheeler who the hell was mr wheeler oh id never known playmate by any other name except once upon a time when id told everybody his name was sweetheart just to confuse things if they decided to go looking for him playmate shook his head and pointed at rhafi three different fathers well i hadnt thought about the kids patronymic or even that kayne might have used it if she wasnt married to the man but she had been hadnt she as i recalled playmate explaining it meantime my new pseudoelven buddy was going on i believe that we may be able to help one another his karentine was flawless upperclass but more like a loud metallic whisper than a normal voice it took me a moment to realize that that was because he wasnt really using a voice more legs on the millipedal mystery every intelligent creature ive ever met had a voice even the dead man did back when he was still alive who are you i asked what are you policeman one who tracks and captures evildoers and delivers them to the justiciars do you have that concept sure only in these parts its track and catch lawbreakers not evildoers big difference here in tunfaire where are you from he ignored my question more or less the distinction perhaps is not always observed in my country either though there are those of us who refuse to bend in the wind damn i got me a grayskinned relway he continued be that as it may i have come to your country in search of two criminals they have proven extremely elusive and lately my search has been complicated by the arrival of other hunters newly alerted to approximately where these two now can be found damn wouldnt it be great to have the dead man listening in here the guys story was good so far though hard to follow because it was delivered in six or eightword puffs separated by long inhalations i was inclined to suspect that the creature normally communicated mind to mind like the dead man i asked how can we help each other you wish to recover the boy cypres prose who has been taken captive by the recently arrived masker elements i wish to capture the two villains i was sent to apprehend my superiors are growing impatient i believe i may be able to locate the boy by locating the criminals holding him i do not have the power to wrest him from the hands of his captors alone however join me in doing that then get the boy to tell us where my criminals are hidden once i have them in hand ill go away life here can return to normal thats just about good enough to gobble up even if life here is never any normaler than it is right now what do you think play are lastyr and noodiss desperate criminals i dont think theyre any danger to chodo contague based on the little i saw but they never really acted like innocent men sounds like a workable swap what are those two wanted for they are brotherhood of light their exact crimes are unknown to me i do not need to know those to do my job i said if were going to be partners were going to have to call you something besides hey you you got a name of your own he had to think about it as if unum ydnik waterborn which i cannot explain so that you would understand call me casey i heard that name recently i like the sound and it will be easier for you in words my friend winger might have used had she been around this old boy was slicker than greased owl shit he always had a good answer ready to go though i got no sense of insincerity from him i was almost certainly less sincere than he was all the time we were talking rhafi kept maneuvering back and forth trying to reach the door with his sack of plunder while trying to keep facing away from casey and keeping me or playmate in between i told him you can forget what i said rhafi i think were all going to work the same side the boy stayed behind playmate while he said kip wont give those guys up then maybe well just toss him back to the bad guys i hadnt fallen in love with cypres prose during my brief exposure to the kid i kept wondering what i was doing not just dropping the whole thing doing a favor for a friend i did owe for all those times when playmate had done really big favors for me just leave the bag on the table please casey told rhafi i will return everything to its proper place mr garrett when would you like to pursue this matter im going to take it as stipulated that youre the expert on the people holding kip how dangerous is that situation there was a time when i did a lot of work related to kidnappings and hostage holdings unless the villains belong to one of just a handful of professional gangs the victims chances are slim and they deteriorate with time by the standards of your city those scoundrels are a waste of flesh you people are more casually cruel to your own families and friends without thought than maskers can be under full force of malice the dangers enveloping cypres prose are almost entirely emotional and spiritual perils of the soul your people almost entirely discount as irrelevant at best i could buy that i didnt know what the hell he was talking about which was probably his point they arent breaking his teeth or shoving hot needles under his nails casey managed to project an aura of horror so strong that it got me thinking about some of the other feelings id experienced since hed shown up no nothing like that then if hes in no immediate physical danger im going home and getting something to eat and maybe ill take a nap and then maybe i could dash over to katies and see what i could do to patch things up hoping her father wasnt home katies father doesnt realize that she isnt twelve years old anymore and im sure playmate is worried sick about his stable down deep playmate has to know what monsters hes harboring casey shuddered he projected quietly controlled terror he knew the truth i might like this guy after all even if i didnt trust him farther than i could throw the proverbial bull mammoth i suggested why dont we all wrap up all our other business then meet at my place in the morning we can go find kip from there your morning or real morning playmate asked we need to get that established he couldnt conceal his sneer in addition to his completely selfdelusory regard for the equine race playmate is a devoted adherent of that perverse doctrine which suggests that its a good thing to be up and working ere ever the sun peeps over the horizon which goes to show just how broadminded a guy i am i still consider him a friend solar morning but no before the crack of dawn stuff moderation in all things thats my motto even in telling us what your motto is evidently playmate cracked because ive never been there to hear you state it before now after sunrise i grumped rhafi were leaving now you go out first playmate you follow casey i know youre a stranger here but youve been here a while and those books tell me youve been trying to learn your way around heres a tip dont ever leave your door unlocked again i guarantee you next time you do these people here your neighbors will steal everything but your middle name before you get down the stairs to the street i backed out of the room myself i retreated cautiously until i reached the head of the stairs needlessly casey never stuck his head out of his room that was clever garrett playmate said after we hit the street i thought so myself but knowing my luck the dead man will be sound asleep when casey shows up tomorrow playmate chuckled i stopped the parade half a block from the yellow tenement rhafi what did you take take what do you mean i didnt take i had been fishing because it seemed in character his response betrayed him i saw you i want it right now and no holding back aw playmate explained look if you make casey mad he might not help us get kip back there followed an exchange during which playmate almost lost his temper because he couldnt make the kid understand how casey could guess that he had taken anything that turned up missing rhafi hadnt gotten the brains or the looks rhafi began to look like he wanted to cry but he held it in he produced three small gray objects two dark and one light in varying shapes and sizes though none had a major dimension exceeding four inches except for colored markings on their surfaces all three items looked like they had been cast from some material that resembled ivory or bone when it hardened all three items had slightly roughened surfaces we stood in a triangle facing inward examining rhafis loot i handled everything with extreme care there was almost certainly some kind of sorcery involved with those things and i had no desire to wake it up i concealed them about my person carefully good now i have a job assignment for you rhafi i want you to stay right here and watch that yellow brick tenement see if anybody who might be our friend casey ever leaves keeping in mind that hell be wearing some kind of disguise you saw the clothes and stuff he had you want me to see where he goes as id hoped he was all excited no no dont do that i dont want you to end up like kip you just stay here till a man named saucerhead tharpe shows up youll know him by how big he is and because he has bad teeth if casey does leave make sure you can give saucerhead a good description of his disguise whatever once saucerhead shows up you go home i want you to tell your mom that we dont think kip is in any physical danger that were on the trail and that it looks like we might get them back as early as tomorrow got all that sure mr garrett excellent you make a good operative as soon as we were out of earshot playmate asked do you believe that that kips not in any real danger i think our new pal casey believes that im not sure how come but i could tell what he was feeling maybe its because of all the time i spend around the dead man then i get close to somebody who probably communicates the same way and i just kind of cue in ill ask his nibs uhm darn ive got to find somebody to watch the stable i cant keep walking away like this the horses need attention somebody has to be there to deal with customers not to mention thieves thats not a problem in my neighborhood he stated that with complete conviction i hoped his optimism wasnt misplaced you ought to get yourself a wife im reminded of an old saw about talking pots and black kettles he would be im doing something with my bachelorhood im laying in memories for those long cool years down the road look ive got to send saucerhead down to relieve rhafi saucerhead will know where to find winger i can have him tell her to come over and cover for you playmate made growlie noises he grumbled he whined winger has a million faults but her country origins qualified her to babysit a stable and shed probably do a decent job as long as she was getting paid assuming playmate had sense enough not to leave any valuables lying around winger has a real hard time resisting temptation it was the getting paid part that had been giving my large friend problems throughout this mess hed made commitments without first considering the fact that somebody would have to part with some money to see them met winger would expect to be paid saucerhead would expect to be paid garrett the professional snoop might be gouged for a favor or two but you couldnt expect him to pay his own expenses and he was out of pocket already for help from several people including mr tharpe pular singe the tracker and the generous assistance of the morley dotes glee club and bonebreaking society hell even my partner who didnt have much else to do and didnt require much upkeep might insist on some sort of compensation just so the forms of commerce were observed he can be a stickler for form and propriety sometimes i suspect he isnt aging all that well playmate said there isnt any money in this garrett you saw kayne and her kids we could always auction off a few horses theyre begging for them down at kansas and loves way i hear playmate was so aghast he couldnt even sputter from his point of view my simple mention of a slaughterhouse was so far beyond the pale that he found it impossible to believe that such words could have issued from a human mouth and i just couldnt resist needling him which is hard to understand what with all the surplus horses there ought to be these days garrett he gasped dont enough not funny man all right all right youll wake up someday and ill sing a thirtysevenverse serenade of i told you so outside your window he just shook his head ill get winger headed your way maybe we can work out a deal where well all take a percentage of the profits from kips inventions that actually began to sound like a good idea once it got away i might talk to the dead man and to max weider at the weider brewery where im on retainer next time i ran a surprise check on floor losses for him max weider has a good eye for what people might want to buy and plenty of practical knowledge about how to get them together with your product so they have an opportunity to realize just how much they cant live without it moments after playmate and i parted my head was awash in grand schemes that would make me one of tunfaires great commercial magnates the dead man was still awake and still intrigued which left me vaguely uncomfortable usually a major part of the work i do consists of getting him to wake up then getting him interested enough to participate then keeping him awake until we finish any prolonged period of selfstimulated interest and cooperation generally constitutes a harbinger of an equally prolonged period where neither cataclysm nor calamity will stir him i described my day and refused to rise to the bait when he chided me for having knocked off work so early it might be interesting to interview the mother and sister arrange to bring them around you are incorrigible sir so dont incorrige me a weakness for punning is one of the onset signatures of senility garrett i would suggest that a handsoff approach might be the safest policy with these women if indeed your characterization captures the reality i probably cant argue with you there but oh are they scrumdidlyicious to look at a status you appear to accord almost any female you encounter if she is able to stand up on her hind legs unless shes related to dean its a marvel how many homely women that family can pull together in one place the casey creature you did indeed feel that he was honest yeah well he thought he was we need to talk more about how i was sensing him if that was for real and i think it was i want to be able to use it as long as i have a good feel for what hes thinking i can keep him from putting one over on us primitives primitives he knew what i was getting at but wanted me to articulate it better so id be clearer about it in my own mind possibly primitive is the wrong word he had an aura of superiority about him it had a strong moral edge to it a selfrighteousness like dean only much more carefully concealed dean doesnt hide much he isnt concerned about getting along with anybody he knows hes right when youre right other people have to worry about getting along with you we reviewed my day again me underscoring events that had attracted my attention you see how i came to that conclusion even the criminals are too civilized to hurt somebody if theyre actually criminals intriguing it might be interesting to explore a system of thought that is indeed that alien i set it up so well all get together here in the morning he will not come i didnt think he would either but i could hope wheres the goddamn parrot in transit here as we converse the watch on the genuine bic gonlit has not been particularly productive however mr gonlit did meet with reliances people he has not given up on collecting the bounty on miss pular he did have a prolonged argument with the ratmen concerning his fee he took the not unreasonable position that he ought to be paid because what he had been hired to do was to find her which he did but now they insist that he has to get her out of this house away from you and deliver her to them mr gonlit then argued that they were destroying their own credibility by changing the terms of a contract while that contract was in force and that that could not help but come back to haunt them they would not listen they seem to have an exaggerated and irrational fear of your prowess as a street fighter i suppose it is possible that they have confused you with someone else that must be it i sure never worried anybody before now whats going on the pixies out front were acting up mr big has arrived but take your time letting him in there are watchers they do not need to know that we are aware of the bird when it is out of our sight watchers reliances people or relways both of those and possibly more more who i believe colonel block mentioned a strong interest on the hill he had hadnt he singe suddenly bustled in with a tray of food and drinks suitable for a party of ten she offered me one of her forced smiles dean is teaching me how to prepare meals tell him he has to let up on the spices a little when hes working with you you have a delicate and precious nose and hello to you too mr garrett how was your day evidently sarcasm is on the training schedule too my day was pretty much like every working day i walked a couple thousand miles i interviewed a lot of people who were either crazy or bornagain liars tomorrow ill round up some of them and go check out something that might sort out the liars from the loons i will go with you i barely got my mouth open she will go with you well thats nice of you i hope reliance isnt in too black a mood when he catches us i do not fear reliance reliance fears me singe spoke around a mouthful of roll the alreadydepleted state of the tray shed brought warned me that id better grab fast if i wanted my share what she said was at least halftrue getting pular singe back must by now be as much a fear of consequences matter as it was a bruised ego thing for reliance strongmen and even strongrats have to keep on demonstrating their strength the moment they show a hint of weakness some younger hungrier strongarm is going to reach up and pull them down i glanced at singe she waved a fried chicken wing and nodded to let me know it was some good eating then at the dead man old bones wasnt sending it out but i could sense that he was entertained he knew i was eager to run off and find katie id been rehearsing my most abject excuses and humble apologies all day long i wanted to get cleaned up and get going to take my personal life back i wondered how much singe knew i wondered if deans sudden interest in singe might not be anything but another triumph of the old mans basic decency he didnt approve of katie though youd never guess it from overhearing one of their conversations katie was too much like me and ive mentioned his attitude toward my approach to life aint none of us going to get out of it alive so we might as well get all the enjoyment out of it we can while weve got it i said i need to get cleaned up first you need to let mr big into the house he is becoming impatient i believe he is hungry in any event he is about to denounce your taste for im on my way that damned wonder buzzard was invincible somebody once upon a time said you surround yourself with the friends that you deserve i need to take some time to lean back and think about that katies dad wouldnt let me in katie was home but he refused to tell her i wanted to see her he didnt like anyone male liked anyone interested in his daughter even less and me least of all ive never been real good on any musical instrument so i couldnt get her attention with a serenade grumping i stood around in the street wondering what now i could wander over to the tate compound and see if tinnie was talking to me this week i could try a couple of other young and incredibly attractive women of my acquaintance though it was getting late of a workday evening to be turning up on anybodys doorstep or i could go somewhere and hang out with other guys like me dateless and not wanting to stay home and pay five times retail price per mug of weider beer not bought at home by the keg laziness and a long lack of the companionship of men who remembered drew me toward grubb grubers leatherneck heaven which is as fat a misnomer as the one that used to hang on morleys place back when he called it the joy house grubbs joint isnt exactly a pit of despair where lost souls go to drink in solitude perhaps in search of oblivion certainly nurturing a sad pretense that camaraderie might break out at any moment but you dont hear a whole lot of laughter in there as the evening progresses the reminiscing turns inward private and maudlin to memories that as individuals we cannot easily share and im always surprised when there isnt any of the whimpering and screaming that had so often come around in the darkest hours of the night down in the killing zone when those memories come and somebody in grubers place starts wrestling with them somebody else will hoist a mug and summon a ghost bannersergeant hamond barbidon the meanest mortarforker what ever and the cups will rise up and ten thousand ghosts will rise with them corporal savlind knaab lance fanta pantaza andro pat jellybelly ibles mags cooper and each name will remind somebody of another cooper away the best damned platoon sergeant in the corps plenty of men would be prepared to dispute that because everybody remembered a particular sergeant who brought him along the sergeants are the backbone of the corps and if you lived very long out there you grew up to become one chances are you never heard of any of the toastees because theyd fallen in different places and different times but they were corps so you honored them you remembered them and you wanted to weep because those people out there in the street didnt know didnt have any idea and already just months after the long wars end were beginning not to care sometimes it isnt that difficult to understand why the really ugly militant racist veterans organizations have so much appeal for men who survived the cantard nobody who wasnt down there will ever really understand not even those who shook our hands when we left not even those who welcomed us back with mighty hugs and no conception whatsoever what it was like to sit there watching the life bleed out of a man whose throat youd cut so you could go on undetected to murder some other poor boy whose bad luck had placed him in your path at the wrongest time possible in the entire history of the human species so that someday somewhere far away some woman would cry because she no longer had a son i decided that what i wanted was to spend an evening at grubb grubers place but apparently i never arrived eventually a moment came when i was rational enough to realize where it was that i was regaining consciousness guess who was looking down at me with an unhappy glint in his eye i croaked we godda sta dis romance morley wha da my doin here ive been hoping you could explain that to me friend the evening is just getting started ive got some swanks from the high ground down here slumming carpeting the floors with silver then you burst in obviously not part of the entertainment youre all torn up you have blood all over you you have a snarling ratman hanging on your back you crash through three tables before you collapse five minutes later im standing here watching you leak all over a molnar rug because all my customers have abandoned me and i dont have anything else to do i tried to get up my body wouldnt respond id used up my reserves talking evidently morley looked up as his man puddle entered my field of vision puddle was about eighty pounds overweight and appeared to be about as out of shape as a man could be and still stay upright he had a lot of miles on him too but looks are deceiving he was strong he was hard and he was tough and he had a lot more stamina than was credible for a man his size he was dressed as a cook he needed a shave need to shave puddle i crooned i thought about going back to sleep but i thought i probably ought to hear what puddle had to say first morley asked what did you find a long trail a broken ratman and puddles a blood boss da skink was a reglur oneman army corps i said not loud enough to be heard and the ones who were after him when he staggered in here split hauled ass outn here da second we come out a da door reliances gang you think not sure boss but diss his part a rat city tunfaire can be considered as many cities which occupy the same site in some cases this fact is acknowledged publicly but in most the pretense is strongly in the other direction no matter well get the real story when sleeping beauty over there wakes up i managed to roll my head a short way a ratman in worse shape than i found myself was sort of strewn around the floor ten feet closer to the front door being stepped over and around by people cleaning up the mess morley said sarge come give puddle a hand get garrett sitting up in a chair then well find out what happened good good because i really wanted to know a second very large man who couldve passed as puddles tattooed big brother appeared beside puddle straining for breath both men bent toward me each grabbed a hand up i floated i tried to say something what crawled out of my mouth didnt make sense even to me they dropped me into a comfortable chair at least it was comfortable under the circumstances i wasnt yet quite certain what the circumstances were i had the uncomfortable feeling that id been on the losing side in a major brawl morley said somebody bring the medical box the existence of which i noted a fact that would weigh in on the other side the next time my good friend insisted he was completely out of his former underworld life which he might want me to believe because he thought i was thick with colonel block and deal relway sarge start checking him out sarge is sarge for the obvious and traditional reason and some think for his tattoos which let the whole world know that heres a man who made something of himself in the army heres a man who was tough enough and ferocious enough to have survived years of leading men in the witchs cauldron that was in the cantard what that name and tattoos dont tell is what kind of soldier sarge was not many know sarge never brags he doesnt look the type but if he wanted he could stay drunk the rest of his life on drinks bought for him by other guys whod been to and come back from the land beyond the far walls of hell sarge was a field medic down there which means he spent more time with his neck under the blade than did most of us and during most of that time he couldnt have enjoyed the luxury of fighting back against the venageti trying to kill him because he was too damned busy trying to do something to salvage something from amongst an overabundance of freshly mutilated bodies i tried to tell sarge he was all right for a groundpounder almost an honorary marine maybe he understood some of what i was trying to say because a sudden horrible pain shot from my neck down my spine through my hips and into my legs all the way to my toenails i believe i squealed in protest hes been worked over real good sarge said but not by nobody who was able ta do whatever he wanted what hes got is da kin a wounds and bruises ya see when a whole bunch a clumsy guys gang up on somebody whats fightin back so i put up a fight good for me if id been worked over like a plowed field then how come i didnt ache in places i didnt even know i had anything broken morley asked nah hell heal damn puddle observed an here i was tinking we could finally grab us a break assuming we could a caught dis ole boy oh my stars da man his own self is awake puddle is full of it i consider him a friend even though hes always saying things like that because he doesnt just say them about me you could get the idea that he wants to drown morley and sarge in fact hes always rooting for everybody to get out of his life and leave it a whole lot less complicated morley leaned closer so what was it garrett to what do i owe the pleasure of your presence this time i croaked i don know can remember goin to katies morley gave me a dark unforgiving look hell never forgive me for having found katie first her impact on him is just as ferocious as it is on me which is hard to believe considering how i start drooling and stammering whenever she comes around me and how much more practiced and slick morley is when dealing with the obstinate sex maybe you got there puddle got it and laughed his goofy laugh sarge asked den how come dem ratmen was all over him when puddle nudged him with an elbow hard enough to loosen a lever or two somewhere inside his beansize brain oh he caught da wildcat dats pretty funny boss and maybe he didnt that cat wouldve scared those mice away so whats your game with the ratpeople garrett i couldnt remember but if ratmen did this to me there could be only one answer singe i guess reliance the old boy does seem to be getting a little fixated on that particular subject dont you think i do tink i had a strong feeling that singe was becoming a major issue inside the world of ratfolk organized crime reliance was ancient for one of his kind the upandcoming youngsters must be getting impatient i tried explaining that to morley i faded in and out a few times before he got it bet youre right garrett it isnt about singe at all not really and i think i know how to settle the whole mess and turn reliance into your best buddy while were at it sarge the rats breathing just picked up hell be ready to sing in a few minutes whatre you gonna do with stalwart assistance from puddle i was having considerable success at staying in my chair my speech was clearing up some too ill just remind belinda that a brokendown exmarine named garrett with help from his ratgirl honey and a certain suave and incredibly handsome restaurateur saved her sweet slim behind not all that long ago ill include some suggested topics for discussion with reliance and his troops like the troops should leave the general alone and the general should remember that hes indebted to you now not the other way around i don like it of course you dont youre garrett you have to do everything the hard way marshall curry help mr garrett to a seat at the table in the back corner and whichever one of you heathens has a little brandy squirreled away id like to see a dram turn up in front of my friend guys started looking for the apocryphal friend the usual uncomplimentary remarks passed between puddle and sarge i didnt think i liked the guy they were talking about very much myself we needed to track him down and spank him marshall and curry turned out to be the young thugs morley had brought along for the cypres prose chase somehow while morley was away consulting his two weightiest henchmen a beer stein brimming with spirits appeared before me the smirk on the mug of the cook who delivered it told me it had been donated involuntarily from someone elses stash probably that of faux cooks sarge and puddle i am amused by the fact that none of morleys guys share his tastes for vegetarianism and teetotaling they respected him enough not to bring their slabs of dead cow to work with them but a few cant or dont want to get by without a little nip of firewater now and again a few sips got my brain clanking along just well enough to make me wonder why i wasnt hurting as much as i ought to be those ratmen mustve tried to get some kind of drug into me and they mustve had some success i didnt feel well but i didnt feel nearly as badly as i knew i would when whatever it was wore off morley dropped into the chair opposite me showing a lot of pointy teeth his place was ready for business again and naturally customers began to drift in dotes said bring me up to date on your adventures i could talk in fits and starts now almost clearly so i did but i still couldnt tell him anything about whatd happened in the last few hours i noted that my cohort in delivering disaster the ratman had indeed been swept up and taken away some of morleys less skilled waitstaff and kitchen help were not in evidence either id say it wasnt a good evening to be a ratman foot soldier of course so far it wasnt that great an evening to be me either i wasnt seeing double from drugs or concussion anymore i was doing that from the bite of a pretty good brandy suddenly i spotted a couple of katie shavers coming in the front door dressed to stop the hearts of celibate clerics and to start those of guys whod taken up layabout duty in the morgue i gawked and muttered one for each of us morley said excuse me whats she doing here well i believe she received a message explaining that youd been badly mugged on your way over to her place so make like youve got one foot over the line and shes the only thing holding you back not to worry she aint the only thing but as long as shes here on this side im staying too hello darling katie just kind of smiled and ate me alive with her eyes which is part of what katie does so well she doesnt say much most of the time but shes great to be with when she does she has red hair an alltime crop of freckles and eyes that are a sort of grayblue slate instead of the green you might expect nor is the red hair that brilliant shade that always comes with a difficult nature conversations stopped while katie walked the length of the palms women punched or gouged their men yet for all that katie is not a great beauty though not even a madman would try to make the claim that shes the least little bit unattractive what she has most is tremendous presence and animal intensity every minute with katie is like a minute spent in a cage with a restless panther you are in bad shape she told me like she was surprised to encounter the truth her voice husked of course yet managed to sound like she was going to bust out laughing any second i tried to tell her she ought to see the other guys my mouth wouldnt form the words the effects of the drug kept coming back katie scooted a chair around beside me sat down next to me took my hand and leaned against me cure for most anything i croaked in morleys direction and all was right with the world morley nodded and drifted away after a long time purring i managed to get out words to the effect i tried to see you to apologize for getting tied up with my work but your dad wouldnt even tell you i was there thats all right i tried to see you too but dean said you were out and he wouldnt let me in to wait and never mentioned the fact that shed come around either what time was that midmorning ah i was out but she wouldnt believe that if i told her because she knows my habits if i defended dean at all shed decide that i mustve been with somebody else sometimes her mind works in nonsequential directions disdaining cause and effect we need to get those two together who dean and your father thats probably not a good idea the only thing theyd agree about is that they should keep us away from each other youre right im always right darling you need to remember that youre right they all are all the time which means that therere really tens of thousands of realities all around us happening all at the same time has to be on the face of the evidence which brings to mind a joke first told me by winger of all people and by just about everyone else i know since if a man speaks in the heart of a forest and no woman is there to hear him is he still wrong katie asked have you been drinking yes i have a little bit medicinal brandy but the reason im goofy is because the ratmen tried to drug me morley returned now accompanied by marshall and curry the whole gang dragged me upstairs and put me away in a guest room where katie did her best to keep me awake while i was suffering a threat of concussion the palms by daylight is a different world as a soft light will flatter some women so night and candlelight do wonders for morleys nightclub by day the cheap wall coverings and decorations that had upgraded the place from its former status as the joy house revealed their shabbiness the joy house hadnt been what it sounds like it used to be the same thing it was now just patronized by a different clientele lowlifes grifters and pickpockets and lowlevel professional criminals ticks on the underbelly of society the palms on the other hand caters to parasites able to afford new clothes but the upscale appurtenances have begun to show wear i sat at that same back corner table sucking down herbal tea and trying to figure out if my head hurt because of the ratmens drug the brandy id consumed or because various blunt instruments had thumped my skull in passing it was a valuable exercise in theory if i could figure it out i could shun the causes in future all id have to do is give up drinking or get a real job morley bent down to look me in the eye he couldnt restrain a smirk i grumped this place is starting to look tacky buddy maybe you ought to start setting yourself up for another format change try selling granite wine to dwarves and trolls for a while maybe those kinds of people are much too hard on the furniture the overhead would be too high you started to remember anything about what happened he knew blows to the head sometimes work that way chunks of memory from right before the trauma disappear some i was headed for grubb grubers place katies dad had just told me to get lost i hadnt seen the guys down there since before that business with the call it seemed like a good time to drop in morley offered me a thinly veiled look of despair he asked why would you want to hang around with that tribe of hasbeens because what they has been is what i has been i didnt say morley would never understand guys down at grubers know what everybody else went through not many others do and less than anyone those who stayed home to comfort the lonely soldiers wives some of us dont need to go in there as often as others because i learn more from them about whats going on around town than i can anywhere else none of those guys feels like hes got anything to hide or anything to hold back ouch how the bee doth sting i asked did you perchance send word out about what happened i was supposed to meet some people this morning i informed your partner at his request i passed the word along to playmate too morley grinned he had a huge row with winger about whether or not she ought to get paid until he decided he had to relay the news to someone else morley seemed more curious than i found comfortable naturally suspicious i examined that from a couple of angles while also wondering if it wasnt natural to want to know what was going on when you were involved hell i wanted to know what was going on myself some of morleys guys were sweeping mopping otherwise halfheartedly getting ready for the coming evenings business of a sudden with no perceptible change in attitude or speed they all headed for the kitchen in moments the place was empty except for myself and the owner and the owner no longer looked happy i muttered maybe i should head for the kitchen too because i had a feeling i wasnt going to like what was about to happen imminence became actuality the approaching coach the rattle of which had cued the troops to vanish wasnt approaching anymore it had arrived morley said i do wish shed take a little less of a personal interest in her business its your fault you know nobody ever sees her till your name comes up two thugs pushed into the palms once they stepped out of the bright sunlight they looked like miniature trolls ugly and hard as jasper i dont know where they find them maybe theres a mine where they dig them up one held the door for belinda contague despite being who and what she is belinda persists in dressing herself as the slut of doom the vampire whore in black she wore black today but with the light behind her not much of her shape remained a mystery that ended when the door closed her dress was black and unusual but not particularly revealing without the backlighting she said something to her henchmen both nodded one went back outside the other assumed a relaxed stance watching morley and me belinda approached perfectly aware of the impact she had because she worked hard at creating it she was tall with a shape wellfavored by nature she had a particularly attractive face which unfortunately she insisted on covering with makeup as pale as paper her lips were painted bright red and slightly exaggerated by the color we have been lovers we might be again if she really insists very few things frighten me belinda contague is one of them belinda isnt sane but she has her madness under control and uses it as a weapon she is deadlier and scarier than her father ever was because shes so much more unpredictable she bent and kissed me on the cheek lingering in case i cared to turn for something with a little more bite i had to fight it belinda has her positive attributes she sensed my temptation and was satisfied she dropped into the seat beside me the one katie had occupied just last night luckily katie had gone home sometimes its a curse being a redblooded karentine boy especially when the redblooded karentine girls wont leave you alone i asked howd you get here so fast i did know that morley had sent her a message about the reliance situation i was in town already there was a matter i had to see to personally im making arrangements for my fathers birthday this one is the big sixzero i want to give him a party ill want you guys to be there i wouldnt be around if it wasnt for you morley and i exchanged the looks of men suddenly and unexpectedly condemned belinda said tell me about your problem with reliance i did so whys this pular singe so important to you shes my friend do you make her squeal shes just a friend belinda im just a friend but youve made me squeal a few times it isnt like that belinda ive also helped you out a few times because youre a friend she showed me some teeth and a flash of tongue she was pleased with herself i owe you for crask and sadler so ill send out word the way you suggested thatll set you up and itll close out my debt to him for his part in saving me from those two you all over that now you all right shed been tortured and brutalized during the incident shed mentioned back to my old self able to best a marine two falls out of three know where i could find a marine who wants to wrestle youre turning into a forward little sweetmeat morley made a face but kept his groan to himself sometimes youve got to be direct when all anyone does is worry about whether youre planning to cut their throat im no black widow garrett so she said i had no trouble picturing her with a scarlet hourglass on the front of that dress accentuating her alreadyenticing shape she had no reputation for that sort of thing but there was ample precedent in her own fathers treatment of her mother i dont think you are what i wish you werent is somebody who twists my head into knots every time i see you because that really gets in the way when i try to do business with you she leaned against me poor baby morley sat there in absolute silence showing no inclination to draw attention to himself he had no personal relationship with belinda to help shield him from her unpredictable wrath he preferred by far to do business at a grand remove belinda told me tell me a little more about this case youre working so i did i could see no way that it would hurt and there was always a chance shed get a wild hair and do something that would help how does that tie in with your rat girlfriend it doesnt far as i can see ill look around in tunfaire its far harder to hide from the outfit than it is to hide from me or colonel block the outfit commands far vaster resources this have anything to do with all those flying lights everybodys been seeing she asked it might i conceded grudgingly not really having considered the possibility before there was no evidence to suggest it belinda popped up in a bright good mood suddenly her mercurial mood swings are another thing that makes her a scary thing shes much more changeable than most women she planted another kiss this time at the corner of my mouth give my best to tinnie were on the outs this week alyx then nothing going on there either theres hope for me yet ill definitely want you to come to daddys party out the door she went bouncing like shed shed a decade of life and a century of conscience morley exhaled like hed been holding his breath the whole time you know what that means belinda having a party for the kingpin yes hes not going to be sixty not yet and i think his birthday really isnt for a couple of months yet either it means shes confident enough of her hold on the outfit to roll chodo out and let everybody see what his condition really is the purported overlord of organized crime in tunfaire is a stroke victim alive still but a complete vegetable belinda has been hiding that fact and ruling in his name for some time now questions have arisen but the combination of chodos past propensity for bizarre behavior a little truth and belindas utterly ferocious ruthless suppression of challengers have kept the kingpin position safely a contague prerogative morley said therere some old underbosses wholl revolt they wont take orders from a woman no matter who she is i sighed too chances were good belinda knew that better than we did chances were good that belinda was ready to retire those old boys and might do it at this marvellous party i could figure that but they couldnt because they didnt know what i knew about chodo how many times have you saved her life morley asked several right uhm hed been there a few times i think shes gotten superstitious about you i think shes decided youre her guardian angel that no matter how bad it gets if shes in trouble good old garrett will bail her out thats not true but she believes it which means you dont really have anything to fear from her except for her expectations a sly look flicked across morleys features you think she bought your story about singe it took me a moment to get it you butthead i said i was afraid of something like this another woman had just stamped into the palms she headed toward me and morley elbowing morleys men aside winger definitely survives more by luck than by any good sense winger morleys greeting was less than enthusiastic i suspect hed had a bad personal experience there once upon a time which would teach him to pay attention to his own rule about not getting involved with women whore crazier than he is the very one she retorted winger is a big old gal more than six feet tall and solidly built though shes actually quite attractive when she bothers to clean herself up if she was a foot shorter and knew how to simper shed be breaking hearts wholesale just by looking the wrong way hey garrett she roared what the hell are you doing sitting on your ass in this nancy dump you was supposed to you dont listen too well do you word went out that i got the snot beat out of me last night to you too the man who told you is standing right over there meantime ive got bruises on my bruises im stiff all over yeah how bout where it counts didnt think so youre another one thats just all talk she glared at morley get up and walk it off winger is something like a thunderstorm and something like a female saucerhead except with better teeth and shes a lot more stubborn than tharpe it may take saucerhead a while to work something out but hell change his mind winger has never been wrong in her life unless it was that time she thought she was wrong but it turned out that she wasnt big blond meaty goofy completely dangerous where your valuables are concerned shes likely to be part of or taken in by the most outrageous scams imaginable and yet shes one of my friends one of the inner circle one of those whod take steps if something happened to me and ive never figured out why we like each other come on garrett get up off that fat ass dont you figure you done left saucerhead twisting in the wind about long enough i did think that but saucerhead was getting paid and he too had been told of my misfortune i asked wheres playmate youre supposed to be covering for playmate oh he went off somewhere this morning before your messenger came when i got bored i decided i sighed morley shook his head what i said im sure youve heard the word responsibility a few times you have any idea what it means chances were she did but just didnt care what winger demanded again if you came over here because youre bored whos minding playmates stable so the other crooks dont walk off with everything in sight it was really stupid of us to have left all of kips inventions unguarded but the gods of fools had been with us word had come that playmate hadnt suffered any losses he had wonderful neighbors whos getting paid to make sure that doesnt happen other crooks what do you mean other crooks wiseass look im actually here because im kind of worried about play i thought he was going off to meet you i figured hed come back when he heard you wimped out on account of you got a couple of bruises and a scrape i said well ive had all the fun here that i can take im going home it took me nearly a minute to get out of my chair then i couldnt stand up straight guess ill have to look on the bright side i looked left i looked right so where the hell is it winger for heavens sake go take care of that damned stable i had visions of footpads absconding with my own personal threewheel and dont give me any of that crap about im picking on you because youre a woman im picking on you because somebody hired you to do a job and youre just letting it slide again gods somebody get this man a drink hes gone totally cranky singe and dean both awaited me on the stoop the old man came down the steps to help me make the climb winger had been right a little exercise had loosened me up but hardly enough i still moved like somebody twice my age suffering from rheumatism id begun to worry that the ratmen might have done me some internal damage once id eaten and downed a quart of deans medicinal tea though i no longer felt like we needed to send for a witch doctor with singes help dean moved a padded chair from the small front room into the dead mans room i occupied it prepared to discuss business instead i went to sleep i stayed that way a long time when i awakened dean was there with more food and fresh tea singe fluttered about nervously we find ourselves facing a disquieting development mr playmate has disappeared no i didnt want to hear that i dont like losing a client that means i have to work three times as hard usually for no pay miss winger sent word to the effect that he has not yet surfaced i took the liberty of sending dean to mr dotes with an appeal that he send a few men to support miss winger this would seem an opportune time for raiders to try scooping up cypres proses inventions it would wouldnt it and its mrs winger shes got a husband and a couple of kids she abandoned somewhere out in the country the good news is an hour ago a messenger delivered a letter from reliance it was a bit formal stiff and strained but he renounced all further interest in miss pular hear that singe you can go outside without worrying about the bad guys reliance cannot and does not guarantee the good behavior of all ratmen garrett call it a weasel clause if you like but he did advise us that he is not able to control the actions of some of the younger ratmen he denounced a certain john stretch in particular to be expected i guess were still better off than we were i cant imagine too many of those youngsters being crazy enough to want to get the outfit after their tails the young often cannot connect cause and effect garrett you see stupid behavior on the street every day it will take only one fool who believes he can outwit reliance and the outfit to ruin miss pulars prospects im pretty sure miss pular is bright enough to outwit any of her kind who might be stupid enough to come after her indeed singe preened but she will have to remain alert and ready for trouble for some time to come until the rat tribes acclimate themselves to the new situation reliances letter is there before you i asked dean to leave it when he finished reading it to me his mention of the letter was a hint that i should read it i did so wondering who had written it id never heard of a ratman who could read or write id say this is less than a total victory for singe that is correct singe asked what is wrong the way reliance states this he isnt just giving up his claims on you hes telling us you dont have any more claims on the community of the ratpeople he wont let you singe thought for a while then please explain more in case i do not understand correctly hes exiled you from your people you know exile she nodded hes basically saying that since you wont play by his rules he isnt going to let you have anything to do with your own people i guess youll have to decide if thats a price youre willing to pay i have decided already are you reliance does not have much longer and while he does last he cannot be everywhere keeping me from making contacts i might want he is too old and too slow and an enforced exile will compel me to learn my way around the rest of the city more quickly wow i said yes perhaps you should marry her after all in five years you might be a king old bones let singe in on the part where he showed that he was impressed the rest he sent only to me one of his poor excuses for a joke garrett miss pular you will have to pick up mr playmates trail at his stable track him to wherever his hidden demons have taken him you might search the boys workshop it is conceivable that mr playmate found something there that led him to believe he could find the boy on his own actually a notion that had occurred to me when first id heard that he was still missing i said excellent thinking old bones i see only one problem with the scheme im so beatup i can hardly move at my best speed today i can grow a footlong beard faster than i can make it to the river a difficulty anticipated and overcome in my communications with mr dotes i arranged for you to be transported wherever miss pulars nose leads her whos going to pay for all of this weve got saucerhead out there somewhere getting gray weve got singe and winger working weve got who knows how many of morleys gang backing up winger wheres the money coming from kayne prose dont have a pot to pee in her kids dont seem to be producing playmate isnt much better off than kayne anytime he gets two extra coppers to rub together he gives one of them away you are going to pay for it as an advance cut out of your share of that lake of gold you see yourself tapping in the future what are you digging around in my head again there was entirely too much of that stuff going on around here lately the outbreak of warfare amongst the pixies prevented me from going off on a rant the goddamn parrot wanted a part of this action he started hooting and hollering and cursing the pixies i believe your help has arrived somebody knocked on the door with a battering ram plaster dust fell all over the house the pounding didnt stop dean came roaring out of the kitchen armed with a cleaver ready to offer somebody some advanced training in etiquette he beat me to the door he was in such an evil temper that he opened the door without first using the peephole gah who wouldve thought a man that old could jump that far and backward at that while inscribing sagas on the air with the edge of his lightning cleaver i caught him hey maybe you want to settle down before you damage the woodwork it cant be all that bad im all right dean insisted right away they just caught me by surprise an odor wafted in through the open doorway like the southern extremity of a northbound skunk or more likely the last thing you smell when you meet up with one of the big flesheating thunder lizards out in the woods it was bad breath on an epic scale i hadnt encountered it in a long time but i knew it of old its provenance was just coming back to me when i got up to the door and leaned out just in time to get the full benefit of the exhalations of a pair of humongous creatures whod bent down to peer into my house these boys both fell out of the ugly tree at a young age hitting every damned branch on the way down then their mommas whupped them with an ugly stick and fed them ugly soup every day of their lives they were uhglee with a couple of capital doubleugs doris marsha howre you fellas doing doris and marsha rose were two of three brothers who insisted they were triplets born of different mothers doris and marsha have a greenish cast and stand twenty feet tall they have teeth that stick out all which way one is crosseyed and one is walleyed but i cant keep that straight sometimes they trade off theyre grolls a seldomseen result of what can happen when giants and trolls fall in love doris and marsha arent very bright but they dont have to be theyre so big hardly anything else matters were all doing marvellously actually a small voice piped of course the grolls seldom went anywhere without the third triplet dojango who being a halfwit was the brains of the family dojango rose isnt much over five feet tall well taller than bic gonlit so maybe hes five and a half hes indistinguishable from a thousand other weaseleyed furtive little grifters on the streets of tunfaire hed have no trouble passing for human if he wanted though he cant be more than oneeighth human in reality in some fashion hes distantly related to morley dotes morley tosses snippets of work his way when finesse and a low profile arent critical components in the grand scheme i descended the front steps amidst booming greetings from the larger brethren and the worst carryingon by the pixies since their own arrival i barely noticed already their hellraising was becoming a commonplace part of the background noise of the city seldom is tunfaire completely quiet dojango rose had himself in harness between the shafts of kip proses twowheeler manhauling cart he grinned bet thiss something you never thought youd see actually actually you really think you can haul that thing around town with somebody in it dojango seemed to have gone a few rounds with consumption since last id seen him he looked lucky to be able to shift himself based on prior experience chances were good he had his brothers carrying him most of the time i am kind of counting on my brothers to help actually rose admitted but theres more to me than you think actually actually dojango rose had some annoying verbal tics there just about has to be hey knock it off let her go doris unpinched thumb and forefinger a pixie buzzed away in dazed staggering flight amazing some people will respond automatically to any loud commanding voice ah garrett i was just i know what you was just i climbed into the cart every muscle arguing back save it for the villains were liable to run into some godsdammit there i was in the street about a thousand steps downhill from my front door and i hadnt brought anything out with me dean and singe materialized each with arms filled they clattered down the steps singe dumped her load into my lap that consisted of enough instruments of mayhem for me to start up my own small army singe and dean stayed busy around the back of the cart for a while with trips into the house and outside again then the old man headed back up the steps eventually singe came up beside me we are ready to travel she tossed dean a cheerful wave dean returned the gesture she had outstubborned him and overcome his prejudice by force of personality singe was indeed a wonder girl what were you doing back there storing provisions you do not plan your travels properly especially in the area of food so dean and i fixed us something to take along while i was digesting that dojango suddenly called out where to boss there were subtle signs that some parts of playmates place had been searched i asked winger has anybody been in here since you took over since playmate wandered off no youre sure absolutely she was irked i was daring to question her faithfulness to her commission i didnt think so so you have to quit going through playmates stuff while she sputtered i took a lamp into kips workshop at first glance the only change there was the absence of the cart id ridden over here behind one or another of the grolls mostly as id anticipated three blocks from my house dojango was already trying to mooch a ride with doris or marsha pulling the cart though there were problems problems which sprang from their size neither could fit between the carts long shafts so whichever one was on the job dragged the cart along onehanded the ride became a series of wild jerks as the groll swung his arms then there was the problem of height the grolls hands were eight feet off the ground when they stood up straight when they pulled the cart i ended up lying on my back but we had arrived at playmates stable marsha had volunteered to carry me around in his arms when he saw how much trouble i had levering my stiff old bones out of the cart id take you up on it too i told him except for the fact that youre too tall to go anywhere inside here that was one big problem with being those two guys hardly any structure in tunfaire was tall enough to accommodate them so i limped a lot and leaned on things i was crabby i snarled at people for no good reason and i didnt find a single clue as to where playmate had gone but i did have singe shed located playmates newest track and was ready to move out on it long before i finished my rounds of playmates digs i swore there had to be something incriminating somewhere something to tie him into the evil equine empire i kept returning to kips workshop convinced that there was something i was overlooking there was nothing missing and nothing wrong there but something deep inside me kept telling me to watch out for something i never did figure out what it was but i trusted my hunch i told morleys associates to keep a close eye on kips junk something here has something to do with whats going on i dont know what it is yet so i dont want you to let anybody in dont let anybody touch anything and in particular dont let winger touch anything but otherwise consider her to be in charge i gave winger a big grin and a glimpse of the old raised eyebrow trick winger gave me the finger promises promises that earned me a matched set of flying fingers singe was having trouble concentrating dojango kept distracting her he wouldnt shut up which was a habit of his that id forgotten kind of the way you forget how much a broken bone hurts until the next time you bust one i explained on three separate occasions how difficult it was for singe to follow a trace as old as playmates to explain that she had to concentrate all her attention on the task at hand oh yeah oh yeah i understand garrett actually and thirty seconds later it would be thiss just like the time me and doris and marsha was running the bag for eddie the gimp actually if we wasnt right on top of what we was doing every second i sent a look of appeal up toward doris whose turn it was to walk beside the cart but it was too dark out for him to notice so i asked doris how the hell do i get your little brother to shut up huh i got ready to groan i dont know i just shut him out is he running off at the mouth again still i cant get him to stay quiet for twenty seconds straight hes driving me crazy and hes making it impossible for singe to keep her mind on her work i suffered a moment of inspiration if we dont pull this thing off if we dont find this guy we blow the job which means that none of us will get paid dojango shut the fuck up you even cough im gonna slug you doris waved a fist about the size of a bulls head in his brothers face where we gonna put him when i do garrett cause im guaranteed gonna gotta do it on account of he cant even keep his mouth shut when hes asleep he managed to shut up when he had to that time we all went to the cantard yeah but like they say long ago and far away and times change they do indeed id just gotten more words out of one of the grolls than id heard before in all the years id known them dojango couldnt help observing actually it aint really polite to be talking about somebody like they aint even there when you bop doriss blow was almost casual dojango rocked and wilted his brother scooped him up and carried him like a baby i asked wasnt that a little harsh he ought to be getting used to it garrett actually doris grinned broadly moonlight glistened off his snaggle teeth this aint the first time his mouth has caused us some trouble amen brother marsha said from up front we gotta love the guy on account of hes family but sometimes if it wasnt for his connection with cousin morley guys we all have relatives like that ive got a greatuncle medford that somebody shouldve poisoned a hundred years ago singe stopped you are quite right about medford shale garrett greatuncle medford had figured prominently in the case where id first made singes acquaintance just as you were right about me needing no distractions if i am to follow this trail perhaps i can have doris knock you out then have marsha knock doris out then pray that a building collapses on marsha or we could all take a hint and save the chatter till later you could do that but i am willing to bet that none of you are able was it mama garretts boy whod said that this ratgirl desperately needed some selfconfidence she sure didnt lack for it in this crowd ten minutes later i called singe i know where were going we were headed for the prose homestead maybe playmates luck had changed or from his point of view maybe he had given in to temptation were headed for the boys mothers flat all right if you think so if you want to go there and wait for me go ahead i would prefer to stick to the trail that will reveal if there were other stops he made along the way a gentle admonition from the expert i decided to heed it the girl had a point suppose playmate was headed for kayne proses place but never made it there he did make it but hed gone away again singe explained that to me before i ever went upstairs and found a very frightened cassie doap holed up behind a barricaded door refusing to open up for anybody cassie come on thiss garrett the man playmate hired to find your brother kip now playmates disappeared and im trying to track him down too i hoped he turned up soon my body was doing a lot of aching he came here about i looked at singe whispered how long ago this morning he came here this morning why was that where did he go from here cassie kept telling us to go away she was terrified but singe could detect no odors that would justify such a strong response and none of the neighbors showed any curiosity which suggested that great dramas by cassie doap were not at all uncommon i recalled rhafi telling me that cassie was an actress she put on characters like clothing maybe she was overacting now i wished i had one of my human lady friends along particularly tinnie tate of the shoemaking tates that professional redhead would know how to manage a mere blonde tinnie was an accomplished actress herself at least where the manipulation of guys named garrett was concerned singe did make a few calming remarks loudly enough to be heard through the door while i tried to talk cassie out of her hysteria singes comments were kind of childish but they had their effect at some point cassie decided to open the door a crack to see who was out there in the hallway with me i dont know why my having a ratgirl along shouldve been reassuring but it was enough so that cassie decided shed talk to us she asked what do you want to know mr garrett my heart broke that delectable young woman had called me mister i was nothing but a mister i wasnt on her list of prospects its a cruel world indeed probably just as well though cassie was the kind of woman mom warned me against one goofier than me wheres playmate cassie i dont know he went to find my mom all right that made sense maybe to her she was definitely afraid for real she had referred to her mother as mom shed always called her kayne before and why did he do that cassie was she in trouble i dont know she went to find rhafi when he didnt come home then she didnt come home so i went and got playmate and he decided to go looking for both of them without bothering to inform me or even winger who hadnt mentioned cassie which probably meant that winger wasnt paying attention to what she was supposed to be doing just as an aside did you see a tall blond woman at playmates stable no is that important probably not all right lets go back rhafi disappeared whats the story on that that man you had watching bic gonlit rhafi was hanging around with him covering for him when he had to go off like that then rhafi just disappeared while that man was away getting them something to eat he told us when kayne and me went to find rhafi on account of rhafi was supposed to start a new job today its getting really hard to find somebody wholl give him a chance anymore kayne really didnt want him to screw it up this time now that shed decided to trust me cassie gushed getting rid of the fear and the tension through a flood of words she didnt really have much to say except that rhafi had disappeared then kayne had gone looking for him while sending her to tell playmate then playmate had gone after kayne and he hadnt been seen since and now cassie was firmly convinced that the forces of darkness would come for her soon you get back inside and barricade your door again ill take care of it i hoped id done somewhat less than take care of things on several occasions lately you still have a trail i asked singe yes getting better than it was i grunted i didnt try to shortcut this time though i expected the track to lead us straight to saucerhead which it did more or less though tharpe wasnt at his post i didnt even ask i just left singe to work her wonders it is not entirely clear but it seems that mr tharpe accompanied mr playmate or he followed him within a very short time and they went over to that ugly yellow building right they were headed in that direction when they left here that was singe making no assumptions can you detect any other odors here that you mightve noticed in that place we just visited that blond woman was here earlier today and maybe others who left traces in that building the odors are very faint but theres nothing to contradict the story cassie told us you do not trust her ive found that its best to trust no one completely when im working a case nobody is ever completely honest with me truly truly nobody wants to admit that theyre desperate but they are or they wouldnt come to me in the first place they almost never do until things are out of hand but thats human nature you dont want people to know you cant manage your life youre afraid to look weak we walked while singe and i talked i was moving more freely now but i still hurt doris and marsha were doing a wonderful job of keeping their mouths shut dojango was still napping he was in the cart i had everybody wait in front of the ugly yellow structure while i gave it a careful onceover from outside the grolls attracted attention wherever they went of course but they knew how to discourage gawkers a growl and a wave of the club each carried more as decoration than as armament were enough to discourage most people for a while i wondered if they would use their clubs if pressed theyd employed them during our visit to the cantard but they hadnt really wanted to they were actually gentle people the rose triplets though the two big ones did get a kick out of panicking people once in a while it seemed to me that it might be useful to know what was happening inside caseys place before i went storming upstairs doris i need you to hoist me up so i can peek through a window only there wasnt any window i stared at the blank brick tried to visualize the inside of the tenement to see if id gotten turned around i hadnt so how had i misplaced a window made of glass i had doris put me down then i worked my way around the ugly structure it did have a few unglazed windows but very few indicating that it had been erected during the last attempt at establishing a window tax with the minimum legal number of openings none of the existing windows were on the fourth floor what the hell which was what the place had to be in summer how high can you count i asked doris garrett i dont think questions like that are polite youre probably right but i suspect that i dont much care heres what i want six minutes after i go in the front door you take your club and knock a hole through the bricks right up there where i was feeling the wall dont be shy about it haul off and pound a hole right through and then what when they come to arrest me go down fighting i dont think so hey youre a bigtime bullshitter garrett but you aint bigtime enough to bullshit me out of knocking somebodys building down all right all right the recent outbreak of law and order was getting to be a real pain so dont bust a hole through the wall just thump on it hard enough to distract whoevers on the other side better give me eight minutes to get up there though thats a lot of stairs doris grunted shuffled over to his brother they muttered at one another not pleased because whatever happened here would do so in front of witnesses the grolls were beginning to attract gawkers who wouldnt run from a growl and a brandished club mostly they were youngsters who shouldve been asleep but adults would gather too if it became obvious that the grolls would have some entertainment value singe you come with me i headed for the entrance to the tenement that was filled with spectators who wanted to know what was going on were hunting for kagyars i told them which dumbfounded everyone the people of tunfaire and karenta arent much interested in their own history my remark wouldve melted their spines half a millennium earlier the empire was still in place then but was suffering a swift decline because it was being choked to death by fanatic members of the orthodox rite the kagyars had been members of a gentle nonviolent heretical cult whose beliefs mustve terrified the hierarchy of the established religion they invested all their energies and all the treasure of the state in a hundredyear campaign to exterminate the kagyar heresy all that horror and cruelty and evil and today not one karentine in a thousand can tell you what a kagyar was possibly not even one in ten thousand what will you do singe asked knock on the door and see if anybody answers whack them over the head if they do i brandished my headknocker there was no peephole in caseys door so he would have to open up in order to respond i knocked singe looked around nervously and sniffed she said its hard to tell but i think they may have gone back downstairs again i knocked some more playmate rhafi and i did come up and go down before still no answer to my knock the building shuddered doris was on the job something fell behind the door i did a fast picklock job between club strokes get back against the wall i told singe squeeze your eyes tight shut i pushed the door inward knelt tripped the rug booby trap i got the same crackle pop and flash i avoided problems with my hair this time but did get the fuzz crisped off the outside of my forearm casey mustve adjusted the aim of his sorcerous implement a glance across the hallway assured me that was true the wall was smoking at a site two feet removed from the previous and the crisped area was significantly larger i began to suspect that casey might not plan to honor our new alliance and i began to reflect on the fact that this particular silver elf wasnt as reluctant as the others to resort to violence dont expose yourself yet i told singe this things going to pop a couple more times second try wasnt a charm as before the fury of the sorcery was considerably lessened but its aim had shifted since the first flash i lost most of my stick and got a mild case of roasted knuckles the lead from the end of my stick was still liquid when i peeked we were collecting witnesses now the older ones probably thinking about launching a raid as soon as the dangerous people got out of the way doris kept whapping the outside wall that was sure to attract attention out there police attention eventually i told singe we probably wont have much more time but haste could be painful or even lethal i got down on the floor and slid my arm in to trip the third flash it was more feeble than the last time id done this though plenty bright enough to have me seeing spots then i recalled casey having just hopped over the trigger carpet better safe than sorry i hopped there were no changes in the room behind the door casey had returned his possessions to their appointed places every item in the place looked precisely positioned i had a suspicion that deal relways place would be very much like this i looked at the window that wasnt there on the outside of the building the view it presented was impossible what it should have shown was the wall of the building next door instead i found myself looking down into the street out front interesting something thumped behind the closed curtain of caseys bedroom come in and close the door i told singe keep an eye on this window look for anybody who might belong to the guard or who just gives you the feeling that they might be trouble i yanked the curtain aside and said well hello id found some of my missing people rhafi and his mother kayne was unconscious so was rhafi but he was restless neither had a stitch on rhafis clothing lay on the floor as though discarded by someone undressing in a hurry nowhere could i find anything that looked like it might have come off kayne i tried not to get distracted by the still life hey singe you think you could track somebodys clothes if somebody else was wearing them she stepped over where she could see what i saw my she kept looking back and forth between the window and the naked people well and can you wake them up i was trying to do that already i wasnt having any luck i tried to avoid any expression as singe took her opportunity to inform herself of the nature of human bodies would you consider the female attractive she asked with any other woman i know id have to consider that a trick or loaded question singe i guessed actually wanted to know yes she is especially considering her age and the fact that shes borne three children singe becomes horrified whenever she contemplates the size of human babies her people have babies in litters of up to eight the aggregate weight usually being less than that of one human newborn and the male is he attractive not to me but thats partly because i know him he could be attractive to some women nature appeared to have blessed rhafi in one respect i returned to my question could you track the womans clothing i think our villain mightve used it to disguise himself singe eyed rhafi dubiously looked at me in mild alarm then shifted her attention to the window she thought i kept trying to waken kayne and her son it became obvious that they were under some kind of enchantment that i couldnt penetrate after several minutes of silence singe told me i can follow the horses again meaning following the clothing would be extremely difficult but i will have no trouble following mr playmate and mr tharpe who would have been with or who would have been following what they believed to be this woman she eyed rhafi again growing more uneasy with what she saw i opened my mouth to ask a question then realized that id been outreasoned by a ratgirl a ratgirl who had other things on her mind rhafi was getting more of her eye time than that window was casey had spun the tables on me he needed help to get to kip hed told me so but he didnt want to be anybodys partner so he became kayne prose and lured playmate and saucerhead into going where he wanted where they would doubtless fight like lions to defend the lovely kayne from the villainous silver elves garrett somethings happening dopey me i glanced at rhafi first figuring maybe he was having a happy dream but nothing to startle singe was happening there what the window it keeps showing different things i stepped over she was right it kept alternating between four different live scenes did you touch it did you do anything no i was over here looking at i never thought they were so big i was picking at the colored spots on this strange gray stone she shoved a paw at me her whiskers were way back but she just had to take another look at rhafi i took the stone a number of not dissimilar items were scattered around the room but not nearly so many as there had been during my previous visit which suggested that casey might have taken some with him those elves wed chased whod knocked me out over and over had used some small fetish or amulet or whatnot to do so maybe all those things were different magical devices which got me thinking we had a small collection back at the house from that last place where kips kidnappers knocked us down plus those id taken away from rhafi should they stay there dangerously near my partner when we didnt know their capabilities might it not be more useful to surrender them to colonel block that might earn me some obligation points and might even be a service to the crown if these silver elves actually were a sorcerous threat from foreign lands singe made a squealing sound that might have been surprise fright dismay or all three together i glanced into the other room i asked singe the same question did you touch it did you do anything singe backed out of the room but couldnt stop staring until i closed the curtain i chuckled but didnt pursue the subject i did suspect that in future shed be less inclined toward romantic experimentation i thought it might be a good idea to gather up everything of potential interest to the people block represented because minutes after singe and i left it caseys place was going to get picked clearf garrett uhm you said tell you if i saw anything interesting you found rhafi interesting did you not that her tone put me in my place for my having my mind in the gutter in the window i saw what she meant when the view of the street out front came up three silver elves had taken station across the way they werent out in traffic but even so youd think people dressed that weird would attract some notice that they attracted none whatsoever told me that some sort of enchantment concealed them from passersby but couldnt fool the windows eye a hint of a flicker of afterimage indicated that they were pretending to be women women who didnt know their ways around one stared at something in her hand as she swung her partially extended arm right and left we did something to attract caseys enemies i said and they got here fast but they still dont quite know where to find him wed better get out of here while we can i squinted at the window when the street view came back up did those elves really have waists and breasts that was a fine crop of nubbins to be sure but damned if it didnt look like something was there putting a little appeal into those elegant silver lines the silver elves werent visible anywhere when singe and i reached the street i felt them vaguely though in the back of my mind can you smell anything something cold like what i smelled when we were tracking that boy but not quitethe same i think thats because thiss a different bunch of elves we have some kind of pyramid here theres one guy casey whos hunting two guys lastyr and noodiss because theyre wanted for unspecified crimes then we have these three elves evidently all female in times past they raided playmates stable and the prose flat trying to lay hands on kip then we have the four who actually did capture kip unless casey was lying and his lips werent moving at the time on account of he doesnt have any these people are all involved in criminal enterprises of some sort we were moving away from the ugly yellow structure singe picking the way me limping along in her wake lugging a sack filled with trinkets rescued from caseys digs i nodded to doris and marsha as i passed i felt the invisible elves start moving behind me singe observed reliance is involved in criminal enterprises but a lot of his activities dont appear to be morally questionable though she hadnt stated it perfectly i was proud that singe could reason to that level true the law isnt always about whats right or wrong a lot of times its about somebody being guaranteed an advantage over somebody else and thats human nature thats the nature of any sentient species i think damn those invisible people really are moving back there i get the feeling that theyre crossing to caseys place i hoped that was what they were doing rather than falling in behind us they were sure to walk in on some excitement if they went upstairs i hoped theyd find caseys place crawling with scavengers and voyeurs i said i think it might be a good idea if we checked back to see how rhafi and kayne are doing later those two could end up in deep trouble if that sleep spell didnt wear off shush i need to concentrate so now it was me who was the distraction the triplets werent because they were keeping their distance pretending they werent with me good on whichever one of them thought of that but i needed to toss my swag bag into the cart with dojango i wasnt about to carry it forever my aches and pains had receded somewhat but they continued to hamper me i limped and gimped and had no sense of humor at all i couldnt even work myself into a state of amusement over singes recent discombobulation and that was pretty damned funny it could become a classic after a few retellings polished it up when our path took us around a corner thus taking us out of sight of any eyes tagging along behind i halted i didnt move until doris and marsha appeared i tossed my swag bag into dojangos lap the results were satisfactory roses enthusiastic barking demonstrated that he had been faking unconsciousness i left him to his brothers singe and i traveled on into the night me limping and groaning and demonstrating grand vigor in protesting my determination to find a new way to make a living where in hell are we going i muttered wed been walking for hours it was the middle of the night i felt every step in every muscle and every joint we were way up north passing through neighborhoods where real elves roamed singe and i drew stares from folks curious about whether we were a couple i couldve told them that we were a couple of idiots this was dangerous country but if we stuck to the main thoroughfare the grand avenue we should be all right partly because it was customarily safe ground partly because doris and marsha were ambling along with us their clubs dragging the cobblestones and their knuckles threatening to get down there soon i am following the trail garrett i am not creating it singe was getting cranky too probably needed to get some food in her this is why i hate working once you get started you cant just knock off when you feel like it and have a couple of beers youve got to keep going until you drop why dont you eat one of your sandwiches singe immediately went to the back of the cart and dug out several if it makes you feel better knowing we are much closer than we were their scent is almost fresh they are less than three hours ahead every silver lining has a cloud thats the godsdamned gate up there i grumbled glaring at an island of light in the far distance please dont tell me they left town all right singe sounded troubled and she should for ratpeople tunfaires outer wall constitutes the edge of the world go past it and you fall off into the misty void the situation wasnt much better for me i dont like notcity i dont go outside often when i do i prefer to visit some rich mans estate where i can be comfortable while i take care of business i get back to town as fast as i can if we kept going this general direction for a few hours we could drop in on the contague estate although i know better intellectually emotionally i feel like the deadly wilderness is clamoring at the city gate all carnivorous or poisonous plants and animals most of them bigger and faster than me while the air is so full of maneating bugs that you dont dare breathe deep in reality most of the countryside near tunfaire is well tamed if it wasnt it wouldnt be able to feed the city the exceptions are some bits unsuited for exploitation or which the wealthy and powerful have set aside as hunting reserves or whatnot the rare incursions of thunder lizards mammoths or even bears or giant ground sloths are just that rare but they sure do get talked about plenty marsha said we maybe need to take a sleep break first if were really going to go out there garrett he had a point a good point or at least a damned good excuse for us not to go wandering around the wilderness in the dark even if we were only a few hours behind our friends wilderness is relative before sunrise we were in wild country compared to where i live but we were in a carefully tamed and only mildly unkempt park compared to the places where i fought my share of the war of course this was the worst nightmare wilderness singe had ever seen she couldnt take ten steps without stopping to sniff the morning air for the warning stench of approaching monsters i kept after her to move faster the quicker we get there the quicker we get it over with and the quicker we get back to town you dont want to spend the night out here do you but instinct is hard to overcome i prove that every time i get too close to belinda contague besides the grolls can handle anything were likely to meet dojango had been yakking all morning inconsequentialities typical of him actually so much so that nobody paid him the least attention though doris did drag him out of the cart and have him pull it as one way of slowing his jaw down wait a minute i said what was that because dojangos mouth runs with no real connection to his brain he just chomped air for a minute what might he have said that could interest me he hadnt been listening then he went into mild shock because somebody was interested in something that hed said uh i dont remember actually about the thing you saw in the sky oh that happened while you were all asleep actually when the time had come wed all just planted ourselves at streetside grolls on the flanks and started snoring we hadn i been bothered size does matter dojango continued i decided id stand watch on account of all of the rest of you were out like the dead he was fibbing he hadnt been able to sleep because hed spent all that time snoozing in the cart its easy to tell when dojango is revising history he forgets to use his favorite word and and a ball of light came in out of the east from beyond the river it went somewhere south of us it stopped for a while i could see the glow then it came north slowly drifting back and forth over grand avenue i had a feeling it was looking for something actually and it came to a stop up above us yeah after a while it shined a really bright light down on us and thats all i remember he shuddered though so there was something more what else he didnt want to talk about it but dojango rose is incapable of resisting an invitation to speak just a really bad dream where the light lifted me up and took me inside the glow into a weird leadgray place they did really awful things to me these weird shiny little women this one wouldnt leave my thing alone i see hed healed wondrous fast if hed been tortured something to keep in mind i did some thinking some consideration of the circumstances i came up with some ideas the first time we approached a sizable woodlot which boasted enough tangled undergrowth to suggest that it wasnt used much i had doris and marsha carry the cart and its cargo deep inside and camouflage it with branches dojango cried like a baby i guarantee you i dont have a whole lot of sympathy buddy why dont you use your sore feet to make the rest of you mad enough to smack some of those elves around when we catch up with them that bought me a respite dojango rose is a lover not a fighter he probably heard his mother calling but couldnt run away as long as his brothers stuck it out we passed gated estates the grolls attracted considerable attention most of the guards were friendlier than they might have been had i tried to engage them in conversation on my own doris and marsha make a convincing argument just standing around leaning on their clubs some of those guards had seen saucerhead and playmate go by but not a one had seen kayne prose or any other willowy blonde tharpe and playmate had been bickering according to several witnesses they were also not making very good time we were still only a few hours behind them despite our pause to enjoy a stone mattress we keep on with this and were going to find ourselves out in the real country pretty soon i observed we were past the truck gardens and wheatfields and starting up the slope into wine country ahead the hills started growing up fast we popped over a ridgeline me cursing the day kayne met kips pop and even more bloodily the day i let myself get into debt to playmate whoa there it is thats perfect there what is dojango asked id stopped hed sat down he had one boot off already that bowl of land down there filled with trees it has a pond in there you can see the water runs down off all these hills looks like a great hiding place bet you thats where some sort of flash happened under the trees a dark brown smoke ring rolled up through the foliage there was a rumble like a very large troll clearing his throat that was different dojango said he levered his other boot off my guess is our friends just found the elven sorcerers nobody rushed off to help dojango massaged his blisters and distinctly looked like hed rather head some other direction any other direction singe had the sensibilities of a soldier if we can see what is happening down there then whoever is down there can see what is happening up here absolutely i responded by dropping into the shade of a split rail fence the rose boys didnt need the whole speech either the big ones made themselves as scarce as possible on an open road that ran downhill through a vineyard where the plants were seldom more than hip high to me dojango rolled into a ditch a look around showed me a countryside not made for sneaking the wooded bowl was entirely surrounded by vineyards i could cover some ground on hands and knees amongst the vines but there wasnt a whole lot of cover for guys twenty feet tall and there were people out working the vineyards some not that far from us eyeing us askance because of our odd behavior before long most of the workers began to amble downhill to see what was going on theres our cue people look like youve got grape skins between your toes dojango began to whine in earnest once out of his boots his feet had swollen he couldnt get them back on it was real wed have to leave him behind which was just as well actually dojango has a talent for screwing things up by getting underfoot when times begin to get exciting i told him well pick you up on the way back he didnt act like his feelings were hurt most of the vineyard workers reached the wood well before we did which was fine by me because something unpleasant was going on in amongst the trees something flashy noisy then smoky another doughnut of brown smoke rolled up out of the trees the vineyard people decided they wanted no part of that they went scooting right back up the hills not a one was interested in wasting valuable running time gawking at my odd company at a guess id say people in the area had had bad experiences down there before once you penetrated the dozen yards of dense brush and brambles on the outer perimeter of the wood you found yourself in a perfectly groomed parklike grove without undergrowth with grass almost like a lawn with a pond an acre in size somewhat off center to the west and with a big silver discus thing smack in the middle standing eight feet above the grass on spindly metal legs a flimsy ladder rose from the grass to an opening in the disks belly a silver elf lay at the foot of that unconscious or dead likewise one saucerhead tharpe right hand gripping the elfs ankle whose scattered attitude suggested that hed been dragged back out of the discus i saw nothing to explain the brown smoke rings nor all the racket wed heard while we were coming down the hill the wood was perfectly still now not a bird had a word to say not a bug sang one bar to his ladylove a few leaves did stir in the breeze but they kept their voices down the only sounds to be heard were the distant excited voices of vineyard workers who had decided they were far enough away to slow down and gossip when i stopped and counted them up in my head i doubted that thered been more than a dozen workers total we four froze with the moment some listening some sniffing i turned slowly trying to get a direction for the sense of presence id begun to feel i whispered to singe the casey creature is here in the grove somewhere can you scent him the odors here are very strange garrett i am confused i do scent something that might be casey but i cannot locate him a breeze stirred the leaves and branches my eye kept going to an oddity of shadow that didnt stir with everything else i examined it from the corners of my eyes i squinted right and left and direct i moved several times so i could try everything from a variety of angles several times the dance of bright sunlight and deep leaf shadow made me think that i had glimpsed something that might have been kayne prose crumpled up beside a stump trapped inside something like a heat shimmer when i concentrated i discovered a shadow being cast onto the ground by something not apparent to the naked eye i looked left and right nothing told me why the vineyard hands had run for it nothing told me where playmate might be now nothing indicated the current whereabouts of the three silver elves not sprawled underneath their silvery discus nothing told me much of anything i drifted toward the shadow that shouldnt have been beckoning marsha to follow laying a finger to my lips i got a few more glimpses of kayne prose she didnt appear to be awake the invisibility spell keeping her unseen was sputtering and maybe needed a little punching up from somebody whod had enough schooling to know what they were doing the spell did a whole lot of nothing to fool my sense of touch i got marsha down on his knees guided his hands thats his head you hang on in case he wakes up if he does let him know whos in control without killing him if possible gotcha i began the task of frisking and disrobing a body i couldnt see the stripping part didnt go well at all a totally bedraggled imitation kayne prose materialized suddenly in the same moment singe said gleep where did garrett go inasmuch as i had not gone anywhere i gazed with suspicion at the small gray fetish id just taken off casey singe come over here when she arrived i put the device into her paw she vanished i assume i reappeared now youre invisible hang on to that it might come in handy nobody can see me whoo haha what i could do with this what couldnt we all do why dont you sneak over there and see if saucerhead is still breathing i had a recollection of having turned up horizontal myself a few times after running into these elves only they hadnt knocked themselves out too those times i couldnt see singe but she did still cast some shadow when she stepped into the light she said mr playmate must have climbed up the ladder singe dont go in there my last two words even i couldnt hear over the crump as a sudden ring of brown smoke blew down off the bottom of the discus the smoke hit the ground ricocheted back upward into the sky it seemed much less substantial than had the earlier clouds singe you all right a ratlike squeak resolved itself into garrett can you hear me i cannot hear right now but otherwise i am all right i am going to finish climbing the ladder now you damned fool thats what just i found mr playmate he is right inside here out cold lying on a metal floor with two more elves one has a broken arm at least it is bent the wrong way meanwhile on the ground i was continuing to make sure that casey and the other unconscious elf wouldnt be able to go anywhere when they woke up lets see if we cant get this costume off this one id given up trying to strip casey and to singe thats a good job singe dont go wandering around in there singe she didnt respond the girl was getting a little too sure of herself would one of you guys reach up in there and drag playmate out doris had taken over trying to get caseys silver suit off him so marsha crawled under the discus it was a tight fit he ended up twisting himself around so he was seated on the grass his head and shoulders inside the opening gosh garrett its weird in here a moment later he dropped an elf hey you damned near hit me with that i was having no luck stripping the elf who had fallen with saucerhead the new arrival didnt look like hed be any easier here comes the one with the broken arm you might want to take him so he dont get hurt any worse i jumped up just in time to grab the body marsha handed down the elf weighed hardly anything at all hey garrett look at this i turned doris was standing up his top half up in the foliage he seemed to be looking back up the hill that we had descended to get to this adventure i shed my burden skipped a dozen yards to a point where i could see the hillside myself i thought the vineyard workers would be up to something but they were just making tracks instead dojango was in deep sludge but he hadnt noticed yet it was kind of funny actually because he didnt see it coming until after doris and i began watching he was probably just sitting there throwing pebbles at grasshoppers and congratulating himself on having gotten out of all the work when he spotted the glowing balls by that time theyd bracketed him and were descending doris said maybe he didnt make up all that shit about them pulling him inside and doing something to him they sure didnt have no trouble finding him again did they even after we ditched that cart and all that magical stuff an excellent observation brother i watched dojango jump up try to run in several directions all of which turned out to be blocked as soon as he chose them he never stopped trying though like a squirrel in a box trap while prancing on stones because his tender feet were bare i noted that the vineyard workers were trying to make themselves seem scarce while they watched too once the balls of light were on the ground they faded to become three eggs of leadgray metal with little in the way of exterior features i said we can probably expect their company in a few minutes wed better roll up our sleeves and get ready playmate came flopping down out of the discus marsha started dragging him away i said hide all these people in the woods under the brush maybe then get yourselves out of sight where is that girl i hopped over the foot of the ladder singe singe didnt respond i said on second thought leave saucerhead and playmate lying out in the open this guy too i used a toe to nudge the silver elf lying nearest the ladder thatll give them something to focus on so theyll maybe overlook the rest of us you guys hide take whatever steps seem appropriate gritting my teeth i reached out and touched the metal ladder quick and cautious using just the tip of one finger nothing happened not even a hint of brown smoke the ladder took me up into a small metal room that was maybe ten feet across its ceiling was five feet high i had to move in a stoop that started my back aching in moments at its extremities the rooms floor conformed to the external curve of the discus the room itself seemed suitable only for storage singe my voice sounded strange in that place singe didnt answer me dont be playing games just because youre invisible still no answer the back side of the ladder went on up to another level i swung around there looked up there did seem to be an opening which was closed mostly closed a bit of fabric had gotten caught in a gap where the closure abutted the head of the ladder the lighting was poor but the fabric resembled that of singes shirt i pushed nothing gave but the muscles in my back i tried again twisting the closure slid sideways an inch i thought i had it now i pushed and twisted some more the crack widened a few more inches then wouldnt respond to any effort i made i tried to look through the crack i couldnt see anything but nothing i followed up by snaking a cautious hand in to feel around nobody stomped on my fingers its a wonderful life when the highlight of your working day is that nobody stomped on your fingers i felt around some more it seemed that the main reason the entry wouldnt open any farther was that singe was lying on it getting her off proved to be a challenge but i was up to it i was a trained veteran royal marine eventually i slithered through the gap singe was lying in plain sight mostly on another metal floor like the one below this room was perfectly round with another ceiling that had to be uncomfortably low even for the elves who used it one of those was slumped in one of four chairs gracing the room the chairs were all fixed to the floor the wonders of that round room were too numerous to recount i think i was too numb to recognize a lot of them as anything special there seemed to be thousands of little glowing lights for example some were green or red or yellow or purple or even white some kept flashing on and off most seemed content just to be there showing themselves ive seen some wild sorcery in my day including the kind that melts mountains yet i was more impressed with this vision than id been with anything id seen before the numbers were what did it then there were windows something like the one at caseys most of them more nearly horizontal than vertical but the really eyepopping thing the overwhelming thing was the outer wall all the way around the room it was like that was missing not there at all until you touched it the woods were visible there pretty much as i wouldve seen them had i been standing on a fifteenfoothigh platform i was seeing the world from the altitude that doris and marsha saw it i couldnt hear anything though i checked singes pulse shed be all right i checked the elf somebody had slugged this one from behind id bet on any invisible ratgirl i couldnt find a pulse in any of the usual places but he was twitching already i got him plucked of his possessions and tied up with odds and ends just in time and just in time for the arrival of the three glowing balls those touched down carefully after a wary approach when he saw that happening my captive elf began to kick and struggle he wasnt pleased i felt an inarticulate mental pressure but he never said an actual word i shut the door in the floor and parked both singe and the elf atop it when he tried to move i admonished him gently with a toe he learned faster than a pup i looked outward again the three glowing objects gradually stopped doing that they turned out to be dull gray lopsided metal eggs not more than ten feet tall the fat half of each egg downward each stood on three metal legs as skinny as broom handles nothing happened for a while then as an opening began to appear in the side of one of the gray eggs doris came bounding out of the woods and dealt that very egg a mighty overhand smack with his club the blow left a sizable dent then there was a flash and doris staggered away not knocked down but not real sure where he was anymore a vaguely feminine silver elf dropped a ladder from the assaulted egg and scrambled down to the ground she seemed to be seeing the fact but didnt want to believe that doris hadnt been destroyed by the flash i got all that from feelings within me and from elven body language that probably meant nothing of the sort because the creature wasnt human it hit the ground running toward doris in a truly foul mood the groll himself had gotten lost in the woods he was blundering around in confusion the other two silver elves left their eggs they showed hints of femininity too from the remove at which i watched i couldnt be completely sure however though there did seem to be minor physical differences from the other elves nothing was absolutely convincing maybe if you were a silver elf you could tell kind of the way slugs can tell the boys from the girls plainly they didnt label themselves the way humans do sexually or by pinpointing weirdness physical disparity or attractiveness never mind i dont need to get my ulcers burning about human nature im all growed up now maw i know we aint gonna get nowhere wishin an hopin people are too damned stubborn speaking of stubborn here came marsha half the size of a house crawling on his belly sneaking up on the lead egg only abandoned a moment earlier by a silver elf with cute little crabapple breasts marsha had learned something while watching his brother precipitate attack when he was close enough marsha reached out and with a sideways swipe of his club swatted one of the eggs legs out from under it which didnt turn out to be quite as clever as id thought before he did it when the egg fell it tipped straight toward him he had to scramble to get out of the way and even then he wasnt safe the elves decided to chase him the violence of the eggs fall shook the discus for a second i was afraid i was going down too the fallen egg began to glow in a patch on its bottom then it started sliding around drunkenly darting and stopping like a water bug spinning tearing up trees it knocked over the only uninjured egg struck the discus a ferocious glancing blow and panicked the new arrivals they didnt know which way to run finally the egg blistered off in a straight line ripped through the pond and the woods beyond then plowed a deep furrow through a vineyard almost all the way to the top of the slope before it came to rest at that point it seemed both to melt and to sink slowly into the earth marsha had to be amazed by what hed accomplished the silver elves were amazed too and distraught in the extreme i was now reasonably confident that they did communicate the way the dead man does i couldnt pick out any words but the atmosphere was pregnant with emotion there was a lot of blaming and fingerpointing going on driven by a terror of being marooned that fear became a notch more intense when the three examined their surviving egg and discovered that doriss illadvised attack had crippled it somehow uhoh the three all stared at the disk like it might be their salvation after a brief commune they all produced a variety of gray fetishes and began poking at them with long skinny nailless fingers one of the little girls came forward toward me passing out of view beneath my feet two minutes later there was a whining noise from the area where singe and the captive elf lay sprawled i scooted over there the door in the floor was trying to move the weight piled on it kept it from doing so i sensed a considerable frustration down below that was one maybe lady who didnt think things ought to be going this way a maybe woman whose day had been on the brink of triumph but which had turned to shit in her hands in a matter of minutes been there sweetheart i muttered i began to look around seeking something identifiable as a nonlethal weapon i didnt want to hurt anybody if i really was dealing with women possibly the most bizarre aspect of this business so far was the fact that no one had gotten killed we had one elf with a broken arm and we had me with a bumper crop of aches and bruises acquired from ratpeople not directly involved in the case but otherwise the whole thing was almost civilized and no silver elf had yet done anyone a direct physical injury i didnt find anything that could be used as a weapon maybe i could rip an arm off the elf i did have and use it to harvest the new crop i did retain plenty of pieces of steel in a variety of shapes and sizes all with very sharp edges should the situation grow hair though even so these weird people didnt seem to be impressed by weapons which left me wondering just how bright they could be the elf downstairs tried to get the floor door open again i sat down nearby ready to crack her knuckles with the butt of a knife if she stuck a hand through the way i had im not always a perfect gentleman some of the little flashy lights expired suddenly outside the most voluptuous elf began to jump up and down evidently shed solved some puzzle and was totally excited she didnt jiggle much though the other elf looked over her shoulder clearly she disapproved of her sidekicks demonstration but was pleased with their results her daddy longlegs fingers began to prance across another of those gray fetish things more lights went out there was a declining whine fading fast never noticed until it went i dont think thats a good sign i told myself still more lights went out definitely not a good sign up on the seethrough wall which i just now noticed had a curved shape in the vertical dimension that allowed it to show a lot more than a flat window would i saw a large piece of deadwood come arcing out of the woods spinning end for end horizontally it was a log i wouldve had trouble lifting it got both silver elves i felt their rush of pain inside my head the elf downstairs made a run for it she dropped out the bottom of the disk and headed up the path already blazed by the selfimmolating egg marsha didnt have any luck catching her i didnt let it worry me she was completely weird and doubtless had no clue how to get by in the country without help from her strange sorcerous toys she should not be hard to track just follow the commotion she caused maybe colonel block could get me a big fat medal for having saved karenta from the foreign sorcerers and sorceresses maybe the flying pigs would start evicting the pigeons from their traditional roosts which sure would leave a mess around all those dead and incompetent generals posing outside the chancery the common wisdom among former grunts is that competent generals wouldnt have screwed up so bad they got themselves killed and therefore there wouldnt have been any need for a memorial soldiers are a cynical bunch in the process of exploring the interior of the discus i discovered cypres prose installed in a padded box behind a door that locked from the outside the little horizontal closet was soundproof it was on a floor above the one with the marvelous lights and the wonderful view the upper level seemed to constitute of crew quarters and such if you went over it just guessing my years in the corps with its ancient and traditional naval associations clicked in at last this thing had to be some kind of aerial ship or boat with a crew with decks and bulkheads and hatches instead of floors and walls and doors with heads instead of toilets and galleys instead of kitchens and all that special navy talk us marines always resented the silver elves must have been trying to teach kip something stashing him in a padded box but they hadnt been harsh enough their rewards and punishments must have been too subtle the boy began to complain the second the door opened never once going for a good to see you again or thanks for coming to find me garrett that being the case i shut him back in while i went on to explore the rest of the aerial ship after a while i reopened the hatch confining kip where can i find lastyr and noodiss bitch bitch piss and moan all right your call i shut the hatch i went back outside hey marsha did you happen to look for dojango im pretty sure they dragged him into one of those lead eggs in the excitement wed forgotten the little brother marsha went over to the fallen egg and yelled in the doorway he didnt get a response for a moment he and i both stared up the hill along the path taken by the berserk egg then marsha went and yelled into the dented egg that didnt do any good either id better look i said chances are they wouldnt have left him in any condition where he could do some mischief these silver elves were highly weird but i doubted that they were highly stupid i was right i found dojango in the dented ship as unconscious as singe and playmate and saucerhead tharpe this is not good i kept muttering to myself until my superior intellect finally seized the day i went up into the vineyards and asked around until i found a somberly clad gloomily serious young man willing to abandon his post for a fee i gave him messages to deliver to the dead man to morley dotes and to colonel block in that order i gave him half of his handsome messengers stipend before he departed giving him to understand that receipt of the balance was contingent upon his getting the job done right he nodded a lot all his mates seemed to think his going to the city was a huge joke then i just felt like i could lie back and take it easy until reinforcements arrived taking a few minutes every hour to go see if kip had started to catch on yet that boy was slow after a while he mentioned hunger that right theres you one more motive for turning cooperative id say whew its really starting to get ripe in there too guess those good old silver boys let you out when you had to go he refused to understand that right away too back outside i asked how is doris looking marsha id been rooting for a swift recovery making small talk with the healthy brother had worn thin in a hurry once wed used up business and gossip all marsha could talk about was the shortage of suitable females within his size range an you can stuff them ideas right there garrett on account of ive already heard all the jokes about mastodons and blue oxen then i shant belabor the obvious actually i was going to suggest that you jog up and get our cart back singe packed us a load of sandwiches shed also eaten a load of sandwiches along the way but i hoped a few might have survived and if not id at least get a respite from the mighty lovers whining marsha thought that was about the best idea hed heard all week he took off right away tossing back keep an eye on doris will you i will indeed on account of i didnt want to be in the wrong place when the big goof tripped over his own feet and came tumbling down i made my rounds of prisoners and patients they were all being incredibly stubborn about recovering though i now saw some signs that they were coming back singe had begun babbling in her sleep thankfully mostly in ratfolk cant my grasp of the dialect is feeble i was embarrassed only about half the time doris was coming along fine he made sense about seventy percent of the time he stayed fine as long as he didnt get up and try to walk around his sense of balance was out of whack when he did try to walk he drifted sideways then he fell over twenty minutes after marsha left we had a visitor some sort of vineyard manager or overseer or supervisor name of boroba thring boroba was a fat little brown guy on a skinny little brown donkey he believed devoutly in his right to claim everyone and everything in sight in the name of his employer evicting me in the meantime evidently he seldom dealt with anyone who told him no hed come visiting alone and didnt see that as a disadvantage he was one of those particularly irritating characters who couldnt conceive of anyone thwarting him let alone ignoring him which is what i did for a while when first he spouted his nonsense once i became sufficiently sick of his voice i said hey doris you can have this one to play with thring didnt last long i had doris dump him in with the other prisoners after that i passed the time amusing myself by figuring out how to strip silver elves the material they wore was tough but i discovered that it wouldnt stand up to a really sharp piece of steel marsha arrived with the cart youre probably gonna want to keep those people in the shade garrett ive seen albinos with more color to them they definitely dont get out much my oh my the cargo area on the back of the cart still contained sandwiches that singe hadnt eaten and some beer in stoneware bottles that was a nice surprise i shared the sandwiches with the grolls i shared the beer with me i reserved the last sandwich and went to see kip this is the way it goes kid i waved the sandwich took a small bite you can talk to me the nice guy whos here to help you or you can talk to the guard when they get here and take over i know youre a tough guy youve been getting yourself ready for this in your daydreams for the last fifteen years and so far it hasnt hurt much more than an ordinary dream but when the guards get here theyll have someone from the hill with them and you know those people wont think any more of stepping on you than they would of stomping a roach i looked into kips eyes and tried to imagine what he was seeing as he looked at me definitely not what i thought i was probably just a minor villain laughing and rubbing his hands together while cackling about having ways to make him talk time was getting to be a problem what i had to get around was kips absolute vision of himself as the hero of his own story which at this point meant crushing him in a major way because i couldnt come up with a means by which he could see an honorable escape route he could use without believing his escape was some sort of wicked betrayal i did some estimating of how much time i might yet have before those id summoned arrived seemed like it should be quite a while yet if things ran their usual course in officialdom i did some soulsearching too because i wanted to know why some part of me was so convinced that it was important for me to get to lastyr and noodiss when i start thinking and wondering about my own motives life really starts to slow down i can see why morley gets impatient with me marsha built us a fire doris had recovered enough to help without falling in i gathered some of my favorite people in the circle of warmth singe playmate saucerhead casey and a member each from the other crews they didnt look like much naked the males were like shriveled up old prunes like mummies one of the two females wasnt much more promising the other got barely passing marks from me because i possess a prejudiced eye i hoped somebody would thaw out and tell me something interesting neither doris nor marsha had any trouble leaving brother dojango a subject in the realm of silence dojango never said anything interesting dojango just said saucerhead recovered first he was in a predictably foul temper he insisted he was starving save yourself some agony i told him ive been where youre at now three times if you try to eat anything itll come right back up let me learn the hard way his stomach growled agreement your choice but the only edibles in the area are those grapes up yonder and if those were ripe they wouldve been picked already saucerhead wasnt interested in common sense or rationality but he could handle them when they happened then im going back to sleep presumably a trick hed learned in the army doze as much as you can until flying misfortune makes you get up and go to work dont get into it too deep i sent for the guard i cant see you wanting to be lying around here napping when they show which wont be for a while and i can count on my good friend garrett to kick me in the slats and wake me up as soon as he sees them coming over yonder ridge go on and get away from me my head is pounding and i aint in no mood i did get a smile out of playmate before he turned nasty on me somehow while he was unconscious all his pain and misery had become my fault ignoring the incredibly stupid thing hed done chasing after a kayne prose who wasnt even the real deal a dozen miles into the countryside singe tried harder to be nice when she came around but she did find it difficult to be understanding about the food shortage seems i spend my whole life listening to people complain maybe i should get into the priest racket but im either too cynical or not cynical enough i told singe if hunger becomes a bad enough problem well eat our pal casey over there casey didnt respond even though he was awake none of the elves seemed able to communicate without their clothes on i took a nap myself it lasted through most of the night i awakened to find my accomplices feeling better physically but no less testy they all complained of hunger the prisoners were all awake now too but were unable or unwilling to communicate when i gave casey his suit back in hopes that that would help but he just stared at the ruins and shook his head evidently my knifework had deprived him of his sorcery permanently i said ive had a thought saucerhead grumbled dont go spraining your brain this one just popped right up no work at all like a toadstool probably growing on a cow pie somebody from town should be showing up pretty soon but they dont need to find the rest of you here they dont know about you so theres no need for you to deal with their crap playmate said theyll just hunt us down later not if i dont tell them none of these elves can talk theres that grapestomper hes only seen the big guys i can make him a deal thatll guarantee his silence playmate gave up arguing he enjoyed official scrutiny as little as the next man what about kip we havent found kip kip is what this mess is all about its all a waste of time money and pain if we dont get the kid back ill keep looking hes got to be here somewhere i have to take him back garrett i know overly moral me id decided that i couldnt let a kid fall into colonel blocks hands not even that kid block is a decent enough guy for a royal functionary but there are a lot of people way nastier than me that hes obliged to keep happy and kip meant nothing to him personally there were ten thousand kips in town maybe i get him together with kayne prose make kip mean something long enough for the hill folk to lose interest i strolled over to the discus i climbed inside the bulk of a sandwich awaited me beside the hatch to kips compartment i was tempted to enjoy it myself but i was concerned too that sandwich had drawn no flies when i reflected on the matter i realized that i had yet to see any insect inside the aerial ship now there was a sorcery worth stealing hello kip this could be your lucky day i have something for you to eat and a chance for you to get out of here before baron dreadlore and the civil guards arrive dreadlore was a fabrication but somebody with a name very much like that would turn up soon maybe several of them considering how much damage a sorcerer could imagine himself doing if he owned the secret magery of flight water dang me kip i hadnt even thought about water i should have i must be getting senile theres a whole big pond of the stuff right outside and a nice cold spring you still want to be stubborn yes he did i told him they got hold of your mother and rhafi you know he croaked that was casey how would you know how would you know that name the drople and the graple both told me they have ways of observing things that are happening in the city he didnt explain who the drople and the graple were two of his captors presumably they talked to you they hoped to convert me to their cause they didnt get the job done it was nice to see the kid too weak to be a smartass i couldnt understand what they were talking about lastyr and noodiss are the only ones of them that i ever actually do get they just want to go home howd they get here in the first place in a sky vessel like this one but they didnt know how to work it well enough they crashed it i dont recall the incident they crashed in the river whatevers left of their ship is underwater at last i was starting to dig something out not that it made a lick of sense that being the case why not let casey take them home because casey isnt here to take them home casey is here to take them to prison theyre escaped convicts kip was losing patience with me and my questions no they have the wrong politics although politics isnt exactly what it is not like what we mean when we say politics here its all politics and philosophy and science and law and research with all three groups and even though ive talked and talked about it with lastyr and noodiss i still dont understand much better than you do without ever having heard them explain anything it seems like theres a war going on between people whove got different ideas about how knowledge should be handled the party lastyr and noodiss belong to the brotherhood of light believe that knowledge is the birthright of all intelligent lifeforms that it should be freely shared with anybody able to understand it thats why they came here so they could teach us i believe ive mentioned my tendency toward the cynical reaction i sneered at the charity of kips friends i said the way youre hacking and croaking ill bet youre ready for a long cool drink of springwater kip grunted so point the way for me in complete exasperation the boy told me i dont know where they are you know how to contact them lets go kip it isnt a game anymore it isnt an adventure people are coming for you wholl pull pieces off you like youre a bug the stakes are probably a lot bigger than either of us can imagine he gave me a look that belittled my imagination i kept plugging we need to do whatever we can to get ourselves out of their way the kid looked at the stale sandwich but didnt fold i had to admire him even if from my point of view he was being stubborn for all the wrong reasons you win kid eat hearty time to change over to plan q i found him i told playmate they had him stashed in some kind of locker marsha get everybody ready to hit the road were gonna move as soon as we can get the kid cleaned up playmate take him to the pond my instructions inspired a hundred questions i ignored them all located my local buddy mr thring he had value under the new plan he glared daggers once i removed his blindfold but hed begun to understand that bluster and attitude werent his best tools here mr thring good morning ive been talking with my associates about what we should do with you most of them think we should take you over to the pond and hold you under until you cant remember names or faces anymore surprise and fear lit up the dusky round face of the estate manager but it seems to me that you might be more use to us healthy if youll help us with a little something and can leave us comfortably assured that you wouldnt discuss your adventures with anyone later on thring was eager to provide assurances he couldnt by virtue of having been bound and gagged what im looking for is a littleknown path or road we can use to slip away from here inside i was kicking myself for not having pulled this together last night when wed had a lot bigger lead on the folks whod be headed our way now that messenger was going to end up having to whistle for the second half of his stipend you do know this country well enough to help us with that dont you probably grew up around here came right back after you did your five right the man nodded his head good im going to take your gag off now and well get started on making you one of the crew i scanned the group this wasnt a promising crowd for making a running retreat kip was in no shape to travel neither was mr thring dojango would whine a lot but he could walk limping hed soaked his feet playmate and saucerhead would manage what they had to manage doris and marsha would end up doing more than their reasonable share as usual probably by having to carry somebody and i would want to take an elf or two along the females seemed the most promising hostages they were lighter and from what little i could sense of what was going on inside them they seemed more cooperative more likely to talk about things none of the several crews wanted known playmate saucerhead and i could take turns pulling our prisoner cart saucerhead approached whats up garrett ive decided not to wait for colonel block mr thring here has been generous enough to offer to guide us out of here by back ways so we can get out and go home without having to deal with those special people whore likely to show up here with the guard i gotcha good idea you suppose he could guide us somewhere where we could get something to eat ill talk to him about that a little hunger probably wouldnt hurt us nearly as much as leaving a clear backtrail once we put some miles between ourselves and the wrecked skyships though i was ready for a snack myself i was so agitated all my paranoia went to waste when i reached home after an epic death march that brought the survivors and me into town through the west gate i learned that the dead man hadnt received my message at all neither had morley because morley wouldve contacted his nibs if he had what that meant was there was still a gang of elves out there tied up and maybe dying of thirst and exposure i headed for the alkhar immediately there wasnt much of me left when i got there i need to work on my strength and endurance i had no trouble getting in to see colonel block he really was interested in what i was doing i related a comprehensive version of my story it ran light on the sorcery side and came up short on names but was solid enough to let the colonel know that here was a matter genuinely in need of his attention block asked did you happen to catch the name of this weirdly dressed fellow who was supposed to bring me your message yeah earp eritytie earp was he michorite that sounds michorite possibly maybe one of those cults now that you mention it he dressed the part and ill bet all the other hands yucked it up when he volunteered to take the job am i right there was some amusement but nobody else volunteered you know what your boy is going to wake up in the tenderloin stonecold broke without even his farmboy brogans undoubtedly so wrecked that he cant remember his own name let alone those of people he was supposed to give messages those ascetic cultists dont deal with temptation well when they come up against it without all their sour fart buddies watching over their shoulders holding them back hell that could be me but at least ive been there enough times that i know what im missing block gave me a concerned look you may end up with some legal problems if any of those elves die can you produce trustworthy witnesses to back you up when you say they kidnapped this kid hell wes you had a guy there when it happened not exactly oh i do believe you more or less so why dont i just stipulate that youve got me over a barrel get somebody out there those creatures cant do you any good dead if you really need me you know where i live i thought youd go along be right there handy when questions start popping up you thought wrong im going home im going to eat and sleep and not do anything else for about nine days im allergic to the country it takes me a long time to get over it im just trying to do my civic duty here anyway you always were a bullshitter garrett ill let you know how it comes out id heard that before hed forget about me the second i left the only reason hed mentioned taking me along was to make me more eager to get out of there he wanted to grab the benefits of this for westman block damn that was smart of me being stupid enough to hire a messenger whod get lost in the redlight district before he thought of doing anything else from the little ive heard about the michorites and related cults thats a rite of passage they the men get one chance to sneak away and wallow in sin and depravity then they spend the rest of their lives keeping an eye on each other every miserable man making sure nobody else has any fun ever again in your hands i said i hope you get more out of it than i did go on before i change my mind he might just to show me that he could so i got the house was crowded what with singe kip and the captive silver elves staying over singe offered to ease the crowding by moving into my room with me i begged off again kip and the elves ended up sleeping on the floor in the dead mans room where hed have the least trouble keeping them under control id really hoped that singes encounter with rhafi unclothed would scare her off it seemed to have whetted her curiosity instead the situation amused his nibs immensely he wasnt going to help me get out of it either i fell asleep in a household drenched in the miasma of his amusement dean never gave the bitching a minutes rest but he did cook up breakfast enough for the whole wretched crowd the elf women joined in timidly dean tried them on everything in his arsenal tea they found acceptable honey seemed to be all right in tea or straight from the pot one nibbled a biscuit also with honey aboard bacon revolted the two of them the more obviously feminine member of the pair the one who looked like shed actually made it a few weeks into puberty attacked the mustard once she discovered it dean scowled and muttered to himself a lot of work goes into grinding seed and preparing the condiment theres always a pot on the table mainly because i dont much like mustard the other elf woman the elder and senior woman judging by wrinkles seemed terrified though no one even spoke to her i got the feeling shed never seen the inner workings of a karentine household fear or no she did appear to me immensely curious about everything kip was a shuddering zombie controlled by an increasingly exasperated dead man kip never stopped fighting him something was missing in that boys makeup i couldnt understand how hed managed to stay alive this long singe and i removed to the dead mans room as soon as id had enough to eat she brought a platter along with her loaded with seconds or thirds having no better idea what to do with herself the slimmer elf woman tagged along she wouldnt sit when i offered her my chair because that would leave me standing between her and the door the other one stayed with dean exploring the wonders of the kitchen so where do we stand old bones have we learned anything perhaps at the first instance probably that we should not have allowed emotion to sweep us away and get us involved in this as i see it now we have stormed into the middle of something that was none of our business we have done nothing but trail chaos and dismay wherever we have gone what do you mean we big daddy homely you cant really talk about someone else in the royal plural can you do not become tedious i am struggling to translate what little recognizable material i find in the thin creatures mind this is truly an alien intelligence garrett i have encountered nothing like it in all my years nor have i ever heard of such creatures unless there may have been similar folk here when i was a child visitors they were called then they were all murdered for their secrets inasmuch as they did not reveal anything they were soon forgotten i am having difficulty communicating not just because of what you would call a language barrier but also because of her fear she is awash in fear not just of us here whom she finds terrifying enough but of being cut off from her own people she is completely unmanned by the possibility that she may never be able to return home and least of all but still there in the mix is a fear of the consequences of the failure of her mission and that would be i do not know that is in a sealed part of her mind what about the other one she is frightened too and her mind is more closed but behind her fear there is a hint of her seeing this personal disaster as a potential opportunity for i do not know what something compulsive possibly obsessive possibly something wicked worms of temptation have begun to awaken way down in the black mucky deeps i hate it when he meanders off on a free association poetic ramble i guess because i cant ever figure out what the hell hes babbling about what about kip did you get anything new out of him yes once i became aware that there was something that should be there but it is not much and i do not know if we can justify hunting down lastyr and noodiss of course we can but i couldnt think of any reasonable argument in favor of that is there any chance some of those elves mightve put a compulsion into my head somewhere along the way like one of those times when i was knocked out at the moment i am unable to investigate all of my mental capacity is occupied by the boy and these foreign women they definitely are both women then by birth you unclothed them you saw i didnt see much but what i had seen had been curiously interesting the one in the kitchen at least raised a crop of lemons many human women are not as voluptuous as those in the range you usually find interesting this ones primary sexual characteristics are somewhat atrophied i would expect that to be true of the others as well i did notice that in the women it all added up to a sort of virginal innocence that was attractive in its own fashion singe hissed at me i think it was supposed to be laughter i suspect that this is not an individual aberration i suspect that we would find the males even more atrophied weird i shuddered the ones i stripped down out there definitely werent built to boogie maybe i ought to introduce this old gal to morley the pixies out front launched one of their racket shows which wakened the goddamned parrot she may be beyond seduction garrett they may have tried to breed the sexual impulse out of themselves the same madness has been tried by countless cults in our part of the world in a shortsighted effort to shove all those distractions aside how the hell do they get little elves then exactly no such cult lasts more than a generation perhaps the silver elves have found a way around that limitation possibly they have a separate breeder caste i do not know i do know that no living creature i have ever encountered save the rare mutant has lacked desire however distorted the core impulse might have become because of stresses upon the individual i would suspect them to be present in these elves but buried deep so have you gotten anything out of the kid concerning his two weird pals truly he does not know how or where to find them he does not have a reliable means of attracting their attention his method worked only two times in five tries the rest of the time they just turned up at their own discretion almost always when he was alone it has not occurred to kip to wonder but they almost certainly knew that he was alone before they visited dean stuck his head in that racket out front is because the wee folk have spotted bic gonlit dean was talking to the pixies now times change i gave him the fisheye on general principles he wouldnt be feeding them too would he now why would bic i have him go bring him in garrett he flashed me a pixieseye view of the spot from which bic was watching the house i noted that it was farther away than the dead man had shown he could reach before when trying to manipulate a human being after that take kip home to his mother he is nothing but a distraction here this is the real bic gonlit the genuine article evidently determined to be foolish help me find out why he will not run this time he will not see you leave the house though he was mad as hell bic couldnt get his body to move he couldnt do anything but flinch when my hand settled on his shoulder bic my man here you are again lurking lets go for a walk gonlit stood up and zombiewalked over to the house with me i talked to him all the way mainly in an admonitory tone there was no need to get any other watchers overly excited i did blow mrs cardonlos a kiss she was out on her porch keeping her eyes open she needed her reward mr gonlit is after miss pular again now on behalf of a ratman who calls himself john stretch you get the joke singe john stretch no why would the name john stretch be a joke the notion seemed to irritate her john stretch is what they used to call the hangman before we got civilized and started lopping off heads instead is that true i wonder who he could be singe had almost no accent left despite her vastly different throat and voice box scary how talented the girl was but her tone was so controlled even i knew she was dancing around something i was surprised the dead man didnt get after her although sometimes he just doesnt pay attention to anything but himself mr gonlit does not know who john stretch is he does not care one of the hardnosed youngsters with ambitions toward reliances throne if you care to call it that a somewhat naive youngster willing to pay part of mr gonlits fee up front mr gonlit enjoyed a wonderful gourmet dinner last night he followed it with a bottle of tunfaire gold and a deep pipe filled with the finest imported broadleaf tobacco probably a postersaldt now mr gonlit finds himself in a position where he has to deliver something that will please john stretch hey bic you know we warned you to back away from us gonlit shrugged people warn you off pal i dont recollect you ever running away that stuff is pretty obnoxious when somebody else is throwing it into your face must be the boots talking bic making you braver than you ought to be whatre you gonna do pal send me to the cantard bic tried hard not to betray his interest in the silver elf woman her interest in bic however was both frank blatant and troubled the manly posturing thing seemed both to excite and repel her she was eager to see what happened next theres an original question bic well i have work to do errands to run i hope you took that john stretch for a potful of gold by the time i get back home youll probably be unemployed kip where the hell are you get your sorry ass ready im taking you home with a side trip to the palms along the way of course i needed to see my old buddy my pal morley the celery stalker and carrot killer i passed the word to morley the number one boy out to scrub reliance is a rat who calls himself john stretch thats cute whatve you been up to i thought reliance might be interested what do you think how do you mean up to why do you want to know weve had some unusual people turn up here the last couple of nights theyre the sort who dress up in black and manage to suck all the joy out of a room just by entering it why would they come here i thought you might be able to tell me not a clue here and i really didnt have one that the kid you were looking for the very one am i good or what so you got him back damn me with faint praise if you want im taking him home to his mother now you think hes smart enough to make it there then kip had just done something to test sarges patience i have hopes im counting on his ego and once im shut of him ill be the happiest boy in town id go on a toot if i didnt have work to do ooh you have another job lined up already nope just studying the excesses of the rest of you im considering entrepreneur stuff because im going into business for myself morley looked at me for a while all right this ought to be entertaining what you dont think i can be a serious businessman no because a serious businessman has to stay sober most of the time a serious businessman has to make his decisions untouched by emotion and most of all a serious businessman has to work all day every day enduring longer hours than the most dedicated character on his payroll i took a deep cleansing breath sighed o ye of little faith exactly tell me everything youve left out about your adventures garrett when i got to the part about the michorite messenger morley began to laugh he said i guess that explains the kid who turned up here a few hours ago what he was a darkhaired boy of draft age as handsome as they come some mothers son wearing nothing but a loincloth but he stank like an alley in the drought season how long did you fiddle with the words to put that together then till now sounded good didnt it he couldnt remember why he was supposed to see me the boys in the kitchen gave him some leftovers and sent him on his way i grunted sourly hey sarge no need to hold back on my account the kid asks for it smack him probably wont do any good but hes got to learn somehow someday though i was just about convinced that kip never would only seconds later smack kip bounced off sarges fist slammed into a wall folded up into a very surprised pile of dirty laundry morley said sarge wasnt just a medic he did one tour training recruits i asked howd you teach that kind when you were in the army sarge aint dat hard garrett but foist ya do got ta get dere attenshun excellent in theory but we were dealing with cyprus prose who i feared could not be reached by mortal man the kid got up still looking surprised as he shook his head he started to say something sarge popped him again harder and moments later again harder still and that was all it took kip looked right at sarge as though really seeing him for the first time dere dats better lets you an me talk boy then a miracle occurred kip paid attention morley opined i believe it has to do with sarge having no emotional investment everyone else who ever tried to teach the boy manners didnt want to hurt him down deep he always knew theyd pull their punches and theyd give up after theyd failed a few times so he learned to outlast them sarge doesnt have an investment he doesnt care if the kid lives or dies hell just keep on hitting harder and harder until he gets results people sense that they give him their direction the way the boy has ouch sarge had smacked kip again this time turning him ass over appetite a smart mouth always calls for a little reminder let the master work a while youll be glad you did so i did i kept one ear turned sarges direction while morley and i tried to figure out what the hell id gotten myself into this time sarge talked to kip softly gently probing his core knowledge of courtesy and the social graces kip knew the forms what he lacked was any understanding sarge managed to pound a few insights into his thick youngadult skull i told morley that sonofabitch just went up about ten notches on my approval board he had me fooled you think he could do anything with a blasphemous parrot where is the lovable mr big im sure hes out there somewhere spying on me morley chuckled but said only theres more to almost anyone once you get to know them garrett but you knew that already its the kind of thing youre always throwing at me when ive decided its time to break some totally deserving jerks arm most of the time he goes for the neck actually thats different oh absolutely garrett at the risk of causing you a seizure because of my departure from the norm youre full of shit morley gets a kick out of arguing morals and ethics with anybody wholl sit still for it i said i need to get going i only wanted to get the word to reliance youre beginning to pile up a real debt i dont think so you do still recollect who it was who didnt bother to tell his buddy that he was lugging a coffin full of vampire to a certain meeting with the gentleman who was the kingpin before our current lovable chodo contague what was that villains name dotes rolled his eyes looked to heaven and to hell im never going to hear the end of that am i im never going to hear the end of that nope at least not while i have a parrot on staff hey kip its time to take you home naturally kip had to find out if it was possible to resurrect the old order i told him i learned something today too bottom line what it adds up to is i dont put up with any more attitude from you you give me any crap i pop you you dont behave like a human being i hit you even harder than sarge did sarge is a good man but he never was a marine i led kip to kayne proses coop kayne was pleased kayne squealed in delight like a girl younger than her daughter she hugged and kissed her baby she hugged and kissed her babys rescuer she refused to turn the latter loose until he promised her an opportunity to demonstrate her gratitude more fully but when the smoke cleared away and the emotions settled out kayne still had sewing to do she asked me to take kip home where i found his sister cassie trying on a new personality this one was much more appealing this one was very friendly indeed i account it a miracle that i was able to escape still wearing my trousers trailing a maybe later that started me drooling every time i thought even a little bit about cassie doap what a life rhafi did get the job one of the good things to happen in my life has been the unshakable friendship ive formed with max weider the brewery magnate ive done several jobs for max they didnt all work out the way we hoped but we did become friends of the sort who trust one another absolutely where money and women are not concerned max has a very lovely daughter named alyx alyx is a bit of an adventuress in her own mind alyx could complicate things without even trying a new man answered the door at the weider mansion max doesnt go out much anymore like the old majordomo this characters pointy nose spent most of its time higher in the air than did that of any member of the weider family that nose wrinkled when he saw me i told him go tell gilbey that garrett is here its business i cooled my heels outside until i began to suspect that the majordomo hadnt bothered to deliver my message manvil gilbey max weiders lifelong sidekick wasnt as keen on me as everyone would be in a perfect world but he was certain to let new help know how do you get a job like that if youre the employer how do you find somebody to do it the door opened this time manvil gilbey himself stood on the other side behind him lurked a disappointed doorman im sorry garrett rogers only started yesterday in all the confusion i forgot to let him know that youre one of the people we always want to see is there something going on at the brewery could be but this dont have anything to do with it i told the doorman thanks for nothing bubba hey gilbey how do you go about finding and hiring a guy who can be snooty about opening doors max is in the study napping when last i checked lets go up maybe if you needle him a little hell show some interest in life are you involved in anything i believe it would be useful if we had you work your magic at a few of the smaller breweries weve acquired the past couple of years two or three of them keep showing some screwedup numbers you kept the original workforces right top to bottom max always did till individuals proved themselves not worth keeping weider wasnt sentimental about deadwood or crooks we only put in a handful of our takeover guys to study their processes we try not to change the final product unless its really awful but we do look for ways to increase profitability youd be amazed how many inefficiencies persist in this industry simply because things have always been done a certain way from the day they launched their first brewing operation weider and gilbey had produced a quality product the most efficient way possible today they control seventy percent of the humandirected brewing in the city and they have shares in many of the nonhuman breweries even ogres understand enhanced profit margins and good beer gilbey pushed through the second floor door to maxs study held it for me i passed through into the heat max always has a bonfire going in the fireplace there these days i missed a step max had aged a decade in the weeks since last id seen him he used to be a little roundfaced redcheeked bald on top smiling twinklingeye sort of guy not now he looked terrible he had suffered a severe decline in a very short time which wasnt that huge a surprise life had been exceedingly cruel to max of late hed had two children murdered and his wife pass away all on one horrible day max wasnt napping after all garrett i see that youre not here to brighten my day and that your wardrobe has begun to decline already i guess im just a naturalborn slob do we have trouble on the floor again not that im aware of manvil did ask me to check out a couple of the new satellite breweries and ill get to that right away before the end of the week but what i came for this time is to beg the borrow of some business expertise weider steepled his spidery blueveined fingers in front of his nose the rheum went out of his eyes his now nearly gaunt face showed a bit of light id managed to pique his interest gilbey who had moved to a post beside his employers chair shot me a look that told me to get on with it while there was a chance of getting max interested and engaged i could do this i know how to keep a corpse awake and interested sometimes manvil gilbey isnt just max weiders number one lieutenant hes his oldest and closest friend they go back to their war years together which makes for a hell of a bond what it is i said is that ive stumbled across this kid who invents things all kinds of things some are completely weird some are completely useless and some are really neat what i want is for somebody with a lot more commercial sense than ive got to eyeball the inventions and tell me if im fooling myself when i think somebody could get rich making some of them ah max said another business opportunity first time this week weve been offered the chance to get in on the ground floor isnt it manvil i pretended to miss his sarcasm im not looking for anybody to go in on it with me i have that part worked out if i could just have manvil give me his honest opinion of the stuff in the kids workshop and if it matches mine ill see if the tates want to manufacture them now that the wars over there isnt much demand for the army boots and leather whatnots theyve been making for the last sixty years max asked whats your take manvil he was well aware of my precarious relationship with one of the tate girls and he thought i was a raving romantic instead of a tough lone honest man battling to scourge evil from the mean streets which is what i know that i really am as long as i dont have to get up before noon to work the flails i think friend garrett might be even less devious than weve always thought you werent going to cut us in garrett huh why should i you guys already got more money than god and more work than max stilled me with a wave see what hes got manvil garrett willard tate is a good choice hes an excellent manager and he does have that gorgeous redheaded niece besides he knows about tinnie because tinnie and his daughter alyx are friends i like your thinking there maybe because a garrett involved with a tinnie tate again meant a garrett not involved with any weider daughters we may be friends but hes also a father max leaned his head back and closed his eyes end of consultation for now manvil actually smiled id managed to get his buddy interested in something at least for a little while sounds like a riot i said gilbey and i in the weider coach were nearing playmates stable possibly it was a neighborhood war a lot of sturdy subject types armed with knives and cudgels were trying to adjust the larcenous attitudes of the biggest daytime mob of ratmen id ever seen there were dozens of them and things werent going their way the street was littered with ratmen already down the survivors were trying to retreat burdened with booty and just as manvil and i arrived the domains of chaos spewed another ingredient into the cauldron at least twenty more ratmen appeared they attacked the smashandgrab guys with a ferocity i hadnt seen since the islands they were determined to leave bodies behind and they got as good as they gave i leaned out the coach door and told our driver just stay real still and try to think invisible thoughts till this blows over whats happening gilbey asked there was no color left in his face he didnt get out on the town much we seem to have strayed into the middle of a factional skirmish amongst members of the ratman underworld what it was before it turned into that i wont know until i get a chance to look around but i had a feeling it boded no good for me and my industrial schemes your life is never dull is it a little dull wouldnt hurt some days ive thought about calling my autobiography trouble follows me the problem with that is the troubles in my life are usually waiting when i get there the battle outside turned tricornered playmates sturdy subject type neighbors couldnt tell one ratman from another and most of them just plain welcomed a chance to whack on a thieving ratman anyway whistles sounded in the distance the guards were gathering i expected that like the watch before them they would move in only after they were confident that they had nobody to deal with but people who couldnt crawl away i slipped down out of the coach better stay in here for now manvil no problem i used up my adventurous side a long time ago one thing thats never in short supply around playmates stable is the rough hemp twine his hayandstraw man uses to bundle his products before he brings them into town playmate saves the twine and gives it back i gathered a load and started tying rats neighbors thought that was a marvelous idea and joined right in not that one i told one of the sturdy subjects the ones wearing the green armbands are the good guys sort of we can fail to see them getting away if theyre able to go that earned me some dark looks but no real arguments emotions were surprisingly cool considering i tied fourteen ratmen personally before the guard arrived there were more still unbound almost all of the neighbors had started to carry playmates possessions back into the stable they ignored instructions not to disturb the evidence most of that i noted was stuff that had been looted from kips workshop i returned to the weider coach come on lets see if they left anything i can show you to my delight the threewheel my threewheel hadnt been disturbed thiss the main thing i want to make the biggest thing right here watch this i climbed aboard zoomed around as best i could in the confined space i can see every rich family in town wanting one of these for a toy come on try it as gilbey was trying to get the hang of making the big front wheel turn in the correct direction i caught a sound from behind me and whirled expecting an attack from some desperado ratman whod been knocked down earlier or whod gone into hiding when the tide had turned what i found was a weak crosseyed playmate trying to get up from where hed been laid low by a blow to the head i gave him a hand up which wasnt the best thing to do for him in his condition i supported him till he could get his backside planted on a bale of hay and his spine pressed against a post how bad does it look garrett i was checking the top of his head youre going to need a real surgeon youve got a piece of scalp peeled back the wound needs cleaning you need a bunch of stitches youre going to be enjoying headaches for days what did they want they never told me but they meant to haul off everything kip ever made didnt i warn you yes you did hows winger i dont know i havent seen her she supposed to be here ill look around manvil would you keep an eye on my friend here you remember how to deal with a head injury dont let him go to sleep i found no sign of winger anywhere i went back to playmate you sure winger was still here i still have fresh blisters on my ears from the language she used when this started garrett she was busting up ratmen like she was killing snakes or something they wont be good to her if they took her away you garrett i jumped i hadnt heard this guy come in he was way shorter than me but plenty wide and all muscle he had big brushy eyebrows that met in the middle over meanlooking little blue eyes that surely concealed a bright mind he was clad in businesslike apparel that managed to look shoddy even though it was relatively new i knew what he was before i asked who wants to know i do lucius browling extraordinary guard services reporting straight to the director lucius browling didnt offer to shake neither was he rude or confrontational the director what director director relway of the emergency committee for royal security good old relway count on him to paint the outside of his house of righteous thugs with colorful highsounding monikers monikers that would change as fast as people figured out that each was a hollow mask for something more sinister probably in that case garrett just left if you hurry you can catch him hes a little weaselyfaced guy with a skinny black mustache you know all of you guys would get along with the world a lot better if you could just figure out what it means to have a sense of humor quite possibly you have a point the director occasionally mentions how much he values your opinion perhaps you can raise the matter personally once we get to the alkhar he raised a hand to forestall my next question colonel block and the director both want to consult you concerning recent events im just a messenger just one of a dozen egs men in the field hoping to run into you at one of your known haunts implications implications they knew i wasnt at home there was no point fighting it ill be with you in a minute then let me wrap up here i stepped over to gilbey manvil had been smart enough to get off the threewheel before any outsider could get a good idea of what he was doing right now he was just a civilian who happened to be hanging around tell max let me know what you guys think i turned playmate i want you to go see drak shevesh about your head ive used him hes the best there is and it wont bother him that youre human i told lucius browling i was ready he didnt cheer he didnt say much either which was just as well i was a little preoccupied trying to spot the goddamn parrot and being worried about winger i did tell browling if your people have any real interest in what happened here you should round up a bounty hunter named bic gonlit he had something to do with it somehow i was getting piqued with bic he was as stubborn about sticking to his job as i could be colonel block was in a formal mood when browling led me into the biggest chamber id yet seen inside the city prison it appeared to be several cells converted into a meeting room there was a large table of mediocre quality some uncomfortable chairs no windows and not nearly enough light you could hide werewolves and vampires in the shadowy corners today those only held deal relway playing ghost lucius browling vanished as soon as id been delivered three other silent men were present nobody introduced anybody i didnt push those three likely told block what to do and when to do it and whether or not to smile while he did it they had that hill look block said weve gotten back our first reports from the country garrett wow you guys move fast when you want to i take it something didnt go the way you wanted our people found physical evidence and local witnesses to corroborate your report but your silver elves were gone so the girl who got away mustve come back to rescue the others elven enemies possibly having more in common than silver elves and people do or maybe it had to do with wanting a ride home block continued the diskshaped flying engine was gone as well the pearshaped flying engines had been destroyed melted down in a heat so fierce theyd sunk right down into the earth a search of the area produced nothing but these he showed me several of the gray fetish things similar but not identical to one another without invitation i suggested if they were that thorough about cleaning up after themselves youd better consider the possibility that those things there were meant to be found a small stir the observers exchanged uneasy glances you been holding anything back on us garrett relway asked from his shadow deal block cautioned garrett its a pertinent question despite deals tone i wondered if relway ever got to be the nice guy and the answer is probably without meaning to remember i brought this stuff to you guys i dont have any idea what you need to know let alone anything at all about the much vaster category of want to know we dont need to get into any pissing contests garrett i have a job all i want to do is to get it done and im not up for any macho headbutting either where we have trouble is you dont want me to know why you want to know what you want to know you even probably dont want me to know what you want to know whichll really make it impossible to answer your questions intelligently but youll still put the blame on me when you dont hear what you want to hear chances are good youll even accuse me of lying or holding out one of the observers made a gesture block cocked his head slightly although i wasnt included in i understood that there was some communicating going on in much the same fashion as when i conversed with the dead man a very small handful of the most powerful of our wizardly overlords have been able to develop that talent i was able to read the emotional overtones a man entered the room his interruption earned him frowns from everyone but me i didnt care he whispered to relway briefly relway studied me as though hed just suffered a mild surprise that did nothing to make me more comfortable colonel block admitted your argument has considerable merit garrett in private i wouldve accused him of being a poetaster or some other artsy critter equally heinous in front of people where i might embarrass him i said only my thinking is that were all on the same side despite maybe having different goals there was a sign from another of the observers i shut up because i could sense that this particular guy had taken a negative shine to me and wasnt likely to invest a great deal of patience in me block said these silver elves seem to control a lot of powerful sorcery the flight thing being only the most obvious wed very much like to explore some of those secrets and right now youre the closest thing to an expert on them as exists and ive given you everything wait a minute theres casey though you should know about casey on your own casey the only silver elf ive actually talked to his name is something really weird he prefers casey he claims to be a cop he says he was sent out to arrest two elves nobodys seen except maybe one crazy teenage boy a boy who after i grilled him mercilessly turned out to have no clue how to find any elves a boy who couldnt even find his own way home without help casey wasnt sure what crimes the fugitives had committed and he didnt care that was for his judges to worry about he had an apartment i gave the directions and details and recommended extreme caution on the parts of any investigators questions arose i answered as many as i could relway had another visit from the whisperer he took an opportunity to do some whispering of his own to colonel block before he left the room in a hurry to put together a raid on caseys place i assumed once he was gone block said therere people here looking for you garrett legal type people did browling do something wrong did he manhandle you or insult you or in any way demonstrate a lack of courtesy i paused definitely puzzled but then observed either youre really naive or you just dont understand what you and relway have created there isnt any need for lucius browling to be anything but lucius browling for alarms to sound and people to get upset he didnt get it we didnt lapse into a philosophical pissing contest in front of the wizards for such they surely were in mufti you arent a prisoner garrett you arent under arrest youre an expert we called in to help us with a particular problem and i wish youd tell those people that evidently theyre making life very difficult for the staff up front they wont go away just because you trot me out what kind of legal beagle is going to take the word of a man whos in the hands of thank you mr garrett i suspect that ive just learned a valuable lesson and that ill be happy that relway wasnt here to pick it up as easily might i request your presence and assistance for as long as it takes relway to investigate that elfs hideout ill provide a small honorarium ill go tell the folks in the waiting room but if theyre the kind of people i think they are they wont leave until i do block glowered and i was right about the lawyers the casey raid was a disaster for the secret police almost everything had been removed from the place except for an extensive array of booby traps most of them so cunning there was no way to detect them before they did their evil work there were two corpses in the place when we got there relway told us according to people in the building both were tenants who sprang traps while they were looting the place theyd been there a while they were getting ripe the same people told us the elf came back this morning beatup and dirty he did whatever he did in his apartment then went through the building reclaiming his stolen stuff which he loaded into a waiting wagon he did leave a few things behind because he didnt have time to recover everything he was still there at it just ten minutes before we arrived but somehow he knew we were coming at ten minutes he dropped everything and took off i offered a suggestion look for a livery stable in the neighborhood a place that has donkeys stabled possibly for rent and dont count on being able to recognize this guy if you run into him he loves disguises and he has sorceries that help him look like other people and some of the other elves have demonstrated the ability to make themselves invisible what was that about a donkey i rehashed my first encounter with casey disguised as bic gonlit and then explained that the real bic gonlit seemed to be making his living working for ratman crime bosses these days and that i suspected that the raid on playmates stable had been incited by the false bic block wanted to explore the whole bic gonlit question more closely there seemed to be one long coincidence right in the middle of things that being that both bic gonlits would cross my path on unrelated matters it probably wasnt total coincidence i mused but im confident that theres no grand plot in order to pretend to be bic gonlit casey wouldve had to get close to the real bic to study him so bics probably had an unexpected friend during recent months you might see what he has to say about that colonel block gave me a hard look id just set poor bic up for some difficult times but block said suppose there isnt a coincidence is it possible that this casey wanted to pull you in maybe so hed have somebody who really knows tunfaire looking for the two elves he wants to find i considered the almost compulsive need i had at times for finding lastyr and noodiss it could be i think it could be so did that make it the grand plot that i was confident didnt exist i dont think so i have a feeling there was a lot of opportunism and seizing the day going on around me particularly by casey and bic gonlit none by me of course im too damned dumb and then some its been another long day colonel i said and i dont see how i can possibly be any more help no matter how much i might want to be other than to get those people up front out of your hair i was curious about that i didnt know anybody in the legal profession not well anyway lawyerdom is a small community with very little official standing outside the realm of commercial relations and you do know where to find me if you need me block seemed distracted as he said all right youre right you might as well go home as i rose i said heres an idea everything that used to belong to the elves whatever youve managed to gather up isolate it somewhere try not to talk out loud around it and if you try to figure out how somethings magic works make sure you dont give away any of your own i really believe they can spy on us through those little gray blocks somehow colonel block got up and walked me out himself once we were well away from that meeting room and the heart of his little empire he asked you do know who those people were dont you not specifically who i know what all right listen to this youve crossed paths with two of those three before as i understand it one of them doesnt like you even a little bit i dont know what you did to inconvenience him when or where but hes definitely not big on forgive and forget if we convene one of these brainstorming sessions again consider the remote possibility that you might do yourself the most good by not volunteering any information or suggestions they dont trust anything they dont have to work to get theyre cynical at a level that makes your cynicism look like playacting i didnt argue i didnt see any point i wasnt quite sure i got the point he was trying to make either he was sort of doing that sidewise friend thing where he thought he didnt dare be direct i guess he was telling me to watch my back where spooky people off the hill were involved to me that didnt seem like a lesson that needed to be taught to anyone over the age of seven the legal talent had been laid on first by the weider brewing consortium manvil gilbey being quick on the draw later a gentleman had arrived who allegedly was associated with a rather more sinister enterprise harvester temisk has been the legal point man for chodo contague for ages he continues to handle some things in chodos name even though belinda is in charge now secretly which likely is no secret to him i couldnt imagine how harvester temisk couldve gotten involved with my problems and he wasnt the least bit forthcoming when i asked all he had to say was i want you to come see me as soon as your current calendar clears inasmuch as his presence mightve led to my elevation from detainee to paid consultant i told him id look him up as soon as i could i was profuse in my gratitude to the weider man too a skinny little critter with a balding head a huge brush of a mustache and the oddball name congo greeve neither lawyer couldve done a lot for me legally speaking because the guard were pretty much making things up as they went what the lawyers appearance did was put the guard on notice that influential people were concerned about my welfare and influence nepotism cronyism and bribery are how the system works deal relways mad notions of universal justice and meritocracy notwithstanding and the actual producers and the gangsters have far more influence than our masters on the hill see as reasonable i first spotted the goddamn parrot when i was only a block from home that animated feather duster was getting too clever about going unnoticed and just after i spotted the bird i realized that i hadnt been entirely forthright during my interview id forgotten to mention my elven house guests in fact id forgotten them completely take care garrett there are unfriendly ratmen in the neighborhood that seemed hard to credit after so many had gone down at playmates stable still old bones isnt in the habit of being excitable it turned out there were only two unfriendly ratmen and one of those had a limp so profound he was no threat to anyone but himself the uncrippled individual approached me in a manner so bold that people on the street turned to marvel mr garrett guilty this close to the dead man i didnt feel any special risk what do you need i bring a message from john stretch he has the woman winger this ratman was no pular singe i could barely understand him as a point of information garrett this fellow is john stretch he has only a handful of followers left most of them injured he fears they will desert him if he demonstrates any hesitance or lack of resolve couldnt happen to a more deserving guy i hope they enjoy a long and prosperous marriage the ratman appeared nonplussed john stretch says he will trade the woman winger for the female pular singe hell so would i youre kidding right one of my friends put you up to pulling my leg right who was it you can help me get him back the ratman was confused this wasnt going anything like he planned john stretch says he will harm the woman winger john stretch isnt likely to live long enough to harm anybody or to make deals with anybody rather than making more enemies john stretch ought to be trying to find himself some new friends bic gonlit yes indeed i might do business if bic gonlit was available for trade the ratman had been difficult to understand when he was delivering a rehearsed message now i had to rely on a relay from the dead man in order to grasp what he was trying to say you do not want the woman winger what would i do with her nope shes all yours and shes going to take some feeding ill tell you but i am strongly interested in getting my hands on bic gonlit bic gonlit has messed me around a couple of times lately im ready to settle up perhaps that could be arranged the ratman looked thoughtful actually therere two bic gonlits the real bic is short for a human male he wears white boots covered with fake gemstones the second bic is a pretender hes a little taller and never wears boots this false bic gonlit has created a lot of mischief i believe he was responsible for the bad advice that led to the disaster at the stable today the ratman had questions suddenly he had big trouble asking them without revealing that he was himself john stretch he was no genius but he did understand that he wasnt going to come out on top if we got into a scuffle i told him the false bic is really a wicked elf who has disguised himself so the real bic will get blamed for the evil he does i still havent figured out why he wants to cause strife and unhappiness i guess he just does maybe its fun i didnt believe that but it sounded like the sort of behavior and motivation that would make sense to a john stretch john stretch was a recordsetter of a ratman he had berries the size of coconuts but limited smarts to go with them though a lack of brains never has been a huge handicap in tunfaires underworld guts and daring get you ahead faster i want them both but the false bic more than the other the ratman twitched mad as hell but he maintained his selfcontrol i will inform john stretch what should i tell him about the woman winger i dont know shes his problem you could let him know shes involved with the call and that one of her lovers is deal relway of the guard he might find that information useful when he decides how to dispose of her the call is a virulently racist veterans organization armed and organized as a private political army it shares a good many goals with deal relway i wouldnt want to be a ratman who came to the calls attention because id done harm to a human woman and deal relway is deal relway increasingly the bogeyman to all those who practice wickedness in tunfaire i stopped to visit with some of the pixies from brief encounters i knew two of the youngsters by sight a daring boy who called himself shakespear and a young lady named melondie kadare who was so sweet and pretty i wished i could whack her with a transmogrification stick and grow her up to my size melondie was the pixie who had followed me into the alley out back on the occasion of my first encounter with a silver elf in a bic gonlit disguise back then shed been a precocious curious adolescent now she was a serious refined young woman more or less when the old folks were looking pixie lives race away far faster than our own i think that may be why were uncomfortable around the little people theyre so much like us in miniature their swiftly lived lives remind us piquantly that our own more numerous hours are still painfully and perfectly numbered singe let me into the house moments after the goddamn parrot evidently under the illusion that he was some kind of eagle slammed down onto my right shoulder and tried to carry me off to his aerie he couldnt work up quite enough lift so he gave up i feared singe was going to climb all over me exactly the way id wished about a thousand young women of passing acquaintance wouldve done in days of yore and she mightve done so if the sexier silver elf hadnt come out of the dead mans room to see what was happening she wore a tattered old shirt probably taken from deans ragbag it mightve served as a childs nightshirt before it acquired all those holes it was barely sufficient to cover the subject most of the time that was distracting even on her because there was nothing but her underneath the tatters maybe it was some sort of experiment by his nibs singe settled for clinging to my arm so what great adventures did you get to enjoy out there today while the rest of us were locked up here dying of boredom i detached the goddamn parrot from my shoulder i traded you to john stretch for two bic gonlits and a sugarcured ham i tossed the jungle chicken in the general direction of his perch in the small front room what singe shrieked john stretch really wants you you really turned his head garrett do not be a fool miss pular is about to fly into a panic what you are saying means more to her than it should im sorry singe im sorry i didnt mean that like it sounded i was teasing you yes i did tell john stretch that id trade you for two bics but his chances of garrett all right singe no matter what i told john stretch im not letting you go nobody is going to take you away so relax take some time again to see if you cant figure out when youre being teased and ill try to rein it in if i can humans seldom speak straightforwardly and direct i find that frustrating myself sometimes like almost every time i spend more than a few minutes in the company of most human women anyway even if i was that big a villain how likely is it that john stretch would keep his word because hes nothing but a slimy little rat you mean and we all know that ratpeople are nothing but stupid lazy lying thieving smelly animals while singe shouted the dead man passed along one or two points of interest well well the ratman who calls himself john stretch was born pound humility of the same female one litter before miss pular singe it may be that his interest in her is less political than personal miss pular suspects an unwanted brothers concern for his sisters welfare from the viewpoint of a ratman she would be making a huge mistake by getting involved with you whoa whoa singe im sorry i apologize that isnt what i meant at all i felt a variant of wingers question kicking in if the woman who heard it wasnt human was the man still wrong apparently so id tripped a triggerwire and i wasnt going to talk my way out of this one good to see that you are not going to deny that she is involved with you even if you do not feel that you are involved with her the dead man rescued me this once because this wasnt a hole id dug for myself without help and because singe was creeping up on the edge of true hysteria and if theres anything the dead man dislikes more than females in general or as a class its hysterical females there was one plus side to the whole emotional circus although ratgirls do get upset they dont shed tears the silver elf woman just kept standing there gaunt as famine himself in that old shirt taking the scene in with those huge strange eyes she didnt seem frightened anymore i wondered how much she was picking up from the dead man dean brought food and drink to the dead mans room he seemed to have adjusted to the extended presence of guests he and singe in particular seemed to have achieved a sound accommodation after relating my extensive adventures i asked the dead man have you been able to learn anything from our elven guests a great deal beginning with the obvious fact that they are not actually elves nor are they members of any similar or familiar species nor are they a mixture of familiar species nothing that i have learned by the way was provided to me voluntarily they suspect but do not yet know that they have revealed a great deal about themselves and their kind this one knows herself as evas which is the diminutive for something even i cannot fathom the other is fasfir and was the captain of their party of three they have much more complex interior lives than human beings yet seem to envy your emotional freedoms fasfir curiously seems to have a rudimentary sense of humor all right your talents are mighty and your cleverness surpasses anything the world has ever seen what do we know now that we didnt know yesterday we now know that casey is what he claims to be an officer of their law sent here a year ago to arrest lastyr and noodiss insofar as i can decipher the images in evas mind which is much easier to penetrate than is fasfirs those two are religious missionaries originally sent out by an outlaw cult known as the brotherhood of light proselytization is a major crime under the laws of these people casey is supposed to arrest them simply for their intent to proselytize they stole the skyship they used to come here they were not skilled in its operation they crashed it into the river their motives for teaching kip to invent things have to do with wanting him to create things that have to exist before they can begin to make the tools that they will need to fix their ship which takes them into another entire realm of crime entirely apparently that of revealing the secrets of state sorcery another department sent out evas and her companions to seize lastyr and noodiss for betraying sorcerous secrets the fact of those crimes having been included in caseys reports which somehow leaked over to the competing bureau if they needed a ship why didnt they just go down to the waterfront and hire one evidently the journey is too long to make in a normal sailing ship which supposedly cannot travel fast enough to make it to their country in even a loghyrs lifetime wow what else could i say ive always known that the world is bigger than what ive experienced in my thirty years but distances on that scale are beyond my comprehension and what about the elves from the flying disk who are they still more cops they appear to be something resembling a sorcerer who though he spends his whole lifetime studying magic and discovering new things about it never does anything more practical with his discoveries than just write the information down they are members of a fraternity where the search for knowledge is an end in itself the excitement about lastyr and noodiss alerted them to the existence of karenta and tunfaire so they assembled an expedition to come study us apparently they wanted to grab kip prose because their ship is suffering its own problems and they thought that if they could open communications with lastyr and noodiss working together they could produce one working vessel from the two cripples i do stumble into the weird stuff and you cant get much weirder than this these last four may also have been doing commercial surveys of some sort as a condition of gaining financial support for their research at least one of them may be a ringer who really works for a law enforcement bureau that somehow oversees commerce fasfir holds all four in complete contempt at the same time she is convinced that they are her crews only chance of ever getting home if their aerial ship can be made capable of completing one more long voyage fasfir sees two ways of accomplishing that one calls for an improbable amount of good luck making repairs to the one aerial ship you saw up close in the wine country the other requires that she and her friends find lastyr and noodiss so that their wrecked flying ship can be cannibalized to make repairs to the other fasfir is much more knowledgeable than is evas who seems to be the junior member of the mission the creature casey will have a ship of his own hidden somewhere of course there is a general consensus that he will rescue no one but himself he feels no responsibility for the others but he will take lastyr and noodiss back as prisoners and fasfir is afraid that those two might be ready to surrender they came here to save karentine souls and teach karentines forbidden magics that would make their lives easier but after a year of exposure to our savage ways she fears even those two have to have become convinced that we deserve our damnation not exactly original thinking there a quick visit to the chancery steps will expose you to all the outrage against the moral destitution of our times that you can possibly stand most of us are so povertystricken morally that we dont realize that were missing something according to the rantandravers it was unoriginal when i was a stripling it is a long slide indeed that never reaches bottom you ever find any way to communicate with them directly i have not yet given the matter much consideration however and despite any pretense to the contrary this one understands spoken karentine perfectly they have a sorcery which allows them to learn very quickly meaning she was tracking my part of the conversation exactly ouch but is there any solid reason for us to hide evas stood motionless regarding me with those huge unblinking eyes possibly trying to see inside me to the place where i was listening to the dead man i wondered if she was having any success i conjured a vivid erotic vision of the two of us rather energetically being boys and girls together the dead man made his disgust known immediately the silver elf did not though by happenstance there was a huge crash in the kitchen i did get a somewhat puzzled look from singe which confirmed my suspicion that she might be slightly sensitive herself very slightly for which be grateful had she viewed that image we might be dealing with hysteria all over again you know i still ache all over anytime i sit still for very long i dont want to be a detective anymore today and when i get up tomorrow i just want to be an accountant trying to figure out how to make sure we get paid for all of this can they read and write i do not know and now i can no longer see inside evas head without hammering my way in for some reason she has begun to suspect that someone here might be able to read her mind you would not have any notion why she might suspect that would you i shrugged it didnt seem likely did it im not usually much concerned about money as long as ive got some i was growing concerned because of this mess though we were spending and spending and spending to hire help and buy food and there seemed to be an ever smaller likelihood of us managing any return on investment kip was back home with his family the silver elves seemed to have lost interest in him after the country confrontation they all knew that he couldnt finger lastyr and noodiss but old bones was having him one hell of a good time i could tell this thing was the most fun hed had in years it was something new these two weird women evas and fasfir were to him as exciting and alluring as was my friend katie to me i said thiss the least violent least traditional thing weve ever been into im not comfortable with it at all the stakes are trivial and these silver elves are too alien for me to find very interesting perhaps you will feel differently in the morning try considering the stakes from a viewpoint not your own i will be doing that myself now that i have the mind time free one obvious avenue of exploration is the possible dangers the lords of the hill fear those old paranoids are only scared because they think the whole world is infested with people as cruel and wicked and meanspirited as they are true but that does not render them automatically wrong in every instance they can be afraid in a huge way because it is possible for them to have huge enemies to make life terrible not just for them but for us all just one of these silver elves needs to be wicked and willing to use their weird but powerful sorcery against us he was right about that those people controlled some very strange powers he was right about me feeling differently in the morning too for reasons entirely unrelated to any remotely within his consideration at the time i wakened suddenly thinking those pixies had to go but they were quiet instead there was a weak light burning and i wasnt alone in my bed when i turned to tell singe yet again that this couldnt happen a spidery gray finger fell upon my lips another spidery finger touched a large eye then tapped my temple oh boy what was this the silver elf woman evas knelt on the edge of my bed shed seen that naughty image after all and shed brought a sheaf of papers with her i recognized them theyd all been in my office on my desk before id come upstairs evas could read and write karentine and shed been a busy little scribbler she placed the papers in my hands the top sheet said simply teach me she removed that raggedy short shirt and again placed a finger on my lips when i started to tell her to go away that petite form definitely did have its appeal suddenly i couldnt resist wondering about its possibilities later i would wonder if there was any chance my thoughts had been guided from outside evas moved the top sheet of paper to the bottom of the stack followed a story of an extremely ancient people who ages ago had decided to set aside the insidious and constant distortions of the intellect that are caused by the stormy demands of sexual reproduction i could relate to that some would claim that im intellectually distorted most of the time i confess freely that id be much more respectable and much less emotionally vagrant if the gods hadnt seen fit to bless and curse the rest of us with women evas declared herself a despicable throwback who suffered wicked urges and curiosities all the time shed fought those successfully until now only because shed always been surrounded by people who wouldnt let her get into situations where she might embarrass herself here tonight she had an opportunity to pursue the curiosities that were driving her mad and her people would never be the wiser chances were excellent that such an opportunity would never come to her again she knew the mechanics shed taken advantage of her ability to move around unseen to indulge her curiosity intellectually they all had she was the only one who hadnt been repelled back to sheet one and teach me hers was a whole new entirely intellectual approach to the art of seduction backed up by what my rude senses could gather of her mental state evas wasnt kidding and in that weak light she looked far more exotic and desirable than weird i had fallen into every redblooded boys favorite daydream at some point evas took time out to use a thin fingertip to trace letters on my skin to pass me the message i will not break she wanted me to know that she wasnt nearly as fragile as she looked good morning sunshine dean told me nudging me to let me know hed brought my tea i was halfasleep at the breakfast table unable to stop grinning i grunted odd youre smiling and you got to bed at a reasonable hour for once but youre as crabby as a mountain boozelt them damned pixies they never shut up all night long he didnt challenge me that could only mean that he didnt know any better singe appeared obviously having been up since the crack of dawn she was chipper though possibly more conspiratorial than ever she was pleasant to me nor was i getting any grief from the dead man when evas turned up she was coolly indifferent to everything but some tea heavily sweetened with honey she was exactly as she had been yesterday except possibly for projecting a somewhat more resigned attitude toward her captivity her sidekick fasfir though equally cool presented a puzzle she kept looking at me the way you might regard a twentyfoot python you found coiled atop the kitchen table repelled wary awed maybe a little intrigued and excited still nothing from the dead man that mustve been one hell of a dream id had especially since itd reawakened all my aches and pains and had added a few that were new evas might be willing to let me think it had been all a dream spawned by my wicked imagination but i noted with some satisfaction that she moved very carefully and did so mainly when she thought no one was paying attention fasfir noticed though so she knew my grin spread a little wider what evil thought just burst into your mind singe demanded there was an actual teasing edge to her voice nothing special just a warm memory once i finished eating and began to feel a little more awake i moved to my office i was feeling positive and eager to get things done but before i could start i had to go round up a pile of missing paperwork during the course of the morning various people came by the house most wanted money playmate was effusive with gratitude but didnt bring one copper sceat to defray the costs of my efforts to salvage his madonnas useless infant i responded to two written requests for clarification or additional information from the good people at the alkhar i received a note from manvil gilbey telling me that max weider wanted in financially the same messenger brought a sealed note from maxs daughter alyx who complained that she was dying of loneliness and that that was all my fault and when was i going to do something about it there were other notes in time including one from kayne prose inscribed for her by a professional letter writer that was meant to impress me and it did a little then there was a discreet letter from uncle willard tate who invited me to the tate compound for dinner because hed just enjoyed an intriguing visit from a certain manvil gilbey associated with the weider brewing empire the paper on which the letter was written had a light lilac scent the hand in which it had been inscribed was familiar and almost mocking it reminded me which redheaded greeneyed beauty managed the tate correspondence and accounts id have to gird my mental and emotional loins for that visit tinnie was sure to play me like a cheap kazoo if i was bold enough to venture onto her home ground the afternoon saw the arrival of a formal engraved invitation to participate in the celebration of chodo contagues sixtieth birthday party two weeks down the road and a just wanted to say hi note from solicitor harvester temisk implying that hed really like to visit before chodos birthday celebration dean began to grouse about having to answer the door constantly when he wasnt hard at work pursuing his custom of charming whatever woman happened to be staying in the house it was he who took evas far enough along to lure forth a spoken word of gratitude she didnt pronounce the word right and she had difficulty saying it but she did demonstrate that at least one silver elf besides casey came equipped with a capacity for speech yet one more talent unsuspected by us primitives until she betrayed herself possibly she was a throwback in more ways than the one fasfir didnt seem pleased i had begun to develop an idea of the personalities of our reluctant guests evas was cool and brilliant and collected and always in control in her own mind but in real life shed be her own worst enemy a sort of foreign kayne prose with a mind with her selfdestructive urges skewed at a different angle fasfir would be cool and collected and always in control but like the best officers and sergeants would be skilled at failing to see those transgressions which did not threaten the world with an immediate descent into chaos and anarchy singe invited herself into my office to preen and gossip there wasnt a lot to gossip about though unless she wanted to discuss the recipes dean had begun sharing with her i asked how close are you to your brother i didnt think family was important among ratpeople but had only prejudice and hearsay to go by i do not have a brother what does this one say she had started leafing through my papers which side with unerring accuracy she had chosen the side which said teach me i told her what does that mean i dont know this isnt a royal style business i dont have a few million people i can gouge for taxes anytime the urge takes me so i have to make do with whatever bits and pieces of paper come my way my stuff is on the other side i hoped singe hadnt done any poking around in here there were almost two dozen identical sheets of paper inside my desk drawer with both faces still virgin to the pen i stuck to my subject what do you mean you dont have a brother whats john stretch then oh well we do not see some things the same way you do humility belongs to the litter before mine he would have a different father ratpeople follow social and mating customs much closer to those of rodents than they do those of civilized beings such as myself chances were excellent that few of singes littermates shared the same father humility singe responded with one of her rehearsed shrugs so his real name is pular humility no it is pound humility thats right the dead man did tell me that his sire is believed to have been hurlock pound chances are good my mother managed to retain some choice and selfcontrol even during the peak of her season i hope i will have the strength to do the same though i am less likely to go into season as long as i remain in exile the name hurlock pound meant nothing to me never mind im too groggy to keep up with all that lets stick with john stretch why did you get upset yesterday when because i have spent too much time around you people i suppose and because humility was always good to me when i was little but now he wants to use you as a counter in his effort to make himself king of the ratmen just do not go hunting him all right that way i cannot blame myself for whatever he gets himself into i guess whatever the child was strange i was convinced that she didnt know what she wanted most of the time unlike her doomed brother she didnt know where she wanted to go then again im sometimes wrong i have been wondering garrett do you think it would be possible for me to learn to read and write so that was where shed been going when shed chosen that sheet of paper i gave it some thought because honestly ive never thought about it thats probably because of the prejudices all us humans are brought up with do you know any ratpeople who can read or write no reliance is the only one i know who needs to so he has a couple of slaves to keep his books and write his letters the same goes for the other ratman gangs i kept a straight face have you ever heard of anyone who tried to learn ive met some who wanted to learn wanted to try to learn but who would teach them who indeed nobody in tunfaire of whatever race wanted ratpeople getting notions taking on airs thinking above their station all right karentine is the main language in tunfaire so its what youll know best i recovered the sheet carrying the request teach me ironic do you know any of these letters by name she didnt then but half an hour later she knew them all and had a solid grasp on the concept of how characters and groups of characters represent the sounds that make up spoken words that was because shed paid attention most of her life to everything going on around her i sorted out every paper i had that had anything on it in evas handwriting which was actually laborious tiny printing and got that all put away we humans might ought to have you strangled right now singe i swear youre going to take over the world in a few more years for once she grasped the compliment she was learning in every direction i hoped she was as good in her heart as she seemed otherwise id be helping to create a monster i did hear the pixies get excited but missed the knock on the door id fallen deep into contemplation of eleanor who seemed to be contemplating me right back she didnt approve of the way id been running my life lately when eleanor disapproves i know its time to do some serious reassessment i thought i had a handle on it too dean stuck his head into the office therere some very nervous ratmen on the stoop john stretch john stretch one gave me that name im on my way bring them to my room i swung the door open get in here guys theyre watching the place most of the time these days bic bitty buddy howre you doing not too good i guess and casey as a second bic shuffled forward i know that must be you in that disguise screwed up eh damn john stretch you got them both i didnt think you could do it i made sure the door was solidly locked just to retard any attempt at a hurried exit go into the room behind the door on the right please dean these guys look like theyre starved singe where are you weve got company give dean a hand in my heart i was wondering if perhaps singe wasnt the only genius pup produced by her mother and this other pup did want to be in charge john stretch and his friends didnt know what to make of the dead man its hard to do him sitting there like an idol that gives off just a hint of bad aroma chances were excellent that theyd never run into a loghyr before it could be in fact that theyd never heard of the loghyr race they didnt know what to make of fasfir when she invited herself in either she drew plenty of attention from casey though casey seemed amazed to find her alive and more amazed to find her clad in ragged native garb but he kept his opinions to himself the dead man assured me that casey had closed his mind with a determination that was stunning for the time being he was locked up tighter than fasfir was he must suspect something either that or he was a naturalborn paranoid i took my seat damn again john stretch how in the world did you manage to round up these two interesting he has a talent of his own he can use his normal rat cousins to scout and spy for him much as i employ mr big though his reach is very much shorter than mine it couldnt be any other way i continued you put me in a nasty position john stretch my reputation for keeping my word is my most important asset last time we met i thought john stretch must be dim he wasnt not even a little he understood that i wanted to weasel out you agreed to a deal we have fulfilled our undertaking his karentine remained hard to follow but was adequately understandable his courage was beyond question ratmen dont talk back to humans let alone imply threats the problem is long before i made the deal with you i swore a solemn oath to singe that i wouldnt let any of you people drag her away from here and he knows that if he does not keep his word to me he will soon wish he was enjoying the torments of one of his human hells instead of basking in my displeasure singe staggered under the weight of a tray of hastily assembled sandwiches she set that on the little table began to help herself john stretch and his ratmen waited only long enough to get a nod from me before they assaulted the pile singe brought her muzzle within inches of john stretchs with her mouth full and crumbs in her whiskers she demanded what the hell do you think you are doing pound humility i am not a pawn in your game i will not be a pawn in your game i will not be a quiet obedient little ratgirl who lets herself be passed around like a weed pipe john stretch and his henchmen glared daggers at me this was all my fault this ratgirl getting uppity if garrett will not whip up on you and throw you out of here i will kick your mangy tail up between your hind legs myself then i will go to work on your idiot friends john stretch could not find words for a while finally he asked you are not a prisoner here what a prisoner you are an idiot i live here this is where i want to live gah i had a feeling that the cunning ratgirl had just jobbed me a strong hint of loghyr amusement supported that hypothesis that damned singe could think on her feet it is quite true that john stretch believed miss pular was in need of rescuing in addition to being a clever and competent criminal he appears to be an unabashed romantic and as vulnerable as you might want to hope from that quarter as was if you will believe it reliance in his time he was going to get bashed if he tried anything here john stretch lets you and me step over to my private office for a minute and talk man to man go ahead grab another sandwich before singe consumes the whole pile i started in while john stretch was still reeling from his first look at eleanor whatll your guys do if they find out everything theyve been through was just to rescue a ratgirl who refuses to be saved thereve been people killed a bunch have been dragged off to the alkhar you know their prospects are going to be dim there those will not be much worse than out on the streets the war is over there is no more work humans have no more motive to treat us with respect for those imprisoned the misery just will not last as long the stable disaster was bad luck bad timing added to the fact that we were not told just how much material we were expected to remove maybe you didnt know the temper of the neighborhood very well either of course we did not no ratpeople live there but the promised payoff seemed worth the risk it always does until the pain starts possession of pular singe is more than a personal matter all ratkind is watching yes i would have rescued her even having heard the words from her own mouth in karentine rather than cant i find it hard to believe that she prefers to live among humans ill tell you why you know the saying lower than a ratmans dog i know it i understand it ill tell you whats lower than a ratmans dog a ratwoman think about it he got it a point in his favor most ratmen wouldnt have if youd drawn them a picture that may be another reason why reliance considers her an important symbol she is living proof that things can be done in ways other than the ways they have always been done reliance has been advised by a higher power hes renounced his interest in singe in return the syndicate will let him live but hes just stupid enough to think hes clever enough to sneak around the outfit somehow so im going to invest in some rough insurance as soon as were done here you mean that singe is my friend pound humility shes one of the most remarkable people ive ever met of any species i want to see her become everything she can i want to see what she can become if shes given the chance despite the customs and politics of ratpeople despite the prejudices of everybody else you understand no but i can accept if singe is safe from reliance answer my question whatll your friends do if they find out what you were doing if we do not have possession of singe they might be angry enough to kill me thought so you ratfolk arent subtle people so maybe youll want a running start no wait a minute wait just a minute i might have an angle hang on here for a second i zipped across the hallway singe come out here yes bring the sandwich i shut the door behind her singe my sweet whatever happened to that nowyouseeme nowyoudont fetish we took off casey out in the country i knew we hadnt turned it over to the guard mainly because id forgotten all about it singes whiskers folded back way back the significance of which i intuited instantly oh no you didnt you wicked girl not only did she know about evas shed been there to watch you figured out how to work the box now she was a sorceress too and she hadnt said a thing old bones are you listening i am here then show singe what i want her to do there were too many untrustworthy ears in the place tonight and now the dead man knew about evas too he hadnt before though three people in the house did know evas must have some considerable skill at sealing memory blocks including those in minds not her own but i did know garrett because the pixies knew however it was none of my business he had nothing to say about his failure to be a direct witness himself but the pixies too who didnt know dean so far even fasfir even fasfir grrr he was right before this was personal stuff but when had that ever kept him from butting in with his opinion and why hadnt the senior elf woman blown up like a bad batch of beer now wasnt the time to worry we needed to get on with business keep singe posted on what im saying i returned to john stretch heres what well do singe will go with you all docile and bashful for your sake because we think itll be good to have you for a friend let all ratkind marvel at your coup but i want to warn you singe is going to vanish like a candle being snuffed i want you to lie low for a few days after that things will be going on with reliance and his like pay attention try not to repeat their mistakes after your luck turns john stretch had no idea what i was talking about but he listened hed know the whole story soon enough have another sandwich while singe gets ready stretch and his henchrats dug in eating with an amazing devotion i told stretch how he could pick up a little extra pocket change by hunting elves i continued to have this strong desire to meet lastyr and noodiss i heard singes distinctive step descending the stair i met her at its foot i told her i want you to be careful dont let anybody get close enough to get a good hold on you disappear first time theyre all looking at something else once you figure they cant blame it on john stretch dont leave a trail they can sniff out you care of course i care youre my friend i worry about you good it is all right you know you and evas or you and kayne prose or you and her daughter that sort of thing does not trouble ratfolk like it does your people i was curious evas suspected i was there after a while but by then she did not care if id had whiskers they wouldve been back far enough to tie behind my head the more i saw of singe the less well i seemed to know her maybe i needed to stop using her as a mirror please be careful i will be careful garrett because i mean to have my turn someday help what have we got with these two i asked the dead man after id seen the ratpeople into the street and after id turned the goddamn parrot loose to keep track of them singe needed watching reliance couldnt be blamed if he attacked his enemies and lo pular singe happened to be tromping around with them that wouldnt violate the letter of any agreement with higher powers other than a bigass grudge of course very little that is new or interesting mr bic gonlit did persist in trying to sell miss pular after you asked him to behave for which effort his reward has been to end up here traded for her bic winced badly he was getting the benefit of the dead mans wisdom the thoughts must have been particularly strong fasfir stirred back there in the darkness where she sat crosslegged atop a stool she wouldve been an elegant sight had there been enough light to reveal her none of the silver elves seemed to be acquainted with the concept of underwear or of modesty either officer casey did hire those ratboys who just left a great many of them going well beyond john stretchs gang they were supposed to steal everything from cypres proses workshop without exception evidently because caseys superiors had ordered him to see that it was all destroyed i didnt speak aloud just articulated my questions softly in the back of my throat he can do that he has the sorcery to be able to talk to people in another country evidently no wonder the hill crowd wanted to lay hands on these people i had trouble imagining the full power of the weapon that would be instantaneous communication there would be no defeating armies with that capacity indeed it is extremely difficult to dig information out of casey but it can be done slowly if one approaches the task with considerable patience he does not appear to be as adept at concealing himself as fasfir is when worked over time so maybe she can get him to cooperate you have any idea where his ship is its the only working one left if we knew where it was the rest of the silver elves would turn into our best friends quite likely and i do know where the ship is approximately approximately and or is it a but it would be something severe sorceries project it and actually finding it might be difficult our visitors do not envision spatial relationships the way you do they see different colors hear different sounds sense things you do not sense at all oh well will casey just do more mischief if we cut him loose he will try he is what he is he shares many of your character traits he will try to do the job he has agreed to do he has just recently received those orders concerning the eradication of inappropriate knowledge whatever that may mean i suspect that that means there is now an actual physical threat to cypres prose simply because he has so many wonderful ideas ideas he received from his elusive friends then well just have to keep him around here if he got too rambunctious i could always send him off for a wondrous vacation in the alkhar in a conversational sort of voice i said bic were going to give you one more chance to get out of our way with your ass still strapped onto the rest of you all itll take is for you to carry a letter from me to colonel block at the alkhar because i dont have time to handle it myself can you manage that without getting distracted knowing that the letter means enough to me that ill hunt you down and feed you your magic boots one from each end if my message doesnt get through within the hour garrett how come youre so damned determined to make my life miserable maybe youd better look at the facts bic who did what to who first i think your beef is with casey this critter right here dressed up like you he had you jumping through hoops by pretending to be kayne prose in heat while he was working kayne pretending to be you im so clever sometimes i can spot a pothole only minutes after ive stumbled into it and you and kayne both ended up screeching because you couldnt get all the way lucky old case couldnt pretend that part bic growled bic didnt want to listen to any damned theories look at him man he looks like you in a funhouse mirror a mirror that skinnied him down and tailed him up never mind im not going to argue till youre convinced so just give me your damned letter and let me out of here and dont forget to remember me in your will because ive treated you better than anybody else in town wouldve done i found myself lusting after a beer or something with a better kick i hadnt had a drop since our country picnic but i couldnt take time out now i had business to attend to outside the home bic id kiss you goodbye but then youd just come back for more i shut the door behind the little man at last leaned against it i sincerely hope that thats the last time i ever see bic gonlit the man was like a mosquito not a major problem but one persistent annoyance if you didnt kill him can he possibly have any other reason to buzz around my ear now suppose the guard arrest and question him i didnt think of that i hadnt which seemed real dim of me the second the subject came up but he will and hes clever enough not to let that happen i wish the bird was here to send out to watch him you might send a pixie they have not yet done much to earn their keep that seems a little dangerous for the pixies lets just trust bic to do what he said hed do im going to clean up and change now im heading up to the tate compound to see willard tate old chuckles failed to seize the opportunity though im sure he noted my unnecessary explanation of why i had to put myself in close proximity to a certain ferocious redhead who couldnt quite seem to decide how big a part of my life she wanted to be i think were in business i told the dead man when i returned in the wee hours a little lightheaded willard tate enjoys his brandies and loves to share his pleasures with people he likes he likes me right now the rest of the tates are wine people every one with a favorite vintage im not much on the spoiled grape juice myself i prefer that weider barley soup with plenty of hops but i couldnt be impolite when a taste was offered and it was hard to keep track of how much sipping i did when i was a little distracted off and on by tinnie and her wicked cousin rose i said ill have a sitdown with all the principals as soon as i arrange for morley to make space available i would take morley on a nostalgic voyage into his past returning the palms to the days when it was the joy house and neutral ground for meetings just like the one i planned he was a good friend he deserved to get the business excellent and though i do begrudge admitting it i believe you have suffered one of your better ideas this time did singe get back yet more than an hour ago all went well she ate and drank like a lumberjack then went to bed that child has an amazing capacity for beer if shes going to keep sucking it down here shed better start showing an amazing capacity for bringing in cash what about the jungle chicken still out there watching the alkhar now to see how the guard responds to your message theres only one response possible dont tell me they havent done anything nothing dramatic there have been comings and goings but not being familiar with the routine around the jail i do not know if they are unusual and it would behoove us to recall that we live in a political world what colonel block should do and what he is allowed to do might not be identical if someone important uphill happens to be an investor in reliances undertakings i know i know its a blackhearted world im going to go put away some beer myself then im going to sleep till noon a mans fondest dreams and dearest ideals often become stormtossed wrack upon reefs of reality i wakened to find myself already deeply involved in some extremely heavy petting evas had decided school was in again only it took a few moments of exploration to determine that tonights pupil wasnt evas perhaps fasfir had pulled rank fasfir was a dedicated student give her that her focus matched evas it seemed she wanted to practice till she got it right she didnt go away until people started stirring around the house good thing id announced that i meant to sleep in dean didnt get the word or didnt care he wakened me his stern look of disapproval was the one he reserved for my sloth brought out on occasions when he felt he couldnt state his opinion aloud he wouldve employed an entirely different and much uglier scowl had he known about evas or fasfir he told me you need to get up there are messages awaiting your attention and miss winger is in the street outside apprising the world of all your shortcomings i doubt that she hasnt had a chance to catalog them unless youve signed on as her adviser he plowed ahead and the workmen have arrived he said that last quickly and softly as though it was a minor mooshy afterthought of no consequence whatsoever i didnt think about it which was the point john stretch had cut winger loose good for him good for her maybe not as good for me if she was going to roam the streets accusing me of being in cahoots with those ugly fraternal twins mal and mis feasance although i certainly had trouble imagining why she might do that considering she slept in their bed herself most nights none of that sounds all that pressing to me i grumbled knowing he was going to be disgruntled simply because i was in bed when it was light outside already dean shrugged his usual aggressive morning attitude seemed to have abandoned him he was intrigued by something on the floor something he might possibly have last seen hanging off fasfir he frowned deeply as he tried to get a mental grasp on the facts i saw the change when he decided he was imagining things i said ill be down in a few minutes on instructions from the dead man dean let winger into the house she stormed from the front door directly into the kitchen where i was working on breakfast while surrounded by my harem have a cup of tea winger then i said if you insist on being abusive ill just chuck you right back out in the street where you can keep on entertaining the secret police spies who watch this place every minute winger was wound up she blistered the air with her extemporaneous remarks however mention of relways gang got her stuttering fast unfortunately for her immortality i wasnt paying enough attention to recall her exact words for posterity which was probably just as well she hadnt been doing a whole lot of nunstyle talking youre running around loose arent you i wedged the question in while pouring tea for myself and evas who seemed astounded that something like winger existed imagine that and you didnt get one single precious little hair on your pretty head harmed either amazing i wasnt responsible but she didnt need to know that winger thought some the implications made her stumble some more she decided to sit down and enjoy an eating contest with singe at least until shed worked herself up for a fresh round of accusations once she had her mouth full i asked how did those ratmen manage to capture you i expected something to happen morley was supposed to send some men to back you up didnt they show those pussies i think thats what she said her mouth was still full of dribbling crumbs those assholes ran out on me i sighed that wasnt that hard to translate it meant shed been such a bitch that morleys guys had decided that the job wasnt worth it that winger deserved whatever she got morley would back them up and would demand that they be paid for their suffering and hed have the moral right of it probably winger remains her own worst enemy maybe she ought to try a little adult education with sarge some crashing and banging started up front what the hell sounds like somebodys beating on the side of the house with a sledgehammer for a moment i envisioned doris doing to my house what hed refused to do to caseys place nobody told me anything but deans attitude suddenly seemed evasive i recalled his having said something about workmen i drained my teacup and headed for the front door noting that i wasnt hurting much of anywhere this morning which was wonderful and surprising i ought to have some cramps or something considering the rigors of my instructional duties the racket got the goddamn parrot going help help oh mister please dont i leaned in to tell him aw shut yer ugly beak ya little pervert before i went on to the door aint nobody here who aint heard it all before wait huh i believe we are about to have a caller but somebodys trying to wreck the outside of the house masons are removing a couple of bricks to permit the pixies access to the hollows in the middle course of the wall the outer walls of my place are threecourse brick masonry a very dark blackish rough red brick typically the center course of that sort of construction includes a lot of voids so some genius had gotten the notion that those voids could be turned into pixie apartments gah now id have them squabbling inside my walls day and night i supposed chances were excellent the guilty genius spent most of his life making and unmaking messes in my kitchen as the dead man had predicted someone knocked on the front door the knock had that peremptory character i associated with the secret police that combination of confidence and impatience nor was my guess in error though my visitor was no one i recognized and had been chosen no doubt because of that fact if they had to deal with me directly they would show me too many faces to remember yes courier i have a message for you from colonel block a written message at that he slapped a small scrollstyle document into my hand then turned and took off stepping like he was marching to a drumbeat pitched too high for human ears he headed straight up the street to mrs cardonlos rooming house probably to collect the daily reports which meant theyd given up bothering to pretend well reading i closed the door with shoulder and elbow a report on what theyve been doing about reliance and some other rat gangsters using human slaves to manage their bookkeeping generous of the colonel yes indeed and ill tell you this i wouldnt want to be a known ratman criminal right now what block was willing to commit to paper would be just the tip of the iceberg and what hed been willing to set down was so vicious and wicked that i felt belated reservations about having unleashed the whirlwind heres an interesting did you know did you know that ratpeople alone of all the intelligent peoples of tunfaire have no legal standing whatsoever less even than an ox or a draft horse that anyone can do just about any damned thing they want to them with complete legal impunity just the same as if they were regular rats easy to understand why then they would be bitter better believe not one in a hundred of my fellow royal subjects had a conscience sufficiently well developed to understand why i found that situation troubling too do not bruit that about few people know were that common knowledge someone would soon be killing them for their fur or their teeth or their toenails or something such and people capable of that were out there strangers to conscience remorse and pity who were constitutionally incapable of encompassing those concepts however often they were explained ive unchained a beast this once may be for the best mr relway may know no limits but those he imposes from within which may make him appear infinitely ferocious even while those internal limits do exist he will exterminate ratmen with wild enthusiasm but everyone who perishes will have been a true villain or if they werent they wouldnt have gotten themselves dead right i know that game of old mr relway will dwindle away to that point someday no doubt but it wont be today today he still recalls that hes just a man an overly idealistic sort of man shall i tell singe she will learn of it anyway tell singe what singe demanded having entered the dead mans room soundly equipped to avoid starvation for at least a generation that the guard have attacked reliance and several other leading ratmen with the sort of acutely accurate intelligence youd expect of deal relway the guard did it because reliance has been keeping human slaves though the slaves humanness shouldnt have mattered slavery at its most blatant and obvious has been outlawed for generations no matter the race of the slave today we have indenture and apprenticeship and several forms of involuntary servitude involving debtors and convicted criminals but nobody owns another intelligent being outright in law sometimes reality can be pretty ugly acute and accurate intelligence then how come they hadnt known about the slavery or had they my cynical side quickly had me wondering if the raids werent just imagebuilding stunts launched at this point only because somebody with a big mouth and an overly moralistic attitude now knew what the ratmen were doing i told singe the attacks have been remarkably vicious and violent because the guard wanted to make an unmistakable point a major new power player had entered the lists there would be truly big trouble if relway ever got so overconfident that he went after the outfit because there are a whole lot more of their bad guys than there are of his good guys and those bad guys have far greater resources and this would be the insurance you were taking on my behalf there was no ducking the truth no reliance no threat from reliance singe did not get upset with me what distress she did betray she directed at herself she might not have willed disaster to devour reliance but a disaster had occurred on her account you are right garrett you are completely right life is a bitch and then you die will humility be all right i dont know i tried to warn him i hope he listened i think hes someone i could get along with and what i do its all connections what we do garrett i started to speak might i suggest a level of caution usually reserved for speech in the presence of miss tate he might but that didnt mean i had a whole lot of use for it singe continued i am part of this team now and i am not really asking for a salary or anything nobody draws a salary here but the more people there are around here the more work has to be done to keep everybody in clothing and food and the way you keep putting it away you arent pregnant are you all i needed was a horde of rat pups underfoot atop the rest of the zoo not a smart suggestion garrett not a smart suggestion he was right id managed to offend singe at last and her main complaint was a sound one id tossed off a remark like that without ever having bothered to learn enough about ratpeople to know that she couldnt get pregnant unless she was in season unlike human women and she hadnt yet gone into season except once her first time under rigorously controlled conditions with her mother and some older sisters there to make sure nothing untoward happened after the first time any ratgirl with half a brain can manage her schedule i go to the same apothecaries human women do and the same hedge wizards singe rolled up her left sleeve showed me a fancy yarn amulet not unlike those worn by every human female i knew whod passed the age of nine this is a cruel wicked unpredictable and exciting world bad things happen to good girls good things happen to bad girls nobody with any sense risks having her life shattered by chance joy or evil which isnt to say that there arent scores of accidents happening out there every day common sense isnt it is really easy but a lot of males do not want females controlling their fertility and very few ratgirls are as courageous as i am it takes a lot of nerve to sneak away and get fitted for an amulet even though everyone knows where to get one what happens if you get caught using one of those things basically they get really unhappy with you but mostly they just take it away then they crowd you till your season comes on you they believe that once a female has enjoyed a vigorous season of mating she wont want to delay another one ever again is that male arrogance or is it true i cannot tell you of my own certain knowledge i have seen females little older than myself swilling an herb tea they believe will bring them into season sooner at the same time taking other concoctions supposed to prevent pregnancy or to terminate one if it starts sounded to me like love amongst the ratfolk could be as mad as it is amongst human folk it is a good thing to be a girl who thinks ahead singe said so my older sisters tell me they say a girl can futter herself blind for weeks on end if she makes the proper preparations and takes the right precautions i was beginning to get uncomfortable singe fluttered her eyelashes weeks my luck was mixed that didnt go anywhere because winger burst in she started barking at the dead man and me you guys arent gonna stiff me garrett a straight line i cannot resist dont give me no shit garrett winger why do you have to be a pain in the ass every day of your life she wasnt really most of the time she was good people my directness startled her silent long enough for me to add i ought to hire the rose brothers to follow you around with a couple of huge mirrors so every time you start in on somebody they can shove one in front of you so you can see whats happening winger got a big goofy look on her face she isnt deep at all shell take that sort of remark literally often as not this time she cocked her head and thought about it for a few seconds before she decided it was just somehow some more of garretts candyass goody twoshoes crapola pussy philosophy a category which included anything i ever said that she didnt agree with or didnt understand she gave her hair a violent toss you guys aint gonna get outta giving me what i got coming oh youre going to get what youve got coming one of these days her blind fool drunk good luck has got to run out someday upon repeated advice from the dead man in the face of my own deeply held principles i sent winger off with a little money in her pocket she was happy to get it she knew perfectly well that she didnt deserve it now shed go do some drinking get into a fight with somebody who reminded her of her husband maybe bed him if he survived the action then while she was still drunk but already beginning to feel the bite of a hangover shed drag saucerhead tharpe out of bed and try to con him into helping her manage some criminal enterprise noteworthy for its complete boneheadedness like the time she got poor grimmy weeks drunk bopped what little brains he had out then talked him into helping her pilfer the singing sword of holme prudeald that damned sword has no value whatsoever its not fit for fighting and its only magical property is its ability to sing badly the damned blade never shut up after they pinched it everywhere grimmy and winger went it boomed out offkey operatic arias about henpecked top gods brothers who plooked their sisters in order to create psychopathic dwarfmurdering heroes who tended to forget that they were married to defrocked doomed and not very bright choosers of the slain which might not have been too bad if winger hadnt gotten a wild hair and tried to sell herself as the nimrod chooser they say it made great street entertainment winger panicked when she figured the swords owner would get word she did a runner when grimmy had his back turned leaving the poor befuddled dope holding the scabbard so to speak im probably the only guy in town who bought grimmys sad story about the big blonde whod led him to his despair if grimmy survives four years of forced labor in the silver mines hell return to the street having learned a valuable lesson about getting to know your partners in crime before you begin to work together she hadnt even given him her real name hey chuckles i said popping into the dead mans room whatre we going to do with casey and the girls the male silver elf was too much trouble to keep under control but if we turned him loose he would become dangerous and he didnt deserve to be turned over to the guard and i didnt want to kill him i have been giving that matter some thought it is not simple i have been unable to find a satisfactory answer yet i will continue to reflect possibly casey himself will present us with an idea that didnt seem likely i was in my office after our recent power spending our financial picture was no longer rosy i scowled that might mean having to take on more work evas eased into the room cold and aloof and remote today she wore an unflattering tattered dress that had been handed down by one of deans much heftier nieces the dress wouldnt have been flattering when it was new and on the form it fit the weavers had strung a lot of ugly thread into the woof evas closed the door then she began to change into the very friendly evas i cannot wait i got the sense that she was mildly ashamed of herself because she couldnt control herself after a while i managed to get away the first tentacles of a marvelous idea had begun to stir in the darkened rooms at the back of my mind damned if it didnt seem like eleanor winked at me had to be a good idea if i could survive the next few days how well do you know my parrot i asked come on you should get to know him i made sure my crew were the first to arrive at the palms even dean came along mainly to make sure morleys barbarians did things right if there was much surprise at the appearances of singe and evas morleys people hid it well id left fasfir behind fasfir seemed to have learned everything shed wanted to know during her one protracted lesson quite possibly nothing could surprise them one quick glance around and i asked sarge whats going on i paid you guys good money you were supposed to set the place up for you jus go on up da stairs dere garrett puddles up top hell take care a you puddle could make that climb and survive smartass sarge said reading my mind deys gonna come a time when yer gonna have some slick pup mockin you fer havin stayed alive so long maybe so i hope so if my luck shaped up my manners were less than impeccable i scurried up to see what was what leaving singe and evas under deans protection puddle pointed when i reached the top ive been in and out of morleys place for as long as weve been friends id been upstairs a hundred times morley has his office and living quarters up there i hadnt thought much more about that floor now i discovered a narrow hallway beside his office that on previous occasions must have been covered with a panel that looked like part of the wall the hallway opened into a banquet room complete with dumbwaiter to the kitchen i suppose i shouldve suspected the existence of the place seemed entirely reasonable once i saw it there was a lot of room up there it might be a major adjunct to morleys business i wondered what went on there when he wasnt renting it out to me morley materialized in his most ingratiating oily manner he asked is it satisfactory sir hed noted the fact that i was nonplussed he loved it is there anything else i can do a doublewidth table array had been set up with seats for twenty people eight along each side and two at each end the settings were basic but correct as far as they went dean didnt register any objection when he arrived which eventuality occurred while morley and i were talking there was something else morley could do but wed get to that later no thiss fine except youve got extra places set dont give me that dark look im not inviting anybody in weve just found that setting extra places saves embarrassment when the invited guests decide to bring along someone you didnt plan to have attend people do that even though its terribly bad manners i understand all too well dean had brought in a covered birdcage containing one guest i hadnt wanted to invite this one wouldnt be getting his own chair and if i could avoid it the cover wouldnt be coming off his cage either he could be the dead mans proxy without participating in anything i remarked your guys ran out on winger at the stable the other day and shouldve left an hour before they did the woman is insufferable and she keeps getting worse shes got a problem with you that she was taking out on them he didnt want to talk about it so i asked you totally trust all your guys downstairs of course i tilted my head toward evas colonel block has some highlevel friends whod love to sink their talons into her we took a coach over here so nobody would see her on the street if you need to keep her secret why risk having someone see her her presence is an important ingredient for the success of my evening she is a she isnt she youd better believe not extravagantly so just to look at but between us guys dont let that fool you her public attitude either the ice does melt in fact it goes straight to steam a touch of wine helps so she has an excuse for making katie seem repressed and distracted you didnt you know tinnie will come with her uncle shell figure that out before shes all the way into the room the possibility had occurred to me but the potential of the evening seemed worth risking tinnies wrath i mean that would come down on me sooner or later anyway its like weather some days were going to have some shell notice kayne prose and cassie doap long before she notices evas you didnt you rogue rakes the word i think but dont go playing pot to my kettle pal it took a lot of arranging to get everybody here tonight and i had to get away from the house for a while at least none of them are married in general morley prefers women encumbered with husbands rich husbands are especially good their wives are much less likely to make demands hed rather not meet they have too much to lose besides hes a married elf himself so he claims ive never met his wife he hasnt seen her himself since he was a kid supposedly or maybe she wasnt a wife just a fiancée arranged marriage its an elven thing and an everybody else thing sometimes when substantial estates are involved i added the rules of our relationship laid down explicitly by tinnie herself clearly state that neither of us has any right to demand anything of the other as long as the relationship remains informal whichs the way she wants it kept garrett youre thirty years old do you still believe in the tooth fairy too id say theres a better chance of me running into the tooth fairy than there is of tinnie actually living up to the letter of that i hope you know what youre doing morley left us in puddles care he said he wanted to head downstairs so he could make sure my guests went the right direction when they arrived which probably meant he didnt want those lowlifes mixing with his class clientele i resisted the temptation to let the goddamn parrot get away dean assumed his post the seat to the left of what would be mine at the table head he laid out paper pens and ink and a couple of kips writing sticks hed try to record what got said accurately enough that there could be no arguments later i was confident that others would do the same i was just as confident that thered be arguments over who said what and when later on theres always somebody who insists the records are wrong evas and singe lurked behind the old man both of them trying to read his notes as he made them i wondered how much success they actually had it was scary how fast singe was picking up the art writing was giving her trouble though her body wasnt built to provide the necessary fine motor skills i suspected shed never manage anything but tedious block printing even that would make her unique i separated evas from singe the man i was talking to was the one i told you about she showed an interest immediately shed reached the point where she was having trouble sustaining her public frost she was obsessed which had been cute for a while but which had become disturbing once i found myself ambushed whenever i was alone i thanked the stars or fates that fasfir had needed to try her wings just the one time it had been sweet enough work keeping up with evas i reminded her hed be a better teacher than i am much better elves are known for their endurance if you could believe a quarter of what this particular halfelf said about himself hes not bad looking either by our standards near as i could read a silver elfs face evas seemed thoughtful i settled beside dean all set he was studying one of kips writing sticks looking dubious im not sure i can do this anymore if you cant get it word for word make sure you get the high points ah playmates here as i moved that way singe sidled up what are you trying to do with evas nothing garrett just trying to help my best pal get a chance to experience an amazing phenomenon i think you are up to something really look i need to talk to playmate playmate had kip in tow but not kips mother or sister or rhafi mustnt ever forget poor invisible rhafi playmate looked exhausted its getting to me garrett having the guard watching the place all the time having them come around asking questions at all hours even kip seemed subdued he hardly fidgeted he made no effort to wander away from playmate he didnt insult anyone i asked where are the rest of them i dont know if theyre coming kayne said she was but i expected her to get here before we did she has to come well be on real thin legal ice if we put together a company where one of the partners isnt even old enough to draft we need his mother here i understand that but you need to realize that kaynes custodial status wont stand up if somebody big really challenges it shes a woman so shes pretty much handicapped when it comes to making contracts herself if this turns into something involving really big money you know the jackals are going to start gathering playmate was right women who make a name and place for themselves have to do so against the ancient tide of the law kayne had the legal advantage of being a widow had no living father and neither son had reached his majority still as playmate said add money to the mix and somebody would take legal action to become kaynes legal guardian playmate mused im worried that the father will turn up and stake a claim i thought he was dead no he disappeared hes presumed dead even if he is dead somebody could claim to be him it would be his word against kaynes a woman of questionable morals the sorting out would give somebody plenty of time to do some mischief people cant do much mischief if their legs are broken it wouldnt be that simple i hate people sometimes play in times like these i have trouble convincing myself that relway doesnt have the right idea about how to handle humanitys scum might not be your best simile garrett the scum is what rises to the top well somebody is here somebody proved to be max weider and his beautiful daughter alyx alyx was coifed and dressed to kill alyx loved every second of the attention she attracted manvil gilbey and our first uninvited guest congo greeve straggled in behind the bad and the ugly congo looked like he had broken out the special formal occasions cranial wax his eightinch part glistened wicked wicked alyx headed straight for me blue eyes sparkling like a bucket of diamonds she showed me a wicked wicked smile and leaned forward to offer me a worldclass glimpse of a wicked wicked decolletage bad girl i told her daddys going to spank promise youre hopeless ive got plenty of hope i know you cant resist forever i see you took the trouble to dress up she grabbed my right arm did a little wriggleandspin move before i realized what she was doing her daddy was not amused i whatre you doing tinnie was right behind us the devil herself stepped into the room red hair green eyes freckles a shape to make men sit up nights cursing the sun and the moon and the stars because there was only one of her to go around she wore green velvet she eyed alyx checked the goofy look on my clock shook her head and allowed puddle to guide her to the side of the table where the tates would be stationed like most everyone else i know who passes as more than a remote acquaintance puddle treats tinnie like an empress alyx said damn that didnt get a rise out of her how bout you well you did get your dad all steamed up youll hear from him later max and i might be friends but there was no way he was going to let me get involved with his baby not that hes a snob he just dont think my prospects are any better than those of highwaymen or pirates professions notorious for their high rate of turnover alyx went over and dropped inelegantly into a chair beside tinnie they fell into conversation instantly probably beating up on me they were close friends despite alyxs relentless campaign to slide her shoes under the end of my bed morley reappeared he had changed clothing he wore a ladykilling costume now i kept a straight face he cast covert glances into the dark corner where singe and evas lurked trying to avoid notice evas was busy playing peekaboo with the goddamn parrot but didnt miss morleys return kip had discovered evas too he was scared to death i said play tell kip its all right shes on our side well i was hoping she was things might change suddenly if she found out she had a ride home are you ready to begin serving morley asked the kitchen is ready for you not yet im waiting for the boys family to show he stared at evas and the jungle chicken which evas had just uncovered theres something about that creature something she was projecting herself id felt it back at the house more than once yes there is would you like me to introduce you im talking about mr big garrett he lied thats one of the better straight lines youve ever handed me but im going to let you off you were distracted let me mingle with my guests you want something to do a wine course might be appropriate right now a suggestion that dean had offered on the way over as a way of dealing with time that had to be filled there was an extra tate as well as the weider lawyer his name was lister he was a cousin in his thirties outsiders occasionally confused him with tinnies deceased pop lester lister passed as the family legal expert he was a squarejawed darkhaired immaculately clothed and groomed painfully handsome character who had a hint of the weasel gleaming from the corners of his eyes for some reason i think of him as the lawyer of times to come i know of no one in the tate clan who likes cousin lister hes tolerated because hes kin and because hes good at what he does cousin lister has no clue how his relatives really feel about him like every human family in tunfaire great or small the tales have menfolk buried in the cantard fulllength frog fur coats are more common than grown men who avoided military service in the war zone lister tate without halfway trying wangled himself an army assignment that kept him right here in tunfaire as the armed forces liaison with their biggest suppliers of boots and leather accoutrements he didnt even move out of the family compound nevertheless he promoted himself an outofbarracks housing allowance that exceeded the pay rates of men like myself at my highest rank even including the combat bonus i got while i was in the islands i worked my way around to tinnie my good fortune never ceases to amaze me i was daydreaming about meeting a beautiful redhead look what walked through the door i saw what you were daydreaming about a slutty blonde young enough to be your baby sister alyx snickered and bounced over a seat so i could settle between her and the redhead she made some crude remark about the chairs warmth that wouldve had her father looking for a switch had he heard it i gave her a wink you could come be my babysitter tinnie told me you ever call her bluff for real big boy youd better have your running shoes on alyx said if he does he wont be able to do anything but crawl youre going to put it all on me when shes talking like that i winked at alyx again she stuck her tongue out at tinnie and started to hop into my lap then she noticed her father gilbey and congo greeve all glaring at her she needed to learn that some teasing wasnt acceptable in public yes because i expect you to know how to say no that seemed a tad unrealistic but i didnt insist instead i said uhoh with very little regard for tinnies opinion kayne prose had arrived making a grand entrance just ahead of cassie doap who seemed to have adopted a flamboyantly flirtatious personality for the evening tinnie stomped a foot she wasnt used to this level of competition in fact she was rather exceeded mother and daughter wore newly made gowns their creation mustve required the needles of all kaynes cooperative sisters both gowns flattered outrageously what begged for very little flattery in the first place slackjaw disease raged among the menfolk in morleys private dining room even deans imagination seemed to come to life rhafi came in behind his mother and sister rendered almost invisible by their glory as happenstance had it lister tate was the only married man in the room the bachelors and widowers all looked ready to revel in their status when time and doom catch up with me and i have to slough off this mortal realm i mean to thank the gods for having blessed me with the chances ive had to get to know so many comely women i expect to start working on my speech about ten thousand years from now manvil gilbey caught my eye projected the unspoken question was this something id laid on for max max could not seem to stop staring at cassie doap i shook my head mouthed but if itll help puddle showed the newcomers to their seats near playmate and kip even he was having trouble breathing there were far too many beautiful women in that room each of them trying to oneup the others tinnie let me have an elbow putting plenty of force behind it thats for what youre thinking i apologize ill never think of you as an object again from now on its nothing but business from now on youll be mr tate in my every act and thought that earned me a repeat stroke of the elbow id better not be the fickle woman alyx said look at dad i think the old bulls in rut tinnie muttered alyx sometimes youre too juvenile even to amuse me i moved up to my place beside dean which was my signal that the evening was about to become serious those who werent in their official seats found them once everyone sat down there was very little room to spare morley had another place setting on each long side but it wouldve taken a shoehorn to get anybody in i introduced everyone including morley as host then evas and singe as they took their seats to the left of dean and to the right of me without explaining their presence i thought they ought to stay mysterious they drew stares but not even lister tate was gauche enough to demand information about them i let morley know that we were ready to be served kayne and cassie both managed admirably during dinner tinnie was not amused by the regard they received she was used to being the center of attention but all the men at this banquet were related to her or had known her since she was a pup except for me and dean and kaynes drooling baby boys and she already had dean on a leash and me wrapped around her finger alyx was amused she liked seeing tinnie have to take second chair just to rub it in she kept right on flirting with me her father wasnt worried about her anymore i tried not to cry when i thought about how much this evening was costing me i tried to forget the fact that if it didnt work out i might end up spending several years working fourteenhour days just to get back to the point where i could afford to save money buying beer by the keg as a business convocation the sequestered evening at morleys place had to be some sort of precedent the gang of us came out of there having created a company dedicated to the creation production and marketing of the fruits of the imagination of cypres prose ingenious boy inventor the weider brewing empire would provide financing the tate family would handle the actual production kayne prose and all her offspring would move into the tate compound where they would live much better than ever they had before with no requirement that they do anything but be kips support and inspiration i myself would be the genius who held it all together having been the genius who had gotten it all together i had a feeling kayne prose wouldnt have much attention to spare for industry not for a few months at least when kayne prose met manvil gilbey it was lust at first sight both ways all the rest of us had to be grateful that they didnt jump on one another right there in the banquet room kaynes behavior wasnt exactly a surprise i had a feeling she seldom met a man she didnt like but manvil gilbey is as reserved as a wine butt normally the absolute absurdity of the universe is declared in a bellow once again by the fact that max weider age sixty became infatuated with cassie doap a completely ridiculous eventuation not unilateral in nature nor did either of those two seem conscious of the fact that cassie was three years younger than alyx weider and alyx was the baby of maxs five children max told me of course its stupid but shes a dead ringer for hannah when i first met her and he was willing to play delusional games with himself in order to defy his pain more or less nobody cons max weider for long not even max himself cassies positive response wholly genuine was a good deal more puzzling we knew already that neither cassie nor her mother were out for the easy ride bought with their looks and bodies therere times when people do honestly connect on something besides the physical level that became one of the fine evenings of my life one of those times when everything works out even better than youd dared hope sometime during the socializing following the creation of the articles of agreement encompassing the founders of the new company my good pal morley dotes and the silver elf evas disappeared i suspect that couples who do that tell one another no one will notice but secretly dont give a rats ass if anybody does because their minds are fogged by anticipation the capper came when lister tate proved he wasnt a complete waste of flesh by belatedly providing a device for getting around the legal age problem as well as the potential problem of a fatherly return willard tate can adopt the boy the device goes all the way back to imperial times when the emperors wanted to handpick their successors its not much used anymore except on the hill but the tool is there mrs prose can allow it if nobody challenges right away only a royal proclamation can reverse it and we could argue against that that only an imperial edict is valid since the adoption went forward under a prekarantine law i believe there are precedents i told tinnie promise me youll keep kip away from rose i plan to keep him for myself he has good prospects hell be your cousin spice is nice but incest is best ouch you meanie ill bet hes got stamina too my prospects are looking up too i wont need a business excuse to get my foot in the door at the weider place anymore ouch alyx shes hurting me do you feel like a captain of industry the dead man asked i waved a hand in a dismissive gesture he couldnt possibly see what i feel like is a guy dancing six inches above the ground because i have completely thoroughly irrevocably nailed morleys mangy hide to the wall i have hoisted him on his own petard ive spent months and months and months trying to map out some absurdly complicated revenge scam to get even with him for the goddamn parrot and in the end a better answer just dropped her bottom into my lap i just had to introduce morley to evas let morley be morley let evas be evas and let deal relway be his own suspicious self the dead man wasnt pleased once id decided to point evas at my pal morley id launched a companion scheme which resulted in her wanting to keep the feathered clown with her evas couldnt leave the palms now there were too many watchers outside who reported to the emergency committee for royal security it may be a long time before they tire of observing comings and goings at morleys place oh me oh my i love it i wonder how long itll take morley to realize that hes reaped the whirlwind no more mr big trying to get me stoned on the streets following me everywhere keeping track nagging me no more gah a ferocious squabble had broken out inside the front wall soundless almost gloating laughter seemed to fill the atmosphere well hell he might not miss a step still i could cherish thoughts of morleys delicious plight although fasfir didnt approve she had managed to establish communications with the dead man she found it painful to be completely alone when old bones didnt make her feel better she joined me in my office by means of notes a few words spoken with difficulty and my small ability to sense moods she made it known how cruelly terrifying being alone and lonely was for her kind i told her caseys here but fasfir found casey nearly as alien as she did me and he was a lot less fun after dark i could scramble her brains and push the fear away for a while huh you worked hard enough but i never felt like you got much out of it she informed me that she was much more diverted when i was with evas and she was in evas mind evas flesh responded more readily thoroughly and willingly than did her own though her problem probably existed entirely within her own mind odd though she believed she had mental hangups she admitted to being every bit as enthusiastic as evas only she enjoyed it best at second hand life gets stranger by the hour this is tunfaire that would be the taproot iron law things get weirder ask the dead man what it was like in the old days when he was young and callow hell let you know that everything was normal and straightforward way back then the written record however doesnt support him there may be cycles of less and more but weird is with us always company is coming another visitor he had concluded that our silver elves were identical to the strange people who had been called visitors when he was a child hed found fragments in caseys head to confirm his speculation so from now on we were going to call them visitors fasfir whipped past me as i eased into the hallway she hurried to the front door then stood there baffled by all the mechanisms i nudged her aside looked through the peephole a very small scruffy nervous brunette was on the stoop homely enough to be related to dean she was poised to knock but wasnt sure she was ready to commit she looked around to see who might be watching she flickered i lifted fasfir up so she could look is that your other friend fasfir nodded i opened the door which startled the visitor because she hadnt yet announced herself fasfir revealed herself slithering around me as lithely as a cat before the illfavored little woman could run away i shut the door and left the ladies to their reunion i went to the dead mans room you been eavesdropping i got the equivalent of a mental grunt in response i noted that casey who seldom strayed from the dead mans room was lapsing into sleep again by the time he left my place casey was going to be years ahead on his sleep finding anything interesting like why this one is running around loose when she ought to be a captive of the masker contingent given fewer distractions i might exploit the present moment of emotional vulnerability to unearth those and further significant answers i pinched my lips closed we can call this woman woderact she seems to be what we would call a sorceress she would be the most socially reserved of the female crew she is not an adventuress yet there is about her that same intense suppressed hunger that characterized evas some not so suppressed amusement the maskers kicked her out because she was of no use to them she would not cooperate also the maskers may have thought she could lead them to fasfir and evas either of whom might know something that would help them repair their ship these maskers seem to be more hardened than are the other visitors except for casey except for casey i do believe that it is just marginally possible that casey could do direct willful physical harm to another being none of the other visitors seem able to entertain the thought ah the excitement of the reunion has begun to ebb fasfirs thoughts are no longer accessible and there goes the new mind ha a vast miasma of amusement wrapped itself around me my metaphysical side seems to be asserting itself i have suffered a psychic episode you are going to have to teach night school at least one more time i can lock my door but you will not no being an empathetic kind of guy i probably wouldnt not for a night or two please move the women out of the hallway now we are about to suffer another caller it would be best that the visitors are not seen i looked out the peephole as someone knocked i saw a lean beanpole of a man all dressed in black he had a black beard and wore a widebrimmed black hat i didnt recognize him dean came into the hallway started to go back when he saw that id reached the door first i beckoned him forward to answer while i eavesdropped and covered him from the small front room the stillness and emptiness in there were sweet with luck the parrot smell would fade away eventually dean followed instructions but didnt fail to stomp and employ his full arsenal of disgusted expressions the man on the stoop asked is this the home of the confidential operative known as garrett sounded to me like he knew the answer already dean thought so too yes why i have a message from miss contague sounded like he was talking about a living goddess the way he said that for mr garrett making sure he went away without saying anything more that was strange dean told me handing me a vellum document folded and sealed with a red wax seal as ornate as any used by the nobility that man had a voice like an embalmer she chooses her henchmen to ornament her own epic which she rewrites as she goes along its a crying shame such a lovely young woman to be so twisted i blame her father so do i but however cruel chodo was he never put a knife to her throat and forced her to do evil she made the choices when first wed met belinda had been trying to kill herself by slutting it up down in the tenderloin at the time that had been fashionable amongst unhappy young women from wealthy families even now belinda seemed determined to bring about her own destruction except that these days she wanted to go out in a flashy orgy of violence so her pain could be seen and shared by everyone the dead man once told me that monsters arent born theyre made that they are memorials which take years of cruelty to sculpt and that while we should weep for the tortured child who served as raw material we should permit no sentiment to impede us while we rid the world of the terror strewn by the finished work it took me a while to figure out what he meant but i do understand him now you just need one intimate look at what a fully mature monster can do to achieve enlightenment he may have been the most wonderful pup youve ever known but you dont hesitate to strike the dog if he goes rabid what is it belinda found the flying ship that got away out in the wine country dean said it took that much paper just to tell you that no wondering on his part about why shed even been looking theres some cryontheshoulder stuff too almost like a confession which made me wonder if i shouldnt be more pessimistic about my personal longevity i might be scheduled to share her funeral pyre and her people have found the stable where casey keeps his donkey that for the dead mans benefit not deans dean didnt care things he told the people there led belindas agents to another apartment it doesnt sound as fancy as caseys bic gonlit place but the stuff she says they found there makes me wonder if half of tunfaires population isnt our pal casey in disguise excellent will you want to relay any of this to colonel block not today because hed pass it on and the people hed pass it to dont really need more power than they already have you think we can use this as leverage to work on casey i wished wed find something i was way tired of having the visitor underfoot can we make him think we have him over a barrel now hed been around too long just to hand over to the guard now block and relway would want to know why i hadnt bothered to mention him earlier probably and the point to doing that would be what oh yeah hes on a mission i will discuss it with him meanwhile it is time you stopped lollygagging and went back to work id begun to loathe the captain of industry gig all right yes everybody did warn me but i guess its mostly because my partners dont have any patience with my relaxed attitude toward work theyre worse than tribe of dwarves trained by dean there is supposed to be a lot of humorless from under the roots of mountains all work and no play dwarfish blood up one of the branches of the tate family tree i cant provide any arguments against the allegation of my own knowledge tinnie definitely finds it hard to step away from work for any extended length of time i was the only key member of the new company not having great fun with our venture kip haunted his vast new workshop twenty hours a day and usually fell asleep there fawning tate nephews and cousins rushed hither and yon making sure kips genius remained unencumbered by scutwork experts from the discontinued military leather goods operations now stayed busy trying to determine the most efficient means of threewheel production my own threewheel the only pay id yet received for any of my trouble had been spirited in from playmates stable it now resided in the tate compound inner courtyard where there were always folks lined up to take a short ride the managers didnt want their several completed prototypes defiled by the unwashed even brother sister and cousin unwashed though twothirds of the shoe factory floor had been turned over to new manufacture the tales werent abandoning their traditional business base they were just scaling back to the peacetime levels known by their greatgrandfathers shoes become a luxury when you have to pay for them yourself the tates would remain the leading producers of fashionable womens footwear theyd held that distinction since imperial times though i was a rabid fan of the threewheel and wasnt interested in much else less than half the reassigned production space was intended for the manufacture of my vehicle my associates were equally taken with several other kip prose inventions his writing sticks were in production already in three different colors and orders were piling up the guard and the hill folk hadnt taken notice perhaps because writing sticks dont fly kip was having the time of his life he was the center of everything everyone else was having a great time meeting the challenges everyone but poor garrett there wasnt that much for him to do id used up my ration of genius there were no crooks here trying to steal from the boss i didnt have any other assets to kick in except for knowing a lot of different people i can bring to bear on a difficulty but the only bringing together i was getting done these days took place back at the house nights woderact was proving to be a researcher every bit as dedicated as evas had been a tad more shy initially but fasfir kept egging her on and climbed right in there with us when the adventure called her tunfaire gets weirder by the hour and my life marches in the van there wasnt much i could do but all my business associates seemed determined to have me right there at the factory not doing it im an old hand at skating out of the boring stuff i acquired that skill in the harsh realm of war i ducked out of the tate compound i recouped my spirit and recovered from my difficult nights by undertaking the promised visits to the troubled weider satellite breweries that killed three days but didnt demand much genius like so many tunfairen villains the various crooks were completely inept they betrayed themselves immediately my report named several managerial types who had to go when the thieves went because bad guys as incompetent as the ones id caught couldnt possibly have operated without their superiors turning a blind eye while extending a palm for a share of the proceeds fasfir decided she had to try her luck in person one more time no man couldve faulted her enthusiasm but something was missing from her makeup she just wasnt a katie inevitably direct participation left her disappointed but she didnt have problems enjoying what evas or woderact shared with her mind to mind weirder by the minute this latest time fasfir had a different motive for joining me of late we had been refining our communication skills until using gestures grunts a few spoken words some writing and what i could pull out of thin air she could get ideas across she had a big something on her mind this time you want to get your whole crew back together i tried to appear distraught though that very notion had been worming around in my head for two days as things stood my having sicced evas on morley hadnt changed anything for me except that i didnt have to listen to the goddamn parrot anymore could i count on you three to stay out of mischief absolutely that came through almost as clearly as one of the dead mans messages i didnt swallow it whole the ladies hadnt lost their interest in going home ill see what i can do fasfir became quite excited and grateful moments later an equally excited and grateful woderact joined us weirder and weirder i hired a coach grumbled about the expense the whole time put the lady visitors inside it i let them reclaim some of the fetishes woderact had brought along to the house they would appear to be human if they were seen on the street casey got aggravated because he wasnt allowed to come along neither of the ladies believed him when he told them that hed help them get home lookit dis puddle enthused as i pushed inside the palms somebody done fergot ta lock da goddamn door again puddle wasnt doing anything but loafing in a chair his was the only body in sight id timed my visit perfectly morley around what was dat huh tought i heard sometin a huge grin drove suspicion off his face we aint seen much a morley da past few days garrett what wit him spendin so much time takin care a dat bird sarge shoved out of the kitchen clearly having been eavesdropping poor boy is gettin kinda pale garrett im tinkin he mought oughta get out in the sunshine more what da hell was dat what was what i asked as innocent as the dawn itself i fought i heared da stair creak sarge scratched his droughtstricken failing crop of hair he and puddle both eyed me suspiciously what i inquired puddle demanded whatcha up to garrett actually i just wanted to drop in to see if i had any good reason to gloat both men nodded and smiled they could understand that sarge told me i don know where ya found dat little gel garrett but i sure do wish dey was one or two like her aroun back when i was bout sixteen puddle nodded enthusiastic agreement gloat yer heart out i will i said well if the man cant come down then things are going just wonderfully if you do see morley tell him i stopped by and that im thinking of him but dont let him know im having a hard time keeping a straight face when i do a feeble groan limped stumbling downstairs everybody snickered before sarge and puddle discovered my latest maneuver seemed like a good time to move myself along somewhere else later guys both henchmen observed my retreat with abiding suspicion i set course for home making plans for indulging in some serious rest and brew tasting i kept breaking out in giggles which inclined the streets to clear away around me my opinion of the legal profession seldom soars above ankle height i believe that most troubles would settle out faster without lawyers stirring the pot so it irks me to have to admit that lister tate and congo greve really did turn out to be useful tate was a good idea man greve seemed to know everybody who was anybody well he did know the legal beagles that everyone who was anyone paid to put words in their mouths and he knew how to work them when they were just hanging around tate told the rest of us well create a demand for threewheels by having them seen underneath the most important people i didnt get it i protested youre talking about giving them away you dont make money giving things away you have to consider promotion as a part of the investment process mr garrett its an investment in public exposure paralleling our investments in tools and materials well only comp ten units total and those will be prototype and pilot units we put together while were figuring out the most efficient way to build the threewheels congo greve said ive placed all ten already too two with the royal household one with the metropolitan thousands of the best people will see that old goof and his two acres of beard pedaling around the dream quarter every orthodox heretic in town will want one to ride to church plus i got one placed in westenrache house with the imperial family how about that just those four units should give us exposure enough to generate thousands of orders i never got a protest in because i couldnt get my jaw moving greve knew people inside westenrache house the remnants of the imperial family with hangerson had been forted up or under household arrest there for centuries ever since the ineptitude of generations of ancestors let the empire crumble into kingdoms and principalities and tiny quasi states each of which paid lip service to the imperial crown while ignoring its wishes completely the sole function of the empire these days insofar as karenta is concerned is to furnish somebody who can crown the king whenever a new monarch ascends karentas throne which occurs with some frequency though we havent had a coronation recently our present monarch is particularly adept at sidestepping assassins with deal relway covering his back hell probably live forever i croaked i think i understand if the kings daughters happened to be seen larking around on our threewheels every young woman of substance would demand she be provided one of her own and the herd instincts of their fathers would ensure that the girls remained indistinguishable from the princesses good mr garrett mr greve said once we establish a list and the social primacy of our product to the exclusion of all imitators well have written ourselves a letter of marque allowing us to plunder the aristocracy i gave brother greve the fisheye that sounded a whole lot like the true lawyer coming through greve sighed explained we must ensure that our threewheel is the only threewheel the elite find acceptable once the fad gets started imitations are certain to appear as soon as someone capable of building them lays hands on one he can tear apart we have to make sure that anybody who actually buys a competing threewheel is considered a secondrater or worse his expression suggested that he had begun to rank me with the dimmer of the dimwit tate cousins lister said its possible that i can work my royal household connections to wangle a decree of patent if the crown so ordered nobody would be allowed to build threewheels but us until somebody able to offer a big enough bribe got the king to change his mind or got the people who made up the kings mind for him to do so likely the king himself would never know about the decree of patent im glad you guys are on our side i thought i could see how weider beers had become the choice of beer drinkers now snob appeal backed by suggestions that any tavern brewing its own beverages on premises was an outdated secondstringer its product likely fit only for the meanest classes which is true in many cases the uniformity and consistent quality of weider brews exceeds anything produced by corner taverns and i can claim a certain expertise in judging the quality of beers greve continued to pontificate obviously our ability to produce threewheels will be limited demand will exceed supply for as long as the fad runs we want to sustain and exploit that situation first well set a publicly announced fixed unit price exorbitant of course then well place our buyers names on a list then lister and i being cheesy lawyers will let those who want to do so bribe us to move their names up the list excellent thinking lister tate declared he actually rubbed his hands together in washing motions and chuckled wickedly till he realized some of us were staring he grinned told us sorry i dont have mustache ends to twirl here lets do this while were at it publish the list by posting it outside the compound entrance update it daily so the buyers will know where they stand in case they feel an urgent need to move on up oh yes excellent idea heres another idea well put serial numbers on the threewheels the lower the serial number the more exalted the status of the threewheel i said i can see people falsifying serial numbers oh both men gave me looks that said they wondered how a grown man could be so naive and still be here among the living more than one threewheel would go out the door with the same low serial number pure raging unbridled capitalism now if they could just find ways to steal our raw materials evade taxation and not pay our workers their wages our profit margin might begin to approach what those guys would consider minimally acceptable i was becoming increasingly certain that the best thing i could do for the company i had invented would be to stay away i should just let them haul my share of the profits over to the house aboard a beer wagon my mind just wouldnt fall into a businesslike groove if i was building a business id do it as if everybody involved was a partner kind of the way i had things already enough of that i saw kips family whenever i visited the tate compound kayne was bored prosperity was all right with her but she wanted something to do she was used to working long and hard i told her theres plenty of work around here ill pass the word cassie rhafi how about you guys cassie was extremely adept at doing nothing useful and planned to keep right on doing what she did best rhafi was content to polish his loafing and consuming skills as well so be it i was in the tate compound when the workers completed our first presentation threewheel half of the pair of gaily painted monsters meant for the kings daughters we drew lots to see who would pedal it away i didnt win sleepily the dead man again asked how does it feel to be a captain of industry his inquiry had an amused sharp mocking edge to it the sort of edge his thoughts take on when things go exactly according to his prognostications i feel like a man wasting his life like the proverbial square peg indeed but if you were not working there you would be here either sleeping off hangovers or indulging yourself in some rakish indulgence yeah thatd be great indulging in some indulgence he was feeling generous he didnt mention the several visitor women id finagled out of the house not that long ago singe invited herself into the dead mans room then into the conversation evidently the dead man had kept her posted she took a sandwich out of her mouth long enough to ask are you having problems with the redhaired woman again i hope absolutely always that goes without saying but not as many as usual mainly because tinnie was too busy working and i stayed out of her way i am sorry no youre not youve been polishing up your sarky havent you when you are lower than a ratmans dog you do have to try harder john stretch was here not long ago he wanted us to know that he knows where the other visitors are hiding the ones we ran into out in the country singe still shivered when she recalled that adventure though it made her the awe of all ratpeople who heard the tale they are here in the city now their skyship is hidden inside a large abandoned structure on the embankment a little ways north of the landing way up there in strange territory coincidentally within a few hundred yards of the site where the ship belonging to lastyr and noodiss is suspected to have gone beneath the water i frowned trying to picture such a fantasm as an abandoned building in tunfaire id expect to bump snoots with a unicorn first this city is awash in refugees from the former war zone nothing that remotely resembles shelter isnt infested with desperate dangerous people singe anticipated my question people lived there until ten days ago something scared them into moving out meaning maybe somebody more dangerous had moved in what do you think old bones worth a look or are we out of the thing since kip doesnt seem to be in trouble anymore though how could we be out while we still had casey underfoot i wished there was some way i could give him to morley too the dead mans response was the mental equivalent of a distracted grunt dont you dare go to sleep on me wholl keep casey under control the question elicited only a mental snort and the equivalent of i was just resting my eyes you dont keep him managed chuckles i wont have any choice but to turn him over to the guard i cant handle him weve already seen that mental grumbles old bones was getting testy a sure sign he was headed for a long nap hes predictable kind of like the weather is predictable you look out the window and tell everybody a storm is on its way no way youre ever wrong given sufficient time what is your attitude toward unearthing lastyr and noodiss not quite obsessed but definitely still interested despite all logic they planted that one deep whoever did it he didnt tell me what i wanted to know that was supposed to be a hint old bones who messed with the inside of my head i am inclined to suspect casey but i do not know i have not read direct responsibility in any visitor mind yet but the visitors have been exceedingly adept at concealing specific items witness evas and her sisters witness casey himself he has not yielded up a tenth of his secrets even though he has been in direct mental contact with me for ages now also it might be wise to consider the possibility that your urge is not of visitor origin what we might do well to recollect occasionally colonel blocks several subtle cautions about the intense interest in the visitors being shown behind the scenes by several hill personages you have been rendered unconscious with some frequency of late we might review your memories of those episodes with an eye toward the possibility that some of our own folk might have created an opportunity to implant a compulsion maybe who really isnt as important as what who wants the secrets of the visitors magic isnt truly critical to us who wont have much direct impact on our lives perhaps if you discount the moral dimension naturally and when the talking is over you do want to meet the mysterious lastyr and noodiss yourself i sure do i know ill be disappointed i always am but id definitely like to see who got the cauldron bubbling then cease investing your time in the threewheel business there is nothing you can contribute there except exasperation for your associates id had the feeling that even willard tate was considering changing the locks on the compound doors it isnt just that i ask too many questions i ask questions that make people uncomfortable even the bloodiest villains have to work hard at conscience management sometimes until they get their full arsenal of justifications filed sanded and polished to fit their shadowy needs indeed you do also you must stop juggling the women in your life i understand that you are trying to live every young mans dream and are managing a twisted approximation but there come moments when each of us must step away from the dreamtime sometimes somebody besides me flops something uncomfortable onto the table find lastyr and noodiss before they perish from old age i didnt contradict him but evas had told me that visitors never grow old nor do they die of old age they live on until fate finds a way to squash them with a falling boulder or until they do something really stupid like going into a horse stall all alone without a witness around anywhere which sounds like some of those old false legends about morleys people singe it ought to be safe out there now you ready for another adventure whither thou goest oh thats rude all right first thing in the morning bright and early for real but for now lets just hit the kitchen and tip a few mugs of weider select i am getting old i thought about heading out to grubb grubers to enjoy a few with the old jarheads i thought about wandering over to serenade katie whom i hadnt seen in so long she mightve forgotten her favorite little honey bunny i thought about several other ways to fritter my evening and in the end i just stayed in sipping the dark and exchanging brewborn wisdom with my pal singe i hit the sack early never suffering a thought about the feuding pixies singe and i set out about a week before my normal getup time we headed for the casey digs belindas connections had discovered we didnt learn a thing there except that the guard had the place under surveillance a fact that would interest miss contague a great deal we also learned that thugs i assumed to be relways were keeping watch on us loyal subjects by means of some very clever operatives and tactics the shiftiest operatives alive have trouble keeping up when the folks theyre watching can step around a corner and vanish which singe and i did a few times then i decided it wouldnt be smart to give away the fact that we really could slide around a corner and disappear that invisibility fetish was a wonderful device i didnt want it taken away by some bubba dreadlock the pursuit did a hell of a job of hanging on id have to congratulate block and relway someday i told singe we cant shake them every time we give them the slip they get right back on track after a while i hadnt been too obvious about trying to lose them yet however i was just pretending to take normal precautions i didnt want them to know that we knew we were the object of a massive tail singe stopped being talkative as the morning wore on her shoulders hunched she seemed to shrink maybe i did a little too we had reached the embankment which is an ancient docking and warehousing district along the riverbank north of the landing its rough country and i dont know my way around there nor do i know a soul amongst its denizens which isnt true of the waterfront on the south side the embankment seemed a bleaker harsher less colorful district than its more familiar cousin the embankment is the jumpingoff point and home base for all trade along the navigable waterways some of which reach a thousand miles beyond karentas borders a thousand miles into the heart of the continent the southside waterfront is the jumpingoff point for what seems to me far more exotic destinations along the ocean coasts and overseas what is that smell singe asked the sweet aroma of uncured animal hides i was able to answer that one because of my intermittent association with the family tate you wont believe this but there are men crazy enough to hunt thunder lizards and mammoths and sabertithed toogers in the plains and mountains and forests back in places so far away they dont even have dwarves or elves there yet flatboats bring hides and teeth and horns and bones and ivory and fur and sometimes even meat down to tunfaire and sometimes gold or silver or gemstones or lumber or untaxed whiskey it all gets unloaded right here on the embankment where several of the bigger warehouses belong to the contague family and store none of the mentioned goods except whiskey a broad range of herbs and spices grows wild in the interior too but hunting is the thing a bold enough hunter responding to the appropriate commercial demand can set himself up for life by making a handful of the right kills i expect a lot of bold veterans will toss the dice out there before long and have enough success that the market for animal byproducts will get shaky perhaps the crown ought to encourage homesteading that would bleed off a lot of extra people generally speaking the quickest way to get dwarves to give up their silver and gold is to take it away over their dead bodies but if you can bring them the head of the right kind of thunder lizard which they wont hunt themselves no matter what theyll throw gold dust at you like the bags are filled with sand but that head has to come off an adult specimen of one of the major carnivores or off a threehorn or the rarer fivehorn because an infusion of powdered horn will scare impotence into the next continent ive never heard why dwarves covet the teeth of the great meat eaters but who better than a lady dwarf to know intimately the meaning of rock hard singe told me we must pass through this place that smells of old death huh the area where they make leather from those uncured animal hides the tannery district there were places which processed tallow and bone too though little of that would be imported none of those places lacked their enthusiastic odors why someone is using ratman trackers to follow us there can be no other explanation for their success yet few of my people have the courage to visit the fastnesses of death even if they forget that not many generations have passed since our own kind were killed and flayed to provide fashionable trousers for young dandies the stench will overwhelm anything as subtle as traces left by you and me without leaving it obvious that we were trying to distort our backtrail ah my friend you continue to amaze me a year from now you will be working for me there was a thought to rattle me singe jumped up and down and clapped her paws i did it i did it you should see the look on your face i believe ive created a monster ratpeople arent built to laugh but singe sure did try and she kept her mind on business while she was having fun she led the way along a path a ratman tracker ought not to find suspicious yet one that would overload any trackers nose singe was too naive to understand that anything not going his way would be suspicious to director relway i may have remained a little naive myself not till after we had begun taking advantage of the districts natural odiferous cover did it occur to me that having relways fanatics on my backtrail might be a lesser evil singe and i were on a holiday stroll giddy because we had shaken free singe more so than i because she had a better appreciation of what she had accomplished and of its cost her own olfactory abilities had been dampened hugely a sudden whir the pixie shakespear materialized above my right shoulder he told me you must hide quickly they will be here in a minute another whirr as shakespear went away i glimpsed a second pixie hovering pointing in the direction of the threat i heard the wings of several more singe pulled me toward the nearest doorway it was open beyond lay the noisome vats of a small tannery i wondered how the flies stood the smell i whispered did you know that the wee folk were with us you did not know you missed the sound of their wings you have better ears than i do and youre starting to make me feel old i shouldve been more aware of what was happening around me maybe my friends are right maybe i am getting too tied up inside my own head there wasnt anything in the tannery there was no tanning going on thought the place was still in business it gave the impression that the entire workforce had slipped out just minutes before we arrived curious it wasnt a major holy day that i knew of though possibly the place employed only members of some lesser cult still there ought to be somebody around to keep opportunists from finderskeeping all those squirrel hides here singe had located a low opening in the outer wall placed so air could waft in and rise to roof vents so the tannery could share its chief wonder with the city the opening lay behind a heap of pelts from small animals the majority had come off rodents but some were scaly the odor off the pile guaranteed that no ratman tracker would find us here singe had both paws clamped to her muzzle gagging i whispered could you pick me out of this singe shook her head slightly took a paw away from her muzzle long enough to tap her ear reminding me that her people also had exceptional hearing then she dropped down so she could watch the street between bars that kept dogs cats and other sizable vermin from getting to the delicacies they would have to stroll all the way down to the unlocked and open door if they wanted to compete with the bugs singe beckoned me i went for the fresh air i got down on the dirt floor amongst the crud and the hair and the fleas off the pelts and observed and learned the first few hunters werent unusual they were just thugs but they were extremely nervous very alert thugs they were thugs whose main task was to protect a brace of extremely unhappy ratmen the trackers kept glancing over their shoulders i didnt recognize anybody but wasnt surprised i didnt know many members of the guard and relway was enlisting fellow fanatics like harvesting dragons teeth then i saw white boots with platform soles and cracked fake jewels bic gonlit was up on top of them the real bic gonlit and bic wasnt alone nor was he in charge his companion wore black as tattered as bics white but was a lot more intimidating he looked like he was about nine feet tall he wore a mask arcane symbols in gold and silver spattered something like a monks hooded robe an extremely threadbare robe this particular stormwarden wasnt enjoying a great deal of prosperity that would make him especially dangerous singe was even more careful than i was about not attracting attention by breathing her people have nurtured that skill since their creation i didnt recognize anybody but bic my first inclination was to drop everything and head for home let bic and the big boy play the game which is exactly what most people do and what all the big boys expect us to do they count on that up there on the hill they dont know how to react when ordinary folks refuse to fold and fade usually thats followed by a lot of sound and fury and people getting hurt which explains the prevalent cowardly attitude once they passed by i whispered ive got bic gonlit figured out now hed taken caseys money hed underwritten his taste for high living by collecting books for casey but once things got real interesting the little pudgeball had made a fast connection up the hill that being the case why hadnt any hilltype visitors come to the house maybe brother bic hadnt made himself a deal so good that he felt like giving up everything he had informationwise or more likely the dead man had revised his recollections before letting him leave the house youve got to keep an eye on the dead guy hes sneaky old bones has been getting slicker every day for a long time he doesnt keep me adequately informed though i thought i must have an unrecognized tendency to blab all over town another pack of intense bruno types came along following bic and his buddy in black they were alert they were all armed too though that was against the law once again neither singe nor i breathed id love to see relway attempt to impose his idealistic no exceptions rule of law outlook on the lords of the hill or even on their minions the resulting fireworks would make for great popular entertainment bics stride faltered he stopped he seemed uncertain he bent to caress his ragged magic boots frowning he looked straight at me though without seeing me he frowned shook his head said nothing to the ragged wizard the stormwarden beckoned two ratman trackers a conference ensued the whole crew had become confused nobody had the track now by scent or by sorcery singe pinched me i breathed this isnt the time because shed snuggled up like she wanted to get really friendly it hadnt ever gotten this complicated when i was running with morley then singe proved that i had misjudged her again she pointed back past the heap of possum and muskrat hides several visitors were up to something back there singe had pressed against me to make sure the invisibility spell concealed us both i whispered what the hell are they doing theyre not supposed to be here one of the visitors had his arm in a sling another seemed to have a broken leg evidently the maskers hadnt been able to work any medical magic every visitor carried at least one gray fetish and studied it intently i whispered therere too many of them there were more here than the masker four i couldnt get them all in sight at once but i definitely counted at least five visitors though it was hard to tell one from another even when the visitor hailed from evas crew unless you charmed them out of their silver suits i whispered were still blocks away from where john stretch said theyre hiding singe murmured quit whispering so much then added a thought id had already and didnt want to be true maybe they were warned about us coming maybe they are here because they expected us to go to the place where we were told that they would be hiding maybe because in tunfaire nothing ought to surprise you the possible will happen the impossible takes only a few minutes longer in this case the probabilities were apparent certain overly friendly visitor ladies desperate to get a ride home had conned simple old garrett into returning some visitor fetishes they said theyd need in order to sneak in and join evas in her adventures with morley dotes at the palms taking advantage of simple old garretts understandable and righteous desire to rectify a nearcosmic injustice if they got away i hoped the girls were dim enough to take the goddamn parrot with them smirk id have to remember to call the place the joy house next time i dropped in at morleys smirk the extra visitors lurking here had to be lastyr and noodiss erstwhile missionaries just had to be because no visitor would be going home if they couldnt all work together and the maskers would have been gone already if theyd gotten reinforcements from the old country the women in particular had to be extremely cooperative with the others they were at everyones mercy disdaining singes advice i whispered you watch them ill keep an eye on the street the confusion out there had begun to commence to begin to get ready to head on out somewhere else bic and his pal resumed moving though confusion didnt cease being their guiding spirit they faded away i expected them back you cast around a bit but you always return to the point where your track evaporated to hunt for the one thing you missed the last time you looked minutes later singe murmured a grand understatement we should leave sooner or later they will stumble over us in spite of this invisibility amulet or they might have some way to tell if an invisibility spell is being used anywhere nearby if i invented an invisibilitymaker id sure try to come up with a way to tell if somebody else was using something like it around me or they might hear you whispering that too wed come to the embankment to find visitors although this wasnt quite the situation id hoped for this wasnt good this didnt fit in with my halfassed plans at all singe was spot on about whispering but she was a tad off when it came to who would do the eavesdropping yikes here came bic gonlit and his threadbare stormwarden buddy hustling like they were being driven by one of the wizards spooky winds their trackers and henchmen scampered along behind them confused and alert and able to keep up only because bic had those stubby little pins the flotillas course ran straight toward me i poked singe indicated that she should peek through the airhole once shed done so we got up on our hind feet and chest to chest in careful lockstep began to ease along the brick wall toward the cover of another mound of hides we found it necessary to freeze every few steps because the visitors had become extremely nervous suddenly they were inclined to jump at the slightest sound they had to suspect that they had trouble in their hip pocket several visitors fetishes extended before them suddenly rushed the hide pile singe and i had abandoned bic and his cohorts were causing a disturbance outside and singe and i hadnt gotten but a dozen feet away so we froze and shivered and held our breaths and hoped nobody stumbled into us the visitor with his arm in a sling missed running into me by scant inches tension mounted amongst the visitors the advent of danger reawakened the bad feelings between the maskers and kips pals i could sense just enough to tell that the maskers blamed lastyr and noodiss for everything kips friends blamed the maskers for zipping all over the sky thereby alerting the savages to their presence lastyr and noodiss had abandoned the altruism that had brought them to tunfaire in fact prolonged exposure to our fair flower of a city had turned them bitter and cynical imagine that singe and i continued to move teensy baby steps then with more vigor once we realized that the people outside intended to come inside visitors began flying all over the place two quite literally i didnt see any ropes or wires keep moving i told singe in what i thought would be an inaudible whisper visitors froze something had changed the visitors were alert in a whole different way the visitors then unfroze every man jack getting busy with fetish boxes those guys needed bandoliers to carry all the fetishes they had evidently every task imaginable could be managed with the right gray box two visitors headed our way weaving slow serpentine courses zeroing in bics gang poured through the open door big surprises happened for everybody the confusion attained an epic level at first it looked like it would be a walk for the startled visitors thugs went down left and right exactly as easily as i had in my first several encounters with masker magic then bic came through the doorway the visitor sorcery didnt affect little bitty big boy bic selected a paddle meant for stirring the contents of a curing vat he took a swing at the nearest silver figure which happened to belong to the masker with the broken leg the visitor rewarded bic with a beatensheep sort of bleat the shabby stormwarden stepped inside and instantly called down some of that oldfashioned thunder and lightning the ability to control which gave stormwardens their name weather magic is the flashiest and most obviously destructive power possessed by our lords of the hill and the most common hides flew vats exploded people shrieked bic gonlit rose ten feet into the air spinning faster and faster as he did so the stormwarden followed spinning himself but he threw off spells like the sparks coming off one of those pinwheel fireworks i told singe we really need to take ourselves somewhere else the game looked like it was just starting to get serious i thought you wanted to find the visitors we found them now lets take advantage of the fact that nobody here has us at the head of their todo list right now pixies flitted around us giggling and squabbling more annoying than a flock of starving mosquitoes not a single one had anything useful to say their presence didnt help anything singe and i werent invisible anymore there was no need nobody was interested in us but the squawking bugs threatened to attract attention for the gawkers trying to figure out what was happening in the slowly collapsing tannery a guy hanging out with a ratwoman bold enough to walk the streets by daylight was a secondary spectacle threads of blue light as thin as spider silk crawled over the ruins the entire heap of rubble hurled itself skyward everything inside went up with the building itself people and debris alike floated on the surface of an expanding invisible bubble more time seemed to pass than actually did the bubble popped and collapsed a raindrop smacked me in the cheek i noted that a cold breeze had begun blowing the change in weather wasnt unseasonable or unlikely it was just a surprise because i hadnt been paying attention vigorous lightning pranced over the remains of the tannery one bolt struck something explosive probably chemicals used for treating leather the explosion scattered brick and broken timbers for a hundred yards around a spinning sliver sixteen inches long flew between singe and me narrowly missing us both singe said we have found them do we really need to stay so close now i dont know you may have a point i spied a dirty white behind wagging as somebody struggled to back his way out of the mess when the pile finally finished birthing bic it developed that he had hold of his employer by the ankle he strove to drag the wizard out by main strength i said i think we might move a little farther away lightning bolts like swift left and right jabs rained down on the ruins starting small fires flinging debris around despite his discomfiture and the inelegance of his situation the stormwarden was still in there punching other things were happening at the same time they were less intensely visual i credited them to the visitors because bics gang were the people being inconvenienced damn wed dropped the invisibility spell and were trying to fade into the onlookers but bic spotted us almost immediately but he didnt get the chance to report us a visitor floated up out of the ruins jabbed one of those gray fetishes in his direction and he fell down sound asleep i wasnt feeling real charitable i hoped he woke up with a headache as ferocious as the worst id enjoyed back when they were knocking me out all day long i told singe itll be a week before they get their stuff together back there lets use the time we did to no avail whatsoever not only were the maskers not hiding where john stretch said there was no sign of their skyship id hoped it would be right there where i could sabotage it or whatever seemed appropriate at the moment of discovery why would i want to keep them from going away the longer they hung around the more likely they would fall into the hands of somebody off the hill which would make times just that much more interesting for those of us who couldnt fly away singe you smell anything that might be the masker skyship she strained valiantly and told me i can tell nothing what happened back there has blinded my nose poor baby follow me it was time to get the hell away from the embankment our line of retreat took us back past the ruined tannery raindrops continued to strike randomly scattered but getting fatter all the time and colder one smacked me squarely atop the bean it contained a core of ice it stung i regretted my prejudice against hats look singe said we were slinking through the crowd of onlookers which had swollen to scores most of them tickled to see a stormwarden looking like he had a firm grip on the dirty end of the stick a groggy bic was back up on one knee a blackclad ankle still in hand glaring at the mob not a man of whom offered a hand he spied somebody he thought he recognized that somebody being mama garretts favorite boy he croaked out garrett garrett kept on rolling maybe a little faster garretts sidekick puffed and hustled to keep up bic yelled as loud as he could his excitement didnt do him any good at all the one response he did get was a growing hum that sounded like a swarm of bumblebees moving in for the kill it came from within the rubble masker sorcery bic slapped another hand onto his boss ankle and went back to pulling look singe gasped again the rubble had begun shifting and sliding as though restless giants were awakening underneath the bubble was coming up again and now the bumblebees were singing their little bug hearts out the bubble got a lot bigger this time bricks and broken boards ratmen and squealing henchmen all slid off bic forgot about me and singe he forgot his manners entirely he yanked the mask off the stormwarden slapped his face i caught a glimpse of pallor disfigured by indigo tattoos a real heartbreaker of a face it must drive the hookers wild something began rising up inside the bubble something shiny like freshly polished sword steel the bumblebees lost the thread of their hearty marching song and began to whine the bubble began to shrink and the steel to sink but the bees picked up the beat after a few false notes the masker skyship emerged from the ruins the addled stormwarden popped it with his best lightning bolt the skyship popped him back enthusiastically he flew twenty yards ricocheted off a brick wall barely twitched once before an incoming bic gonlit tumbling ass over appetite crashlanded on top of him the masker vessel lumbered into the sky and headed south the bumblebees occasionally stumbling the ship itself wobbling a little faster with the feet i think singe said when i slowed to watch i am developing a strong need to find myself somewhere far away from here the crowd seemed to agree with her everybody thought it was time to be somewhere else yes indeed girl yes indeed before old bic wakes up and decides to blame us for everything we did go somewhere else but we werent much happier there than wed been on the embankment ive got a bad feeling about this singe i said puffing as i headed south the knees beginning to ache im willing to bet i know exactly where that thing was headed no dummy she singe opined mr dotes establishment yeah yeah the skyship was long gone by the time we reached the palms but people were still hanging around in the street telling each other about it thered been enough excitement for the visitation to become a neighborhood fortyday wonder i noted a couple of familiar faces among the gossipers guys asking only occasional questions and doing a lot of listening some snooty galoot got his heart broken when i didnt even slow down going past him at the door with a rat in tow for the gods sake for a moment i thought id finally get me a chance to witness a genuine sputtering fit of apoplexy snooty galoot disappointed me people so often do i smells wit my little smeller sometin what a man ought not ta got ta smell puddle announced from the shadows at the other end of the room sarge hollered from the kitchen dat mean dat garretts here dat it does indeed ha so pay up i told ya da man dont got a ounce a shame an hed turn up before da dust settled sounds like we guessed right i told singe they did come here hey greenwall puddle yelled ya need more help talkin people outa comin in da door the snooty character gobbled some air it was obvious that morley had hired him for his upthrust honker not for his ability to intimidate hard men i said dont be too rough on the guy puddle i intended to explain how he naturally went spineless when he saw singe and me bearing down but puddle interrupted yer right garrett its his secont day on da job aint every day ya look out da door an deres one a dem flyin disk kinda tins landin in da street out front wit goofylookin silvery elf guys jumpin down an whippin up on everybody i took a second glance at greenwall he did look like a man nursing a ferocious headache so did puddle for that matter so the girls all got away puddle stared at me with narrowed eye for several seconds yeah dey went but one a dem had ta be dragged kickin and da udder two cried all da way cause dey didnt want ta go wow your boss is quite the man hell be heartbroken im sure morleys gonna be singin hosannas soon as he gets enough strengt back puddles grin slid away his face turned serious i hate ta be da one what gives ya da bad news garrett but dem sluts dey stole mr big when dey went oh that is awful what an actor i know what racket i ought to be in now not involved in inventing and manufacture i ought to be on the stage i managed to be convincing in my loss o cruel asp of fortune thou wicked serpent how painful thy sting gods garrett you arent just a ham youre the whole stinking pig morley had managed to get most of the way downstairs he looked like a guy fighting a big headache too once again i brought my acting skills to bear and concealed my amusement you look like death warmed over you been playing with the vampires of a sort right now i dont think i ever want to see another woman oh i suspect youll change your mind after you recover from the fantasy come true given a few days id found myself thinking of katie and tinnie in a nonplatonic fashion again but i am a very resilient fellow they stole mr big garrett you sound like that bothers you morleys eyes narrowed suspiciously like why wouldnt that bother the gods themselves its no secret that i wasnt fond of the ugly moth but if you miss obnoxiousness fluttering around you ill send over some of the swarm of pixies thatre living in my walls now no need mr big will be back morley predicted he sounded so confident i wondered if i ought to be worried you sound sure and glum at the same time evas and her friends are going to come back with him hehhehheh i pulled my most evil laugh out of my bag of attitudes for special occasions you sure they wont just wring his neck when they get tired of him youll be laughing out the other side of your mouth when they get here garrett ill move ill go into hiding youre marked buddy youre special you started something and now youre marked for their special attention i started nothing it was all evas idea you gave her the idea for her new idea mr entrepreneur shes going to get hold of a bigger skyship and start bringing silver elf women to tunfaire for very special vacation getaways and she sees you as a whole lot better partner in her enterprise than she sees me she told me so a bit of wickedness lurked in the corners of his eyes he just might have had something to do with the lady visitors attitude telling stories on me again probably i have to break him of that habit their government will never let them do that stopping adventurers was caseys business his whole purpose in life was to prevent contacts between his people and ours you really think its beyond corruption glad to see youre all right i said get plenty of rest and get some meat in your diet youll need to beef up if you want to make it in the gigolo racket i began to sidle toward the door i plan to maintain my amateur status but you being a businessman now you might want to exploit the opportunity maybe i could recruit kip and rhafi and a dozen of their friends what they lacked in experience they could make up in enthusiasm i sidled some more noting that singe was enjoying my discomfiture entirely too much whats your rush garrett my old pal asked ive got to see a dead man about a horse morley took his turn chuckling chances were he had a fair notion what was going on in my head but he said only you be careful on the street there are some ratfolk out there who resent what the guard did to reliance and they think you and singe might have had something to do with that your friend john stretch is having trouble setting himself up as reliances replacement my friend john stretch is going to get some grief from me too id concluded that john stretch had given me completely bum information about where to find the maskers that singe and i had stumbled into the right place at the wrong time almost entirely by chance that we never would have found the visitors if bic and his sorcerer friend hadnt been dogging us dotes got in a final gouge as we stepped into the street see you at chodos birthday bash i think you could sell your gigolo franchise to the outfit chodos birthday party that bucket of ice water put everything else into a more favorable perspective the return of the insatiable visitor girls sounded positively attractive by comparison what the hell do you mean he got away i yelled at dean between you and old bones in there you couldnt manage one guy four feet tall and only about fifty pounds soaking wet you exaggerate mr garrett dean replied with cold dignity that creature has powers and the thing in the other room went to sleep he jabbed a thumb in the direction of the dead man if you insist on pillorying someone for dereliction i suggest your candidate be the thing actually capable of having exercised control over the foreigner but hes asleep i cant vent my frustrations by yelling at him dean shrugged my need to yell was a matter of indifference to him unless i showed the slackwitted judgment to zero in on him personally i expect youre starved mr garrett what do you say to stuffed peppers that was blackmail in its rawest form deans smile was wicked even demonic hed do it hed really make the whole house reek of that foul fruit you watch out i dont change the locks next time you go out of the house dean smiled its his firmly held conviction that i cant get along without him the man is mad im going to go into my office im going to put on my thinking cap singe how about you grab us a pitcher and a couple of mugs i really wanted to go pummel the dead man but knew id just end up driving myself crazy if he was soundly enough asleep to let casey get away thered be no waking him up anytime soon because beer was involved singe overlooked my treating her more like an employee than a partner which is what she figured she was i didnt give eleanor more than a passing glance because i knew what id find if i bothered to consult the woman in the painting no help at all and a whole lot of amusement at my predicament singe materialized with the beer not one pitcher but two one in each paw with mugs we went to work sipping nobody saying much after a while she returned to the kitchen for refills we sipped some more i began to relax then dean stuck his head in to tell me that colonel block was at the door and wanted to see me i hadnt heard him pounding singe hadnt either apparently she said just when i was about to seduce you lifes a bitch theres always a westman block ready to jump in and ruin the moment colonel how good to see you to what do we owe the pleasure singe moved her special chair aside so block could plant himself in the guest seat block nodded his head sagely all right garrett you got me fooled youre thrilled to see me i just wanted to share some news we caught one of those silver elves that have been terrorizing the city terrorizing being the superb actor i am i kept a straight face and said really congratulations dont waste the effort huh i know whats been going on garrett lucky for you most of the time i buy into deals concept of the rule of law im glad to hear it your attitude however frequently makes it hard to cut you any slack so my best friends keep telling me i had a rough childhood my daddy got killed in the war which wasnt the smartest choice of wiseass comments but the good colonel set me straight dont be a dickhead garrett everybodys daddy got killed in the war thats the way they did it in those days they waited till a guy created a family before they conscripted him that way they could be sure thered be more soldiers coming up easy sorry this was an aspect of wes block i hadnt seen before so lets be serious youve caught one of the silver elves and he isnt talking were not entirely sure that he can the people whove examined him say it might not be possible to make him talk because we dont have the technical expertise clever clever casey he was selling his strangeness and and there have been suggestions from some quarters that your partner might be able to fill the communications gap ah now we came to the reason for the friendly visit theres an idea that hasnt found its time assuming there was any way at all he could be talked into underwriting the delinquencies of the people youre fronting theres still one problem hes sound asleep based on grim experience id say theres a cruel chance hell stay that way for a long time because hes had to stay awake a lot lately im trying to save you some grief garrett and i appreciate it but no amount of good intentions on your part or of anybody elses wishful thinking can change the facts come on ill show you like theres anything visibly different about how the dead man looks when hes sleeping stick a pin in him if you want he wouldnt feel it anyway but if he was awake hed respond to the insult or you could say something revolting but true about the loghyr ill take your word for it but his tone wasnt that reassuring the trouble is i have people pressing me who dont really care about such problems you have people pressing you whore stupid enough to risk offending a dead loghyr in a word yes there really are people who dont know any better people that survived the cantard we have a crop of apprentices coming up who didnt get a chance to experience the worst the war had to offer before the venageti collapse they dont know theyre not invulnerable they have no grasp whatsoever on their true limitations and theyre in a hurry now you dont say and you dont know any older cooler heads who might rein them in block shrugged he looked grim he shuddered i asked what i never expected it would be easy but i did hope which means which means that im going to have to find a hole and pull it in after me because relways gotten a big head lately too he insists that if any of those spookchaser pups do step very far outside the law hell nail them the same as if they were muggers on the street oh boy thatll bring their daddies out i took a huge breath let it go in a grand sigh i didnt think hed move this soon that little man is crazy garrett but crazy like the proverbial fox id bet hes a lot more ready for a showdown than you or i think he could be if he does go down hell make sure its in a conflagration so dramatic that not just tunfaire but all karenta will be changed forever i sighed me another one of those huge sighs all right i dont want to do this i hate to get noticed by those people but theres a slim chance i can get through to your guy if hes the one we called casey i assume he is because all the rest of them seem to have gone aboard the skyship that was terrorizing the city earlier today block gave me one of his squinty looks he knew that skyship had made an up close and personal appearance at the digs of my friend morley dotes but he didnt press the matter i offered him a brief thoroughly edited version of events on the embankment claiming id been there in the interest of my client kip prose who still felt threatened the point is im still finding myself up to my ankles in bic gonlit nothing i do gets that guy to go away hes started to make me wonder if it isnt personal after all bic gonlit with a stormwarden eh a thoroughly shabby stormwarden youd figure him for a fake just looking at him nobody off the hill ought to be that scruffy but he sure brewed up the lightning when the time came to show his stuff i havent gotten the reports on that incident yet ill look into it when i get back he asked several questions evidently meant to give him clues to the sorcerers identity i dont think i helped singe decided to go refill our pitchers block said thats creepy garrett what is that rat running around here just like she was people oh i didnt start an argument you get used to it you are holding the silver elf at the alkhar arent you yes good it wouldve been bad for me if theyd decided to question casey in the cellar of one of those ugly stone piles on the hill well let me tie up a few loose ends here then ill wander over there with you and take a shot at seeing what i can do with your guy colonel black was suspicious right away and right down to the bone and he was right to be whatre you up to garrett im trying to keep my life from getting infested with parasitic wizards ive had runins with casey before if its him youve got and not some other elf none of us knows about i might be able to communicate with him i managed once before but hes stubborn and he isnt afraid of anything blocks suspicions were allayed only slightly i dont know why im a trustworthy kind of guy im going to go help singe if deans not there to do it for her she gets beer all over drawing it out of the cold well i went to the kitchen singe i need the invisibility fetish somebody trusted me she handed the thing over without a question you know if we have any more of these things squirreled away anywhere she shook her head you gave all the rest back to the women or to that man in there hes afraid of me isnt he in a way yes hell get over it say a prayer for me to the gods of the ratfolk or maybe i will not our gods are all cruel and treacherous reflecting the world itself we just try to trick them into looking the other way a philosophy i could embrace wholeheartedly my interview with casey took place in the same big room where id gotten interviewed earlier the same main players seemed to be on hand block was there three quiet wizards were there none in costume and none of them the one who ran with bic gonlit im confident that director relway was there as well back in the shadows though i never actually heard or saw him casey was there seated in a hard chair at a bare table when i arrived they hadnt bothered to restrain him he was no physical threat as i settled opposite him one of colonel blacks men dumped a sack of nine fetish devices in front of me i said casey old buddy were in the really deep shit here now youve been around tunfaire long enough to have a pretty good idea of the kind of people who have hold of you you have a pretty good idea what they want and you know theyre not real good at taking no for an answer you have to understand that some things are inevitable and that all you can do is make it easier on all of us lines of a sort everyone in that room probably including casey himself would have used numerous times i took out the fetish id brought from home added it to the pile while staring straight into caseys strange eyes could he read me at all whats that block demanded one of those amulet boxes of theirs singe found it today when things were blowing up on the embankment figured i ought to bring it over casey do you understand anything ive said do you know what these people want after a long long pause casey nodded of course he knew it was his mission to make sure they didnt get it from him or the maskers or especially the brotherhood of light i hoped he would keep his mission in mind because i was counting on him to get us all out of this mess all right look here colonel were getting somewhere already told you i could get through to him whoa there casey slowly and carefully we arent sure which ones of those things are weapons casey took such offense that his indignance was plain to everyone we do not make weapons that caused a stir more because hed spoken than because of what hed said is that true but ive been knocked unconscious over and over again by something that left me with the worst headaches of my life i believe casey would have laughed if visitors had the capacity for laughter what you experienced was an effect of a device used for the removal of the parasites common to the bodies of most of your animals and races lice and fleas in particular with the device set at its strongest power we do not make weapons ill take your word for that which one of these doohickeys is a flea getter ridder ofer casey extended one spider leg finger slowly good sergeant you want to take that one away excellent now i knew that casey could tell these devices apart hopefully which would mean that he should know what kind of fetish i had placed on the table maybe he was smart enough to understand what needed doing so lets go over the rest of these one by one tell me what theyre supposed to do start with this one here casey did that and after wed reviewed a couple of fetishes i realized that he couldnt really make me understand what he was talking about i didnt have the vocabulary then his voice gave out i asked block can we get him some water in here hes obviously not used to talking block said something one of his men moved i glanced over and when i looked back casey wasnt there anymore neither were any of the fetishes an instant later as the shouting began the hammer of darkness fell again what happened i mumbled i was the last one to wake up the delousers effects were cumulative for sure how about you tell me block growled dragging me into a seated position with my back against a wall ive got a notion i dont have a lot of fleas anymore gods my head is killing me hit me and put me out again i meant it at the moment no i want you to get up i want you hurting while you explain what just happened you wont be able to concentrate enough to bullshit me i dont know what just happened you were here you were paying attention you probably got a better look than i did maybe i did maybe i didnt i cant shake the feeling that there wasnt a pea under any of the shells nausea overcame me as i tried to stand beer and my last meal beat me to the floor godsdammit that just tops my whole day off garrett i tried to climb the nearest chair it was occupied i gasped get me some water wasnt somebody supposed to go after water and what happened to him the man in the chair was one of the sorcerers his eyes were open but nobody seemed to be at home behind them the look was worse than the thousandyard stare with that you knew your guy would probably come back someday seeing this you knew he wouldnt ever i dont know garrett he seems to have turned into a vegetable they all have but nobody else was hurt he stepped carefully avoiding my mess wow casey mustve done that deliberately he wasnt a nice guy after all unless he hadnt been aware what they were and this was a byproduct of them owning their talent in the wrong place at the wrong time block declared i think their intelligence was deliberately and systematically destroyed that would make our casey a vindictive little bastard wouldnt it completely without a sense of humor about being misused why do you suppose he let you and me and the rest of these guys slide because were like him just battling the darkness the best we know how gift horses eh you could be right he didnt say anything for a while i seized the opportunity to concentrate on feeling sorry for myself i wondered if lastyr and noodiss had gotten away before they gave kip an idea for a miracle headache cure id better check then block told me id better have you taken home i want you to stay inside your house until i get this sorted out therell be questions some of you men want to get this mess cleaned up cant anybody around here do something without waiting to be told it didnt seem likely not when everybody was preoccupied with a killer headache this is bad shit garrett block whined thiss real bad shit ill be lucky to get out of this just losing my job arent you being a little too pessimistic i clamped down and pushed the pain back but not very far man you let yourself get way too impressed by people off the hill did hill people give you your job i thought prince rupert did that and what were these guys trying to pull anyway they were trying to cut the rest of those witch doctors up there out of the jackpot you watch the rest of their kind will take one quick look at the facts and figure they had it coming you do have a knack for looking on the bright side garrett i sure hope its as easy as all that first id heard of me being a brightside kind of guy but what the hell eh if i played to that maybe block would forget to nag me about caseys getaway i reminded the good colonel of his obligations i thought you were going to take me home colonel blocks coach was still a block from my house when it bogged down in traffic macunado street was clogged with bodies most of them human and only remotely acquainted with personal hygiene but with plenty of odds and ends and mixtures in the crowd too everybody wanted to see the glowing blob in the sky that seemed so interested in our neighborhood this blob wasnt a flying disk nor was it like those things that evas and her friends had flown this was more of a cylinder with gently tapered ends with nothing protruding outside to hear the crowd tell it the cylinder had descended to ground level several times but was now just hovering like it was confused or just waiting i told block im telling you right now flying around up in the air isnt onetenth as much fun as you might think and youd know what youre talking about hasnt been that long since i took a few rides on a pegasus garrett you ought to write all your adventures down being mindful not to leave out any of the bullshit youre always laying on people you know id do that if there was any way to make a few coppers out of it but even i have trouble believing some of the stuff thats happened to me youre right youd have a credibility problem i dont believe some of it and i was there when it happened the crowd oohed and aahed as the skyship suddenly dropped down almost to touching level just about where the garrett homestead stood it hovered there only briefly colonel block was looking out the other side of the coach at the time he might not have noticed he did say all these weird things going on in the sky lately have had their positive side effects for instance i wasnt paying close attention i was worrying about caseys stubborn streak was he going to get after kip again now such as the political shenanigans have quieted down for a while we havent had anybody march for days and its been at least a week since there was a significant race riot people get tired of the same old entertainment caseys skyship rose up against the backdrop of the night dwindled till it was a point lost among the stars i wondered just how strange his home country could really be presumably those of his people that id met were amongst the most bizarre specimens the normal people would stay home content to do normal things colonel block dropped me in front of the house the street having emptied quickly once the show came to an end hang on garrett he made me wait what do you intend to do about bic gonlit i hadnt given that much thought it didnt need much ignore him and hope he goes away i suppose hes just been doing his job he can go on doing it i dont see how that could involve me anymore block grunted said i do want to know which stormwarden hes running with if you happen to stumble across that bit of information you got it i started up the steps to the house a moment later i was surrounded by a cloud of pixies every one of them squeaking all of them determined to have me adjudicate countless disputes and quarrels i was rude to them all whether or not i knew them singe opened the front door she held a big cold mug of beer ah the little woman welcoming me home as i started to extend my drinking hand singe tossed back half the mug then she told me the dead man said you were coming hes awake again that casey woke him up he said damn thats a trick i wish hed taught me before he went away garrett all present and accounted for near as i can tell headache and everything whats up big guy whatd the visitor have to say just no hard feelings and farewell and thank you and do not be too concerned about reactions to his report he does not believe that his superiors will insist upon any followup the damage done by the brotherhood of light was slight and should damp itself out within a generation apparently it did the same last time around thats good to know whatever it means im going to go sleep off this headache after i drank some beer and chased it with headache powders deal relway himself came to the house he never made it quite clear why the little man has trouble articulating sometimes he did hint that he was convinced that id collaborated in the escape of a particular royal prisoner and that i had been an accessory to the total moronification of three alreadysubhuman subjects of the karentine crown not that that was necessarily a bad thing in the case of those particular subjects as far as he was concerned justice had been served what was that all about i asked the dead man after the director took his leave the only response i got was the psychic equivalent of a snore i wanted to scream id counted on the dead man to pluck relways psychic bones karentas current monarch has been so deft at survival that most of his subjects have had the opportunity to learn his birth date they have begun taking advantage of the fact that the kings birthday is traditionally a karentine holiday this year the people of substance had chosen to collect in the reservoir park there they would show off their new seasonal outfits and their participation in the latest fad the wonderful world of inventions called threewheels any family that showed up without being able to claim at least one threewheel on order might as well resign itself to being the butt of condescending gossip for at least as long as it took for us to develop a grander bigger more expensive model i had to attend with my business partners who brought most of their families which meant there were beautiful women in every direction i looked be they tate weider or prose i didnt get much chance to exercise my eyes though tinnie had decided i was back on her a list which apparently awarded her complete custody of where i directed my vision alyx weider was too busy scooting around showing off her own custom threewheel to afford her usual distraction i steered myself toward tinnies uncle willard this is an amazing show sir every damned threewheel wed built was here somewhere so it seemed when are we supposed to do the judging a huge part of the festivities was a contest to see which young lady could dress up her threewheel the prettiest our end users so far were almost all girls and young women of extremely considerable substance a demographic id have found particularly interesting if i hadnt been claimed for the moment ha i told the redhead i am supposed to be looking then why arent you out there outshining alyx and rose pout one of my wheels broke when we were leaving they wouldnt let me get it fixed that would make us late two painfully homely young women paced by four fiercelooking thoroughly well armed characters on foot passed us leisurely following the bridle path ugh i said willard tate cautioned me those are the royal daughters garrett guaranteed to be winners in the contest tinnie added because i would be too obtuse and democratic to figure that out for myself i tried to remember how to do the tug at the forelock thing i was out of practice i asked how are we doing businesswise overall we couldnt be plundering the rich more effectively if we were a barbarian horde and were doing it without any bloodshed you hit this one square on the nose youre a wealthy young man now or you will be before much longer have you been giving any thought to your future beyond maybe getting a bigger cold well installed so we could keep up with singes added demands on the beer supply no i said uhoh what sounds like im about to be offered an investment opportunity willard laughed something he didnt do very often normally he was as sour and serious as an accountant you might say that garrett deal of a lifetime what im wondering about is what are you and tinnie thinking about uncle willard uncle willard ignored tinnie completely youve been playing cat and mouse with each other for several years now youre both getting a little long in the tooth to keep it up im thinking you might want to address your questions to the cat the mouse dont get much say which observation earned me an enthusiastic dig in the ribs you planning to go on the way youve always done i checked tates expression for a clue to how he meant that i thought i got it its what i do i find things i find things out i try to help people who are in trouble its what im good at im not good at managing a big manufacturing thing hell i have trouble managing the everyday business side of what i do now dean does most of that so if you need me to fill in as the son you no longer have well i can try to play the role but i dont think youd be happy with the results deciding maybe i wasnt quite as great an actor as had seemed the case the other day i understand that come its time for the formal judging i hope you brought enough prize ribbons tinnie because everybody whos anybody has to get some kind of award i brought one for every unit weve sold plus a few extras isnt having been born into the aristocracy wonderful tate asked you dont really have to compete youre a winner automatically i agreed beats hard work and study all to hell you know what they say work like a dog and what do you get dog tired tinnie hurried off to one of the tate family carriages of which there were several present she came back with a sheaf of ribbons i let her slide back in under my right arm thinking it was maybe time to start putting the boys life behind if she maybe thought so too the only other candidate id ever honestly considered was a young woman named maya who hadnt been patient enough to wait for me and eleanor of course but that wouldve been a little too ethereal a relationship for me just then a half dozen shimmering objects streaked across the northern sky in a tight formation low in the far distance three seemed sizable sausageshaped vehicles the rest were exactly like the odd little skyships that evas and her henchwomen preferred the masker ship must have flown home very fast indeed and evas secret hunger must be one she shared with a lot of visitor women if this was what morley had predicted and not some kind of raid dotes mightve made the whole thing up still maybe i ought to get into the entrepreneurial spirit and tinnie made herself at home under my right wing again i was still on her a list after all these minutes despite uncle willard she asked arent you done with those people i guess as long as theyre done with kip i did worry about the goddamn parrot though but i wouldnt tell anybody i shook the unsettling notion that those larger vessels might be troopships they were hovering over the embankment now up to something within minutes they headed back the way they had come with an extra disklike vehicle floating amongst them i tried to concentrate on the threewheel festival and spied harvester temisk immediately riding a threewheel of his very own he was headed my way looking altogether too serious for my time of life chodos party was drawing close for us heroes party time is never done
