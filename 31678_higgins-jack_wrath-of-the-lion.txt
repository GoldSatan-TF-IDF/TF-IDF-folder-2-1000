jack higgins wrath of the lion chapter one storm warning the graticules misted over momentarily obscured by a curtain of green water but as the tip of the periscope broke through to the surface the small untidy freighter jumped into focus with astonishing clarity lieutenant fenelon gripped the handles of the eyepiece and his breath escaped in a long sigh beside him jacaud said the kontoro fenelon nodded not more than five hundred yards away jacaud dropped his cigarette and ground it into the deck with his heel let me see fenelon stood back conscious of the hollowness at the base of his stomach he was twentysix years of age and had never seen action never known what war was like except through the eyes of other men but this this was a new sensation he felt strangely dizzy and passed a hand across his eyes as he waited jacaud grunted and turned he was a big dangerouslooking man badly in need of a shave a jagged scar bisecting his right cheek nice of them to be on time fenelon took another look the kontoro moved slowly to the right across the little black lines etched on the glass of the periscope and his throat went dry he was already beginning to taste a little of that special excitement that takes possession of the hunter when his quarry is in plain sight one torpedo he said softly thats all it would take jacaud was watching him a strange sardonic smile on his face what would be the point no one would ever know i suppose not fenelon called the control room from his voicepipe steer oneohfive and prepare to surface he whipped the periscope down the hiss it made as it slid into its well mingling with the clamour of the alarm klaxon as he turned brushing sweat from his eyes jacaud took a liiger from his pocket he removed the clip checked it with the rapidity of the expert and slammed it back into the butt with a click that somehow carried with it a harsh finality he lit another cigarette when he looked up he was no longer smiling in the wheelhouse of the kontoro janvier the first officer yawned as he bent over the chart he made a quick calculation and threw down his pencil by dead reckoning they were forty miles west of ushant and the weather forecast wasnt good winds of gale force reported imminent in sea areas rockall shannon sole and finisterre for the moment there was only an unnatural calm the sea lifting in a great oily swell janvier was tired his eyes gritty from lack of sleep a native of provence he had never managed to get used to the cold of these northern seas and he shivered with distaste as he gazed out into the grey dawn behind him the door to the companionway clicked open and the steward entered holding a steaming cup of coffee in each hand he gave one to janvier and the other to the helmsman taking his place at the wheel for a few moments while the man drank janvier opened the door and walked out on to the bridge he stood at the rail drinking his coffee and breathing deeply of the cold morning air feeling considerably more cheerful once across biscay there was the long run south to look forward to maderia then the cape and sun all the way he finished his coffee emptied the dregs over the side and started to turn a hundred yards to starboard there was a sudden surge in the oily water it boiled in a white froth and a submarine broke through to the surface strange and alien like some primeval creature in the dawn of time janvier stood at the rail trapped by surprise as he watched the conningtower hatch opened and a young officer in peaked cap appeared followed by a sailor who immediately hoisted a small ensign a sudden gust of wind lifted it stiffly the red white and blue of the tricolour standing out vividly against the grey clouds the steward emerged from the wheelhouse and stood at the rail what do you make of her sir janvier shrugged god knows better get the captain a third sailor appeared in the conning tower a signaling lamp in his hands the submarine moved in closer narrowing the gap and the lamp started to wink rapidly a reserve naval officer janvier had no difficulty in reading the signal for himself when he had deciphered it he stood at the rail frowning for a moment then went into the wheelhouse and unhooked the signallamp as he moved back to the rail the light flickered again from the conning tower repeating her request as janvier replied with the message received signal the captain came up the ladder from the welldeck the quartermaster close behind henri duclos was nearly fifty and after thirty years at sea five of them as a corvette captain with the free french navy he found it difficult to be surprised by anything whats all this he demanded theyve made the same signal twice janvier told him heave to i wish to come aboard what have you replied message received duclos went into the wheelhouse and came back with a pair of binoculars he examined the submarine for a moment and grunted shes french all right i can see the uniforms small for a sub though he handed the binoculars to the quartermaster what do you make of her the old man took his time and then nodded lalouette i saw her in oran last year when the fleet was exercising an exuboat experimental job the germans were working on at the end of the war one of those the navy took over so now we know who she is duclos said the point is what in the hell does she want with us he turned to janvier ask her to be more explicit there was a pause while the lamps flickered again and janvier turned blankly she says imperative i board you matter of national importance please observe radio silence the lamp on the conning tower of the submarine was still what shall i reply sir janvier said duclos raised the binoculars to his eyes for a moment then took them down what can you reply if its important enough for them to send a blasted sub after us then its important signal come aboard he grimaced at the quartermaster i was looking forward to all that sun my rheumatisms been killing me lately lets hope we dont have to go into brest the quartermaster shrugged stranger things are happening in the republic these days which republic duclos demanded sardonically stand to all hands and get a ladder over the side the quartermaster moved away and janvier lowered the lamp they thank us for our cooperation do they now duclos observed lets hope they arent wasting our time stop all engines janvier moved into the wheelhouse and duclos took out his pipe and filled it from a worn leather pouch watching the submarine as he did so the forward hatch was opened and a large yellow dinghy hauled out and inflated as the freighter started to slow the two vessels drifted together until finally the gap had narrowed to no more than twenty or thirty yards the submarine commander climbed down the ladder from the conning tower and paused at the bottom watching the halfdozen sailors working on the dinghy he was slim and rather boyish in his reefer jacket and rubber boots and the peaked cap was tilted rakishly to one side he glanced up at duclos smiled and waved then walked along the hull and stepped down into the dinghy he was followed by half a dozen sailors most of whom carried submachineguns slung across their backs four of them paddled the boat across the narrow strip of water towards the ladder that had been dropped over the side of the kontoro two sailors still standing by the forward hatch of the submarine carefully paid out a connecting line carrying a lot of hardware arent they janvier said duclos nodded i dont like the look of this at all it could be messy enough to rub off on all of us perhaps theyre after someone in the crew an oas man trying to get out of the country or something like that the sailors came over the side quickly three of them unslung their submachineguns and stayed in the welldeck and the young officer mounted the ladder to the upper deck briskly followed by the other three he held out his hand and smiled captain duclos my name is fenelon sorry about all this but im only obeying orders you understand the man who came up the ladder next had a scarred and brutal face and cropped hair like fenelon he wore a naval reefer jacket and rubber boots but no cap he leaned casually against the rail and lit a cigarette the other two sailors spaced themselves behind fenelon machineguns ready duclos began to feel distinctly uneasy look whats going on whats this all about all in good time fenelon said you complied with my request to maintain radio silence of course good fenelon turned and nodded briefly to one of the sailors who crossed the deck to the wireless room which stood at the rear of the wheelhouse opened the door and went inside a cry of alarm was followed by a burst of fire a moment later the radio operator staggered through the door blood on his face he dropped to his knees and janvier moved quickly to pick him up the radio the man moaned he put a burst through it there was a sudden ugly murmur from the crew in the welldeck that was answered by a volley of firing bullets hissing through the steel rigging lines duclos glanced over the rail and saw that a heavy machinegun had been mounted on a swivel on the rim of the conning tower even allowing for the difference in height between the two vessels it was still capable of reducing most of the deck area of the kontoro to a bloody shambles he turned slowly his face pale who are you fenelon smiled exactly what we seem captain the commanding officer and crew of the submarine lalouette under special orders but serving france i assure you what do you want duclos said one of your passengers pierre bouvier i understand he is traveling with you as far as madeira ducloss rage hardly contained flooded out in a roar of anger by god ill see you in hell first im still captain of this ship still leaning comfortably against the rail jacaud pulled the liiger from his pocket and shot him neatly through the left leg duclos screamed as the heavy slug splintered his kneecap and rolled over on the deck face twisted in agony to encourage the rest of you jacaud said calmly now get bouvier up here as janvier turned a quiet voice said no need monsieur he is here the man who stepped out of the saloon companionway was well past middle age tall and thin with stooping shoulders he had the angular bony face of the ascetic and thinning grey hair he wore a raincoat over pyjamas and a small greyhaired woman clutched his arm fearfully behind them two other passengers clothes hastily pulled on hesitated in the doorway you are pierre bouvier fenelon demanded that is correct jacaud nodded to one of the sailors bring him over here the womans voice lifted at once but bouvier quietened her and allowed himself to be led forward the sailor placed him with his back to the rail and went and stood beside jacaud what do you want with me bouvier said a month ago at fortneuf you were public prosecutor at a trial fenelon said a trial at which six good friends of ours received the death sentence so the oas is in this bouvier shrugged i did my duty as i saw it no man can do more you will i am sure allow us the same privilege monsieur fenelon produced a document from his pocket unfolded it and read rapidly pierre bouvier i must inform you that you have been tried in your absence and found guilty of the crime of treason against the republic by a military tribunal of the council of national resistance he paused and bouvier cut in gently and the sentence of the court is death naturally fenelon said have you anything to say bouvier shrugged and an expression of contempt crossed his face say say what there is no charge to answer i know it and you know it frenchmen everywhere will jacaud plucked the submachinegun from the hands of the sailor standing next to him aimed quickly and fired a long burst that drove bouvier back against the rail he spun round the material of his raincoat bursting into flame as bullets hammered across his back and fell to the deck his wife cried his name once took a single step forward and fainted one of the passengers catching her as she fell backwards from the welldeck there was a strange muted sigh from the crew and then there was only silence jacaud tossed the machinegun to the sailor he had taken it from and went down the ladder without a backward glance fenelon looked as if he might be sick at any moment he nodded to his men and hurriedly followed the big man missing a step halfway down and almost falling to the deck they went over the side one by one and from the conning tower of the submarine the heavy machinegun covered them menacingly when they were all in the dinghy the sailors standing by the forward hatch hauled on the line quickly they left the dinghy to drift and everyone scrambled down through the hatch except fenelon who walked along the hull and climbed the ladder to the conning tower he stood looking up at the freighter for a moment as the two vessels drifted apart and on the kontoro there was a strange uncanny silence the two sailors dismounted the machinegun and disappeared fenelon remained only a moment or two longer before following the conningtower hatch clanged shut the sound echoing flatly across the water on the kontoro it was as if a spell had been broken and everyone surged forward to the rail janvier had never felt quite so helpless in his life before and for some unaccountable reason was strangely close to tears in the distance the wind was already beginning to lift the waves into whitecaps and he remembered the gale warning lalouette sank beneath the waves like a grey ghost the tricolour waved bravely then that too disappeared and there was only the sea chapter two to sup with the devil a thin sea fog rolled in from southampton water as the taxi turned the corner and pulled into the kerb anne grant peered out through the window at the dim bulk of the building rearing into the night the original structure had been georgian so much was obvious but the years had left their mark a line of uneven steps lifted to the door the paint cracked and peeling in the diffused yellow light of a streetlamp above it a small glass sign said regent hotel she tapped on the partition and the driver opened it are you sure this is the place regent hotel farthing lane thats what you said and thats where ive brought you the man replied its only a dosshouse lady the sort of place sailors come to for a kip on their first night ashore what did you expect the rite she opened the door and got out hesitating for a moment as she gazed up at the damp crumbling facade of the hotel except for the lapping of water against the wharf pilings on the other side of the street it was completely quiet when a cafe door was opened somewhere in the middle distance the music and laughter might have been coming from another planet she gave the driver ten shillings told him to wait and went up the steps the corridor was dimly lit a flight of stairs rising into the shadows at the far end she wrinkled her nose in distaste at the stale smell compounded of cooking odours and urine and moved forward there was a door to the left the legend bar etched in acid on its frostedglass panel when she opened it she found herself in a long narrow room the far end shrouded in darkness an old marbletopped bar fronted one wall a cracked mirror behind it and a man leaned beside the beer pumps reading a newspaper in one corner a drunk sprawled across a table facedown his breath whistling uneasily through the stillness two men sat beside a small coal fire talking softly as they played cards they turned to look at her and she closed the door and walked past them the barman was old and balding with the sagging disillusioned face of a man who had got past being surprised at anything he folded his paper neatly and pushed it under the bar what can i do for you tm looking for a mr van sondergard she said i understand hes staying here beyond the barman the two men by the fire were watching her in the mirror one of them was small and squat with an untidy black beard his companion was at least six feet tall with a hard rawboned face and hands that never stopped moving shuffling the cards ceaselessly he grinned and she returned his gaze calmly for a moment and looked away sondergard the barman said shell be meaning the norwegian the tall man said in a soft irish voice oh that fella the barman nodded left yesterday he ran a cloth over the surface of the bar and anne grant said blankly but that isnt possible i only hired him last week through the seamens pool ive a new motorcruiser waiting at lulworth now hes supposed to run her over to the channel islands tomorrow youll have a job catching him the irishman cut in he shipped out as quartermaster on the ben alpin this morning suez and all points east he got to his feet and crossed the room slowly anything i can do before she could reply a voice cut in harshly how about some service this end for a change she turned in surprise realising for the first time that a man stood in the shadows at the far end of the bar the collar of his reefer jacket was turned up and a peaked cap shaded a face that was strangely white the eyes like dark holes the barman moved towards him and the irishman leaned against the bar and grinned at anne how about a drink she shook her head gently turned and walked to the door she went out into the corridor and paused at the top of the steps the taxi had gone and the fog was much thicker now rolling in across the harbour swirling round the streetlamps like some living thing she went down the steps and started along the pavement when she reached the first lamp she paused and looked back the irishman and his friend were standing in the doorway as she turned to move on they came down the steps and moved after her neil mallory lit another cigarette raised his whisky up to the light then set it down this glass is dirty the barman walked forward a truculent frown on his face and what do you expect me to do about it get me another one mallory said calmly it was some indefinable quality in the voice a look in the dark eyes that made the barman swallow his angry retort and force a smile he filled a fresh glass and pushed it across we aim to please thats what i thought mallory said his eyes following the irishman and his friend as they went through the door after the woman he took the whisky down in one easy swallow and went after them he stood at the top of the steps listening but the fog smothered everything even sound a ship moved across the water its foghorn muted alien and strange touching something deep inside him he shivered involuntarily it was at that moment that anne grant cried out he went down the steps and stood listening head slightly forward the cry sounded again from the left curiously flat and muffled by the fog and he started to run he turned the corner on to a wharf at the far end of the street running silently on rubbersoled feet and took them by surprise the two men were holding the struggling woman on the ground in the yellow light of a streetlamp as the irishman turned in alarm mallory lifted a foot into his face the man staggered back with a cry rolled over the edge of the wharf and fell ten feet into the soft sludge of the mudbank the bearded man pulled a knife from his pocket and mallory backed away the man grinned and rushed him as the knife came up mallory grabbed for the wrist twisting the arm up and out to one side taut as a steel bar the man screamed like a woman and dropped the knife mallory struck him a savage blow across the side of the neck with his forearm and he crumpled to the ground anne grant leaned against the wall her face pale in the sickly yellow light blood streaking one cheek from a deep scratch she laughed shakily and brushed a tendril of dark hair from her forehead you dont do things by halves do you whats the point he said her jersey suit was soiled and bedraggled the blouse ripped to the waist when she moved forward she limped heavily on her right foot she stopped to pick up her handbag and the bearded man groaned and rolled on his back she looked down at him for a moment then turned to mallory are you going to call the police do you want me to not particularly she started to shake slightly suddenly it seems colder he slipped off his reefer jacket and hung it around her shoulders what you need is a drink well go back to the hotel you can use my room while i get you a taxi she nodded down at the bearded man will he be all right his kind always are he took her arm they walked to the corner and turned into the street it started to rain a thin drizzle that beaded the iron railings like silver there was a dull aching pain in her ankle and the old houses floated in the fog unreal and insubstantial part of the dark dream from which she had yet to awaken and the pavement seemed to move beneath her feet his arm was instantly around her strong and reassuring and she turned and smiled into the strange pale face the dark eyes ill be all right a little dizzy thats all the hotel sign swam out of the fog to meet them and they went through the entrance and mounted the rickety stairs his room was at the end of the corridor and he opened the door switched on the light and motioned her inside make yourself at home ill be back in a couple of minutes the room had that strange rather dead atmosphere typical of cheap hotels the world over there was a strip of worn carpet on the floor an iron bed a cheap wardrobe and locker the one touch of luxury was the washbasin in the corner by the window and she hobbled across to it surprisingly there was plenty of hot water and she washed her face and hands then examined herself in the mirror that was screwed to the wall above the basin the scratch on her cheek was only superficial but her suit was ruined otherwise she seemed to have sustained no real damage she was sitting on the edge of the bed examining her ankle when he returned he placed a halfbottle of brandy and two glasses on top of the bedside locker and dropped to one knee beside her any damage she shook her head a nasty graze thats all he pulled a battered fibre suitcase from under the bed and took out a heavy fishermans sweater which he dropped into her lap youd better put that on youre wet through when she had pulled it over her head and rolled up the long sleeves he rested her right foot on his knee and bandaged the damaged ankle expertly with a folded handkerchief she watched quietly he was of medium height with broad shoulders and wore the sort of clothes common to sailors a cheap blueflannel shirt and heavy working trousers in some dark material held up by a broad leather belt with a brass buckle but this was no ordinary man he had a strange hard enigmatic face the face of a man few would care to trifle with the skin was clear and bloodless black crisp hair in a point to the forehead the eyes were the strangest feature so dark that all light died in them on the wharf he had been terrible in his anger competent and deadly and when he looked up suddenly his dark eyes stared through her like glass for the first time that night genuine fear moved inside her and then his whole face creased into a smile of quite devastating charm so great that he seemed to undergo a complete personality change you look about ten years old in that sweater she smiled warmly and held out her hand my name is anne grant and im very grateful to you mallory he said neil mallory he touched her hand briefly opened the brandy poured a generous measure into one of the glasses and passed it to her i got the barman to phone for a taxi it might be some time before it gets here id like to know why the driver who brought me didnt wait she said i asked him to theyre not too keen on hanging around the dock area at night itsa rough place and taxidrivers are obvious targets he grinned that goes double for goodlooking young women by the way she smiled ruefully dont rub it in id no idea what i was letting myself in for but i was getting desperate id been waiting in lulworth for someone for most of the day when it became obvious that he wasnt going to show up i decided to come looking for him van sondergard mallory said i heard you ask the barman about him did you know him he had a room along the corridor from here i had a drink with him once when he came in the bar nothing more than that where did you meet him i didnt she said the whole thing was arranged through the seamens pool i told them i need someone to take a motorcruiser across to the channel islands for me and captain her for a month or so until my sisterinlaw and i were capable of looking after her ourselves i also told them wed prefer someone whod done a little skindiving they put me in touch with sondergard she sighed he seemed rather keen on the idea id love to know what changed his mind it was very simple really he was sitting in the bar half drunk feeling rather sorry for himself when one of his old captains walked in due out on the morning tide for suez and short of a quartermaster three drinks was all it took for sondergard to pack his duffel and go off with him sailors have a habit of doing things like that he swallowed his brandy took out an old leather cigarette case and offered her one are you a sailor mr mallory she asked as he struck a match and held it forward in cupped hands he shrugged amongst other things why i wasnt sure if id been asked id have said you were a soldier what makes you say that i think you could say i know the breed my father was one and so was my husband he was killed in korea there didnt seem anything to say and mallory lit a cigarette and walked to the window he peered outside then turned the motorcruiser you mentioned what kind is it a thirtyfooter by akerboon twin screw steel hull only the best he looked suitably impressed hows she powered penta petrol engine shell do about twentytwo knots at full stretch depthsounder automatic steering every latest refinement he grinned id say she must have cost you all of seven thousand pounds not me she said my fatherinlaw all i did was obey orders he told me exactly what he wanted sounds like a man whos used to getting his own way she smiled a habit he finds hard to break hes a majorgeneral grant mallory frowned are you talking about iron grant the western desert man she nodded thats right hes been living in the channel islands since he left the army i keep house for him what does the old boy do with himself these days hes almost blind now she said but hes still amazingly active and hes made quite a reputation for himself as a war historian he uses a taperecorder and his daughter fiona and i type up his notes for him you said you wanted sondergard to have had some experience as skindiver why was that it wasnt essential but he could have been useful in the fifteenth century a small fishing village and fortress on lie de roc were inundated the ruins are now about eight fathoms down a few hundred yards offshore were making a survey fiona and i have been doing most of the diving so far sounds interesting he said you shouldnt find any difficulty in getting another man from the pool to take on a job like that as he looked out of the window and down into the yellow fog she said quietly i was wondering whether you might be interested he turned slowly a slight frown on his face you dont know anything about me what is there to know you told me yourself you were a sailor from necessity he said not choice you couldnt handle foxhunter you mean is that her name oh yes ive handled boats like that before ive even done a little skindiving eighty pounds a month and all found she said does that tempt you he grinned reluctantly it does indeed mrs grant she held out her hand in a strangely boyish gesture im glad he held it for a moment looking into her eyes gravely her smile faded and again she was conscious of that vague irrational fear something must have shown on her face mallorys hand tightened on hers and he smiled gently in that single moment her fear disappeared and an inexplicable tenderness flooded through her a horn sounded outside in the street and he helped her to her feet time to go where are you staying an hotel in the town centre you should cause quite a sensation going through the foyer he told her as he took her arm and helped her across to the door the fog was clearing a little as he handed her into the taxi she wound down the window and leaned out to him ive several things to attend to tomorrow so i cant get down to lulworth again until the evening ill see you down there he nodded you could do with a morning in bed she smiled wanly in the pale light but before she could reply the taxi moved away mallory stood looking into the fog listening to the sound of the engine die into the distance then turned and went up the steps when he entered the bar the barman was still reading his newspaper where are they mallory asked the man lifted the flap and jerked his thumb at the rear door in there when mallory opened the door he found the irishman sitting at a wooden table beside a coal fire a basin of hot water in front of him his clothes were plastered with mud and he was wiping blood from a gash that ran from his ear to the point of his chin the man with the black beard lay on an old horsehair sofa clutching his right arm and moaning softly the irishman lurched to his feet his eyes wild you bastard what were you trying to do kill us i told you to frighten the girl a little thats all but you tried to be clever anything you got you asked for mallory took several banknotes from his wallet and tossed them on to the table that should settle the account ten quid the irishman cried ten lousy quid what about freddy youve broken his arm no skin off my nose mallory said calmly tell him to try the health service he walked out and the irishman slumped into his chair again head swimming the barman came in and stood looking at him how do you feel bloody awful who is that bastard mallory the barman shrugged i know one thing hes the coldest fish ive ever met and ive known a few he looked down at the bearded man and shook his head freddy doesnt look too good maybe i should phone for an ambulance you can do what the hell you like the irishman said violently the barman moved to the door shaking his head you know what they say when you sup with the devil you need a long spoon i reckon you and freddy got a little too close he sighed heavily and disappeared into the bar chapter three london confidential the room was half in shadow the only light the shaded lamp on the desk the man who sat sideways in the swivel chair gazing out through the broad window at the glittering lights of london was small the parchment face strangely ageless it was the face of an extraordinary human being a man who had known pain and who had succeeded in moving beyond it the green intercom on his desk buzzed once and he swung round in the chair and flicked a switch yes mr ashford is here sir charles send him in the door opened soundlessly and ashford advanced across the thick carpet a tall greying man in his forties with the worried face of the professional civil servant who had spent too much of his life close to the seats of power he sat down in the chair opposite opened his briefcase and produced a file which he placed carefully on the desk sir charles pushed a silver cigarette box across to him whats the verdict oh the p m agrees with you entirely the whole thing must be investigated but we dont want the newspapers getting on to it youll have to be damn careful we usually are sir charles said frostily theres just one thing the pm isnt too happy about ashford opened the file on the desk this fellow mallory is he really the best man for the job more than that sir charles said hes the best man ive got and hes worked with the deuxieme bureau before with some success in fact theyve asked for him twice his mother was french of course they like that its this shocking affair in perak in that the pm isnt happy about dammit all the man was lucky to escape prison sir charles pulled the file across the desk and turned it round this is the record of a quite exceptional officer he put on a pair of rimless spectacles and started to read aloud selecting items at random special air service during the war dropped into france three times betrayed to the gestapo survived six months at sachsenhausen paratroop captain in palestine major in korea two years in a chinese prison camp in manchuria released posted to malaya january on special service he closed the file and looked up a lieutenantcolonel at thirty probably the youngest in the army at that time and kickedout at thirtyone ashford countered sir charles shrugged he was told to clear the last communist guerrilla out of perak and he did it a little ruthlessly perhaps but he did it his superiors then heaved a sigh of relief and threw him to the wolves and you were waiting to catch him i suppose sir charles shook his head i let him drift for a year bombay alexandria algiers i knew where he was when i was satisfied that the iron was finally in his soul i pulled him in hes worked for me ever since ashford sighed and got to his feet have it your own way but if anything goes wrong sir charles smiled softly i know i end up like neil mallory out on my ear ashford flushed turned and crossed the room quickly the door closed behind him and sir charles sat there thinking about it all after a while he flicked a switch on the intercom send in mallory he lit a cigarette and stood by the window gazing out over the city still the greatest in the world whatever anyone tried to say when he opened the window he could smell the river and the sound from a ships hooter drifted faintly on the quiet air as it moved down from the pool he was tired and there was a slight ache somewhere behind his right eye something he should really see his doctor about on the other hand perhaps it was better not to know he wondered whether mallory would survive long enough to ever take his place behind the desk in this quiet room it would have been a comforting thought but he knew it was rather unlikely the door clicked open behind him and closed again when he turned mallory was standing beside the desk an easyfitting suit of dark worsted outlined his broad shoulders and in the diffused white light his aquiline face gave an impression of strength and breeding not out of place anywhere sir charles moved back to his chair and sat down how are you neil pretty fit sir ive just had six weeks on the island i know hows your shoulder no more trouble theyve done a good job sir charles nodded youll have to be a little more careful next time wont you he opened a file took out a typewritten document and pushed it across have a look at that he occupied himself with some other papers and mallory skimmed through the three closely typed sheets of foolscap when he had finished he handed them back face expressionless wheres the kontoro now the destroyer which found her took her straight into brest for the time being the french are holding the lid down tight complete security and so on they cant keep it quiet for more than three or four days these things always leak out sooner or later what are they trying to do about it the usual roundup of anyone whos even remotely suspected of being connected with the oas or cnr on top of that the deuxieme bureau and the brigade criminelle backed by every available military security agent have been given one order find that submarine i shouldnt have thought that would be too difficult im not so sure sir charles said for one thing this is no ordinary submarine shes quite small a thing the germans were working on at the end of the war whats her radius not much over a thousand which means she could be based in spain or even portugal the french are working along those lines right now but theyve got to be careful on top of that theyre combing the entire biscay coast every creek every island he sighed heavily ive a horrible feeling that theyre completely wasting their time i wondered when you were coming to that mallory said sir charles grinned impishly like a schoolboy opened a drawer and took out a map which he unfolded across the desk it was a largescale admiralty chart of the channel islands and the golfe de st malo ever hear of philippe de beaumont the paratroop colonel the one who helped bring de gaulle back to power thats right he was one of the leaders of the military coup of may and a member of the original committee of public safety philippe comte de beaumont last survivor of one of the greatest of the french military families and hes living in the channel islands he was the great advocate of a french algeria when de gaulle came down on the side of independence he resigned his commission and left france sir charles drew a circle on the chart about thirty miles southwest of guernsey theres an island called lie de roc owned by old hamish grant you mean iron grant the western desert general thats right been living there for five years with his daughter fiona writing up the war his daughterinlaw mrs anne grant seems to run things her husband was killed in korea about a mile west of lie de roc theres a smaller island called st pierre and de beaumonts living there he bought it from grant two years ago theres a sort of castle up on top of the rock one of those mockgothic jobs some crank built during the nineteenth century and you think hes up to no good lets put it this way the french have checked on him for two years now and cant find even the hint of a connection with either the oas or cnr although hes known to be sympathetic to their aims frankly even their foreign office think hes simply a grand seigneur who wont come home because hes annoyed with the general and you dont agree i might have done until yesterday evening what happened to change your mind ive had a man keeping an eye on de beaumont for a year now just as a precaution theres a small hotel on lie de roc he was working there as barman he went missing tuesday yesterday evening he drifted in on the evening tide the police went over from guernsey and picked up the body needless to say there isnt even a hint of foul play you think he may have seen something sir charles shrugged i dont see why not lalouette left brest on a routine training patrol two days ago she could have called at st pierre and our man could have seen her its pretty obvious that he came across something and the deuxieme agree with me theyre sending a man across to work with you on this thing i wondered when we were coming to that mallory said sir charles pushed a file across raoul guyon aged twentynine he was a captain in a colonial parachute regiment went straight to indochina from st cyr in mallory looked down at the photograph it showed a young man slimhipped and wiry the sleeves of his camouflaged jacket rolled up to expose sunburnt arms the calm sunblackened face dark eyes were shaded by a peaked cap that somehow gave him a strangely sinister forbidding appearance why did he leave the army god knows sir charles said i should imagine six years in algeria was enough for any man he asked to be placed on unpaid leave and legrande of the deuxieme offered him a job when do i meet him you dont for the moment apparently hes quite a talented painter hes using that as a cover should book in at the hotel on lie de roc sometime tomorrow what about me a little more complicated im afraid if de beaumont is up to no good then hell be expecting company we need to make your background convincing enough to fool him for at least a day or two and i might as well tell you now thats all the time we can allow what do i do mallory asked sir charles opened another file and passed a photo across the girl who stared out at mallory was somewhere in her twenties dark hair closecropped like a young boys almondshaped eyes slanting across high cheekbones she was not beautiful in any conventional sense and yet in a crowd she would have stood out anne grant he said instinctively sir charles nodded she came over this morning to finalise the purchase of a thirtyfoot motorcruiser called foxhunter its moored at lulworth now apparently she hired a seaman through the pool to skipper the thing for a couple of months till she and her sisterinlaw get used to it for themselves a big boat for a couple of girls mallory nodded i ran one in and out of tangiers for a while back in remember think you could handle one again mallory grinned i dont see why not sir charles nodded in satisfaction first youll have to get rid of this seaman after that all you have to do is make sure you get his job that shouldnt prove too difficult mallory hesitated and went on couldnt we work something out with general grant let him know what were after hed be certain to cooperate sir charles shook his head before you knew where you were hed be running the whole damned show in any case im never happy about bringing amateurs into these things if it can be avoided they give the game away too easily use him by all means but only in an extreme situation where theres no other way he got to his feet abruptly i want results on this one neil and i want them fast cut any corners you have to ill back you all the way one corner of mallorys mouth twitched ironically i seem to remember someone saying that to me once before sir charless face was grave and dispassionate the eyes calm and mallory knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if necessary the old man would not have the slightest compunction in throwing him to the wolves im sorry neil he said at least i know where i stand with you mallory shrugged thats something sir charles took an old gold watch from his pocket and checked it quickly youll have to get moving ive arranged for you to be fully briefed by at eight oclock theyll give you everything money seamans papers and a special transmitter report your arrival after that radio silence till you have some news ive arranged for three mtbs to proceed to jersey ostensibly for shallowwater exercises the moment we get anything positive from you theyll move in so fast de beaumont wont know whats hit him mallory walked to the door as he opened it the old man said good luck neil with the right kind this could turn out to be a pretty straightforward one arent they all mallory said dryly and the door closed gently behind him chapter four gs professor yoshiyama was little more than five feet in height and wore a judo jacket and trousers many times washed a black belt around his waist the face was the mans most outstanding feature the skin the colour of parchment and almost transparent there was nothing weak there only strength and intelligence and a kind of gentleness it could have been that of a saint or scholar it was in fact the face of a great master who had practised his art for more than fifty years his voice was dry and rather pedantic the vowels clipped slightly but the dozen men sitting crosslegged on the floor were giving him all their attention high in the balcony of the gymnasium mallory leaned on the rail and watched the literal meaning of the two japanese characters which make up the word karate is empty hands yoshiyama said this refers to the fact that karate developed as a system of selfdefence relying solely on unarmed techniques the system was first developed centuries ago on the island of okinawa during a time when the inhabitants were forbidden to carry arms on pain of death there was a strangely oldfashioned flavour to everything he said as if he were repeating a lesson painfully learned he turned to a large wall chart which carried an outline of a human figure with all vital points and their respective striking areas clearly marked the system consists of techniques of blocking or deflecting an attack and of counterattacking by punching striking or kicking he turned his face bland expressionless but there is more to karate that wellpractised tricks and physical force he tapped his head there is also the mental application you will be taught how to focus all your strength and energy on a single target at any given time let me show you what i mean he nodded briefly and his two assistants picked up three lengths of planking they were perhaps two feet long each plank an inch thick the two men took up their positions in front of yoshiyama holding the three planks between them and slightly above waistlevel in a single incredibly fluid motion the old mans left foot stamped forward and his right fist moved up from the waist knuckles extended there was a report like a gunshot and the planks split from end to end a quick murmur rose from the class and yoshiyama turned quite unperturbed it is also possible to snap a brick in half with the edge of the hand he permitted himself one brief smile but this requires practice major adams please a small wiry middleaged man with greying hair and a black patch over his right eye stood up at the back of the class and came forward like yoshiyama he wore a black belt but where his left arm should have been a metal limb dangled you will observe that major adams is rather a small man yoshiyama said he is also no longer in the prime of life if we add to this the fact that he has only one arm one would not under normal circumstances give him much hope of surviving any kind of physical assault as it happens however his circumstances are far from normal he nodded to one of his assistants and moved out of the way the assistant a young powerfully built japanese with dark hair ran to the far side of the gymnasium he selected a knife from a table which contained an assortment of weapons turned and ran forward a bloodcurdling cry surging from his throat he swerved to one side came to a dead stop then moved in quickly the knife slashing at the majors face adams moved with incredible speed warding off the attacking arm with an extended knifehand block at the same moment he fell diagonally forward to one side and delivered a roundhouse kick to the groin in what was virtually the same motion he kicked at his opponents kneejoint with the same foot the japanese somersaulted ending flat on his back and the foot thudded across his windpipe for a moment they lay there and then both men scrambled to their feet grinning widely in other circumstances and had the blows been delivered with full force my assistant would now be dead yoshiyama said simply adams picked up a towel started to wipe sweat from his face and caught sight of mallory in the gallery he nodded briefly said something to yoshiyama and moved across to the door mallory met him in the corridor outside what are you trying to do go out in a blaze of glory adams grinned every so often i get so sick of the sight of that damned desk that i could blow my top yoshiyama provides a most efficient safetyvalve he ran a hand over his right hip and winced slightly that last fall hurt like hell i must be getting old as they mounted the stairs at the end of the corridor mallory thought about adams one of the best agents the department had ever had all the guts in the world and a mind like a steel trap until the night hed got too close for someones comfort and theyd tied a mills bomb to the handle of his hotel bedroom in cairo and now he was a desk man running the intelligence section that was the pulsebeat of the whole organisation some people would have said he was lucky but not adams he opened a door and walked through a small neat office a middleaged desiccatedlooking spinster with neat grey hair and rimless spectacles sat behind the typewriter she glanced up an expression of disapproval on her face and adams grinned dont say it milly just tell them im ready he led the way into his own office like sir charless it commanded a fine view of the river the desk standing by the window he opened a cupboard took out a heavy bathrobe and pulled it on sorry about the delay i thought sir charles would keep you for an hour at least more like fifteen minutes mallory said he always goes straight to the heart of things with the sticky ones i wouldnt call it that adams said interesting more than anything else whole thing could be just a storm in a teacup lets go into the projection room he opened the far door and they descended a few steps into a small hall there were several rows of comfortable seats and a large screen the place was quite deserted they sat down and mallory offered adams a cigarette any gaps in this one adams exhaled with a sigh of pleasure and shook his head dont think so nothing important anyway has the old man told you much hes outlined the job told me who the principals are no more than that lets get started then adams turned and glanced up at the projection box where a dim light showed ready when you are a section of film started to run a few moments later it showed a submarine entering port slowly her crew lining the deck to start withthats what all the fuss is about adams said lalouette taken at oran a couple of years ago she looks rather small there cant be more than a dozen men on deck originally a german uboat type xxiii just over a hundred feet long does about twelve kilometres submerged crew of sixteen what about armament two twentyoneinch torpedoes in the bow and she doesnt carry spares doesnt leave much room for mistakes adams nodded they never really amounted to anything this one was built at deutsches werft in and sunk with all hands in the baltic she was raised in refitted and handed over to the french the film ended and a slide appeared it showed a young french naval officer eyes serious beneath the uniform cap the rather boyish face schooled to gravity henri fenelon full lieutenant hes her commander age twentysix unmarried born in nantes father still lives there runs a small wineexporting business mallory studied the face for a moment or two looks weak to me ever been in action adams shook his head why do you ask mallory shrugged he looks as if he could crack easily whats his political background thats the surprising thing we cant find any evidence of an oas connection at all probably did it for adventure mallory said he only needed half a dozen men in the crew to agree with him they could have coerced the rest sounds feasible adarns said lets move on various slides followed there was an admiralty chart of lie de roc with the harbour the hotel and general grants house all clearly marked st pierre was little more than a rock lifting a hundred or so feet out of the sea and crowned by the victorian gothic castle mallory shook his head god knows how they ever managed to build the damned thing out there eighteensixtyone adams said a selfmade industrialist called bryant bit of a megalomaniac saw himself as king of the castle and so on cost him better than a hundred thousand to build the place and that was real money in those days i cant see a jetty is it on the other side theres a cave at the base of the cliffs if you look carefully you can see the entrance the jettys inside the castle faded and another picture took its place it was that of a distinguishedlooking man with silvering haireyes calm in a sensitive aquiline face de beaumont mallory said adams nodded philippe comte de beaumont one of the oldest of the great french families hes even a rather distant blood relation of youknowwho which makes the whole thing even more complicated i know quite a lot about his military history mallory said after all hes something of a hero to paratroopers the world over he came over here during the war and joined de gaulle didnt he thats right received just about every decoration possible afterwards he went to indochina as a colonel of colonial paratroops the viets picked him up at the surrender of dienbienphu in after his release he returned to france and was posted to algeria he was always at loggerheads with the top brass once had an argument with the old man himself at an official reception over what constitutes war in the modern sense that should have been enough to get him put out to grass on its own adams shrugged they needed him i suppose after all he was the most outstanding paratroop colonel in algeria at that time handled all the dirtier jobs the top brass didnt want to soil its fingers with so he helped bring de gaulle back to power thats right a prime mover in the algerie frangaise movement the general of course kicked him right in the teeth by granting independence to algeria after all and de beaumont cleared out after chalks rather abortive little coup last year whether or not he was actually mixed up in that little lot we cant be certain the point is that he left france and bought this place on st pierre from hamish grant caused quite a stir in the french papers at the time and hes kept his nose clean since then as a whistle adams grinned even the french cant turn anything up on him he runs a boat by the way fortyfoot twinscrew motoryacht named fleur de lys the very latest thing for deepsea cruising with depthsounder automatic pilot and hp daf diesels a bit of a recluse but hes been seen in st helier occasionally what do you think id say he has the kind of inbred arrogance that can only come from a thousand years of always being right or at least thinking you were mallory said men like him can never sit still they usually have to be plotting at one thing or another comes from that natural assumption that anything conflicting with their own views must be wrong interesting adams said he has more the look of a seventeenthcentury puritan to me one of the thinlipped intolerant variety a damned good colonel in the new model army jesus and no quarter mallory shook his head hes no bigot simply a rather arrogant aristocrat with a limited field of vision and an absolute conviction of the tightness of his own actions when he decides on a plan of attack he follows it through to the bitter end thats what made him such an outstanding officer for men like him the rot sets in only if they step outside themselves and see just how much the whole damned thing is costing an interesting analysis considering youve only seen his photo i know about him as a soldier mallory said at dienbienphu they offered to fly him out he was too valuable to lose he refused in his last message he said theyd been wrong from headquarters staff down to himself that the whole dienbienphu strategy had been a terrible mistake he said that if his men had to stay and pay the price the least he could do was stay and pay it with them which probably accounted for his popularity with the troops adams said men like him are never loved by anyone mallory said even themselves de beaumonts picture was replaced by another the face which stared down at them was strong and brutal the eyes cold hair closecropped paul jacaud adams said aged forty parents unknown he was raised by the madame of a waterfront brothel in marseilles three years in the resistance joined the paratroops after the war he was sergeantmajor in de beaumonts regiment medaille militaire plus a courtmartial for murder that failed for lack of evidence and still with his old boss thats right you can make what you like out of that lets have a look at the angels now a picture of hamish grant flashed on the screen a famous one taken in the ardennes in the winter of montgomery stood beside him grinning as they examined a map he was every inch iron grant great shoulders bulging under a sheepskin coat quite a man mallory said and he hasnt changed much of course his sight isnt too good but hes still going strong written a couple of pretty good campaign histories of the last war what about the family hes a widower son was killed in korea at the moment his household consists of his daughter fiona daughterinlaw anne and an exgurkha naik called jagbir who was with him during the war this is the daughter fiona grant had long blonde hair and a heartshaped face that was utterly appealing rather a handful that one adams said she was raised in the south of france which didnt help they tried roedean but that was a complete fiasco she was finally settled in a paris finishing school which apparently suited her shes at home at the moment i like her mallory said shes got a good mouth then see what you think of this one anne grant the old mans daughterinlaw it was the same photograph that sir charles had shown him and mallory stared up at it his throat for some unaccountable reason going dry it was as if they had met before and yet he knew that to be impossible the almondshaped eyes seemed to come to life holding his gaze and he shook his head slightly shes over here now to finalise the purchase of a new boat sir charles told me that much what about this man sondergard shes hired through the pool well ship him out somewhere theres no difficulty there ive already got a little scheme in mind to bring you and anne grant together they next saw the picture of a frenchwoman called juliette vincente who was working at the hotel on lie de roc nothing was known against her and she seemed quite harmless as did owen morgan her employer when the welshmans face faded away mallory straightened in his seat thinking they had finished to his surprise another face appeared he turned to adams in surprise but this is raoul guyon the man im going to work with ive already seen his picture whats the idea adams shrugged tm not sure but im not really happy about the way the french are handling this business ive got a hunch that old spider legrande and the deuxieme arent telling us all they could under the circumstances it might prove useful to know everything there is to know about raoul guyon hes rather unusual mallory looked again at the photo sir charles had shown him the slim wiry figure in the camouflage uniform the sunblackened face the calm expressionless eyes tell me about him raoul guyon aged twentynine went straight to indochina from st cyr in hes the only known survivor of his particular cadet class for that year which is enough to set any man apart for a start he wasnt at dienbienphu adams shook his head no but he was at plenty of other hot spots he was up to his ears in it in algeria there was some talk of a girl moorish i think she was murdered by the fln and it had a big effect on him he was badly wounded a day or two later there followed a picture of guyon half raised on a stretcher his chest heavily bandaged blood soaking through the face was sunken beyond pain the eyes stared into an abyss of loneliness theres a lad whos been through the fire mallory said and then some commander of the legion of honour croix de la valeur militaire and half a dozen mentions in dispatches on top of that he paints like an angel a man to be reckoned with and dont you forget it for the next twenty minutes they continued to sit there discussing questions of time and place some important technical data and various other items all of which were relevant to the success of the operation when they finally returned to the office adams sat behind his desk and nodded at a large and wellfilled intray look at that lot he said with an expression of disgust god in heaven but id trade places with you neil mallory grinned i wonder is there anything else adams shook his head call in at the technical branch theyve got a rather neat line in transmitters for you theyll give you a callsign suitable code and so on come back in half an hour ill have some identity papers and things ready plus a rough outline of my little scheme to bring you and mrs grant together now that i look forward to mallory said and the strange thing was that he really did as he went along the corridor and descended the stairs to the technical branch the memory of her haunted him those strange eyes searching looking for something he sighed heavily taking it all in all it looked as if this whole affair could become really complicated chapter five passage by night foxhunter ahoy ahoy foxhunter the boat lay at anchor fifty yards out from the beach her cream and yellow hull a vivid splash of colour against the white cliffs of the cove a small wind moved in from the sea lifting the water across the shingle and darkness was falling fast anne grant shivered slightly as a light drizzle drifted across her face she was tired and hungry and her ankle had started to ache again she opened her mouth to hail the boat a second time and neil mallory appeared on deck he dropped over the stern into the dinghy and rowed towards her he was wearing kneelength rubber boots and when the prow of the fibreglass dinghy ground on the wet shingle he stepped into the shallows and swung it round so that the stern was beached he held out his hand for the girls suitcase and smiled how do you feel all the better for being here she said its been a long day i had a lot of running around to do she was wearing a tweed suit with a narrow skirt and a sheepskin coat he helped her into the stern seat pushed off and rowed for the boat anne took in the flared raking bow and long sloping deckhouse of foxhunter with a conscious pleasure as she breathed deeply of the good sea air she smiled at mallory what do you think of her foxhunter he nodded shes a thoroughbred all right but thats still an awful lot of boat for two women to handle as a regular thing how old is your sisterinlaw fiona is eighteen whatever that proves i think you underrate us what about the engines he said theyll need looking after weve no worries there owen morgan who runs the hotel on the island is a retired ships engineer hell give us any help we need and theres always jagbir whos he mallory said quickly remembering that he wasnt supposed to know the generals orderly he was a naik in a gurkha regiment theyve been together since the early days of the war he hasnt had what you would call a formal education but hes still the best cook ive ever come across and he has an astonishing aptitude for anything mechanical sounds like a good man to have around the house mallory said they bumped against the side of foxhunter and he handed her up the short ladder and followed with her suitcase what time would you like to leave she took the case from him as soon as you like have you eaten not since noon til change and make some supper we can leave afterwards when she had gone mallory pulled the dinghy round to the stern and hoisted it over the rail by now darkness was falling fast and he turned on the red and green navigation lights and went below he found her working at the stove in the galley wearing old denims and a polonecked sweater that somehow made her look more feminine than ever she looked over her shoulder and smiled bacon and eggs all right suits me he said when it was ready they sat opposite each other at the saloon table and ate in companionable silence as she poured coffee a sudden flurry of rain drummed against the roof she looked up at him eyebrows raised that doesnt sound too good whats the forecast threetofour wind rain squalls nothing to get worked up about are you worried not in the slightest she smiled slightly i always like to know what im getting into thats all dont we all mrs grant he got to his feet i think we ought to get started when he went on deck the wind tiad increased scattering the drizzle in silver cobwebs through the navigation lights he went into the wheelhouse pulled on his reefer jacket and spent a couple of minutes looking at the chart the door swung open a flurry of wind lifting the chart like a sail and anne grant appeared at his elbow she was wearing her sheepskin coat and a scarf was tied around her head peasantfashion all set he said she nodded her eyes gleaming with excitement in the light from the chart table he pressed the starter the engines coughed once asthmatically then roared into life he took foxhunter round in a long sweeping curve and out through the entrance of the cove into the channel the masthead light swung rhythmically from side to side as the swell started to roll beneath them and spray scattered against the window a couple of points to starboard the red and green navigation lights of a steamer were clearly visible a mile out to sea mallory reduced speed to ten knots and they ploughed forward into the darkness the sound of the engines a muted throbbing on the night air he grinned at her nothing much wrong there with any kind of luck we should have a clear run when do you want me to take over he shrugged no rush get some sleep ill call you when i feel tired the door banged behind her and a small trapped wind whistled round the wheelhouse and died in a corner he pulled the hinged seat down from the wall lit a cigarette and settled back comfortably watching the foam curl along the prow this was the sort of thing he looked forward to on a voyage to be alone with the sea and the night the world outside retreated steadily as foxhunter moved into the darkness and he started to work his way methodically through his briefing from beginning to end considering each point carefully before moving on to another it was in recalling that de beaumont had been in indochina that he remembered that raoul guyon had been there also mallory frowned and lit another cigarette there might be a connection although adams hadnt said anything about such a possibility on the other hand guyon hadnt been a viet prisoner which made a difference one hell of a difference he checked the course altering it a point to starboard and settled back again in the seat turning the collar of his reefer jacket up around his face gradually his mind wandered away on old forgotten paths and he thought of people he had known incidents which had happened good and bad with a sort of measured sadness his life seemed to be like a dark sea rolling towards the edge of the world hurrying him to nowhere he checked his watch and found with a sense of surprise that it was after midnight the door opened softly coinciding with a spatter of rain on the window and anne grant came in carrying a tray you promised to call me she said reproachfully i couldnt believe my eyes when i wakened and saw the time youve been up here a good four hours i feel fine he said could go on all night she placed the tray on the chart table and filled two mugs from a covered pot ive made tea you didnt seem to care for the coffee at supper is there anything you dont notice he demanded she handed him a mug and smiled in the dim light the soldiers drink what are you after he said the gory details she pulled down the other seat and handed him a sandwich only what you want to tell me he considered the point and knew that as always a partial truth was better than a direct lie i was kicked out in go on she said my pay didnt stretch far enough he shrugged you know how it is i was in charge of a messing account and borrowed some cash to tide me over unfortunately the auditors arrived early that month they usually do in cases like mine i dont believe you she said deliberately suit yourself he got to his feet and stretched shes on automatic pilot so youll be all right for a while ill be up at quarter to four to change course she sat there looking at him without speaking her eyes very large in the halflight and he turned opened the door and left her there he went down to the cabin and flopped on his bunk staring up at the bulkhead through the darkness there had been women before there always were but only to satisfy a need never to get close to that had been the way for a long time and he had been content now this strange quiet girl with her cropped hair had come into his life and quietly refused to be pushed aside his last conscious thought was of her face glowing in the darkness and she was smiling at him he was not aware of having slept only of being awake and looking at his watch and realising with a sense of shock that it was halfthree he pulled on his jacket and went on deck there was quite a sea running and cold rain stung his face as he walked along the heaving deck and opened the glasspanelled door of the wheelhouse anne grant was standing at the wheel her face disembodied in the compass light how are things going he asked im enjoying myself theres been a sea running for about half an hour now he glanced out of the window likely to get worse before it gets better ill take over she made way for him her soft body pressing against his as they squeezed past each other i dont think i could sleep now even if i wanted to he grinned make some more tea then and come back things might get interesting he increased speed a little racing the heavy weather that threatened from the east and after a while she returned with the tea the wheel kicked like a living thing in his hands and he strained his eyes into the grey waste of the morning the sea grew rougher waves rocking foxhunter from side to side and again mallory increased speed until the prow seemed to lift clean out of the water each time a wave rolled beneath them half an hour later they raised alderney and he became aware of that great tidal surge that drives in through the channel islands raising the level of the water in the golfe de st malo by as much as thirty feet he altered course for guernsey and asked anne to get the forecast on the radio in the saloon she took her time over it and when she came back she carried more tea and sandwiches on a tray its pretty hopeful she said wind moderating rain squalls dying away anything else some fog patches in the islands but nothing to worry about gradually the wind died the sea calmed and they ran into a clear september morning with a slight mist rising from the water mallory opened a window and inhaled the freshness when he turned she was smiling at him you can handle a boat mr mallory ill say that for you dont forget to mention the fact in my reference she smiled picked up the tray and went out again he leaned over the chart and checked the course foxhunter rounded les hanois lighthouse on the western tip of guernsey an hour and a half later and seagulls and cormorants cried harshly in the sky sweeping in across the deck from the great cliffs already visibility was becoming worse fog drifting in patches across the open sea as guernsey dropped behind the horizon he set the automatic pilot leaned over the chart and anne grant came in how are we doing with any kind of luck we should reach lie de roc in an hour to an hour and a half depends on the fog if we run into any really bad patches things could get tricky theres a largescale admiralty chart of the island and its approaches in the top drawer she said i bought it specially he took it out and they leaned over it together he de roc was perhaps two miles long and three across the only anchorage a bay at the southern end the entire area was encircled by a network of sunken reefs with only two deepwater channels giving anything like a safe passage through til take her if you like anne said i know these waters like the back of my hand and you need to the damned place looks like a deathtrap mallory shook his head i wouldnt like to be drifting in on those shores on a dirty night a lot of good ships have done just that you see st pierre a mile to the north in the old days whenever a gale was blowing in from the atlantic ships were often swept between the two islands to founder on the great sunken reef which links them at low tide the waterlevel drops as much as thirtyfeet and you can see some of those old wrecks dangerous waters to go swimming in she nodded especially at the wrong time as a matter of fact the barman from owen morgans hotel was drowned only the other day his body drifted in the evening before i left not so good mallory moved on quickly i see theres a castle marked on st pierre a gothic mausoleum its out on a twentyyear lease to a french count philippe de beaumont the place is going to be busier than i thought she shook her head we dont see much of him he stays pretty close to home and we dont get many visitors on the island the hotel only has six bedrooms theyre booked right through the summer of course but owen usually ends the season at the beginning of september he likes to enjoy the last of the good weather himself he wont need much staff then only during the season and then he uses guernsey girls hes had a french cook living in fulltime for nearly a year now she should have left at the end of the season but stayed on sounds a rather obvious setup she shrugged its their own affair and shes a nice girl i hope he marries her the fog lifted a little and on either hand the sea broke in a white foam over great reefs mallory smiled grimly i think this is where you start doing your stuff she took over the wheel and altered course half a point a moment later through a sudden break in the fog the towering cliffs of the island loomed into view and then the grey curtain dropped into place again mallory reduced speed and anne grant took the cruiser forward into the fog she seemed completely unperturbed and he shrugged fatalistically pulled down the other seat and took out a cigarette at that moment the whole boat rocked violently and mallory and the girl were thrown across to the other side of the wheelhouse foxhunter yawed alarmingly and mallory shoved the girl away and scrambled across to the spinning wheel as he pulled the boat back on course anne grant moved beside him and they peered out into the fog perhaps a hundred feet to starboard he caught a glimpse of something solid moving through the water and a sizable wave rolled back to rock foxhunter again and what in the hell was that he said probably a basking shark theyre common enough in these waters but it must have been a big one to leave a wake like that mallory stared out into the fog a frown on his face remembering the force of that wave could a shark however big it was have set up such a disturbance he was still thinking about it when they emerged from the last patch of fog and lie de roc reared out of the sea a quarter of a mile away to the west was st pierre much smaller a little blurred because visibility at that distance still wasnt good between the two islands the sea frothed and roared over the great underwater bridge were in the clear now anne grant said and he gave foxhunter everything she had as they roared through the water towards the great round cove which opened to meet them the water was a deep translucent blue reminding him strangely of the mediterranean a stone jetty jutted fifty feet out from the shore and above it was the hotel a twostoreyed whitepainted building sheltering in a hollow from the winter gales a fifteenfoot launch was moored on the far side of the cove a young darkhaired man in sunglasses was sitting in the stern looking over the side as he turned towards them a swimmer surfaced and mallory caught a flash of blonde hair when they were a hundred feet from the jetty he cut the engines and foxhunter settled back into the water drifting in on her own momentum anne grant was already getting the fenders over the side and mallory ran out to help her the moment they touched he jumped for the jetty with a line and ran it twice around an iron bollard foxhunter jerked once bumped against the jetty and was still as he moved to fasten the other line an engine roared into life the sound echoing harshly from the cliffs and the launch came towards the jetty the swimmer was already almost there anne grant moved to the port rail and mallory joined her fiona she said simply as the girl arrived mallory leaned down and hauled her up and over the rail she crouched on deck for a moment laughing and shaking herself like a young puppy but its marvellous anne simply marvellous she didnt even look eighteen long blonde hair trailing damply to her shoulders she wore a pair of bathing pants and the upper half of a rubber diving suit in bright yellow that fitted her slim figure like a second skin she examined mallory with interest and her eyes widened in approval and where did you find him anne laughed and kissed her affectionately now dont start fiona this is neil mallory hes going to run the boat for us for a month or two till we get the hang of things fiona grant pushed a tendril of wet hair out of her eyes and held out her hand i dont know about anne but speaking for myself ill try not to learn too fast the launch was no more than twenty or thirty feet away now and its occupant cut the engine and it drifted in towards foxhunter whos this for goodness sake anne demanded fiona slipped a wet arm in hers a simply marvellous man anne hes french staying here for a week or two to paint and do a little skindiving but i thought owen closed the hotel last week he did but luckily i was on the jetty when he came in i persuaded owen to change his mind the launch bumped against the side and mallory caught the thrown line as he looped it round the rail the frenchman vaulted on to the deck he wore a slimfitting jersey that left his sunburnt arms bare and the dark glasses gave him the same slightly sinister and anonymous look the peaked military cap had done in the photo in his file fiona took his arm and turned to face them anne id like you to meet raoul guyon she said chapter six iron grant the ancient greystone house was firmly rooted into a hollow in the hill great beech trees flanking it on either side at some time a large glass conservatory had been added running along the whole length of the building and a series of shallow steps dropped down to a stone terrace from the terrace the cliffs fell a good two hundred feet into a small funnelshaped inlet that would have made a wonderfully sheltered mooring had it not been for the jagged line of rocks stretching across the entrance anne grant leaned on the wall a cool drink in her hand and looked out to sea it had turned into a beautiful day surprisingly warm for september with a scattering of white clouds trailing to the horizon she felt completely relaxed and at peace happy to be home again a foot crunched on gravel when she turned her fatherinlaw stood at the top of the steps majorgeneral hamish grant dso mg and bar had been well named iron grant six feet four inches in height with a great breadth of shoulders his hair was a snowwhite mane swept back behind his ears he wore an old pair of khaki service trousers and a corduroy jacket he probed at the top step with his walking stick you there anne here i am hamish she went up the stops and took his arm and his great craggy face broke into a warm smile fiona seemed tremendously excited about the new boat but she was hardly in the house for a moment before she was changed and off out again in a corner of the terrace stood a table containing a tray of drinks and shaded by a large striped umbrella she led him across and he eased his great bulk into a wicker chair shes gone down to the hotel to meet raoul guyon this young french painter whos staying there she promised to show him some of the island before lunch what about this fellow mallory he should be here at any moment i asked him to pick up the diving equipment there was no real hurry but i thought you might like to meet him i certainly would if only to thank him for the way he handled this southampton affair he frowned mallory neil mallory theres something familiar about that name irish of course he certainly doesnt have an accent and you say he was cashiered for cooking the mess books that certainly doesnt fit in with the sort of man whod take on a couple of thugs in a back alley thats what i thought hes a strange man hamish at times theres something almost frightening about him hes so curiously remote and detached from things i think youll like him id love to know why they slung him out the general said mind you the war office god bless em do some pretty daft things these days id rather you didnt raise the subject she said promise he frowned for a moment and then shrugged i dont see why not after all a mans past is his own affair can he sail the boat thats the main thing she nodded perfectly then what have we got to grumble about he squeezed her hand get me a brandy and soda like a good girl and tell me some more about foxhunter she didnt get the chance as she was pouring his drink jagbir appeared at the top of the steps mallory a yard or two behind him the gurkha was short and squat no more than five feet tall and wore a neat sandcoloured linen jacket he had the ageless yellowbrown face of the asiatic and limped heavily on his left foot relic of a bad wound received at cassino he spoke good english with the easy familiarity of the old servant mr mallorys here general the general sipped a little of his brandy and put the glass down again whats on the stove curried chicken when would you like to have it any time you like serve it out here mallory stood at the top of the steps waiting cap in hand and anne smiled up at him would you care to have lunch with us mr mallory he shook his head its good of you to offer but ive already arranged to eat at the hotel she dismissed jagbir with a quick nod trying to hide her disappointment and mallory came down the steps this is mr mallory general she said formally hamish grant turned towards mallory his head slightly to one side come a bit closer man i dont see very well mallory moved to the table and looked down into the cloudy opalescent eyes the general reached out and touched him gently on the chest my daughterinlaw tells me youre a good sailor i hope so mallory said what was your last ship an oiltanker ss pilar tampico to southampton the general turned to anne did you check his papers she shook her head and he looked up at mallory again lets see them mallory took a wallet from his hip pocket extracted a folded document and union card and tossed them on the table see when he last paid off and check the union card there should be a photo she checked the documents quickly and nodded paid off ss pilar southampton st september she smiled as she handed them back it isnt a very good photo mallory didnt reply and the general continued the terms mrs grant agreed with you youre quite satisfied with them perfectly therell be a bonus of one hundred pounds for you on top some token of my gratitude for the way you handled this southampton business that wont be necessary sir mallory said coolly blood surged into the generals face in an instant by god sir if i say it is necessary it is necessary youll take orders like everyone else mallory adjusted his cap and turned to anne you mentioned some diving equipment you wanted me to take down to the boat she took a hurried glance at the generals purple face and said quickly youll find a station wagon in the courtyard at the rear jabbers already loaded it ill be down later this afternoon til expect you mallory turned to the general anything else sir no damn your eyes the general exploded a smile tugged at the corner of mallorys mouth his hand started upwards in an instinctive salute he caught himself just in time glanced once at anne turned and ran lightly up the steps the general started to laugh pour me another brandy anne uncorked the bottle and reached for his glass am i right in assuming all that was quite deliberate of course hamish grant said and ill add to your mystery my dear there goes a man who once was used to command and high command at that i didnt spend forty years in the army for nothing high on the cliffs on the western side of the island raoul guyon and fiona grant topped a steep hill and paused before them the island seemed to tumble over the cliffs and the great jagged spine which joined them to st pierre was visible under the water there she said making a sweeping gesture with one hand did i lie to you you were right he said absolutely magnificent ill expect to see you up here with your easel first thing in the morning youll be disappointed i always work from preliminary sketches never from life she had moved a few feet away stooping to pick up a flower and now she turned quickly fraud he took a small sketchpad and pencil from the pocket of his corduroy jacket and dropped to the ground stay where you are but look out to sea she obeyed him at once all right but this had better be good dont chatter he said it distracts me the sun glinted on her strawcoloured hair and her image blurred so that in that one brief moment of time she might have been a painting by renoir she looked incredibly young and innocent and yet the wind from the sea moulded the thin cotton dress to her firm young figure with a disturbing sensuousness guyon grunted and pocketed his pencil all right she dropped beside him and snatched the pad from his hand in the same moment her smile died and colour stained her cheeks inescapably caught in a few brief strokes of the pencil for all eternity she stood gazing out to sea and by some strange genius all that was good in her all the innocence and longing of youth were there also she looked up at him in wonderment its beautiful but you are he said calmly has no one ever told you this before i learned rather early in life that its dangerous to let them she smiled ruefully until my mother died four years ago we lived in a villa near st tropez you know it extremely well in st tropez in season anything female is in demand and fourteenyearold girls seem to have a strong appeal for some men so ive heard he said gravely yes life had its difficulties but then the general bought this little island and i went to school for a couple of years i didnt like that at all what did you do run away she pushed her long hair back from her face and laughed persuaded the general to send me to a finishing school in paris now that was really something guyon grinned and lit a cigarette tell me why do you always call him general she shrugged everyone does except for anne of course shes special when she married my brother angus she was only my age he was killed in korea she paused a few wild flowers held to her face as she stared pensively into the past and guyon lay back gazing up at the sky sadness sweeping through him as he remembered another time another girl algiers after five months chasing fellaghas in the cork forests of die grande kabylie he had found himself in that city of fear leading his men through the narrow streets of the kasbah and bab el oued locked in the lifeordeath struggle that was the battle of algiers and then nerida had come into his life a young moorish girl fleeing from a mob after a bomb outrage on the boulevard du telemly he closed his eyes and saw again her dark hair tumbling across a pillow moonlight streaming through a latticed window the long nights when they had tried to forget tomorrow but the morning had come the cold grey morning when she had been found on the beach stripped and defiled head shaven body mutilated the proper ending for a woman who had betrayed her people for a frangaoui the snipers bullet of the following day which had sent him back to france on a stretcher had almost carried a welcome oblivion nerida the scent of her was strong in his nostrils and he reached out and pulled her down crushing his lips against hers her body was soft and yielding and when she swung on to her back her mouth answered sweet as honey he opened his eyes and fiona grant smiled lazily up at him now what brought that on he leaned on one elbow for a moment and rubbed a hand across his eyes tut it down to the sea air im sorry tin not then you should be he pulled her to her feet didnt you tell me you were expected for lunch she held on to his hand come back with me id like you to meet the general some other time ive arranged to eat at the hotel she turned from him like a hurt child he restrained a strong impulse to take her in his arms reminded himself strongly that he had work to do important work and walked away when he reached the top of the rise he hesitated and turned reluctantly she was standing where he had left her head drooping something touchingly despondent about her the strong sunlight streaming through the thin cotton of her dress outlined her firm young thighs perfectly damn her he said softly to himself she might as well have nothing on he sighed heavily and went back down the slope mallory lay on his bunk in foxhunter watching the blue smoke from his cigarette twist and swirl in the current from the airconditioner hed had an excellent meal at the hotel in company with owen morgan but there had been no sign of the frenchman his mind went back again to his meeting with hamish grant at the house on the cliffs there had been method behind the old mans bullying of that he was certain he had been a soldier himself for too long to subscribe to the opinion that all generals were rather stupid dullwitted blimps who spent their time either needlessly sending men to their deaths or overindulging at the table behind the worn leathercoloured face the halfblind eyes was a will of iron and a firstrate brain iron grant who had forcemarched his division through the hell that was the qattara depression rather than surrender to rommel who had led the way down the ramp of the first landing craft to hit sword beach on dday was an adversary to be reckoned with by any standards and then there was his daughterinlaw mallory closed his eyes trying to picture her face there was a calmness about her a sureness that he found disturbing even on the wharf at southampton she had not seemed afraid it was as if life had done its worst could do no more as if nothing could ever really hurt her again it came to him quite suddenly that she must have loved her husband very much and he was aware of a vague irrational jealousy he heard no sound and yet it was as if a wind had passed over his face and every muscle came alive and singing ready for instant action the lower step of the companionway creaked and he reached for the butt of the revolver under his pillow no need my friend raoul guyon said quietly as mallory opened his eyes the young frenchman dropped on to the opposite bunk and produced a packet of cigarettes we missed you at lunch mallory said what happened guyon shrugged something came up you know how it is i certainly do theres grass on your jacket a fine day for lying on ones back and contemplating heaven guyon said brazenly not when theres a job to be done mallory opened a cupboard under the bunk took out a bottle of whisky and two glasses and set them on the table business and pleasure dont mix on occasion im happy to say that they do am i not supposed to be a funloving young artist on vacation guyon poured himself a generous measure of whisky and raised his glass sante slimhipped lean and sinewy raoul guyon possessed that strange quality to be found in the airborne troops of every country a kind of arrogant selfsufficiency bred of the hazards of the calling while unaware of this in himself he recognised it at once in the englishman but there was more than that much more mallory was the same strange mixture of soldier and monk of manofaction and mystic that he had seen in the great paratroop colonels in algiers men like philippe de beaumont strange wild halfmad fanatics marred by their experiences in the viet prison camps for the time controlling the destiny of a great nation but mallory also had passed through the fire of a communist prison camp and like philippe de beaumont he had tried to put into practise those lessons hard learned from his chinese taskmasters and with the same disastrous result mallory lit a cigarette and leaned back against the bulkhead how good is your skindiving guyon shrugged i know what im doing a little out of practice thats all anne grant wants me to take her out over the reef this afternoon shes brought a couple of aquamobiles back from the mainland wants to try them out i thought if you asked fiona nicely you might get yourself invited as a matter of fact i already have all part of my businesscumpleasure activities you dont waste much time mallory grinned well see how things look we can make a fullscale reconnaissance later tonight you really think there may be something in this business mallory shrugged i wouldnt like to say as i was bringing the boat in this morning something damned big passed us underwater anne grant said it was a shark apparently theyre pretty common round here do you think its worth reporting mallory shook his head my boss is interested in facts not possibilities ive signalled my arrival and nothing more he opened the cupboard again took out what was apparently a small transistor radio and held it up amazing what they can do with electronics these days there are three motor torpedo boats based on st helier now supposed to be on shallowwater exercises if i give them the word theyll be in here like a shot whats the signal their codeword is leviathan when we need them we simply signal code four thats all thats needed mallory put the set in a drawer in the table and guyon helped himself to more whisky i was in touch with my own people before i left guernsey this morning theyve drawn a complete blank where lalouette is concerned its creating something of a situation what in the hell are the oas trying to prove mallory said this sort of thing isnt going to get them anywhere in the long run desperate men seek desperate remedies eight times since either the oas or the gnr have conspired to kill de gaulle they came closest last month when they ambushed his car on the way to villacoublay airport they picked the leader of that little affair up only last week so this latest business is to prove to people theyre still a force to be reckoned with more than that that they have a long arm which can reach out to punish those who oppose them this isnt the first member of the judiciary to be assassinated at this rate there will soon be no one willing to be connected with the trials of oas members especially when to take part carries an automatic death sentence what about bouvier he was public prosecutor at a military tribunal which only last month tried six members of the oas two were sentenced to death his execution was stagemanaged to have the maximum dramatic effect and the government cant hope to keep it secret beyond the end of the week which doesnt give us long to handle things here mallory frowned have you ever met de beaumont personally only as one of the crowd he was a member of the original committee of public safety which brought de gaulle back to power when it became obvious that the general wouldnt play along with his dream of an integrated algeria he fell to plotting or so we think was anything ever proved against him guyon shook his head it was thought that he was the power behind the scenes in general chiles abortive coup in but there was no evidence before any could be collected he asked to be placed on unpaid leave and left france hes extremely wealthy by the way one of his uncles married into industry after the first war what does legrande think about him guyon laughed legrande has little respect for the aristocracy he would see the guillotine set up in the old situation and smile at the prospect he has no proof that de beaumont it directly connected with the oas but he is unhappy about him he would be quite content to see him dead he has a naturally tidy mind and whats your own opinion of de beaumont guyon hesitated hes a dangerous man and no fool for a year he was in charge of all military intelligence in algeria but he was always at loggerheads with the brasshats he saw war as the communists see war as something to be won and he believed that the end justified the means something the boidois had beaten into him in the viet camps guyon half smiled this much at least i would expect you to have in common with him legrande told me that you too were behind the communist wire for a time you make him sound interesting mallory said id like to meet him ive a feeling that would tell me all i need to know very possibly guyon emptied his glass is there anything else you wish me to do this frenchwoman whos living at the hotel with morgan juliette vincente in my briefing they said she was harmless what do you think our preliminary report certainly didnt indicate anything unusual her mother and father have a small farm in normandy one brother killed doing his military service in algeria in she worked at an hotel in st malo for six months before coming here mallory nodded sounds all right but run the usual check on your room just to make sure it hasnt been searched guyon put on his sunglasses and got to his feet ill get changed see you in about half an hour and well have a look at that reefhe paused in the doorway and stretched it really is a beautiful day im quite looking forward to it after he had gone mallory sat on the edge of the bunk going over things in his mind trying to work out what might happen but he knew that he was wasting his time if there was one lesson he had learned above all others it was that in this game nothing was certain chance ruled every move he opened one of the lockers took out the diving gear and started to check it chapter seven on the reef mallory vaulted over the rail into the translucent blue water paused for a moment to adjust the flow of air from his aqualung and swam down in a long sweeping curve that brought him under the hull of foxhunter to where fiona grant swayed beside the anchor chain like some exotic flower in her yellow diving suit a moment later her sisterinlaw appeared beside them in a cloud of silver bubbles fiona jackknifed at once and followed the anchor chain down into the blue mist her long hair streaming out behind and mallory and anne went after her they were perhaps a hundred yards out from the shore on the southern side of the island and the water was saturated with sunlight so that even when they reached bottom at forty feet visibility was good the seabed was covered by a great spreading forest of seaweed six or seven feet deep which moved rhythmically with every ebb and flow of current changing colour like some living thing fiona swam into it fish scattering to avoid her mallory paused hovering over the undulating mass and anne tapped him on the shoulder and moved away they plunged over a great black spine of rock and a wall complete with arched norman window loomed out of the shadows a few feet to the right anne swam effortlessly through it and mallory followed it was obvious that only the strong tidal currents on this side of the island had prevented the building from being completely silted over centuries before it had no roof and the walls had crumbled until they stood no higher than four feet above the sand beyond the seabed sloped gently into another forest of seaweed broken walls and jumbled blocks of worked masonry strewn on every side fiona grant appeared from the gloom and swam towards them she poised a couple of feet away put a hand into the nylon bag which was looped to her left wrist and produced a piece of red pottery which she waved triumphantly anne raised her thumb and they all turned swam back across the rocks and struck upwards to foxhunters curved hull they surfaced by the small ladder suspended over the side and anne went up first mallory followed her pulled off his mask and turned to give fiona a hand she squatted on the deck taking the pieces of pottery from her bag one by one and laying them out carefully raoul guyon had set up an easel next to the wheelhouse and was sketching hamish grant who sat in the bows the frenchman put down his pencil and moved across to join them the general turned his head sharply whats going on fionas found some pottery anne said guyon turned to mallory a strange alienlooking figure in his webbed feet and black rubber suit whats it like down there interesting mallory said you should try it perhaps later id like to get my sketches of the general finished and the light is just right fiona unstrapped her aqualung squatted down on the deck again and started to sort through the pieces of pottery completely absorbed by her task anne turned to mallory thats the last well see of her today do you want to go down again she shook her head id like to try out the aquamobiles you take one and ill have the other well go round the point to the st pierre reef ill show you the middle passage and theres at least one interesting wreck guyon helped mallory bring the two aquamobiles up from the saloon they were bulletshaped underwater scooters driven by batteryoperated propellers designed to operate at depths of up to one hundred and fifty feet they carried their own spotlights for use when visibility was bad anne and mallory went over the side and guyon passed down the heavy scooters anne moved away at once running on the surface and mallory went after her the sea was calm the sun bright on the face of the water but as they approached the great finger of rock jutting out into the sea at the western end of the island mallory became aware of crosscurrents tugging at his body anne raised an arm in a quick signal and disappeared the sensation of speed underwater was extraordinary to mallory it seemed as if he were hurtling through space as he chased the yellowclad figure in front of him and yet his effective speed was not much more than three knots the red nose of the scooter whipped through the bluegreen water pulling him across a jumbled mass of black rocks for a moment currents seemed to pull his body in several directions at once and then he was round the point and into calmer water they surfaced by a weedcovered shoulder of rock and anne sat on its slope half out of the water and pulled up her mask on either side and stretching across to st pierre was white water surf breaking everywhere over the jagged rocks which made up the central reef mass at low tide most of the reef is twenty feet above water she said stretching all the way to st pierre like a giants causeway could it be crossed on foot she looked dubious i wouldnt like to try its only clear for an hour something to do with another flood which moves in this way from the atlantic a mile away the great jagged rock of st pierre lifted out of the sea the castle was perched on the ultimate edge of the cliffs its strange pointed gothic towers in sharp relief against the blue sky the sea creamed over rocks two hundred feet below what do you think of it she said it must have cost a fortune to build even on the golden tide of victorian prosperity he shaded his eyes and frowned i cant see a jetty its under the island if you look carefully beyond the last line of rocks youll see the entrance in the cliffs at high water theres only ten or twelvefoot clearance is the water very deep in there he said casually she nodded even at low water theres a good ten fathoms theres a fault in the seabed which splits the reef along the centre it runs right under st pierre would that be your famous middle passage thats right and its well worth seeing she clamped her rubber mouthpiece between her teeth pulled down the mask and eased herself back into the water visibility was still good and mallory could see the great boulders of the reef four or five fathoms beneath and then quite suddenly anne tilted her scooter over a shelf of granite and went down into space they moved through a misty tunnel of rock sunlight slanting through fissures and cracks in the roof in wavering bands of light in places the passage was reminiscent of a cathedral nave the rock arched up on either side to support the roof and then the dimness brightened and they moved into a section which was open to the sea anne was twenty or thirty feet in front and she paused waiting for him when he approached she jackknifed mallory went after her the scarlet nose of his scooter cleaving the water fish crowding to either side at ten fathoms he moved into a mysterious green dusk with visibility considerably reduced beneath him she had paused hovering over a ledge when he joined her he saw to his astonishment a threeton bedford truck wedged on its side in a large fissure the canvas tilt had long since disappeared but when he moved in close he saw painted on the side the white star which all allied vehicles had carried on dday and after they moved away again and a moment later the outline of a ships stern loomed out of the gloom every rail every line was festooned with strange submarine growths and he followed the curving side to where a ragged torpedo hole gaped darkly at him beneath tilted into a crevasse was a churchill tank beyond it the shapes of trucks a solitary fieldguns barrel slanting towards the surface mallory followed anne across the deck to the wheelhouse the open door swung gently in the current the deck around it smashed and broken as if by some internal explosion the wheel was still intact and also the compass in its mounting encrusted with scales when mallory moved inside he had a strange sensation that someone should be there that something was missing a bad end for a good ship he thought and moved out again she tapped him on the shoulder and together they rose towards the luminosity that was the surface they hauled themselves on to the flat top of a large rock dry in the sun and anne pulled up her mask and breathed deeply several times whats the story mallory said she shrugged one of the dday armada that never made it she was torpedoed near guernsey when her engines stopped the tide carried her straight in across the reef apparently the crew got away earlier in the lifeboats where did you get the story from owen morgan there are plenty of wrecks in these waters and owen knows them all and their histories something of a hobby with him interesting mallory said id like to take another look feel up to it i dont think so ill wait for you here dont stay too long when the tide starts turning theres quite an undercurrent through the passage he was aware of it almost at once like an invisible hand pushing him to one side as he went down over the edge of the reef the pressure of the water clawed at his mask as the scooter pulled him down and he swerved as a steel mast pierced the gloom he hovered over the tilting deck considering his next move the sight of the black gaping entrance to a companionway decided him he moved inside switching on the spot which was mounted on top of the scooter he moved along the angled corridor and opened the first door he came to it fell inwards slowly the room beyond it dark and he was aware of a strange irrational fear he pushed forward boldly and the light spreading through the water showed him a table bolted to the floor a bunk against one wall and bottles and assorted debris floating against the ceiling he swam out and moved further along the corridor to where it disintegrated into a twisted mass of metal electric wires draped from the roof and most poignant sight of all the broken remnants of a human skeleton crushed beneath a girder he moved back along the corridor quickly and the moment he emerged from the companionway struck up towards the reef at twenty feet he paused to decompress for several minutes aware of the current tugging at his body he surfaced a few yards from the rock and found anne grant waistdeep on the edge of the reef adjusting her equipment well have to get moving she shouted as he approached and pushed up his mask it must be later than i thought i can feel the tide moving already is that bad he said she nodded even the aquamobiles arent going to do us much good with a fiveknot current flowing the other way she moved off at once and he went after her behind them the entire length of the reef was surging into breakers and he could feel the relentless pressure of the current he started to flutterkick with all his strength and gradually the point grew nearer anne turned gave him a quick wave and they went down he could see the weeds on the seabed beneath him leaning over on one side pointing back towards the reef and the pressure was now a solid wall that he was trying to break through he kicked again was dimly aware of the black rocks passing beneath him and then they were round into calm water and his aquamobile seemed to leap forward with a surge of power he surfaced and saw anne at once over to the right and some distance in front of him he raised a hand urging her on and followed when he rounded the final point of rock she was perhaps fifty yards in front of him and moving strongly towards foxhunter a speedboat was moored beside the ladder the sunlight gleaming on its scarlet trim and someone sat in a canvas chair next to general grant a tall distinguishedlooking man in dark glasses and linen jacket who stood up and moved to the rail shading his eyes as anne approached she reached the ladder and he moved to give her a hand when she climbed up on deck mallory was still twenty or thirty yards away and he reduced speed as he came in under the counter of the speedboat the man who was sitting at the wheel turned to look down at him he was a large dangerouslooking individual with a hard face a jagged scar bisecting the right cheek mallory recognised him at once from the photograph he had been shown at his briefing he pushed up his mask hello there jacaud looked down at him calmly nodded then turned away mallory pulled himself to the bottom of the ladder where raoul guyon was already waiting a hand outstretched for the aquamobile mallory went over the rail squatted on deck and took off his aqualung anne grant was standing a yard or two away an attractive figure in her yellow diving suit as she talked to the man in the linen jacket there was little doubt who he was the handsome aristocratic face the easy poise spoke of a man who was supremely aware of the fact that god had created the de beaumonts first such a nice surprise she was saying pure luck that i passed i assure you i was trying out my new speedboat de beaumont raised her hand to his mouth my dear anne you grow more delightful each time i see you she coloured charmingly and the general cut in and now that weve got you wont get away so easily you must come to dinner tonight its been far too long please do anne said he shrugged still holding her hand how can i refuse raoul guyon was standing with fiona beside the deckhouse and anne turned towards him have you met monsieur guyon i have indeed de beaumont said ive been looking at these delightful sketches hes done of the general if he can spare the time perhaps you could persuade him to come across to st pierre one day and sketch me a pleasure guyon said anne turned towards mallory and this is mr neil mallory hes running the boat for us for a month or two till fiona and i get used to things de beaumont stood for a moment looking towards mallory and then he slowly removed his sunglasses his eyes were a strange metallic blue and very cold no warmth in them at all and yet something moved there something that instantly put mallory on the alert mr mallory de beaumont held out his hand mallory took it and the grip tightened the frenchman looked into his eyes for a long moment then turned back to anne and now i must go at what time this evening seven she said well look forward to seeing you he went down the ladder into the speedboat and nodded to jacaud the engine roared into life and the boat turned away in a surge of power de beaumont raised his hand in farewell took a gold cigarette case from an inner pocket selected a cigarette and lit it shall i tell marcel to be ready to run you across tonight jacaud said de beaumont nodded and pierre but i shall also require you jacaud something interesting i have just seen a ghost de beaumont said calmly a ghost from the past and ghosts are always interesting he settled back in the seat and jacaud spun the wheel in his hands and took the speedboat round the point his face quite expressionless mallory stood at the wheel of foxhunter thinking about de beaumont there had been something there of that he was sure but what could it possibly be they had certainly never met the door clicked open behind him and raoul guyon came in and leaned against the chart table lighting a cigarette what did you think of him mallory shrugged very charming very elegant seems soft until you look in his eyes are you dining with them tonight guyon shook his head ive been invited for drinks afterwards what was it like on the reef anything interesting mallory told him everything that had happened when he had finished guyon nodded from the sound of it this cavern under the island would seem like an adequate hiding place for lalouette thats what well have tofind out and how do we do that well use the aquamobiles try the middle passage approach i told you about straight into the cavern do you think theyll let us thats what well have to find out well go in sometime tonight the forecasts good and theres a moon if the weather holds it shouldnt be too difficult well go round the point in the dinghy that should give us a good start guyon sighed legrande told me this one would be interesting little did he know ill see you later the door closed behind him and mallory increased speed the strange thing was that as foxhunter ran back towards the jetty he wasnt thinking of the danger that lay ahead of the long swim through the dark night he was thinking of two metallic blue eyes and wondering what it was that he had seen in them chapter eight the man from tangiers through the french windows the lawn shimmered palely and the great beeches were silhouetted against the evening sky beyond was the timeless sad sough of the sea inside the room was warm and comfortable the light softly diffused and a log hissed and spluttered on the hearthstone there was a grand piano in one corner two old comfortable couches drawn to the fire and a print or two on the walls it was a room that was lived in a quiet comfortable place and the five people gathered loosely about the fire talked quietly to each other fiona grants occasional laugh breaking to the surface like a bubble of air in a quiet pool de beaumont and his host wore dinner jackets and the frenchman looked elegant completely at his ease as he talked to anne grant and the general fiona was wearing a simple green dress in some heavy silk material and sat on the arm of an old tapestry chair guyon stood beside her smoking a cigarette one hand on the high mantelpiece he was not in evening dress but a wellcut suit of dark blue fitted his wiry figure to perfection giving him a touch of distinction he leaned close to fiona muttered something in her ear and she chuckled and stood up raoul and i are going for a little walk anyone feel like joining us and what would you do if we said yes her father demanded brain you she kissed him affectionately and moved to the door ill get a coat raoul it could turn chilly raoul smiled at de beaumont will i see you again before you leave colonel de beaumont shook his head unlikely im afraid i keep early hours these days strict instructions from my doctor guyon held out his hand for the present then and dont forget about that portrait de beaumont reminded him i meant what i said the young frenchman nodded to the others and walked across to the door quickly as fiona called from the hall seems a nice enough young chap the general observed fiona obviously thinks so anne said and hes certainly talented he was in the army in algeria for several years before he took up painting hes remarkably talented de beaumont said hell make a name for himself with little difficulty the general turned his head as jagbir came in and handed round drinks from a tray any sign of mr mallory yet no general the general opened a silver box at his elbow and took out a long black cheroot i wonder whats happened to him probably something to do with the boat anne said and he is walking remember de beaumont fitted a cigarette into a silver holder and said carefully have you known him long hamish grant shook his head anne picked him up in southampton as a matter of fact he got her out of a rather nasty scrape and this is the basis upon which you hired him his papers were all in order hed only just signed off a tanker from tampico a day or so before why do you ask de beaumont stood up paced restlessly across to the french windows and turned this is really most difficult for me i dont want you to think that i am interfering yet on the other hand i feel that i should speak you know something about him the general said something to his discredit de beaumont came back to his chair and sat down youre aware of course that during the latter part of my army career i was commanding officer of a parachute regiment in algeria during the first few months of i was seconded to the general staff in algiers and placed in charge of military security how does this concern mallory we kept a special file on people who were thought to be working for the fln or the various other nationalist organisations neil mallory was in that file he was captain of a seagoing motoryacht berthed in tangiers he was a smuggler engaged in the extremely profitable business of running contraband tobacco into spain and italy he was also thought to be running guns for the fln hamish grant emptied his glass placed it carefully down on the table at his elbow and shrugged in other words he was a tough rather unscrupulous young man whod make a pound wherever there was one to be made youve told me nothing i hadnt already worked out for myself he pushed his glass across to anne tour me another my dear it was the years before tangiers i found most interesting when i read this file de beaumont said thats why i recalled him so easily remember a book you loaned me about a year ago a war office manual entitled a new concept of revolutionary warfare you told me it had been written by a brilliant young officer in during the months following his release from a chinese prison camp in korea i believe it caused quite a stir at the time the general stiffened one hand tightening on the handle of his walkingstick god in heaven he said mallory lieutenantcolonel neil mallory what was it they called him after that unpleasantness in malaya de beaumont said gently the butcher of perak the glass into which anne grant was at that moment pouring whisky splintered sharply against the floor she stood gazing fixedly at de beaumont a puzzled expression on her face then crossed quickly to her fatherinlaw what does he mean hamish grant patted her hand youre sure its the same man de beaumont shrugged the circumstances can hardly be coincidental admittedly until today i had only seen his photograph but its a distinctive face not the sort one forgets easily but what is it hamish anne demanded de beaumont was clearly embarrassed perhaps it would be better if i went forgive me for having cast a shadow on what otherwise has been a truly delightful evening but as a friend i felt that i had no choice but to tell you what i knew of this man you were quite right hamish grant got to his feet im very grateful to you well see you again soon i hope but of course the general sat down again and de beaumont and anne moved into the hall ill get jagbir to run you down to the jetty in the station wagon she said de beaumont shook his head no need a fine evening the walk will do me good when he raised her hand to his lips it was limp and unresponsive he picked up his coat opened the door and smiled good night anne good night colonel de beaumont she said formally and the door closed he stood on the top step a slight smile on his face she was annoyed because he had brought to light something discreditable in mallorys past and that annoyance could only be the automatic reaction of a woman already deeply involved which was interesting he moved down the steps towards the main gate and jacaud stepped out of the bushes what happened de beaumont shrugged patience my dear jacaud i have set things in motion now we must await developments a foot crunched on gravel and jacaud pulled him quickly into the shadows a moment later mallory walked by and went towards the house what do we do now jacaud whispered return to st pierre de beaumont shook his head the night is young and interesting things have yet to happen i think we will go down to the hotel and sample some of our good friend owens contraband brandy we can await developments there he chuckled gently and led the way out through the gates to the narrow dirt road white in the gloaming who was he hamish anne said calmly i want to know neil mallory hamish shrugged an outstanding paratroop officer firstrate war record decorated several times afterwards palestine malaya a different kind of war he went to korea in was wounded and captured somewhere on the imjin prisoner for two years and then what from what one can make out he was the sort of man people were rather afraid of especially his superiors a little like lawrence or orde wingate god rest his soul the sort of desperate eccentric who doesnt really fit in where peacetime soldierings concerned de beaumont said he was a colonel he must have been very young probably the youngest in the army at the time he wrote this book a new concept of revolutionary warfare for the war office in it aroused a lot of talk at the time most people seemed to think hed turned communist kept quoting from mao tsetungs book on guerrilla warfare as if the damned thing were a bible what happened hed been promoted lieutenantcolonel after the korean business they had to find him something to do so they sent him to malaya things werent too good at that time in some areas the communist guerrillas virtually controlled everything they gave mallory command of some local troops it wasnt really a regiment not much more than a hundred men recruiting was bad at the time little stocky malayan peasants straight out of the rice fields i know the type did they make good soldiers in three months they were probably the most formidable jungle troops in malaya within six theyd proved themselves so efficient in the field theyd earned a nickname mallorys tigers what happened in perak the climax of the drama or the tragedy if you like because thats what it was at that time perak was rotten with communist guerrillas especially on the border with thailand the powersthatbe told mallory to go in and clean them out once and for all and did he i think you could say that but when hed finished hed earned himself a new name the butcher of perak thats right a man whod ordered the shooting of many prisoners who had interrogated and tortured captives in custody a man who was proved to have acted with a singleminded and quite coldblooded ferocity and he was cashiered the general shook his head i should imagine that would have involved others no they simply retired him gave the usual sort of story to the newspapers took the line that hed never really recovered from his experiences in chinese hands and so on nobody could argue with that and the whole thing simply faded away she sat staring into the fire for several moments then shook her head the man you describe must have been a monster and neil mallory isnt that im sure he stretched out a hand and covered hers youre attracted to him arent you she made no reply and he sighed god knows it was bound to happen a long time since angus went anne a long long time the door opened and jagbir appeared mallory at his shoulder mr mallory is here general hamish grant straightened in his chair shoulders squared and said calmly show colonel mallory in jagbir mallory paused just inside the room his face very white in the soft light the strange dark eyes showing nothing who told you de beaumont the general said when he was head of french military intelligence in algiers in they had a general file on people like you i understand you were running guns out of tangiers to the fln is that correct for the moment mallory was aware only of a feeling of profound relief that de beaumont should recognise him from the north african days was unfortunate but at least the front he had used in tangiers had obviously been accepted and that was the main thing does it matter he said my past i mean good heavens man im not interested in what you got up to in tangiers its what happened in perak that i want to know about and suppose i say thats none of your damned business the old man stayed surprisingly calm but anne moved forward and touched mallory on the sleeve please neil i must know her eyes seemed very large as she gazed up at him and he turned abruptly crossed to the french window and went down the steps of the terrace outside he stood at the wall above the inlet in the desolate light of gloaming and below the lights of a ship out to sea seemed very far away he was tired drained of all emotion aware out of some strange inner knowledge that whatever a man did came to nothing in the final analysis a step sounded on gravel behind him when he turned hamish grant and his daughterinlaw were standing at the bottom of the steps they moved to the table the old man lowered himself into one of the chairs and anne grant approached mallory for a long time she stood peering at him her face in shadow and then she swayed forward burying her face against his chest and his arms went round her instinctively the old man was silhouetted sharply against the pale night sky and the sea hands crossed on top of his stick rooted into the ground like some ancient statue right colonel mallory he said in a voice that would brook no denial im ready when you are chapter nine the butcher of perak lieutenant gregson paced nervously up and down smoking a cigarette trying to look as unconcerned as the halfdozen malay soldiers who squatted in the long grass talking quietly at the edge of the clearing the body of a man was suspended by his ankles above the smouldering embers of a fire the flesh peeling from his skull the smell was nauseating so bad that gregson could almost taste it he shuddered visibly and wondered what was keeping the colonel he was only twentytwo slim with good shoulders but the face beneath the red beret was finedrawn the eyes set too deeply in their sockets he heard the sound of the land rover coming along the track and snapped his fingers quickly there was no need the soldiers had risen as one man with the easy relaxed discipline of veterans and stood waiting a moment later sergeant tewak pushed his way into the clearing followed by the colonel mallory wore a paratroopers beret and a camouflaged uniform open at the neck no badges of rank in evidence he stood staring at the body dark eyes brooding in that strange white face and restlessly tapped a bamboo swagger stick against his right knee when he spoke his voice was calm when did you find him about an hour ago i thought you might want to see him exactly as they left him mallory nodded leave sergeant tewak in charge here he can bring the body into maluban in your land rover you can come back with me he turned abruptly into the jungle and gregson gave the necessary orders to tewak and followed when he reached the land river mallory was already sitting behind the wheel and gregson climbed into the passenger seat the colonel drove away rapidly and gregson lit a cigarette and said carefully i hope youre not blaming yourself in any way sir mallory shook his head he was a good soldier he knew the risks he was taking if theyd accepted him wed have learned a hell of a lot probably enough to have put them out of business in the whole of perak but they didnt remembering the pathetic tortured body the stench of burning flesh gregson shuddered they didnt give him much of a chance did they sir they seldom do mallory observed dryly there are one or two chair borne flunkeys in singapore who could have learned something this afternoon unfortunately they never seem to come this far in he took a cigarette from his breast pocket one hand on the wheel and lit it there was a signal from hq while you were away theyre sending me a plane friday theres to be an enquiry gregson turned quickly the kelantang affair mallory nodded apparently the papers got hold of it back home he slowed to negotiate a steep hill i dont think ill be coming back but thats ridiculous gregson said angrily there isnt a guerrilla left in kelantang the tigers have had more success in six months than any other unit since the emergency began they dont like my methods mallory said its as simple as that neither did i at first but i know now that its the only way if you dont fight fire with fire you might as well pack up and go home and they wont let us do either mallory said britain never likes to let go of anything thats my irish father speaking and he had the best of reasons for knowing the land rover went over a small rise as it emerged from the jungle and beneath them beside the river was maluban there were perhaps forty or fifty thatched houses on stilts the sawmill and rubber warehouse on the far side of the jetty it was very still the jungle brooding in that quiet period before night fell and as mallory took the land rover down into the village a whistle sounded shrilly and the workers started to emerge from the mill he braked to a halt outside his command post a weathered clapboard bungalow raised on concrete stilts saluted the sentry and ran up the steps briskly inside a corporal sat at a radio transmitter in one corner he started to rise and mallory pushed him down anything he asked in malayan not since you left sir mallory moved to the large map of the area which was pinned to one wall he ran a finger along the course of the river jack must be about there now a good forty miles gregson nodded and indicated a small village to the southwest harry should be at trebu by nightfall between them theyll have swept most of the western side of the river without turning up a damned thing whats our effective strength here at the moment including sergeant tewak and the six men bringing in the body a dozen eight men in the sickbay and all genuine you dont need to tell me mallory picked up his swagger stick mr lis giving a dinner party tonight ill probably be there till midnight call me if anything turns up something special mallory nodded hes got a journalist staying with him for a few days a woman called mary hume isnt she the one who used to be an mp thats right one of these professional liberals who spend their time visiting the trouble spots and kicking the poor old army up the backside in print never mind gregson said old lis food is always interesting some consolation mallory moved to the door turned and for almost the first time since gregson had known him smiled friday thats just three days not much time to clean up perak eh when he had gone gregson went back to the map there was a hell of a lot of country and he knew in his bones that the patrols they had out along the river were wasting their time there were perhaps sixty chinese guerrillas in perak certainly no more and yet they were enough to terrorise an entire state to fill the people themselves with such fear that all hopes of cooperation were impossible and on friday the colonel was to fly to kuala lumpur to face an enquiry that could well lead to his courtmartial and disgrace gregson cursed softly if only mallory could have flown out with the news that he and his tigers had done it again had destroyed the last effective guerrilla band in the north that would have given them something to think about at hq he went into the bedroom at the rear poured himself a drink and stood on the verandah looking across the small strip of rough grass that was the garden a loose board creaked and he turned and saw suwon mr lis secretary coming up the steps she was perhaps twenty and her skin had that creamy look peculiar to eurasian women her lips an extra fullness that gave her a faintly sensual air her scarlet dress was of heavy red silk slashed on either side above the knee and moulded her ripe figure he grinned crookedly and raised his glass surprise surprise i thought youd be at the party i will be later she said but i wanted to see you now thats most flattering he moved close and she held a hand against his chest please jack this is serious the wife of sabal the ferryman has just been to see me shes scared out of her wits whats the trouble theyve been hiding a wounded terrorist at their house for three days now under the usual threats he was shot in that patrol clash on the other side of the river last week his friends took him to sabals house because of its isolation you know where it is gregsons stomach was hollow with excitement and when he put down his glass his hand was shaking about half a mile upriver so theyve decided to hand him over she shrugged if the man doesnt have medical treatment soon hell die sabal is a buddhist he couldnt let that happen youve told no one else she shook her head ive no desire to become a target you know how easily these things leak out thats why i came the back way he buckled on his belt and revolver no one will know who tipped me off i promise you that its sabal and his family im really worried about no need to be ill only take a couple of men with me make it look like a routine call he kissed her lightly on the mouth youd better get going theyll be looking for you at dinner and not a word about this to anyone id like to surprise the colonel he went out through the other room and she heard his voice raised as he called to the duty corporal a few moments later the land rover drove away she stood there a shadow slanting across her eyes like a mask it was as if she were waiting for something only when the sound of the engine had finally died into the distance did she turn and walk away a moth fluttered despairingly beside the oil lamp and shrivelled in the heat what was left of it fluttered to the table mr li brushed it away and reached for the decanter it was obvious that he had european blood in him his eyes lifted slightly at the corners but they were shrewd and kindly the lips beneath the straight nose well formed and full of humour more brandy mrs hume she was in her early forties her greying hair cut short in the current fashion still attractive in her simple print dress a kashmir shawl around her shoulders against the cool of the evening she pushed her glass across and mr li continued you have no idea of the pleasure it gives me to entertain a british member of parliament in my own home im afraid youre a little out of date mr li she answered lightly as suwon came in with the coffee im no longer interested in politics simply a working journalist on an assignment to discover for yourself the state of things in the border country mr li smiled how fortunate that colonel malory agreed to accept my hospitality during his stay i am sure there can be no greater authority on the troubled times through which we are passing ive already seen something of colonel mallorys methods mary hume said coldly and turned to mallory who sat at one end of the long table in a beautifully tailored drill uniform the medal ribbons and sas wings above his left pocket a splash of colour in the lamplight i drove through a village called pedak about ten miles south of here on the way in every house burned to the ground on your orders women and children homeless and the rains due suwon leaned over mallorys shoulder to pour coffee into his cup and he was aware of her fragrance one of my patrols was ambushed in pedak two days ago four men killed and two wounded the villagers could have warned them they didnt because they were afraid she said angrily surely thats obvious the communist guerrillas must have forced them to keep silent with threats quite right mallory replied calmly thats why i burned their houses next time theyll think twice but youre giving them an impossible choice she said to betray their own countrymen something people like you never seem to get straight the men who were ambushed and killed my soldiers were malays the guerrillas who killed them are chinese not all of them some are malayan chinese i wouldnt argue on that point but the majority are chinese communists trained and armed by the army of the peoples republic and infiltrated into malaya from thailand what colonel mallory says is quite true mrs hume mr li put in these terrorists are bad people they have made things very difficult for us in this area for business you mean she said acidly but of course mr li was not at all put out many of the great rubber estates have virtually gone out of business and things will soon be as bad in the timber trade at the mill my workers are already on halftime these are the people who really suffer you know two weeks ago the catholic mission at kota banu was attacked the priestincharge was away at the time but two nuns and thirteen young girls were killed youre wasting your time li mallory said that isnt the sort of story mrs hume wants to hear that rag of hers usually prints items like that in the bottom lefthand comer of page seven he picked up his brandy and walked out on the open verandah aware of lis voice raised in apology behind him in the gathering darkness beyond the river the jungle started to come alive treefrogs setting the air vibrating while howler monkeys challenged each other swinging through the trees and through it all the steady pulsating beat of the crickets at his shoulder mary hume said in a dry matteroffact voice theyre saying in singapore that you executed your prisoners during the kelantang operation is it true i was hard on the heels of another gang i needed every man i had mallory shrugged prisoners would have delayed me and now theres to be an enquiry theyll kick you out you know he shrugged isnt that what you want she frowned you dont like me do you colonel mallory not particularly may i ask why im only doing my job as i remember that was the excuse you offered in korea when you and one or two choice specimens like you accepted an invitation from the chinese to see what things were really like over on that side i see now she said and her voice died away in a long sigh you wrote some excellent articles on how good the prison camps were mallory said how well we were all treated i read them after i was released of course they never showed you over my camp mrs hume which is hardly surprising around about the time you were starting your conducted tour i was doing six months in a rather small bamboo cage as a matter of fact about twenty of us were a salutary experience particularly as winter was just beginning i reported the facts as i saw them she said calmly people like you always do he swallowed about half of his brandy and went on one thing really does interest me why has it always got to be your own country why is it never the other side i mean what exactly is eating away at your guts she was obviously only controlling her anger by a supreme effort of will and when she replied her voice vibrated slightly where a moral principle is involved i refuse to be hampered by a spurious nationalism is that a fact mallory said well ive got news for you mrs hume id rather have that lot out there in the jungle than you and your kind any day at least they fight for what they believe in i can respect them for that even when they butcher nuns and young girls she taunted we managed things like that on a much more impressive scale during the war after all for a purist like yourself there cant be much difference between the terrorists grenade and the bombs released at the touch of a button from forty thousand feet she was suddenly very still and he said softly but then i was forgetting wasnt your husband a bomber pilot during the war im sure his opinion would be most interesting my husband is dead colonel mallory he was killed in the war i know mrs hume mallory said softly she turned abruptly and went back inside and mallory took out a cigarette striking a match against the verandah rail there was a rustle in the bushes below and sergeant tevvak said quietly colonel there is bad news at the command post it would be well for you to come mallory glanced over his shoulder quickly mr li and mary hume sat at the table talking earnestly heads together and suwon busied herself preparing drinks at the sideboard he vaulted over the rail and followed tewak through the bushes the little malay hurried along without speaking leading the way out through the rear gate and down the hill to the village the streets were quiet but outside the command post mallory found what seemed to be the whole detachment standing in twos and threes each man armed and in marching order as tewak led the way round to the store hut at the side of the bungalow mallory was aware of the emptiness that snatched at the pit of his stomach the malay opened the door switched on the light and led the way in the body was covered by a groundsheet and lay on a trestle table in the centre of the room mallory knew it was gregson at once because of the american paratroopers boots which he had bought at a secondhand shop in singapore three months previously tewak pulled back the groundsheet and waited his face like stone the teeth were clenched lips drawn back in the deathagony his hands had been tied behind him the eyes gouged out quite obviously while he was still alive the rest of him was like a piece of raw meat mallory took a deep breath and turned away when did it happen about half an hour ago he was tipped off that a wounded terrorist was hiding at the house of sabal the ferryman i arrived back about an hour after hed left he only took two men when he didnt return i thought id better investigate are they all dead also sabal and his wife and their four children mallory nodded slowly a slight frown on his face he looked down at the body on the table once more covered with the groundsheet go to mr lis bungalow theres an englishwoman there a mrs hume tell her i want to see her if she refuses to come use force the door closed softly and mallory took out a cigarette and lit it thinking about gregson about the senseless needless cruelty of his going it had been intended as a threat so much was obvious and had been directed at him personally whoever controlled the sixty or so terrorists in perak had simply used gregson as a calling card a few minutes later the door opened and mary hume was pushed inside behind her mallory was conscious of lis troubled face in the doorway she was trembling with anger her face very white as she moved forward mallory cut in quickly before she could speak so sorry to trouble you mrs hume but one of my young officers was very anxious to meet you as the frown deepened across her forehead he pulled the groundsheet away quickly she stood staring at the table an expression of wonderment frozen into place and then her head started to move from side to side the lips trembling mr li took her gently in his arms and held her close this was not a good thing to do colonel you go to hell mallory said and you can take her with you and he turned and covered gregson carefully in the distance thunder rumbled and then lightning flared in the split second of its illumination mallory saw each item of furniture in his bedroom clearly he tossed his swagger stick and beret on the bed and opened the shutters as he stepped on to the verandah the rain came with a sudden great rush filling the air with its voice he breathed deeply taking the air into his lungs and a quiet voice said the night air is not good when the rains start colonel suwon stood a few feet away by the rail and as lightning flared again her face seemed to jump out of the darkness the embroidered dragon on the scarlet dress coming alive like some strange night creature i was hoping youd come he said she moved very close until their bodies touched and her scent was warm in his nostrils the sharply pointed breasts hard against him she placed one hand behind his neck her mouth slack with desire and he said softly why did you tell gregson that a wounded terrorist was hiding out at sabals house as his hands slid round to the small of her back her body tensed taut as a bowstring she gave a terrified gasp turned and stumbled down the steps to the lawn as she started across lightning exploded again and in that brief moment of illumination sergeant tewak and half a dozen men moved forward in a semicircle as tewak reached her the sky seemed to split wide open with a crash of thunder that made the earth tremble drowning her cry of terror as she was turned roughly and pushed towards the steps in his room mallory lit the lamp pulled out a chair and sat down suwon s dress was saturated clinging to her like a second skin and her face was very white as tewak brought her forward earlier this evening you visited the command post by way of the garden you told lieutenant gregson there was a wounded terrorist at cabals house she started to shake her head weakly in denial and mallory went on dont waste time in stupid lies the duty corporal overheard the entire conversation tears started to roll down her face and he said gregson is dead but i dont blame you for that only the person who gave you your orders who was it you indent be afraid ill see youre protected she shook her head desperately and tried to pull free from tewaks iron grip she was wasting her time the malay raised his eyebrows mallory nodded and tewak smashed his clenched fist into her mouth sending her staggering across the room on to the bed when mallory pulled her forward her lips were crushed and bleeding and a couple of teeth were missing two weeks ago your friends burned down a catholic mission and butchered thirteen little girls he said calmly last july they derailed a train and killed or injured nearly a hundred peasants as far as im concerned youre expendable now either you tell me what i want to know or ill let tewak really go to work on you and one thing i can promise youll never want to look in a mirror again tewak started to take off his belt and she shook her head weakly the breath bubbling out through her broken mouth mr li she moaned it was mr li li examined himself in the bathroom mirror a pair of tweezers in one hand very carefully he plucked a couple of gold hairs from his upper lip then opened a large goldcapped bottle of perfumed astringent and poured some into his palms he carefully massaged his face wincing slightly at the stinging coldness turned and moved into his bedroom mallory was standing by the open window that led to the verandah he wore his red beret and the swagger stick in his right hand beat restlessly against his thigh it was the eyes which told li his fate those strange unfathomable eyes like holes in the white face staring through and beyond him there was nothing to say nothing at all he stood there a slight careful smile on his face hands thrust into the pockets of his silkdressinggown and mallory made a slight gesture with his hand that brought tewak and his men into the room mr li moved to a small coffee table selected a cigarette from a jade box and lit it who told you mallory shook his head suwon was a mistake girls like her value their looks too much they havent got anything else to trade with the bookcase against the far wall came down with a splintering crash and three of the soldiers rammed the butt ends of their rifles against the wooden panelling a moment later a large segment fell out revealing a cupboard perhaps three feet square containing a wireless transmitter and several files mallory examined the find nodded and turned quickly so far so good now lets get down to business according to our intelligence reports you have between sixty and seventy guerrillas operating in perak id like to know where they are youre wasting your time my dear mallory li said and thats something you cant really spare isnt it when is it theyre coming for you friday thirtysix hours thats all he started to laugh and tewak raised a hand mallory shook his head no sense in wasting time on the preliminaries bring him into the livingroom theres a fire there li was aware of a coldness clutching at his inside the stories he had heard about this man mallory of his tigers and the way they operated no one really believed it because the english didnt fight in this way didnt use such methods which was their greatest weakness brainwashing and psychological pressures he had been prepared for but this they hustled him into the other room and across to the wide stone fireplace in which he had ordered the servants to light a log fire against the dampness of the rains mallory nodded and lis dressinggown and pyjama jacket were ripped away baring him to the waist his hands were jerked roughly behind his back and lashed with a length of rope there was a disturbance outside the door and mallory heard mary humes voice raised shrilly he crossed the room and moved past his men into the corridor the dark circles under her eyes accentuated the paleness of her face and she had obviously been crying whats going on in there she said i demand to know tm questioning mr li mallory told her weve just discovered that hes not quite what he seems to be i dont believe you she said well thats just too bad at a later date ill be happy to show you the transmitting set he had hidden in his room but right now im busy he turned to the corporal on his left escort mrs hume to her room and see that she doesnt leave it he went back into the livingroom slamming the door on her sudden indignant outburst and crossed to the fire he sat down in the chair opposite li took out a cigarette and lit it have you ever been tortured li made no reply and mallory continued in i was working under cover in france i was only twenty the gestapo got hold of me the first two days i didnt do too bad but by the end of the week i was telling them everything they wanted to know of course by that time london had changed everything round so it didnt really matter how very interesting li said i thought you might say that mallory picked up a poker and inserted it into the fire tm afraid i cant wait for a week you understand that but i dont think ill have to ive had the extra advantage of two years in a communist prison camp they taught me a lot those friends of yours li gazed at the poker in fascinated horror and his throat went dry he moistened his lips and croaked you wouldnt dare the marks would be on my body for all to see mrs hume would be a witness to all that had taken place they told me to clean out perak mallory said and ive only got till friday morning to do it that means cutting a few corners you understand im sure he took the poker from the fire it was white hot and he turned and said gently tell me where your men are thats all i want to know youre wasting your time li said you might as well shoot me and get it over with i dont think so mallory considered him carefully and shook his head id say you might last two hours but i doubt it it was perhaps three hours later when li regained consciousness on his bed in the cool darkness of his room his hands had been roughly bandaged and pain coursed through his entire body sending his senses reeling and he had talked that was the shameful thing he had poured out everything to the terrible englishman with the white face and the dark eyes that pierced straight through to the soul he pushed himself upright and slowly hobbled across the floor grinding his teeth together to keep from crying out he paused at the window and peered outside the verandah was deserted there was no one in sight he pushed the window open and crossed to the steps he stood there for a moment inhaling the freshness of the rain a faint excitement stirring inside him driving the pain from his mind he would win he would beat mallory in the end and that was the important thing he stumbled down the steps and started across the lawn he was perhaps halfway across when he heard the click of a bolt as a weapon was cocked he turned mouth opening to cry out conscious that even now mallory had won the line of fire erupting from the bushes spun him around twice and drove him down against the earth for a moment only there was the scent of wet grass in his nostrils then nothing in his office at the command post mallory heard the rattle of the submachinegun clearly he paused for a moment head raised then returned to the map in front of him a few minutes later the door opened and tewak entered shaking rain from his groundsheet mallory sat back what happened the sentry got him as he was crossing the garden mrs humes outside apparently she ran out of the house when she heard the shooting she saw his condition bring her in mallory said she was wearing an old burberry that was far too big for her the shoulders soaked by the rain tewak led her forward and she slumped into a chair and sat looking at mallory her face old and careworn i saw mr li she said dully i saw what youd done to him mr li was directly responsible for the murder by torture of lieutenant gregson and his men mallory said he was responsible for the deaths of thirteen schoolgirls two weeks ago and very many more innocent people during the past two years you tortured him she said tortured him in cold blood then shot him down if hed gone to singapore hed have been tried and very probably sentenced to ten years at the most as a political offender mallory said his friends would have got him out before then believe me you fool she whispered youve lost everything everything dont you see that mallory leaned forward there are sixtythree communist guerrillas in perak mrs hume thats something i got out of li about thirty of them are camped at this moment on an abandoned rubber estate near trebu ive got a large patrol in that area now theyll be in position to attack at am the rest are going to pass downriver hidden in two fishing boats within the next hour apparently theyd intended to destroy the railway bridge at peg at dawn im afraid theyll be disappointed she frowned slightly as if finding difficulty in taking in what he had said but youve only got a handful of men you cant possibly hope to defeat such a large group solicitude for my welfare at this stage mrs hume youre slipping he got to his feet and buckled on his revolver dont worry we have our ways he crossed to the door opened it and turned stay here and this time i mean it mary hume opened her mouth to protest but no sound came and suddenly she was afraid afraid of this terrible young man there was nothing she could do nothing to prevent the tragedy that was taking place out of some strange inner knowledge she knew that neil mallory in the process of destroying the evil that he hated was also destroying himself the most surprising thing of all was that she cared mallory moved across to the jetty and paused beside the two men who squatted behind the heavy machinegun another was positioned on top of a small hill fifty yards away and between them they covered the river with an arc of fire at the end of the jetty tewak waited with the rest of the men two of them crouched behind the narrow wall the heavy tanks of their flamethrowers bulging obscenely the rain rushed into the river with a heavy sibilant whispering and mallory was aware of a strange aching sadness it was as if he had done all this before in another time another place as if life were a circle turning endlessly everything that had happened during the previous few hours lacked definition like a dream only half remembered and then tewak grunted there was the slapping of water against a keel a sensation of an even darker mass moving through the darkness and mallory tapped tewak lightly on the shoulder the little sergeant picked up a portable spot and switched it on the white beam lanced through the night picking out two large fishing boats as they slipped downstream side by side sails furled a man in each stern working a sweep there was a cry of alarm and the first boat half lifted out of the water as it collided with the ferry hawser which tewak and his men had suspended across the river an hour earlier the boat spun round crashing into its fellow and there was another cry followed by a burst of smallarms fire directed towards the jetty mallory called out and the men with the flamethrowers stood up liquid fire arched through the night splashing across the two boats immediately their superstructure and sails started to burn and men poured on to their decks from below the two heavy machineguns opened up raking the decks chopping down the guerrillas as soon as they appeared tewak dropped the spot picked up his submachinegun and joined in with the rest of the men it was over within a few minutes a handful jumped from the blazing inferno and struck out desperately for safety but the flamethrowers searched them out the fire licking hungrily across the surface of the water catching them one by one by this time the river and the village were brilliantly illuminated and mallory stood there watching taking no part in what was happening he glanced at his watch it was just after am and he wondered how harrison was getting on he turned and found mary hume standing a few yards away when he walked towards her he saw that she was crying you butcher she said you butcher ill see you hang for this nights work tm sure you will mrs hume he said calmly and went past her along the jetty twentyfour hours left now till that plane arrived that was all but it was enough if he moved fast along the river bank to meet up with harrison and his men coming south theyd be certain to sweep up any survivors of the clash at the rubber estate another twentyfour hours and after that as he went up the bank towards the command post the first fishing boat sank beneath the surface with a hiss of steam chapter ten an affair of honour a match flared outlining hamish grants craggy features as he lit a cheroot and the enquiry it was quite dark now and below waves creamed over the rocks in the entrance of the tiny inlet it was a warm soft night stars strung away to the horizon and when a cloud moved from the face of the moon the terrace was bathed in a hard white light mallory turned from looking out to sea and shrugged a foregone conclusion they used terms like previous gallant service hinted that i hadnt really recovered from the ordeal of two years in a chinese prison camp and spared you the ultimate disgrace they didnt actually cashier me if thats what you mean you could say i was eased into retirement as quietly as possible for the good of the service of course naturally the old man said a bad business that sort of thing rubs off on everyone concerned what i did to li he would have done to me mallory said the purpose of terrorism is to terrorise lenin said that its on page one of every communist handbook on revolutionary warfare you can only fight that kind of fire with fire otherwise you might as well lie down and let the waves wash over you thats what i brought out of that chinese prison camp general an interesting point of view the only one in the circumstances i did what had to be done when id finished there was no more terror by night in perak no more kota banus no more butchering of little girls god knows that should count for something there was silence in the moonlight anne grants face seemed very pale the eyes dark and secret telling him nothing when a cloud crossed the moon she became a motionless silhouette her face turned towards him but still she didnt speak mallory sighed and tossed his cigarette over the wall in a glowing curve under the circumstances perhaps youll excuse me general this has turned out to be one of those evenings when i could do with a drink he turned and went up the steps the sound of his going fading quickly into the darkness after a while hamish grant said quietly its not often one meets a man like that someone whos willing to carry the guilt for the rest of us it takes a rather special brand of courage she turned towards him her face a pale blur and then as if coming to a decision stood up do you mind he reached for her hand and held it tightly leave me the car will you i might join you later and that was that mallory told himself that was very much that no question of what she had thought of him her silence that stillness had been answer enough and the strange thing was that it mattered that for the first time in years the protective shell he had grown had cracked and now he was defenceless his chin was on his breast hands in pockets as he turned on to the springy turf beside the road white in the moonlight that ran down to the harbour a small wind seemed to crawl across his face and he drew in his breath sharply he heard no sound and yet he knew that she walked beside him he spoke calmly but with a faint irish intonation inherited from his father always apparent in moments of great stress and what would you be wanting anne grant a drink neil mallory she said matching his mood and perhaps another would that be asking too much he paused and turned to face her hands still thrust into his pockets in the moonlight she looked very beautiful more beautiful than he had ever thought a woman could be and there were tears in her eyes he slipped an arm about her shoulders and together they went down the hill towards the lights of the hotel in the long grass on the hill above the cliffs raoul guyon lay on his back and stared into an infinity of stars his hands clasped behind his head beside him fiona grant sat crosslegged combing her hair she turned and smiled her face clear in the moonlight well are you going to make an honest woman of me as always you have a gift for the difficult question he said a plain yes or no would do im reasonably civilised a word no woman is entitled to use he said solemnly and lit a cigarette life is seldom as simple as yes or no fiona i dont agree she said its people who make it complicated my father likes you if thats got anything to do with it and i cant see what theyd have to complain about at your end after all i could pass for french tm quite sure my mother would adore you on the other hand we bretons are very oldfashioned in certain matters she would never allow me to marry a girl who couldnt bring a sizable dowry with her would eleven thousand pounds do fiona said my favourite uncle died last march tm sure maman would be most impressed guyon told her she squirmed against him laying her head on his chest in any case why should we worry about money i know most artists have to struggle but how many of them paint like you a good point and she was right already he had sold many paintings working between assignments on the family farm near loudeac that his mother still managed so competently mornings on the banks of the oust with leaves drifting from the beech trees into the river and the smell of wet earth country that he had grown up in and loved he was aware with a strange wonderment that he wanted to take this girl there to see again with her the old grey farmhouse rooted into its hollow amongst the trees walk with her over the familiar country that he loved so much of course there could always be someone else she said her voice was light and yet there was a poignancy there it was as if she was aware of how near to hurt she might be and he pulled her close instinctively there was a girl once fiona in algiers a long time ago she gave me peace when i needed it more than anything else on earth she paid for that gift with her life a high price ive been trying to escape from her ever since there was a short silence and then she said gently have you ever considered that it might be algeria that youre running from that somehow this girl has come to symbolise everything that ever happened there in that single instant he knew that what she had said was true that by some strange perception she had struck right to the very heart of things i know im young raoul she continued and on the whole ive only seen the lighter side but i know this the war in algeria wasnt the first to send men home with blood on their hands and it wont be the last but thats life there wouldnt be any sweet without sour people get by at a guess id say you must be about a thousand years old he kissed her passionately and she linked her arms behind his neck and pressed her body against him after a while she rolled away and lay on her back breathless eyes sparkling and now do you think i might get to see that farm in brittany he pulled her to her feet and held her at arms length did i ever have a choice she reached up to kiss him and then turned and ran away down the hill guyon gave her a start of perhaps twenty yards and then went after her laughter bubbling up spontaneously inside him for the first time in years the bar at the hotel was a long pleasant room with whitewashed walls its windows facing out to sea two large oil lamps were suspended from one of the oak beams that supported the low roof jacaud and two other men sat at a table in a corner and played cards owen morgan leaned on the bar beside them watching the play a small greying man with hot welsh eyes and a face hardened by a lifetime of the sea beside an open window mallory and anne faced each other across a small table smoking cigarettes far out to sea the lights of a ship moved slowly across the horizon like something from another world and anne sighed a big one i wonder where shes going tangiers the azores take your choice an invitation of the most improper kind he said and smiled you should do that more often she said it suits you before he could reply a shadow fell across the table juliette vincente was standing there a halfbottle of champagne and two glasses on her tray she was perhaps thirtyfive a plain rather simplelooking woman in a blue woolen dress thickening slightly at the waist but her skin was fresh and clean the cheeks touched with crimson from monsieur le comte madame she said simply and placed the bottle and glasses on the table at the far end of the bar two or three broad steps lifted to another room where de beaumont sat beside a pleasant fire anne nodded and he raised his glass small return for a delightful meal shall i ask him over mallory said she shook her head not unless you want to a moment or two later the station wagon braked to a halt outside and raoul guyon and fiona got out turning to help the general the old man led the way up the steps confidently and entered the bar over here hamish anne called and he turned and came towards them mallory got to his feet and brought a chair forward and fiona slipped into the windowseat beside anne guyon picked up the bottle and nodded approvingly heidsieck how typical for the english to reserve the best for themselves i must really do something to upset the balance he moved across to the bar and hamish grant produced a brown leather cheroot case and proffered it to mallory try one of these filthy things but nothing quite like em picked up the habit in india mallory took one and offered the old man a light as guyon returned our good friend owen is raiding his cellar he cant guarantee that everything will have necessarily come in through the proper channels but no matter he tells me that the revenue man only comes once a year and always warns him in advance understandable the general said they were in the navy together owen morgan appeared a few moments later and came across with a wide grin no need for ice he said to guyon as he offered a bottle for inspection its cold enough where thats been excellent guyon said ill open it while you fetch some glasses his gaiety was quite infectious and within a few moments he had them all laughing with a description of an outrageous and quite untruthful incident from his past the conversation which followed moved along spontaneously once or twice mallory noticed the three men in the corner looking towards them obviously irritated after some particularly loud burst of laughter from fiona or guyon one of them hammered on the table and called loudly to owen morgan for more cognac mallory leaned across to anne the one on the left with the haircut he was at the wheel of de beaumonts boat this afternoon who is he they call him jacaud she said thats all i can tell you he seems to go everywhere with de beaumont i think the others are afraid of him hardly surprising guyon put in theres about fifteen stone of bone and muscle there mostly muscle from the look of him jacaud got to his feet crossed the bar and mounted the steps to the other room he leaned on de beaumonts table and they held a short conversation mallory watched them over the rim of his glass once de beaumont turned and looked towards them he gazed coolly at mallory for a moment then turned back to jacaud the big frenchman rejoined his friends and owen morgan turned on the radio the sound of music filling the room guyon pulled fiona to her feet and grinned come on lets liven the place up a little they made an attractive couple as they circled the room the beautiful young girl on the threshold of womanhood and guyon his lean sunblackened face animated and full of life anne grant watched them wistfully and coloured when she saw that mallory was looking at her fiona always makes me feel old she said but not too old mallory turned to the general youll excuse us sir the general touched the champagne bottle lightly and raised his glass enjoy yourselves while you can ill make do with this they moved into the centre of the floor she slipped one arm about his neck and danced with her head on his shoulder her body pressed so closely against him that he could feel the line from breast to thigh for a moment he forgot about everything except the fact that he was dancing with a warm exciting girl whose perfume filled his nostrils and caused a pleasant ache of longing in the pit of his stomach it had been a long time since he had slept with a woman but that wasnt the whole explanation that anne grant attracted him was undeniable but there was something more there something deeper that for the moment was beyond his comprehension the music stopped a pause between records and they went back to their table the others followed a few moments later and as fiona seated herself there was a burst of loud laughter from jacaud and his two friends in the corner followed by a remark in french coarse and to the point and quite unprintable guyon swung round his face hardening the three men returned his gaze boldly he took one quick step towards them and mallory caught him by the sleeve and pulled him down into his chair let it go guyon was shaking with suppressed anger you heard what he said fiona leaned forward and put a hand on his arm dont let it upset you raoul theyve had a little too much to drink thats all a shadow fell across the table and mallory looked up into the face of the man he had heard owen morgan refer to as marcel a little earlier he was of medium height and wore denim pants and a blue seamans jersey he was very drunk and clutched at the edge of the table to steady himself i think youd be better off sitting down mallory told him in french marcel ignored him leaned across the table knocking over a glass and grabbed anne by one arm you dance with me now he mouthed in broken english mallory grabbed for the mans right arm just above the elbow his thumb hooking into the pressure point as he swung round mouth opening in a cry of agony guyon kicked him under the right kneecap marcel staggered backwards lost his balance and sprawled across the other table jacaud pushed him to one side got to his feet and moved forward he stood there swaying slightly as if drunk and yet the slategrey eyes were as cold as ice eternally watchful two to one messieurs he said in excellent english you made the odds owen morgan came round the bar on the run face very white eyes blazing the big frenchman sent him staggering in backwards with a single contemptuous shove of his hand and laughed harshly he asked for it jacaud de beaumont called sharply let it end there jacaud ignored him and de beaumont made no move to come down into the bar gave no indication of being able or willing to control the situation he stayed by the fire a watchful expression on his face in that moment mallory realised that the whole thing had been arranged that for some reason of his own de beaumont had deliberately engineered the situation guyon started to rise and mallory pulled him down again my affair jacaud stood there swaying a little still keeping up the pretence of being drunk his great hands hooked slightly every muscle tensed and ready he lurched forward and stood over them of course my friend might be willing to settle for a drink he nodded at the table a bottle of champagne would do anything to oblige mallory said calmly he reached for the bottle and as he turned reversed his grip and smashed it across the side of the frenchmans skull as anne cried out jacaud staggered and fell to one knee mallory picked up a chair moved in fast and smashed it down across the great shoulders jacaud grunted started to keel over and mallory smashed the broken chair down again and again until it splintered he tossed it to one side and waited slowly painfully jacaud reached for the edge of the bar and pulled himself up he hung there for a moment then turned to mallory wiping blood from his face casually and then incredibly he charged head down like a wounded bull the great hands reaching out to destroy mallory judged his moment exactly swerved to one side allowing the frenchman to plunge past and slashed him across the kidneys with a karate blow delivered with the edge of his hand jacaud screamed and fell to the floor for a little while he stayed there on his hands and knees and when he got to his feet he was slobbering like an animal he lurched forward and mallory kicked his feet from under him jacaud crashed to the floor rolled over and lay still in the silence which followed de beaumont came down the steps slowly he dropped to one knee beside jacaud examined him and looked up you are a hard man colonel mallory when i have to be mallory said you could have done something to stop this why didnt you he turned without waiting for a reply and went back to the table i think that might do for one night shall we go hamish grants face was pale the nostrils flaring slightly as he got to his feet you know i really think its about time i bought you a drink neil ive got some rather special whiskey back at the house so irish that you can taste the peat id like to have your opinion on it annes face was very white and she was trembling mallory squeezed her hand reassuringly and they all walked towards the door de beaumont moved to block the way one moment general perhaps i might be allowed to tender my apologies for this distressing affair at the best of times jacaud has a short temper when hes been drinking i so need for that de beaumont hamish grant said coldly i think the matter has been handled quite adequately de beaumont stood there his smile frozen into place and then he turned away sharply and they moved outside fiona got behind the wheel guyon beside her and the general and anne climbed into the back mallory slammed the door and leaned in at the open window if you dont mind general id like to take you up on that drink another time ive had enough excitement for one night as annes head turned sharply towards him he turned quickly giving them no time to argue and went down the slope towards the jetty a few moments later the engine coughed into life behind him and the station wagon moved away he turned right at the jetty following a steeply shelving path which brought him down to a strip of sand white in the moonlight waves curling in across the shingle with a gentle sucking sound he sat on a boulder and lit a cigarette with fingers that trembled slightly he inhaled deeply drawing the smoke into his lungs and released it with a long sigh behind him anne grant said you dont do things by halves do you whats the point he said simply we seem to have held this conversation before when she whispered his name they came together naturally and easily her hands pulled his head down as her mouth sought his and her sweetness drove every other thought from his mind he picked her up in his arms and laid her down gently in the soft sand chapter eleven in a lonely place the wind was freshening lifting the waves into whitecaps and as the dinghy rounded the point water slopped over the gunwale guyon carefully eased his weight into the centre and started to bale he wore a heavy sweater and reefer jacket against the cold a pair of nightglasses hung around his neck and one of the aquamobiles lay in the prow behind him mallory sat in the stern wearing a black rubber diving suit the heavy aqualung already strapped into place on his back as a crosscurrent started to turn the dinghy in towards the cliffs he opened the throttle on the outboard motor to compensate and glanced at the luminous dial of his watch it was and there was very little cloud the sky brilliant with stars and the moonlight danced across the waves leaving a trail of silver behind it the dinghy lifted high on a large swell and swung in towards the great finger of rock which marked the western tip of the island mallory opened the throttle again for a moment the dinghy seemed to stand still and then it forged ahead they rounded the point fighting the crosscurrents guyon cursing steadily as water slopped over the sides and then they were sweeping into calmer water beyond st pierre and the gothic towers of the castle were dark against the sky mallory throttled down again and the dinghy coasted on the sound of her motor a murmur on the wind the great reef running between the two islands was deceptively innocent in the moonlight waves rolling in from the sea splashed lazily across the rocks now and then a curtain of white spray lifting into the night like silver lace he took the dinghy into the calm waters of the middle passage until they reached the first point where the roof closed in and water boiled across great jagged black teeth he cut the motor and the dinghy slowed and ground gently against a sloping weedcovered shoulder of rock guyon hooked the painter into a crevasse and looked towards st pierre through the nightglasses about a quarter of a mile a long swim not with the aquamobile mallory said guyon got it over the side the dinghy heeling dangerously rather you than me the waters like ice how long will you be mallory shrugged no more than half an hour ive no intention of hanging around at the other end he fitted the rubber mouthpiece between his teeth and adjusted his air supply touched the knife briefly at his belt and clambered awkwardly over the side on to the reef he waded into the water swam to the other side of the dinghy and reached for the aquamobile guyon smiled once and mallory nodded and sank beneath the surface moonlight filtered down through the water probing into the depths when he passed beneath the surface of the reef and came into the middle passage he entered a darker more sinister world he switched on the powerful spot mounted on top of the scooter and the shaft of light pierced through the darkness in front of him splaying against the rocks that arched above his head he tilted the nose of the aquamobile and went down gently leveling out at twenty feet although his top speed was no more than three knots he seemed to rush at a terrifying speed into the wall of grey mist that was the edge of his visibility the great arched nave of the reef stretched into infinity before him the water breaking against his mask and then he was through and moving into a strange unreal landscape of jumbled rocks and pale forests of seaweed waving languidly in the diffused moonlight he surfaced and looked up at the cliffs of st pierre the pointed towers of the castle dark against the sky the moonlight splashed across the face of the cliffs picking out the dark mouth of the cave it was now high water and there was no more than a ten or twelvefoot clearance mallory turned the nose of the aquamobile down and leveled out at forty feet he switched off thespot and moved into a grey phosphorescent mist the great fault in the seabed dropped beneath him at least ten fathoms anne had said slicing into the heart of the island the mist seemed to swing to one side like a curtain revealing the entrance to the cave a good sixty feet across as it widened on its way down he drifted in greygreen walls moving past on either side the water lightened the grey merging into aquamarine as artificial light seeped down from the surface he moved in close to the wall and went forward cautiously he stopped abruptly switching off the aquamobile from this point on the rough wall of the cave merged into the jetty great square blocks of masonry like the foundations of some ancient fort descending into the depths he started up cautiously and immediately the greyblack underbelly of the submarine appeared from the mist he had found what he was looking for and to stay any longer was to invite trouble he turned and flutterkicked towards the entrance the light dimmed and he was aware of the current tugging at him he swam out into that strange grey phosphorescent world and paused to switch on the aquamobile in that same moment it was torn from his grasp with a metallic clang and a shockwave spreading through the water burst around him he turned and saw the frogman suspended in the water about twenty feet away a weird seacreature full of menace the moonlight glinting on his visor as he reloaded his speargun mallory drove forward pulling the heavy knife from its sheath when he was perhaps ten feet away the gun exploded again in a shower of silver bubbles he swung desperately to one side the spear hurtled past and he moved in fast his knife cleaving through rubber and flesh the mans body bucked agonisingly blood rising in a dark cloud as mallory pulled out the knife and snatched at the airpipe as it came free in his hand air burst out at pressure bubbles swirling past him on the way to the surface he could see the mans face quite clearly now eyes bulging teeth clamped together in agony quite suddenly he went over backwards in a graceful curve like a leaf spiralling earthwards in autumn the weight of his aqualung taking him down mallory struck up towards the surface chasing his aquamobile which was rising slowly he grabbed the handles and switched on already aware of further shockwaves rippling through the water bouncing from his body the aquamobile surged forward helped by the turning tide the seabed started to shelve again and below he was aware of the pale forest of seaweed the ribbons of black rock that were the beginnings of the reef once again he was aware of a shockwave curling around his body and he glanced to his right perhaps fifty yards away and coming up fast through moondrenched water was a large underwater scooter at least twice as long as his aquamobile a frogman trailing behind mallory kicked desperately urging the aquamobile forward and then the rocks swarmed up out of the gloom on either side and he rushed into the darkness of the middle passage he switched on his spot planing down to avoid the overhanging roof he was aware of a muffled throbbing in his ear and glanced back a wide band of diffused light spreading through the mist told him that his pursuer wasnt far behind he passed through a section where moonlight streamed in through cracks and fissures in the roof and knew that he was about halfway along the passage somewhere above the wreck of the freighter as he came into the clear section he plunged down and at ten fathoms a tapering steel mast loomed out of the gloom mallory held on with one hand and waited the darkness moved in on him with a terrible suffocating pressure and the mast seemed to move a little as if the old freighter had rolled he remembered the dark companionway dead mens bones crushed under a steel girder and shivered suddenly aware of the cold he could sense the turbulence in the water waves rippling down when he looked up there was the weird incandescent glow of the spotlamp on the other scooter as it passed overhead he waited for a moment or two then went up slowly at twenty feet he leveled out switched on the motor but not the spot and went after the other scooter only in patches was visibility really bad and at this depth the moonlight streamed in through fissures in the rock like regularly spaced lamps along a dark road when he emerged at last from the great central nave into clear water he switched off the aquamobile and surfaced raoul guyon sat in the stern of the dinghy a yard or two away the frogman stood waistdeep in water on the shelving reef beside his scooter a loaded speargun in his hands it was almost as if they were holding a conversation mallory released his grip on the aquamobile went under the surface and swam forward he erupted in a surge of power slid his right arm about the mans neck and fell backwards towing him into deep water tearing the airhose from his mouth they sank down through the clear water the speargun spiralling off to one side mallory wrenched again with his free hand pulling away the mask and the mans face turned up contorted with fear mallory hung on even when a clutching hand reached backwards wrenching away his own airhose he compressed his lips and tightened his grip blood began to seep from the mans nostrils in two clouds and a moment later he swung loosely against mallorys arm mallory unlocked his fingers and the body bounced away spun round twice and started to sink there was a roaring in his ears and his temples pounded he kicked for the surface and bumped against the side of the dinghy gasping and choking for breath guyon reached over and grasped his outstretched hand and mallory stumbled up the sloping shelf of rock and crouched on his hands and knees chest heaving guyon jumped kneedeep into the water beside him and helped him up pulling away the mask his face strained and anxious in the moonlight when he spoke his voice sounded faint and far away and mallory shook his head several times the roaring subsided abruptly and he gasped no time for questions i ran into a little trouble wed better get moving you found lalouette shes there all right moored to the jetty under the island just like we thought room for a couple more from the look of the place he unbuckled the heavy aqualung swung it into the prow and clambered aboard the dinghy as he started the outboard motor guyon unhooked the painter and followed him a second later and the dinghy was moving back towards lie de roc following the twisting channel between the great rocks which already reared up on either side as the tide turned what happens now guyon said we call up leviathan the moment we get back those motor torpedo boats from st helier will be here before you know it the dinghy rocked in the turbulence as it swept on a fast current between high black walls and turned towards the point behind them a fullthroated roar shattered the night and guyon raised the nightglasses and looked back when he took them down his face looked very white in the moonlight its that damned speedboat of de beaumonts coming up fast on this side of the reef must be doing all of fifteen knots mallory glanced back catching a brief glimpse of the thin pencil of light that was the speedboats spot and opened the throttle of the dinghys outboard motor the strong current was running against them now as they tried to breast the point and the light craft was twisted round a wave splashing across her prow throw the aqualung overboard mallory shouted guyon scrambled to his knees reached for the straps heaved and slid the aqualung over there was an immediate difference the prow riding over the next wave and they turned the point and moved into what should have been calmer water the turning tide at this point clashed headlong with the usual strong coastal current and all around them great patches of white water joined with others sending irregular waves cascading against the cliffs the undertow sucking them out again the dinghy wallowed in the trough between two great swells her speed cut in half and behind the roar of the speedboat drew inexorably nearer well never make it to the harbour guyon called a couple more minutes and theyll see us a great heaving swell was building up to starboard as it swept in lifting the dinghy high into the air mallory caught a glimpse of hamish grants house tucked into a fold at the top of the cliffs a light shining in one of the groundfloor rooms he swung the tiller over and the current drove the dinghy in towards the cliffs at tremendous speed the gap in the inlet had been at least twenty yards across but the real problem was that line of jagged rocks blocking the entrance as surely as if it had been a steel portcullis the one slim hope was that the waves sweeping in would raise the waterlevel and carry them over he shouted to guyon this is going to be rough hang on and get ready to swim the frenchman looked back once his lips moving in reply but the roaring of the sea drowned his words mallory held on to the tiller with both hands strange swirling currents twisted them round and the dinghy was carried helplessly in the opening of the cove appeared suddenly in the face of the cliff water boiling through in a great surge at one side white spray foamed high in the air while all around dirty cream patches formed as rocks showed through the dinghy slewed broadside into the entrance lifted high and smashed down upon a great green slab of rock the tiller was wrenched from mallorys hand and the outboard motor was torn away with a section of the stern the dinghy slithered forward across the reef and ground to a halt a jagged edge of rock smashing through the hull guyon went head first over the prow with a cry and mallory went after him the frenchman tried to stand and mallory plunged through the boiling surf hands outstretched to meet him for a moment they clung together and then another wave cascading in across the reef bowled them over guyon went under and mallory striking after him found himself in deep water he grabbed the frenchman by the collar of his jacket and struck out the current pushing them forward his feet touched sand and he stood up pulling guyon after him water boiled waisthigh again tugging at their limbs as it receded they lurched forward feet slipping in the shingle and staggered up the narrow strip of beach at the base of the cliffs someone was playing the piano an old prewar cole porter number with something of the night in it something of warmth and love and hope that seemed to belong to another age than this crouching in the bushes below the terrace mallory was caught for a brief moment unable to go forward or back guyon groaned beside him coughing up water and mallory pulled him to his feet and they staggered up the steps the french window was ajar one end of a red velvet curtain billowing out as a gust of wind lifted it he took a deep breath and opened it wide the fire burned brightly on the stone hearth and hamish grants hair gleamed like silver in the lamplight as he leaned in his wingbacked chair smoking a cheroot anne sat opposite staring into the fire while fiona played the piano it was fiona who saw them first she gave a sudden gasp her hands striking a false chord and jumped to her feet anne stood up slowly and hamish grant turned his head and looked directly at the window sorry about this mallory said as he moved forward one arm still around guymons shoulders guyon retched suddenly and started to cough again mallory helped him to a chair by the fire and the frenchman fell into it with a groan anne stayed surprisingly calm brandy fiona she said quickly two glasses mallory moved forward water streaming from his rubber suit and stretched out his hands to the fire shivering involuntarily as the warmth enveloped him hamish grant reached out to the dark figure dimly seen and touched the wet rubber suit a strange time to go swimming under the circumstances we didnt have much choice mallory turned to anne who gazed up at him searchingly youre on the phone here arent you she nodded linked to guernsey by cable but it hasnt been working since yesterdays storm that often happens theres the radio telephone on foxhunter of course is it important you could say that mallory turned to guyon who was gulping the brandy fiona had passed to him til have to get down to the harbour straight away i can use the transmitter well both go guyon said there could be trouble waiting down there any chance of an explanation hamish grant enquired mildly mallory took the glass of brandy fiona offered swallowed half of it down and coughed as the fiery liquor caught at the back of his throat id say you were entitled to one under the circumstances i was sent here by british intelligence and captain guyon by the same branch on the other side of the channel we were asked to do a quick check on de beaumont i see hamish grant said i take it hes up to no good very much so his present activities are a direct threat to the interests of his own government and the fact that hes seen fit to operate from british territory presents a serious complication on top of that we dont like what hes doing anyway hamish grant smiled faintly how strange two great nations side by side through the centuries we have our quarrels but somehow theyre always in the family the moment the chips are down we move in to help each other so fast its almost frightening can i ask what happened to van sondergard anne asked i paid him double what you would have done and shipped him out and the incident on the wharf that was arranged too he nodded it got a little out of hand thats why i had to get so rough im sorry im not she said simply he reached out and touched her face and something glowed deep in her eyes her hand went up holding his against her cheek and she turned her head touching her lips to his cold palm for a brief moment it was as if they were alone as if the others had ceased to exist it was hamish grant who broke the spell i should imagine dry clothes should be the first step and youll need the car ill get it out of the garage fiona said quickly she was standing at the side of guymons chair she smiled down at him then went out through the french windows guyon got to his feet and he and mallory followed anne out of the room leaving a trail of seawater across the carpet she found dry socks some old service slacks and a couple of heavy sweaters from hamish grants wardrobe and left the two men in his room to change when they went downstairs ten minutes later jagbir was pouring coffee into cups arranged on a table beside the fire hamish grant still sat in his chair but there was no sign of the girls the little gurkha offered them coffee no visible excitement on his face and the old man said there was a mention of possible trouble when you go down to the harbour the violent sort i presume are you armed guyon answered i had a revolver in the pocket of my reefer coat i lost it coming through the surf youll find another in the top righthand drawer of the desk behind you the old man said half a box of cartridges somewhere at the back there should be a liiger there as well but thats already loaded guyon opened the drawer and came back the revolver in one hand the liiger in the other you can have the liiger the old man went on til keep the webley myself if you dont mind guyon slipped the liiger into his pocket and started to load the webley anne and fiona came in they were both wearing heavy sheepskin coats and anne was binding a scarf about her head peasantfashion she smiled at mallory ready when you are he shook his head gently not on your life you stay right here a slight crease appeared between her eyes and fiona started to protest hamish grant cut in sharply theyll have enough to worry about without you two fiona turned to anne but her sisterinlaw sighed and shook her head hes right fiona wed only be in the way she smiled up at mallory so we sit and wait how long for with any luck the whole thing should be wrapped up into a neat parcel by breakfast and i warn you ill have an appetite ill hold you to that he touched her hand briefly and led the way out into the hall the shooting brake was parked at the bottom of the steps its engine ticking over and he climbed behind the wheel and waited for guyon the young frenchman was standing at the top of the steps with fiona anne in the doorway behind them the young girl reached up kissed him and hurried inside he came down the steps and got into the passenger seat his face grim mallory drove away quickly turning out through the gates along the white road and down the hill towards the harbour the hotel was in darkness and the cove was exactly as they had left it foxhunter moored to one side of the jetty guymons hired launch on the other mallory braked to a halt at the end of the jetty switched off the engine and got out moonlight silvered the water and the night sky was like a warm dark velvet cushion scattered with diamonds so far so good he said to guyon and led the way along the jetty he jumped to foxhunters deck and went into the wheelhouse he switched on the light and cursed softly the radio telephone had been wrenched from its fastening on the far wall and lay in the corner smashed beyond repair a fireaxe beside it they beat us to it after all he pushed past guyon hurried down the companionway and through the saloon to the aft cabin he dropped to one knee opened the locker beneath his bunk and rummaged inside is this what you are looking for colonel mallory raoul guyon said softly mallory got to his feet and turned guyon stood on the other side of the table a drawer open holding the small electronic transmitter that was mallorys only link with the department good man mallory said and took a step forward guyon dropped the set to the floor and ground his heel into it twice at the same time taking the liiger from his coat pocket mallory stood staring at him a slight frown on his face and a voice said excellent captain guyon i was really beginning to despair of you as mallory turned de beaumont stepped out of the shadows of the dark galley jacaud at his side a submachinegun in his hands chapter twelve to the dark tower they were close to the island now and marcel cut the engine to halfspeed and took foxhunter in slowly towards the dark arch the speedboat bobbed behind them on a long towline and as mallory looked out to sea a shadow moved in from the horizon blanketing the stars guyon stood by the rail a few feet away talking to de beaumont in a low voice and jacaud leaned against the wheelhouse the submachinegun in his hands one of his eyes was halfclosed the right side of his face swollen and disfigured by a huge purple bruise and his eyes stared at mallory unwinkingly they moved into the dark entrance and mallory shivered chilled by the damp air and then they were through from end to end the cave was about a hundred yards long and perhaps fifty feet across beneath the surface as he had discovered earlier it was even wider the long stone jetty was brightly illuminated by two arclamps and they coasted in to tie up behind a magnificent fortyfoot steelhulled motoryacht the name fleur de lys painted across her counter the submarine was moored on the far side squat and black in the water and looked even smaller than mallory had imagined a dozen or so men in the uniform of the french navy worked busily loading stores on board under the supervision of a slim rather boyishlooking lieutenant in peaked cap and reefer jacket as they went up the short ladder to the jetty he came forward saluting de beaumont casually how are things going fenelon de beaumont asked any snags fenelon shook his head well be ready on schedule good ill give you a final briefing at am fenelon went back to his men and de beaumont turned to mallory magnificent isnt she and just the thing for our purposes small compact only needs a crew of sixteen youre familiar with the type only on paper this one has quite a history built at deutsche werft in and sunk with all hands within a month of commissioning after she was raised she was transferred to the french and now shes yours mallory said a chequered career a body was against the far wall covered by a tarpaulin webbed feet turned to one side blood streaking the pool of seawater in which it lay we couldnt find the other one the current must have taken him under the reef de beaumont shook his head a nasty way to die the words seemed to carry an implicit threat but mallory refused to be drawn and de beaumont smiled faintly and led the way across to where a flight of stone steps lifted a hundred feet into the gloom curving round one wall of the cave they mounted the steps and emerged on to a stone landing and de beaumont led the way to the far end of a passage passing several doors one or two stood open to show narrow service bunks and grey blankets neatly folded from a side entrance there came the smell of cooking he opened another door and they entered a large hall great curved beams of oak arching into the gloom there was a wide marble staircase and above it a gallery at one side logs blazed in an immense medieval fireplace quite a sight isnt it the money these victorian industrialists must have had to throw around and every stone brought in by boat his tone was casual mannered he might have been a rather complacent host showing a friend over his new place they went up the great staircase and moved along the gallery to the far end de beaumont opened a door to disclose a narrow spiral staircase at intervals there were slotted windows and mallory could see far out to sea as they mounted higher and higher they reached a stone landing and paused outside a door de beaumont went in leaving it ajar the room contained a great deal of radio equipment and an operator sat before a transmitting set headphones clamped to his ears he stood up when de beaumont appeared there was a murmur of conversation and then the colonel came back outside he continued up the spiral staircase mallory guyon and marcel following behind jacaud bringing up the rear at last they emerged on a small landing and de beaumont opened his final door the room was circular in shape and quite large it was comfortably furnished persian carpets covering the floor logs burning brightly in the wide fireplace the walls were lined with books except for a section perhaps twenty feet long covered by a velvet curtain de beaumont pulled it to one side revealing a curved glass window one of my little improvements on a clear day you can see france he indicated a chair by the fire if you please mallory sat in the chair and jacaud moved to stand behind him the submachinegun held ready marcel stood by the window a revolver in his right hand held against his thigh guyon remained by the door and mallory looked across at him guyon returned his gaze calmly giving nothing away and mallory turned to de beaumont who was now sitting in the opposite chair i will not insult your intelligence by fencing with you colonel mallory he said for some time i was a prisoner of the viets in indochina there is little they failed to teach me at first hand about the extraction of information from the uncooperative jacaud was senior warrant officer of my regiment he shared my experiences i need hardly add that he would welcome an opportunity to experiment no need to go on mallory said i get the point excellent de beaumont said we can get down to business as you may now have deduced for yourself captain guyon is something of a double agent when the deuxieme offered him employment they were not aware that he was already a loyal member of the oas a most convenient arrangement he confirms the fact that the bureau had no real grounds for suspecting lalouette to be in hiding here that his assignment to lie de roc to work with you was at the request of british intelligence id like to know why we had a man here watching you mallory said just routine because of who you are and what you are he drifted in on the tide the other evening accidental drowning was the coroners verdict he had a habit of taking long walks on the cliffs after dark with a pair of nightglasses de beaumont said rather dangerous someone should have warned him you made a mistake there mallory said to my chief it meant only one thing our man had seen something important with the french combing every creek and inlet on their side of the channel it gave him a rather nasty feeling to think that she might be sitting it out in the channel islands a pity de beaumont said now i must move out rather sooner than i had intended on the other hand neither my immediate nor longterm plans will be affected in the slightest he stood up and smiled politely under happier circumstances i should have enjoyed talking to you we must have a great deal in common im sure youll understand that my time is limited naturally mallory said ironically and got to his feet he had often wondered about this moment how it would come and when the strange thing was that he was not afraid more curious than anything else jacaud moved restlessly behind him and marcel came away from the wall the gun still held against his leg de beaumont took a revolver from his pocket crossed to guyon and handed it to him will you do the honours captain a soldiers end i think guymons hand tightened on the butt of the revolver and he looked across at mallory his face very white quite suddenly he grabbed de beaumont by the front of his coat pulling him forward and rammed the barrel of the revolver against his throat there was a moment of stillness and then de beaumont laughed gently you know our friends in paris have been worried about you for some time now guyon i can understand why youre slipping i should have thought an officer of your experience would have been able to tell the difference in weight between a revolver loaded with blanks and one loaded with live ammunition he reached up and took the revolver from guymons hand and guyon looked across at mallory and smiled wryly sometimes we can be too clever my friend nice to have you back mallory said de beaumont opened the door and nodded to marcel take him below and watch him carefully ill send colonel mallory down later he closed the door behind them turned to mallory and smiled and now that we all know exactly where we are we can perhaps relax for half an hour he took a bottle and two glasses from a cupboard in the corner and returned to his chair this is really quite an excellent cognac i think youll enjoy it mallory sat in the opposite chair aware of jacaud at his back and waited for what was to come he accepted a glass of cognac drank a little and leaned back i cant understand what you hope to gain from all this murder and assassination will only lose you what little support you command a matter of opinion de beaumont said the only politics which seem to matter in this modern world are the politics of violence palestine cyprus and algeria were all examples of victory achieved by a deliberate and carefully planned use of violence and assassination we can do the same the circumstances are completely different in the cases youve quoted nationalistic elements were opposed to a colonial power in your own frenchmen are murdering frenchmen they are not worthy of the name the swine we have dealt with so far loudmouths professional liberals and scheming politicians who feathered their own nests while i and men like me rotted in the viet prison camps de beaumont laughed bitterly i remember our homecoming only too well booed all the way into marseilles by communist dock workers ancient history mallory said nobody wants to know in any case unless theyd been through the same experience themselves they wouldnt know what youre talking about but you have de beaumont said deep inside i think you know what i mean you learned a hard lesson from the chinese you put it down in cold print in that book of yours what happened when you put it into practice he stared into the fire a frown on his face it was going to be different in algeria we were certain of that we fought the fells in the jebel of the atlas mountains in the heat of the sahara in the alleys of algiers and we were beating them in the end we had them by the throat he turned to mallory i was in the army plot of the th may they gave us no choice they would have arrested my friends and me tried us on trumpedup atrocity charges designed to please the loudmouths and fellowtravelers back home in paris we put de gaulle in power because we believed in the ideal of a french algeria a greater france and once he was in control he did exactly the opposite to what you had intended mallory said one of the great ironies of postwar history de beaumont swallowed some more cognac and continued even more ironic that i phillipe de beaumont descendant of one of the greatest of french military families should have helped place in power the man who has destroyed the greatness of his country that remains to be seen mallory said id say that charles de gaulle was moved by one thing only deep patriotism whatever hes done hes done because he thought it best for france de beaumont shrugged so we disagree its of little moment after his visit to st malo on the rd of next month he will no longer present a problem i dont know what you have in mind but i wouldnt count on anything how many times have your people failed now eight isnt it i flatter myself that my own organisation has been rather more successful these affairs need the trained mind malory everything i handle is a military operation planned to the last detail in conditions of the strictest security lalouette affair i have handled personally from the beginning my colleagues in paris know nothing about it i work strictly on my own and use them as an information service only mallory shook his head you cant last much longer youre working on too big a scale already lalouettes become more of a liability than anything else you couldnt be more wrong de beaumont got to his feet took a couple of charts from the cupboard beside his chair and crossed to a small table come over here youll find this interesting they were admiralty charts of the area between guernsey and the french coast and he joined them together quickly here is he de roc and st pierre thirty miles southwest of guernsey the nearest french soil is pointe du chateau only twenty miles away you know the area mallory shook his head the closest ive been is brest a dangerous coast of small islands and reefs lonely and wild you will notice lie de monte only a quarter of a mile off the coast the gironde marshes opposite there is a small cottage on an island perhaps half a mile into the marsh on the main creek eight miles from a road and very lonely not even a telephone there are only two people in residence at the moment and you want them only the man henri granville mallory straightened a frown on his face you mean granville the judge the procureur general who retired last month i congratulate you on your intimate knowledge of french affairs he arrived there with his wife yesterday they are quite alone of course no one is supposed to know hes fond of solitude solitude and birds unfortunately for him a contact of mine in paris got news of his movements last night and let me know at once im sending jacaud across in lalouette later today his execution should cause quite a stir youre crazy mallory said he must be eighty if hes a day on top of that hes one of the bestloved men in france god in heaven everybody loves granville politics doesnt enter into it on three occasions now he has presided at tribunals which have condemned old comrades of mine to death de beaumont said now he must pay the consequences by striking at granville we prove once and for all that we are a force to be reckoned with that no man however powerful no matter what his public standing is safe from our vengeance henri granville never condemned anyone in his life without good reason harm him in any way and youll bring the mountain in on you mallory shook his head youll never get away with it de beaumont smiled faintly crossed to the fire and poured more cognac into his glass you think not he swallowed a little of the cognac and sighed i will postpone your execution till this evening by that time jacaud will have returned it will give me some satisfaction in sending you to your death with the knowledge that henri granville has preceded you which remains to be seen mallory said de beaumont turned and indicated a tattered battle standard hanging above the fireplace an ancestor of mine carried that himself at waterloo when his standardbearer was shot it was with me at dienbienphu i managed to hang on to it during all those bitter months of captivity you will notice it bears the motto of the de beaumonts who dares wins mallory said i would remember that if i were you something you seem to have forgotten mallory said when that ancestor of yours picked up that standard at waterloo he didnt carry it forward on his own there was a regiment of guards backing him up all the way and i seem to remember that at dienbienphu you commanded a regiment of colonial paratroops but then thats france im speaking about the real france something you wouldnt know anything about for a moment something glowed in de beaumonts eyes but he pushed back his anger and forced a smile take him below jacaud he and guyon can spend their last hours together trying to solve an impossible problem the thought will amuse me jacaud gave mallory a push towards the door as he opened it de beaumont said calmly and jacaud when i next see colonel mallory i expect him to be in his present condition you understand jacaud turned sharply a growl rising in his throat for a moment he seemed about to defy de beaumont and then he turned suddenly and pushed mallory forward they went down the spiral staircase mallory leading all the time aware of the machinegun at his back the gallery was in halfdarkness the fire a heap of glowing ashes as they crossed the hall and went through the door which led to the livingquarters and the cave at the end of a long whitewashed corridor they found marcel sitting on a chair outside a door reading a newspaper the revolver stuck in his belt he looked up at jacaud eyes raised enquiringly when this evening when i get back from the mainland jacaud turned to mallory and patted the submachinegun a red glow seemed to light up behind the cold eyes personally colonel mallory mallory moved into the cell as the door clanged behind him guyon swung his legs to the floor and sat looking at him he grinned suddenly you wouldnt by any chance have such a thing as a cigarette on you would you chapter thirteen council of war i had lost all belief or interest in right or wrong in the end you believe only in your friends the comrade who had his throat cut the previous night that was what six years in algeria had done for me raoul guyon stood by the small barred window gazing into the night when he turned he looked tired and this is why you joined the oas mallory said guyon shook his head i was in algiers in so much blood that i was sickened by it there was a young moorish girl for a little while we tried to shelter from the storm together they found her on the beach one morning stripped mutilated i had to identify the body the following day i was badly wounded and sent back to france to convalesce when i returned my comrades seemed to have the only solution to bring back de gaulle you took part in the original plot guyon shrugged i was on the fringe just one more junior officer but to me de gaulle stood for order out of chaos afterwards most of us were posted to other units i spent five months on patrol with the camel corps in the hoggar and did you find what you were looking for almost guyon said there was a day of heat and thirst when i almost had it when the rocks shimmered and the mountains danced in a blue haze and i was a part of it almost but not quite what happened after that i was posted back to algeria to one of the worst districts a place of barbed wire and fear where violence erupted like a disease and life was no longer even an act of faith i was wounded again last year just before general chiles abortive coup not seriously but enough to give me a legitimate excuse to put in a request to be placed on unpaid leave the night before i left legrande visited me in my hotel room offered me work with the deuxieme bureau and you accepted in a strange way it offered me some sort of escape later in paris i was approached by oas agents as an exparatroop officer and supporter of the original coup which had placed de gaulle in power i must have seemed an obvious choice and you informed legrande as soon as i could get in touch with him that was the funny thing i didnt even have to make a choice it was almost as if it had been made for me he told me to accept the offer from his point of view an agent with contacts in that direction would obviously be valuable and yet we were informed that the deuxieme had no real suspicions about de beaumont surely you must have had some sort of lead on him through your paris connections with the other side not really i was only on the edge of their organisation de beaumonts name was mentioned as one sympathetic to their aims on the other hand his political opinions are well known in france there was certainly never any hint that he might be an active worker and all this time you were completely accepted i certainly thought so as a new recruit to the deuxieme it was obvious that my sources would be limited but i passed on selected information of legrandes orders i certainly never managed to get close to any of the really big men but i was working towards it on two occasions he even allowed me to warn some of the lesser fry when their arrest was imminent what about lalouette that was the thing which puzzled us from the beginning the complete absence of information as to her whereabouts even in oas circles because of that legrande told me to inform my paris contacts that i had been assigned to the channel islands merely to run a routine check on de beaumont just to make sure that he was behaving himself legrande felt that at least it would prove once and for all whether a definite link existed something he didnt see fit to inform us at our end im sorry about that but legrande never lives in the present only the future he envisaged a possible situation in which my other activities could prove useful under the circumstances it seemed wiser to present myself merely as raoul guyon an accredited agent of the bureau and nothing more i see the old fox is still a believer in playing his cards as they fall mallory said it shows in his poker game a remark strangely similar to one he made about you just before i left mallory grinned one thing at least has come out of all this de beaumont definitely does have a link with the oas in paris because he was warned that you were coming the one thing i dont understand is why he didnt think it strange that you hadnt told them about lalouette affair the first thing he asked me coming across on the boat a difficult question to answer and how did you told him the bureau believed the whole business to be the work of an independent group that this was confirmed for me personally by the obvious ignorance of the affair in oas circles that as an exparatroop officer who had taken part in the coup of june only to be betrayed by de gaulle i would much prefer to work with him and he accepted that he seemed to at the time it all sounds pretty shaky to me it obviously did to de beaumont guyon grinned wryly on the other hand i didnt have time to think up anything better and i did make my own move against you just before they did remember that was quick thinking the young frenchman shrugged when i saw what they had done to the radio telephone it seemed logical to assume they were still on board that we were under observation it seemed wise to establish my credentials while i still could and i remembered seeing you put the transmitter in the table drawer earlier in the afternoon and youd never met him previously guyon shook his head as i told you before only as one of a crowd naturally i knew a great deal about him he was one of the really great paratroop officers you know ive been going over everything he said to me upstairs mallory said none of it really makes sense in the end he must lose the murder of a fine old man like henri granville on its own will be sufficient to lose him and those who think like him a great deal of sympathy and yet he goes on i wonder why he was always a strange ascetic man a cross between religious fanatic and soldier the surrender at dienbienphu the humiliation of the viet camps and our subsequent withdrawal from indochina were a source of lasting shame to him like many of his kind he swore it would never happen again and in spite of everything he could do it did guyon nodded de beaumont is the last of one of our most noble families his only heir a brother who is a professor of political history at the sorbonne a man with pronounced leftwing sympathies one of his ancestors was one of the few nobles to give wholehearted support to the revolution in another was a general under napoleon for one hundred and fifty years the de beaumonts have been one of the greatest of french families something of a national calamity if he had to be arrested exactly the government was more than happy when he chose to reside in the channel islands at the time it seemed to dispose of him as an immediate problem which he has now become mallory said and in more ways than one you are thinking of his threat to dispose of de gaulle during his visit to st malo next month guyon shook his head lay on the other bed pillowing his head on his hands im not too worried about that they wont get de gaulle hes indestructible that one like one of those rocks out there on the reef after a storm a little more weathered but still standing which leaves us with the granville affair mallory said and the hell of it is there doesnt seem to be a damned thing we can do about it he lit a cigarette and lay on his back gazing at the ceiling going over the events of the previous couple of hours in his mind after a while he said softly the first rule in this game is that the job must come before everything else most men ive worked with in your position would have played along with de beaumont would even have executed me if necessary perhaps i saw the situation differently guyon said you moved so fast you didnt even notice the difference in weight the blanks made why something ive been asking myself on and off for the past hour or more its not easy to explain lets just say that suddenly people have become important to me again and leave it at that he turned his face to the wall and mallory lay there smoking his cigarette thinking how strange it was that a young man all feeling burned out of him by the flames of two savage wars should be brought back to life by that oldest and most elemental of human emotions love he was cold and stiff and his limbs ached he pulled the blanket over his legs and checked his watch it was almost am and he lay in the darkness listening to the rain and the wind after a while he drifted into sleep again he became aware that someone was prodding him and opened his eyes raoul guyon squatted beside him grey light seeped into the room through the barred window and mallory swung his legs to the floor still raining guyon nodded hasnt let up all night its almost eight mallory walked to the door and peered through the iron grille into the corridor outside a young sailor sat in a chair reading a book a heavy service revolver in the holster at his waist mallory crossed to the window the casement opened easily enough but the bars set in the ledge on either side were strong and firm he looked into the grey morning out along the reef to lie de roc rain slanted down and visibility was poor a cold mist drifting close to the surface of the water i wonder what theyre doing over there guyon said at his shoulder they must have realised by now that somethings gone wrong mallory shrugged if theyve any sense at all theyll have brought in owen morgan and gone to guernsey for help in your launch surely de beaumont will have considered that possibility he probably has thats whats worrying me there was a rattle of bolts and the door opened as they both turned marcel entered and stood to one side a revolver in his right hand the young sailor followed carrying a tray which he placed on the bed they withdrew without saying a word bolting the door again the food was simple bread and cheese and hot coffee and mallory suddenly realised how hungry he was they sat on either side of the tray to eat and finished off by sharing his last cigarette afterwards he lay on the bed waiting for something to happen while guyon paced restlessly up and down the cell the rain hammering against the window it was almost ten oclock when the door opened again and de beaumont entered marcel at his back he seemed in a good humour and smiled cheerfully good morning gentlemen i trust you spent a good night your quarters are adequate ive seen worse mallory admitted anything i can get you the condemned mans last wish mallory shrugged we could do with some cigarettes thats about all marcel took a packet of gauloise from his pocket and threw them on the bed anything else de beaumont said politely mallory put a cigarette in his mouth and tossed the packet to guyon i dont think so then you will excuse me youll be interested to know that jacaud and his men left for pointe du chateau fifteen minutes ago as scheduled under the circumstances i think its time i paid a visit to our friends on fie de roc i wouldnt count on anyone being there to meet you oh theyll be there all right i can assure you of that de beaumont smiled faintly as if enjoying some private joke nodded to marcel and passed outside the door closed and the bolts were rammed home with a harsh finality guyon turned with a gesture of despair and mallory motioned him to silence when he went to the door the young sailor was back on his chair reading a magazine mallory crossed to the window and looked outside a minute or two later he heard the sound of an engine and foxhunter came into view running alongside the reef towards lie de roc there he goes guyon moved to the window peered out and frowned but why has he taken foxhunter easier to handle than fleur de lys on the short run and theres too much sea for the speedboat guyon thinking of fiona dropped his cigarette and stamped on it viciously i didnt like his last remark he sounded far too sure of himself as if he knew for certain that the general and the girls would still be on the island i imagine he does mallory said its been a long night he could have been up to anything but that isnt important at the moment he probably only intends to bring them back here for safe custody until hes ready to move out you may be right its henri granville im thinking about sitting in the middle of the gironde marshes not knowing that sometime after noon therell be a knock at the door i can see the smile on jacauds face now and nothing we can do about it plenty if we could get out of here theres always the radio room in the tower or the fleur de lys would be a better bet a boat of that size is bound to have a radio telephone guyon shook his head those marshes are one of the most isolated places on the entire coast even if we managed to contact my people in paris it would still be too late for henri granville theyd never reach him in time but we could mallory said lalouette will have to make the entire run submerged that will take her a good three hours its almost an hour since she left guyon pointed out fleur de lys has twice the speed we could still beat jacaud to the punch only if we get out of here within the next halfhour guyon said and i stopped believing in miracles a long time ago we dont need a miracle just a little luck mallory pulled him down on the bed now listen carefully it was cold in the passage and the young sailor shivered and got to his feet he stamped vigorously to restore his circulation and walked a few paces away from the chair he was bored he was also a little afraid in the beginning the whole affair had seemed like a great adventure a crusade now he was not so sure he turned to move back to his chair and a muffled cry sounded from inside the cell he stood there a puzzled frown on m face there was another cry followed by the crash of a bed going over he arrived at the grille in time to see guyon drive his fist into mallorys face knocking him against the wall you got me into this you bastard the young frenchman cried til kill you ill kill you he flung himself forward and mallory ducked under another blow moved in close and tripped him a moment later and he was kneeling on guymons chest hands twisted into his collar as he throttled him expertly the young sailor gave a cry of alarm he pulled back the bolts and moved into the cell revolver ready in his right hand he reached for mallorys collar and to his amazement guyon erupted from the floor grabbed his wrist savagely and twisted the revolver from his grasp the sailors mouth opened in a cry of alarm that was cut short as mallorys fist moved in a short arc against the side of the jaw mallory picked up the revolver nodded to guyon and they went outside quickly all was quiet guyon bolted the door and they hurried along the passage a strange quiet reigned until they reached the main corridor when they heard voices in the distance and the clatter of pans from the kitchen they passed along to the far end and mallory opened the door cautiously and stepped on to the landing at the top of the steps which led down to the cave the jetty was deserted and fleur de lys and the speedboat were the only craft moored to the wall they went down the stone steps quickly paused for a moment at the bottom then hurried across to fleur de lys when they went into the wheelhouse they saw at once that the radio telephone had been removed from its housing on the wall mallory grinned tightly hes a cautious bastard ill say that for him only to be expected guyon shrugged a good soldier tries to foresee every eventuality he looked around and shook his head this looks one hell of a size for two of us well manage mallory said well have to theres plenty of fuel in the tank which is the main thing go get those lines off the jetty and well move out guyon went forward quickly and untied the first line as he started aft there was a harsh cry when he glanced up he saw a sailor standing on the landing at the top of the steps he ran along the deck and cast off the other line the sailor drew a revolver and fired two wild shots as he came down the steps he was too late the engines were already roaring into life and mallory took fleur de lys out through the entrance spray splashed against the window waves breaking over the deck as he turned through the leeside of the reef and set course for pointe du chateau chapter fourteen forge of arms hamish grant opened the door and stood listening to the sound of quiet breathing fiona was stretched on the sofa and anne slept in the wingbacked chair a rug over her legs as he started to close the door she opened her eyes and said softly what time is it just after eight jabbers made some fresh tea she got to her feet draped the rug over fiona and followed him out any sign of them the old man shook his head not yet the kitchen looked out over the courtyard a large and pleasant room beams supporting a low ceiling jagbir was frying eggs at the stove when he saw anne he poured a cup of tea and gave it to her and she stood in front of the fire drinking it slowly beyond through the wide window clouds hung threateningly over the fields rain dripped from the gutters and brown leaves crawled across the cobbles she went to the window and gazed out into the rain thinking of mallory hamish grant moved beside her and squeezed her hand he did say it would take till breakfasttime i shouldnt worry too much if i were you tm not she said one thing i am sure of is his ability to look after himself but id have thought wed have heard from them by now we very probably will before much longer she finished her tea and moved to the door i think ill run down to the harbour and see whats happening ill send jagbir with you she shook her head let him get on with breakfast i shant be long no need to wake fiona till i get back she could do with the sleep she went along the hall pulled on her sheepskin coat and let herself out of the front door rain fell steadily and she fastened a scarf about her hair as she went down the drive and turned through the gates visibility was poor a grey clinging mist drifting in patches across the water and the central hill of the island looked very green against the leaden sky she hurried along the road and paused on the brow of the hill to look down into the harbour only one boat was moored there raoul guymons launch and the shooting brake was parked at the end of the jetty she went down the hill quickly taking a short cut across the wet grass the shooting brake was beaded with moisture the engine cold she stood there for a moment a frown on her face then walked along the jetty and stepped on to the deck of guymons launch she went into the small saloon stood looking about her for a moment then turned to go she paused wrinkling her nose aware of the heavy acrid taint of oil on the fresh morning air it seeped into a pool from under the door of the engine compartment she opened it and looked into a twisted mass of smashed pipes and broken valves she crouched on one knee gazing at the engine her mind frozen as she started to rise steps boomed hollowly on the wooden planking of the jetty and owen morgan called hello below anne went up the companionway and came out on deck as he stepped down from the jetty he wore an old blue pilot coat and rubber boots rain frosted his grey hair he started to grin but his smile faded at the sight of her troubled face whats wrong take a look at the engine he went down the companionway quickly when he reappeared his face was grave why would anyone want to do a thing like that to make sure we couldnt get off the island she said he frowned quickly look how about letting me in on all this wheres foxhunter i heard her go out early this morning that must have been colonel mallory and monsieur guyon she said they should have been back by now im very much afraid something may have happened to them are they in some kind of trouble they could be but there isnt time to explain now owen we must get to guernsey as soon as possible what about your launch i hauled her up the slipway and into the boathouse ready for winter only two days ago he said no trouble to bring her down again if its all that urgent i can have her ready for sea in half an hour do that anne said til go back to the house for the others ill explain things more fully when i get back she hurried along the jetty climbed behind the wheel and switched on the engine it required a lot of choke before it would turn over and owen was already halfway up the slope towards the boathouse at the side of the hotel when she finally moved away the welshmans skin crawled with excitement whatever was wrong it was certainly serious so much had been evident from anne grants manner and actions and to a man whose entire life had been a series of adventures the prospect of action carried all the kick of a good stiff drink when he was only a few yards away from the boathouse he remembered that the heavy door was padlocked he turned and moved up the slope quickly to the side door of the hotel when he went into the kitchen juliette was standing at the sink washing the breakfast dishes wheres the key to the boathouse he demanded she turned her eyebrows arching in surprise on the nail behind the door where it always is whats wrong ive got to get the boat out he said the grants want me to run them over to guernsey cant explain why i dont even know myself but it must be something serious he took down the key and went out again after he had gone juliette vincente stood at the sink gazing blankly at the door after a moment she dried her hands carefully hung up the towel and went up the back stairs to her bedroom owen morgan opened the heavy doors of the boathouse and moved inside the launch was seated firmly into a deep concrete slot a steel cable coiled around a winch at her stern holding her in place he jumped down on to the deck pulled off the top of the engine housing and paused suddenly his throat going dry the engine was in exactly the same state as the one in guymons boat delicate pipes and valves smashed beyond repair a heavy hammer from his own toolkit lying in the ruins as he got to his feet there was the scrape of a shoe on stone behind him he turned and looked up at juliette she wore his old corduroy jacket against the cold her hands thrust deep into the pockets whats wrong owen she asked and then in one single inexplicable flash of intuition he knew that she was responsible and his eyes widened why juliette he said why did you do it my brother was killed in algeria owen her voice was flat lifeless he died for france they repaid him by giving what hed died for away i couldnt stand by and allow that to happen anger flared inside him like flames through dry leaves what sort of bloody nonsense are you telling me girl what about my boat he started to clamber up beside her and she backed away taking a revolver from her pocket he stood facing her very still the skin on his face so white that it was almost transparent a bewildered expression on his face its me juliette owen he took a step forward move past me very slowly owen she said your hands behind your back dont make me kill you he stood poised feet apart and wild laughter erupted from his mouth kill me girl you in a moment he drove forward one hand reaching for the gun the other grabbing for her coat in that same instant something seemed to move in her eyes and he knew with the most appalling certainty that he had made the last mistake of his life the sound of the shot reechoed deafeningly between the walls of the boathouse and the force of the bullet smashing through his body sent him staggering backwards he swayed on the edge of the ramp hands clutching at his stomach the blood erupted from his mouth in a bright stream and he fell back on the deck juliette vincente moved to the edge of the ramp and looked down at him he lay very still his dark eyes fixed on a point a million miles beyond her she put the revolver back into her pocket went outside and started to close the heavy doors when she turned foxhunter was just coming round the point into the harbour in the kitchen hamish grant sat at one end of the table the remains of his breakfast before him and listened gravely to what anne had to tell him when she had finished he shook his head briefly no use trying to pretend things look good they dont but one thing is certain there isnt much we can do on our own then guernsey is our only hope he nodded and got to his feet i think it would be better if we all went it never pays to take chances and things could get rather unhealthy fiona came in from the hall carrying his old british warm youll need this on father its rather cold it was the first time she had called him anything but general since she was quite small and his heart went out to her he reached for her face dimly seen and patted her cheek not to worry fiona well get things sorted out she held his hand tightly for a moment then turned and led the way into the hall anne was already sitting behind the wheel of the brake the engine ticking over the general and jagbir got into the rear fiona in the front and anne drove away quickly it was still raining heavily and she turned on the wipers leaning forward watching for potholes in the dirt road as the brake climbed to the crest of the hill she changed to a lower gear ready for the descent to the harbour they went over the top of the rise fiona gave a cry of alarm and anne braked quickly de beaumont marcel and three sailors stood in the road looking out towards the sea about a quarter of a mile offshore and running strongly southwest towards the french coast was fleur de lys marcel had one arm outstretched as he pointed he turned to speak to de beaumont and saw the shooting brake as they fanned across the road anne slammed her foot hard against the accelerator in a reflex action that took the old brake forward in a surge of power she saw the mouths open in alarm voiceless above the roaring of the engine and then they were scattering to either side the brake shot through and bounced down on the road swerving on the bend at the bottom cutting across the grass towards the jetty she braked hard and the vehicle slewed in a long breathtaking skid that for one awful moment seemed to be taking them over the edge to the beach and the rocks below they came to a stop the front bumper lodged against a boulder and she opened the door and got out there was no sign of owen morgan or his launch and when she looked up at the boathouse the great doors were still closed she turned and found the general scrambling out at the rear helped by jagbir as the little gurka straightened his coat fell open to show the ivoryandsilver hilt of his kukri the curved blade in its leather sheath thrust into his waistband as fiona came round from the other side there was a faint cry up on the hill anne looked up and saw de beaumont and his men running towards them one of them paused raised lugs rifle and fired a warning shot that whined across the jetty into the water hamish grant turned quickly what about owen no sign of him or the launch anne said but foxhuntersmoored at the end of the jetty any brief hope that they might be able to take over the launch before de beaumont and his men arrived disappeared as a sailor came out of the wheelhouse looked towards them then hurried back inside wed better get up to the hotel anne said they started up the hill fiona leading the way hamish grant using his walking stick to help him there was another cry from de beaumont and the sailor who had been guarding foxhunter rushed out on deck with a rifle and loosed off a quick shot which splintered the woodwork of one of the boathouse doors anne could taste blood in her mouth and there was a pain in her chest she took hamish grants hand and scrambled on her feet slipping on the wet turf and then they were on to the terrace and moving into the porch fiona flung open the door and led the way inside the bar was quite empty a small fire burning in the grate the stillness was so complete that anne could hear her heart pounding hamish grant leaned against a table struggling for breath and she called out owen owen morgan where are you there was no footfall and yet a quiet voice said with startling suddenness from behind her he isnt here anne turned quickly and looked into the calm face of juliette vincente for gods sake juliette where is he whats going on i think that perhaps you have come to the wrong place madame juliettes hand came out of her pocket holding the pistol and now we will all wait quietly for the comte de beaumont in the same moment jagbir drove forward the terrible gurkha battlecry bursting from his throat his hand swung from under his coat the razorsharp blade of the kukri hissing softly through space juliette vincente pulled the trigger twice bullets smashing into the little gurkhas body and then he was on top of her as she fired again at close quarters the heavy blade swung down half severing her neck they fell together jagbir on top the kukri as firmly clenched in his right hand in death as it had been in life as fiona screamed the door swung open hamish grant turned pulling the webley from his pocket thrusting it towards the dark formless shadow against the light that was de beaumont behind him the window shattered and the barrel of a rifle was rammed painfully into his back if the general is wise he will drop it marcel said hamish grant stood there trapped in the moment of decision and already it was too late de beaumont moved forward and pulled the webley gently from his grasp and now old friend perhaps you will be sensible chapter fifteen the fleur de lys fleur de lys rolled her slim length into the wind plunging over a wave as water broke across her prow in the wheelhouse mallory leaned over the chart table behind him the wheel clicked to one side eerily to compensate as the vessel veered to starboard the automatic pilot in control the admiralty charts he had found in the flat drawers underneath the table were very comprehensive the one which covered the pointe du chateau coastline and the gironde marshes told him everything he needed to know the door of the saloon companionway swung open and guyon appeared he wore a yellow oilskin jacket and carried a large mug of coffee in each hand how are we doing mallory checked his watch almost noon not long now were doing about fifteen knots i heard the weather forecast on the radio in the galley just before i came up guyon said it wasnt good winds increasing and fog indicated in the coastal area were running into it already mallory drank some of his coffee and guyon peered through the window in the distance the fog waited like a damp shroud and heavy grey skies dropped towards the sea already the waves were lifting into whitecaps in the northwest how far would you say were behind lalouette now guyon said mallory shrugged submerged she only has half our speed allowing for the start she had its going to run things a little close he leaned over the chart again shell have to surface inshore of lie de yeu before moving into the main creek flowing out of the marshes what depth is it there mallory traced its course with a pencil four or five fathoms strong tidal currents constantly changing not to be relied on i know what that means one day theres a sandbank the next six fathoms of clear water these tidal marshes are all the same but we could get in with fleur de lys i think so probably not as far as the central island where the cottage is its marked on the chart half a mile in guyon straightened and the inimitable wry grin twisted his mouth things might get interesting eh i think you could say that gradually the mist enfolded them until they were running through a strange enclosed world and mallory took over the wheel and reduced speed to ten knots about thirty minutes later they emerged into a patch of clear water and saw the coastline of pointe du chateau no more than half a mile to port as they approached a string of rocks and small islands lifted out of the sea running parallel to the coast trailing away towards the great hogback of the lie de yeu looming out of the mist in the distance mallory called to guyon to take over the wheel and went back to the chart when he straightened his eyes glittered strangely i think we can save a little time here but it means taking a chance lalouette will have to use the inshore passage she has no other choice this side of lie de yeu theres another passage marked between the island and the reef three fathoms we might take the bottom out of her guyon said mallory shrugged its de beaumonts boat not mine guyon grinned tightly then i suggest you take the wheel mallory changed course a point and the young frenchman went down the saloon companionway when he returned he carried two lifejackets when i was a child a gypsy woman told my mother i must always beware of water superstitious nonsense of course but unfortunately my breton blood says otherwise id hate to prove her right at this stage mallory changed to the automatic pilot slipped his arms through the straps of the lifejacket and took over the wheel again they were running parallel with the islands now and fleur de lys rocked in the turbulence waves slapping solidly against her hull rain hammered against the window cascading in a sheet which blurred the outlines of all solid objects adding a strangely dreamlike quality to the whole scene ile de yeu was very close and he could see white water boiling in a frenzy across the jagged spine of the reef he swung the wheel hard to port fleur de lys shuddered protestingly a wave slammed against her hull and the deck tilted guyon was thrown across the wheelhouse and mallory fell to one knee the wheel started to spin but already his hands were back in position as he brought her head round she lurched forward towards the narrow band of clear water between the reef and the island he gave her everything the engines had to offer and the boat responded magnificently the passage rushed towards them at a seemingly impossible speed and then they were into it water crashing across great rocks on either side white curling fingers reaching out to enfold them all around boulders were appearing and disappearing waves foaming over them and raoul guyon hung on to the chart table his face white strange swirling currents snatched at the rudder and for one agonising moment fleur de lys slewed to port mallory heaved on the wheel there was a slight audible shudder that ran through the entire craft as she slid across a sandbank and then they were into clear water fog rolled from the land in patches and they could smell the foetid odour of the marshes that was carried towards them on the offshore breeze mallory reduced speed and they moved in the engines rumbling protestingly on a low note the marshes drifted out of the fog dark and sinister waiting to receive them and overhead a long wavering skein of geese passed like windblown spirits of the dead long narrow sandbanks lifted out of the water and landward miles of rough grass marsh a maze of creeks waterlogged mud and wavering barriers of reeds they turned the end of a long sandbar and the mouth of the creek opened before them guyon leaned forward with a cry of alarm squatting just inside the entrance like some landblown whale was lalouette her greyblack plates shining with moisture fenelon stood in the conning tower with jacaud and below three sailors were fitting an outboard motor to the stern of a large rubber dinghy mallory took fleur de lys forward in a surge of power her bow wave cascading across the hull of the submarine knocking one of the sailors into the water there was a startled cry and as they passed there was no more than ten feet between them mallory was aware of the shocked dismay on feelings face of jacaud frowning in disbelief and then they were through and safe in the fog he reduced speed to five knots and opened the window fog was sucked in sharp and cold the taste of it bitter as death he strained his eyes into the gloom watching the reeds drift by a few minutes later they slid gently to a halt with a slight jar mallory quickly reversed the engines for a moment nothing seemed to be happening and then quite suddenly fleur de lys slid backwards that settles that he said we obviously arent going to get any further he cut the engines went out on deck and climbed on top of the wheelhouse the reeds were very thick at this point but to the left was a small lagoon circular in shape and perhaps a hundred feet in diameter he pointed to it as guyon scrambled up beside him our one chance he jumped to the deck went into the wheelhouse and started the engines as they rumbled into life he spun the wheel and crashed the boat into the reeds as she gathered speed for a moment they seemed an impenetrable barrier and then they slowly parted and fleur de lys passed through into the lagoon mallory cut the engines and she moved slowly to the far end and came to a halt her prow grounding gently against a sandbank no time to waste he said one of us stays with the boat the other goes for granville and his wife that had better be me guyon said we have mutual acquaintances i think he would trust me mallory pulled the chart forward youll do better by going on foot and swimming the intervening channels he opened a drawer and produced a pocket compass keep due west and you cant miss the central island about a quarter of a mile away getting granville back here might be difficult guyon said hes an old man but used to these marshes thats why he comes here remember youll have to make out the best way you can mallory produced the revolver he had taken from the young sailor at the castle and held it out not much but better than nothing guyon pushed it into the pocket of his oilskin jacket and went out on deck quickly he jumped from the prow to the sandbank and plunged into the reeds mallory lit a cigarette and stood on deck in the quiet rain perhaps five minutes later he heard the sound of an outboard motor passing along the main channel it moved into the distance muffled by the fog and then there was only silence as guyon went through the reeds a curlew whistled hauntingly somewhere to the left and wildfowl called as they lifted from the water disturbed by his passing he came out on higher ground checked the compass and ran forward alone in a land of shining mudflats lonely creeks and everywhere the reeds he came to the end of solid ground and waded across a narrow creek his feet sinking into soft mud he could taste the salt on his lips and it stung his eyes painfully but he kept on moving pushing through the reeds into the grey shroud gradually the ground became firmer again until he was able to run across sand and coarse marshgrass a few moments later he stood on the banks of a shallow lake and the house loomed out of the fog on its island fifty yards away the evil scumcovered waters reached out to meet him as he moved forward and he took out the revolver and held it above his head it was not likely that the water would affect it but there was no point in taking chances it was surprisingly easy going the mud giving way to hard sand and he was soon moving up on to dry land again as he ran towards the singlestoreyed house a narrow wooden jetty loomed out of the fog and he paused abruptly no boat was moored there not even a marsh punt he stood there a frown on his face considering the fact then turned and went towards the house he could smell wood smoke and saw it lifting in a blue tracer from the rough stone chimney he went up rickety wooden steps to the porch opened the door and went in the room was furnished simply but comfortably loose rugs scattered across the polished wooden floor there were several bookcases all filled a sofa and two easy chairs in front of the fireplace logs smouldered fitfully on the stone hearth heavily banked with ashes that they might not burn too quickly they told guyon all he needed to know henri granville and his wife were not there but then they should have always counted on that as a possibility ornithology was the old mans great hobby he had even written a book on the subject it was quite obvious that at this moment he and his wife were sitting in their boat somewhere among the reeds which covered so many square miles of the marshes probably even in some birdhide since dawn taking photos he moved outside and went down to the jetty faintly through the mist came the sound of an outboard motor jacaud and his men for them the solution would be obvious they would simply wait for granville to put in an appearance no need even to go looking for him there was only one answer to the problem and guyon waded into the lake and pushed towards the other side he moved up on to high ground and ran along the shore towards the sound of the motor in spite of the clammy cold of the marshes sweat trickled from feelings armpits ever since that first moment of shock when fleur de lys had passed them in the mouth of the estuary he had felt sick and frightened and then de beaumonts message over the radio the mind numbing as the operator decoded it the message was quite plain under the circumstances they were to return at once but that hadnt been good enough for jacaud he had insisted on going on into the marsh and fenelon had wilted under his cold fury the reeds lifted like pale ghosts on either hand the only sound the steady rattle of the outboard motor he sat in the stern at the tiller two sailors in the centre with rifles jacaud sat on the edge of the rounded prow his submachinegun slung around his neck as he gazed into the fog like some great bird of prey he turned his granite brutal face running with moisture we must be almost there cut the motor well start paddling youre wasting your time jacaud guyon called gaily i beat you to it by now henri granville and his wife are well on their way out of here as the dinghy drifted forward a sandbank reached out from the reeds like a pointing finger guyon stood on a small hillock at the far end his hand swung up and he fired twice one of the sailors groaned and went over the side still clutching his rifle jacaud slipped the submachinegun over his head it came up in a long stuttering burst of fire slicing through the reeds he was too late guyon had disappeared like a ghost into the fog he laughed mockingly somewhere near at hand and then there was silence the remaining sailor leaned over the side to pull in his comrade jacaud turned and struck up his arm leave him we havent time the sailor recoiled from the killing fury the devils face that confronted him the curious thing was that when jacaud spoke his voice was quite calm back to lalouette and give that motor everything its got mallorys got to return to lie de roc hes no choice his girlfriends still there if were lucky we can catch them on their way out to sea to mallory the rattle of gunfire in the distance was like a physical blow and he walked the deck in impotent fury hoping desperately that whatever had gone wrong guyon had been able to handle it perhaps ten minutes later he heard the sound of the outboard motor returning along the creek he stood very still one foot on the rail listening as it passed downstream he clambered on top of the wheelhouse and looked towards the west straining into the fog it was a good fifteen minutes before he heard the sound of brent geese calling bitterly as they lifted from the reeds as the beating of their wings subsided he was aware of movement towards the left he took a chance cupped his hands and called raoul over here a couple of minutes later guyon emerged from the fog and stumbled across the sandbank mallory ran to the prow and hauled him on board guyon was soaked to the skin and bitterly cold his face pale and drawn have they passed yet mallory nodded what happened guyon explained briefly shivering repeatedly as the wind cut through his damp clothes what do we do now get to hell out of here and fast mallory said unless im very much mistaken jacaud will wait for us at the estuary if we can get down there fast enough we might stand a chance of getting out to sea before theyre ready and back to lie de roc thats the general idea youd better go below find yourself some dry clothes and a drink ill get things moving up here he went into the wheelhouse and started the engines when he put them into reverse fleur de lys parted easily from the soft mud and he swung the wheel hard over bringing her prow round until she pointed towards the wall of reeds that barred them from the creek he took her forward with a burst of speed repeating his earlier manoeuvre once again it proved successful the reeds parted protestingly and the boat burst into the creek he turned the wheel to starboard and she swung round grazing the mud of the opposite bank he took her downstream slowly the engines a murmur in the rain guyon came up from the saloon wearing khaki slacks rubber boots and a heavy white sweater with a turtle collar in one hand he carried a bottle of brandy in the other a tin mug how do you feel mallory said guyon grinned and held up the brandy how would you expect its gourvoisier like some i certainly would mallory took the brandy down in two quick gulps as a warm glow started to seep through his entire body he took out the packet of gauloise that marcel had given them and threw them to guyon better have one while the goings good things might get pretty warm within the next ten minutes he took one himself and opened the window of the wheelhouse rain kicked into his face and there was a slight wind blowing in from the sea across the marshes lifting the fog into weird shapes visibility was down to thirty or forty yards but the reeds were beginning to drop back and the channel widened perceptibly the water lifted in long swelling ripples and waves kicked against the bottom of the boat they were almost there now and as a curving sandbank appeared a few yards to port he cut the engines and the current carried them in there was a slight shudder and they stopped whats the idea guyon asked id like to know what the opposition are up to you stay here i shanty be long mallory jumped to the sandbank landing kneedeep in water waded out and followed its length into the fog until he could no longer see fleur de lys a few minutes later he stood at the end water splashing in across the sand and looked out towards he de yeu there was no sign of lalouette and he turned and ran back the way he had come splashing through the shallows as the tide began to lift over the sandbank fleur de lys was already swinging out into the deepening channel and he took guymons proffered hand and scrambled over the rail not a sign of them as far as im concerned im going to give her everything shes got and head out to sea theyll have to come up with something pretty good to stop us he went into the wheelhouse started the engines and reversed into the channel visibility was becoming rather better as the fog lifted and fleur de lys roared down the centre of the channel her bow wave surging across the water on either side the mouth of the estuary appeared clear and open to the sea and mallory swung the wheel to port to negotiate the great sandbank fifty yards beyond the entrance as they turned the point the current pushing against them they found lalouette waiting jacaud was in the conning tower a heavy machinegun mounted on a swivel pin the moment they came into view he started to fire bullets swept across the deck and mallory ducked as glass shattered in the wheelhouse guyon crouched in the doorway resting the revolver across one raised arm trying for a steady shot but it was impossible as bullets hammered into their hull mallory spun the wheel and the young frenchman lost his balance it was the fog which saved them a long solid bank rolling in across the reef before the wind and it swallowed them in an instant guyon picked himself up and stood listening to the impotent chatter of the machinegun as jacaud continued to fire after a while there was silence he turned to face mallory his breath easing out in a long sigh id say that called for another drink as they emerged from the fogbank mallory took them out to sea giving the engines full power he turned with a grin nothing wrong there thank god guyon went into the saloon and returned with the courvoisier hes made one hell of a mess down there holes all over the place i dont think de beaumont will be pleased mallory swallowed some of his brandy and lit a cigarette well find out about that soon enough guyon went into the saloon and mallory inhaled deeply on his cigarette with a conscious pleasure everything was going to be all right he was certain of that sometimes one got these feelings the wind had freshened even more and spray spattered against the shattered windows of the wheelhouse he pulled down the helmsmans seat and sat some time later guyon came in with sandwiches and hot coffee and mallory switched to the automatic pilot want me to take over guyon asked mallory shook his head in these conditions it should only take us two hours at the most to get there it was perhaps half an hour later that he became aware that they were slowing perceptibly his attempts to adjust the controls met with no success and he switched to automatic pilot and went below guyon was lying on one of the saloon divans his head on his hands eyes closed as mallory entered he opened them and sat up whats wrong god knows mallory said but were losing speed badly and she isnt answering to the wheel like she should the fleur de lys heeled to starboard and there was a great rushing of water beneath their feet he dropped to one knee pulled back the carpet and peered inside when he looked up his face was grave there must be two dozen bullet holes along the waterline were leaking like a sieve no wonder the damned things slowed down they went on deck quickly and into the wheelhouse the electric pump was housed in a cupboard in one corner and the condition of the doors splintered by bullets told him what he would find he surveyed the smashed and twisted metal briefly then turned his face grim youll find a handpump aft of the main engine housing do the best you can with that stick it as long as you can and ill spell you i see raoul guyon said things look bad eh only if lalouette catches us in this condition mallory said grimly guyon moved out along the deck without a word and a moment later mallory became aware of the harsh rhythmic clangour of the handpump he looked out of the window at the brownishwhite stream of water gushing across the deck took over the wheel and waited for fleur de lys to lighten chapter sixteen sea fury when fenelon first caught sight of fleur de lys his mind froze refusing to accept for the moment what he knew to be an impossibility the graticules misted over temporarily obscured by a wave and he raised the periscope a little more fleur de lys jumped into view her familiar lines quite unmistakable he said quickly to the rating at his side fetch monsieur jacaud here tell him to hurry jacaud arrived a few moments later whats going on take a look the big man gripped the handles of the periscope tightly and lowered his head when he turned to look at fenelon a muscle twitched in his right cheek i wonder what went wrong fenelon shrugged perhaps you damaged her engines with the machinegun or even holed her does it matter shall i surface we should be able to board her with very little trouble jacaud shook his head and something glowed in the cold eyes ive got a better idea remember the kontoroyou said that one torpedo was all it would take lets see what you can do fenelon felt the blood surge to his temples and his heart pounded wildly my god its perfect they wont even know what hit them i dont mind that jacaud said as long as theres nothing left afterwards lalouette carried two twentyoneinch torpedoes both mounted in the bow fenelon took a deep breath pulled himself together and started to issue firm crisp orders enemys bearing onetwofive course onethreeone speed six knots range one thousand five hundred these facts fed into a complicated electrical device provided the angle of deflection enabling the torpedoes to be aimed the right distance ahead of the target so that both should arrive in the same place at the same time a moment later the petty officer called deflection onethree degrees right sir fenelon raised the periscope handles his face pressed to the rubber eyepiece stand by both tubes both tubes ready sir fenelon could feel the sweat trickling down his face and his heart seemed to leap inside him so often he had heard of this moment had it described to him by men who knew but for him this was the first stand by to fire fleur de lys seemed to leap into focus every line of her clear and clean his hands tightened on the handles fire one the submarine lurched as the missile shot away and the hydrophone operator reported torpedo running fire two again the submarine shuddered torpedo running fenelon turned to jacaud care to watch the big man pushed him roughly to one side and bent to the handles on board fleur de lys guyon still sweated at the pump and the boat ran on the automatic pilot in control while mallory stood on top of the wheelhouse and swept the sea with a pair of glasses that lalouettes would catch up with them now was certain they were making no more than six knots and barely holding back the water submerged the submarine had three or four knots on them they were well out of the main shipping lane he knew that their only hope was the chance of an odd fishing boat putting in an appearance hardly likely considering the weather he swung the glasses again in a wide arc and stiffened as something lifted out of the water to starboard it was a periscope the telltale bow wave giving it away and then he saw the great surging streak of foam boiling under the surface of the water as it ran towards them torpedo he cried and jumped to the deck losing his balance and rolling over he picked himself up scrambled into the wheelhouse and grabbed for the wheel he spun it round desperately and slowly she started to turn guyon appeared beside him adding his weight shoving the wheel over and then a great swell rolling in from the west gave them the final push mallory left guyon at the wheel and rushed to the rail he was just in time to see the wash of the torpedo passing to starboard a few seconds later it was followed by the second in the submarine jacaud gave a growl of rage turned and grabbed fenelon by the jacket you missed damn you you missed but thats impossible fenelon bent to the periscope and jacaud pulled him away from now on im giving the orders take her in close and surface im going to finish mr bloody mallory off personally on the fleur de lys mallory was back at the wheel and guyon worked the pump furiously but it was no good the boat rolled heavily waves breaking across her prow the weight of the water inside holding her down lalouette had fired both her tubes and no additional torpedoes were carried by type xxiii submarines mallory knew that he looked out of the window watching the fog roll in again in patches there was no other vessel in sight and his heart sank under the circumstances jacauds next move seemed obvious somehow there was still a shock of surprise as the sea boiled in a great cauldron no more than fifty yards away and lalouette broke through to the surface even as the water still spilled from her plates jacaud appeared in the conning tower a rating came up beside him and they started to mount the heavy machinegun on its firingpin guyon stood in the doorway the revolver ready in his right hand now what i think thats obvious mallory said flatly if im going to go im taking him with me its been nice knowing you and you mon colonel raoul guyon drew himself together as if on parade an honour sir he moved along the deck to the prow and mallory swung the wheel and brought fleur de lys into the wind a moment later and she was bearing down on lalouette jacaud started to fire bullets hammering into the prow and mallory braced himself hands firm on the wheel guyon lay flat on the deck one arm around a stanchion waiting for the moment of impact there were two rounds left in the revolver and he was praying that at the last he might have the chance of putting them both into jacaud in the conning tower of lalouette jacaud still fired the machinegun raising it slightly aiming for mallory in the wheelhouse fenelon appeared beside him his face white and terrified mouth open in a soundless scream mallory was aware of all these things of the bullets hammering into the wheelhouse as he ducked out of sight and then fleur de lys was lifted high on a swell she seemed to poise there for a moment then slid down the other side into lalouette her prow grinding against the side of the conning tower where it joined the hull there was a terrible crash a groan of tortured metal as the bow crunched into the plates cutting through the ballast tanks crushing the pressure hull lalouette heeled the conning tower leaning over spilling the machinegun into the water and jacaud and fenelon hung on desperately guyon was on his feet leaning over the rail as he took aim and fired fleur de lys lurched to one side and he went head first into the sea fleur de lys kept on moving her steel hull sliding over the submarine pushing it down into the water suddenly she was across her prow plunging into a wave mallory got to his feet grabbed the wheel and struggled to bring her round incredibly she answered and lifted sluggishly over the swell her engines still beating he turned and looked out through the shattered windows at the submarine she had righted herself now but the sea was breaking over her hull in sinister fashion the forward hatch opened and several sailors emerged jacaud came down the outside ladder to join them they were pointing at something in the sea and mallory saw raoul guyon a swell lifting him up and carrying him in towards the submarine as he was washed across the grey hull they pounced on him there was nothing mallory could do and he kept on going passing into the fog when he glanced back five minutes later lalouette was lost to view gradually the engines lost power and progress became slower the fog was very patchy blown by a strengthening wind and in the distance he could see lie de roc low on the horizon the engines stopped altogether five minutes later with a hiss of steam he went down into the flooded saloon found the bottle of gourvoisier and went back on deck the fog had cleared even more now but the wind was cold and the waves were lifting again he unshipped the dinghy and waited until the green waters started to slop across the deck then he slid it over the stern and climbed in he rowed away paused and watched fleur de lys slide under the surface the water boiled for a little while then calmed into a great white patch of froth a coil of rope a box and one or two loose spars floating in the centre it was always a saddening sight the loss of a good ship he inflated his lifejacket raised the bottle of gourvoisier to his lips and started to row lalouette drifted low in the water her powerful diesels still working pushing her towards the island progress was agonisingly slow and in the conning tower jacaud waited a cigarette in his mouth watching the island grow nearer in the gathering dusk below things were bad and getting worse every minute the crew worked kneedeep in water and it took the petty officer all his time to keep them under control fenelon lay on the bunk in his tiny cabin lips moving soundlessly as he stared up at the bulkhead he shivered as if he had the ague and when someone attempted to speak to him he gazed at the man with vacant eyes guyon lay huddled in a corner of the conningtower bridge blood oozing from a nasty gash in his forehead knocked insensible by jacaud the moment they had hauled him from the sea jacaud stirred him with his boot wondering exactly how he was going to kill him it would have been easy to leave him in the sea or even to put a bullet through his head the moment they hauled him aboard but that would have been too simple guyon deserved something special he was a traitor and had been all along the line the throb of the diesels faltered and stopped and in the silence which followed there was a startled cry from inside the submarine the forward hatch opened and the crew poured out they brought with them several inflatable dinghies including the one with the outboard motor which jacaud had used in the marshes jacaud picked guyon up slung him over one shoulder with easy strength and went down the ladder he walked along the hull and paused a couple of yards away from the frightened sailors they were no more than a quarter of a mile from the great reef which linked lie de roc and st pierre the tide carrying them in jacaud did not intend to wait and see what happened to lalouette when she was pounded across those terrible rocks he nodded to the petty officer im taking the one with the outboard motor youre coming with me there was a chorus of startled cries from the men and one of them rushed forward why you why not us jacaud took a liiger from his pocket and shot the man twice in the chest the bullets knocking him into the water there was a sudden silence and they all crowded back a few moments later the largest dinghy was moving away the petty officer in the stern operating the outboard motor jacaud sat in the prow facing him and guyon sprawled in the bottom the power of the current was already swinging the doomed submarine in towards the reef and there was a confused shouting on deck one by one the men crowded into the remaining dinghies and the current immediately swept them away below in lalouette fenelon lay in his cabin forgotten by everyone it was only when the water reached his bunk that he came to his senses he sat up stared down at it for a moment then suddenly seemed to come to life he moved outside and started forward at that moment the lights went out he screamed as darkness enfolded him and started to feel his way along desperately as he reached the control room light streaming in through the open conning tower water started to cascade down the ladder and the whole world seemed to turn upside down he was aware of the crash the rending of the metal plates and then a green cascade mercifully engulfed him the sea swung lalouette in across the reef for a brief moment she poised on the edge then plunged down into the darkness of the middle passage chapter seventeen the run to the island the oars dipped and rose and mallory pulled with all his strength but his arms were tired and already there was a blister in one palm from a splinter in the rough handles it was more than an hour since fleur de lys had gone down and he had rowed steadily for most of that time making little progress the fog still hung low over the water in long wraithlike patches on one occasion he seemed to hear a faint cry when he looked back there was a brief flash of yellow on top of a wave as one of the submarines rubber dinghies was swept out to sea after a while he stopped and rested on the oais lie de roc was still half a mile away and it was quite obvious that the run of the tide was sweeping him on a parallel course with the island that would eventually take him out to sea even if he fetched up in the steamer lane that ran upchannel from ushant it would be dark in another hour he was under no illusions about his ability to survive a night in the channel in such a frail craft there were two good doubles left in the bottle of courvoisier he took them down slowly and tossed the empty bottle into the sea as a thin rain drifted down on the wind he reached for the oars and started to row again the freshening wind dispelled the last traces of fog and an ugly chop formed on the water he pulled steadily staring into the gathering twilight his mind a blank everything he had of brain and muscle concentrated on his impossible task when he paused twenty minutes later and looked over his shoulder he saw to his astonishment that he was now quite close to the island there was a slapping sound against the keel of the dinghy and it swung round swirling past a long finger of rock moving in fast caught by some inshore current he bent to the oars with renewed vigour forgetting the pain in his right hand the blood that dripped steadily down the current helped carrying him closer inshore every minute the waves were higher now as they pounded in over the rocks and water started to slop across the dinghys stern he heaved on the oars trying to keep her head round but it was too much for him he let them go knelt in the bottom and waited holding on with both hands the cliffs were very close now the surf white as it crashed in across the narrow beach breaking over ledges of rock behind mallory a great heaving swell rolled in gathering momentum sweeping him in before it a sudden rending crash jarred his spine water foamed around spray lifting high into the air the dinghy ground forward across jagged rocks her boards splintering and came to a halt the prow wedged into a crevasse mallory hung on and as the sea receded with a great sucking noise he scrambled out of the dinghy and stumbled across the final line of rocks a moment later he was safe on the strip of beach at the base of the cliffs he sat down holding his head in his hands and the world spun away the taste of the sea was in his throat and he retched bringing up a quantity of saltwater after a while he got to his feet and turned to examine the cliffs behind they were no more than seventy or eighty feet high and sloped gently backwards cracked and fissured by great gullies it was an easy enough climb and he scrambled over the edge a few minutes later and turned to look out to sea the fog had disappeared completely now but darkness was falling fast and the moon was already rising above the horizon he hurried through the wet grass following the slope in a gentle curve that brought him over the edge of the hill ten minutes later on the far side of the harbour from the grants house the cove looked strangely deserted no smoke rising from the chimney of the hotel he was aware of guymons launch of the shooting brake tilted against a rock the long skidmarks trailing back up the grassy slope to the road he went down the slope on the run he walked round to the front of the hotel calling loudly without receiving any reply when he opened the door and stepped into the bar he was already prepared for something out of the ordinary some evidence of a struggle at least jagbir and juliette vincente still crouched together by the bar a pool of dried blood spreading into the rush matting it was very quiet too quiet and for a moment mallory seemed to hear the sea roaring in his ears and there was an element of unreality to it all it was as if none of this were really happening and he turned and stumbled outside he wasted five minutes in going down to the jetty in the forlorn hope that guymons launch might be seaworthy it was almost completely dark when he breasted the hill and trotted towards the grants house he went in through the kitchen and quiet enveloped him that strange secret stillness a house wraps about itself when no one is there and an overwhelming loneliness surged through him he spoke aloud his voice hoarse and broken anne but only the house listened to him and the quiet ones he stumbled into the sittingroom opened the cabinet and poured himself a brandy he stood there sipping it quietly remembering her here by the fireside in the soft lamplight a thousand years ago the darkness seemed to move in on him with a strange whispering and he closed his eyes tightly fighting the panic the despair which rose inside him the moment passed he put down the glass and went out through the french windows the moon was clear and very bright stars strung away to the horizon when he topped the hill on the western side of the island st pierre and the castle were etched out of black cardboard breathtakingly beautiful like something from a childs fairytale beneath him the tide was already on the turn white water breaking across the great reef rocks thrusting their heads into the moonlight minute by minute the water would continue to drop until for one brief hour a jagged causeway linked the two islands one hour only and then the tide would come roaring in but there was no point in thinking about that such had been his haste since landing from the dinghy that he had not even had time to rid himself of his lifejacket he touched it mechanically moved along the cliffs till he came to a sloping ravine that slanted to the beach below and started down marcel unbolted the heavy door and de beaumont moved inside there was no window but the room was brightly illuminated by a naked bulb which hung from the centre of the low ceiling guyon and hamish grant sat on a couple of old packing cases talking in low tones they came to their feet the old man leaning on his walking stick guyon was very pale dark circles under his eyes and the gash on his forehead was red and angry it seems i must congratulate you captain guyon de beaumont said calmly guyon shook his head no need you were doomed from the beginning a pity you didnt realise that a few lives ago i wouldnt be too sure the game isnt over yet it will be the moment colonel mallory makes land and what if he doesnt from what i hear fleur de lys was in a sinking condition when last seen youre forgetting granville and his wife they must have contacted the authorities now the sands are running out de beaumont you were wrong from the start always have been we dont need you and your bullyboys to tell us how to govern france marcel took a step forward and de beaumont pushed him back let him go on a countrys greatness lies in the hearts of her people not in the size of her possessions and france is people in one way or another blood and suffering is all theyve been given since and theyve had enough but not you colonel you couldnt stop if you wanted to anything i have done i have done to the greater glory of france de beaumont said or the greater glory of philippe de beaumont which is it can you tell the difference have you ever been able to de beaumonts face seemed to sag and for the first time since guyon had known him he looked like an old man he turned and walked out marcel hesitated and then followed him the door closed and the bolts rasped into place quite a speech hamish grant said out of the long silence which followed accomplishing precisely nothing guyon said wearily and sat down his head in his hands worth hearing though the old man patted him gently on the shoulder resumed his seat and they waited de beaumont stood in front of the great glass window of the tower room and looked out over the sea far far to the west the rim of the ocean was tipped with orange fire he de roc dark against the sky the beauty of it was too much for a man and he opened the casement and inhaled the good salt air and out beyond the island the lights of a ship seemed very far away life was a series of beginnings and endings that much at least he had learned he remembered dienbienphu standing on the edge of a foxhole in the rain as the tricolour was hauled down and little yellow peasants from the rice fields had swarmed over the broken ground to take him and what was left of his men and then algeria years of bloodshed of death in the streets and death in the hills he had believed implicitly that the end justified the means but what if that end was never realised what if one were left only with the blood on the hands blood which had been shed to no purpose which could never be washed off he felt curiously sad and drained of all emotion a small wind moaned around the tower and then there was only the silence in that single moment the heart turned to ashes inside him looking out over the moonlit sea he knew with a bitter certainty that he had been wrong that in the final analysis all that he had done came to nothing that everything raoul guyon had said was true he walked to the fireplace and looked up at the old battle standard for a long moment he nodded as if coming to some secret hidden decision he picked up the telephone and pressed an extension button when the receiver was lifted at the other end he said briefly send up jacaud he replaced the phone moved across to a narrow door opened it and stepped into the small turret bedroom anne grant sat in a chair by the window fiona lay on the bed they got to their feet and faced him he bowed courteously and stood to one side if you would be so kind they hesitated perceptibly then brushed past him he closed the door moved to the fire and turned what have you done with my father fiona demanded there is no need to alarm yourself he will come to no harm i give you my word and raoul guyon de beaumont smiled faintly a great deal has taken place of which you are not aware captain guyon is at this moment with general grant except for a nasty cut on the head he seemed in fair condition when i saw him an hour ago you havent mentioned colonel mallory anne said carefully de beaumont shrugged all i can say with truth my dear is that at this precise moment i havent the slightest idea where he is there was a knock at the door it opened and jacaud entered he came forward and waited the cold eyes in the brutal animal face giving nothing away have foxhunter refueled and made ready for sea de beaumont said ive already seen to it are we leaving i should imagine it would be the sensible thing to do even if mallory hasnt managed a landfall yet granville must certainly be in touch with the french authorities by now admittedly they will then have to contact british intelligence but i shouldnt imagine it will be long before were faced with some sort of official delegation where are we going portugal perhaps you but not me jacaud philippe de beaumont extracted a cigarette from his case and fitted it carefully into his holder we leave in half an hour for jersey when you have landed me in st helier you are a free man you and the others may go where you please jacauds eyes narrowed jersey why would you want to go there because they possess a more than adequate airport my dear jacaud and an earlymorning flight to paris i intend to be on it you must be mad you couldnt walk ten yards along the champs elysees without somebody recognising you no need de beaumont said calmly you see i intend to place myself in the hands of the authorities for once jacauds iron composure was shattered give yourself up youd face certain execution that would be for the court to decide de beaumont shook his head ive been wrong jacaud we all have i thought i wanted what was best for france i see now that what i really wanted was what was best for me further bloodshed and violence would accomplish nothing the events of the past few days have taught me that and what about the women and the old man what do we do with them we can release them before we leave theyll be picked up before long and guyon him we will also leave rage erupted from jacauds mouth in a growl of anger ill see that one on his back if its the last thing i do on top of earth god in heaven i could have left him to drown sergeantmajor jacaud de beaumonts voice was like cold steel i have given you certain orders you will see that they are carried out understand for a dangerous moment the fire glimmered in jacauds eyes and then quite suddenly he subsided i beg the colonels pardon accepted release captain guyon and general grant and bring them up here we leave in half an hour jacaud opened the door and went out de beaumont sighed and said almost to himself twentythree years of blood and war too much for any man it was anne who answered him her face very pale before god colonel de beaumont i pity you he took her hand and kissed it gently then crossed to the door to the turret room and opened it perhaps you would wait in here they walked past him he closed the door and went to the fireplace he looked up at the standard for a long moment then sat down at his writing desk and picked up a pen marcel sat at the table in his tiny room a bottle of cognac in front of him he was reading an old magazine turning the pages slowly his mind elsewhere they should have been out of this place the moment jacaud had returned with the news of the loss of lalouette so much was obvious he wondered what de beaumont had wanted and raised his glass to his lips behind him the door crashed open and jacaud entered his face was white the skin drawn tightly over the prominent cheekbones and there was a strange smoky look in his eyes that made marcels flesh crawl what is it what happened up there jacaud grabbed the glass filled it with cognac and swallowed it down he wants us to take him to jersey from there he intends to fly to paris to hand himself over to the authorities he must be mad marcels face turned a sickly yellow colour are you going to let him am i hell if they get him they get all of us it would only be a matter of time what about the prisoners hes going to release them marcel jumped up in alarm weve got to get out of here this whole things going sour were getting out of here all right but on our own jacaud said just you and me everyone else can go to the devil but first ive got to settle with de beaumont he knows too much for his own good and guyon ill have to forgo that pleasure you take care of him and the old man ill see you on the jetty in fifteen minutes he went out and marcel raised the bottle of cognac to his lips swallowed deeply and tossed it into a corner it was quiet in the corridor and he moved quickly along to the end and paused outside a stout wooden door he took a revolver from his pocket and checked it quickly there were four rounds in the cylinder and he unbolted the door kicked it open and moved inside raoul guyon and general grant rose to meet him marcel closed the door behind him and moved forward you first captain he said and his hand swung up guyon flung himself to one side and the bullet chipped stone from the wall in the same moment hamish grant slashed at the light with his walking stick plunging the room into darkness marcel cried out sharply and fired twice he was aware of a shadow moving over towards the right in the splitsecond flash and fired twice again the second time the hammer clicked on an empty chamber he flung the useless weapon into the darkness with a sob and reached for the door there was the scrape of a foot behind him and a great arm slid around his neck he was aware of the pain of the relentless brute strength and struggled wildly hamish grant increased the pressure his fingers locked together like steel bands and the frenchman went limp the old man dropped him to the floor and said hoarsely raoul where are you there was a movement in the darkness beside him here general hamish grant put out a hand and touched him on the shoulder are you hit not a chance guyon said but lets get out of here we must find the girls the old man opened the door cautiously and walked into the passage something moved a dark shadow against the light he reached out a snarl rising in his throat and his wrists were gripped tightly a tired familiar voice said all right general its me chapter eighteen last round mallory struggled across a great slippery mass of rounded stones and paused on top of a natural escarpment he had never felt greater loneliness in his entire life on each side stretched the sea and before him clear in the moonlight the sinister twisted maze of jagged rocks and great boulders that made up the reef at high water the escarpment upon which he was now standing would be a good five fathoms deep and he moved on slipping and stumbling across a morass of slimy seaweed sinking up to his knees in places it had taken him threequarters of an hour to get halfway along the reef with each passing moment it became more and more apparent that unless he could increase his rate of progress the tide would sweep back in to pound him across these cruel rocks he came out on to a strip of wet sand shining in the moonlight and started to run for perhaps a hundred yards the sand held true and then petered out into gravel and broken stone he entered a forest of dark pointing fingers which lifted into the moonlight like some strange prehistoric monument and wasted ten minutes finding his way through as he struggled out along a shelving bank of seaweed he paused and looked down at moonlight shining on the waters of the middle passage it stretched before him a dark tunnel with at least twenty feet of headroom at low water the wind blowing in from the sea scattering spray in his face decided him at his present rate of progress he was certain to be caught there was only one remaining chance of beating the tide and he slid over theedge strangely enough when he entered the water he wasnt aware of the cold and his lifejacket worked perfectly he turned on to his back and started to swim using both arms in a powerful back stroke the passage was shadowy in the moonlight and very still and the sound of the sea outside seemed to come from another place he remembered what lay beneath him fathoms deep in the darkness and pushed the thought away concentrating all his strength on the task in hand it was perhaps fifteen minutes later that he became aware of a different note outside and spray foamed through the crannies above his head splashing across his face the waterlevel started to rise at once and with every passing minute the roof came nearer pie turned on his face and swam forward thrashing wildly with his feet a few moments later he came out into a jagged basin as a swell lifted him up he grabbed for a ledge and hauled himself out of the water the tide was already moving in licking hungrily at the rocks and far out to sea a flash of sheet lightning illuminated the sky he came to the end of the main body of the reef and before him a long thin spine of rock and gravel stretched three hundred yards to st pierre he started to run aware of the roaring of the sea hungry for him as she swept in to drown the land erupting with phosphorescence bluegreen lights dancing on the water dissolving as rapidly as they appeared to the right lightning flared again and a dark band of shadow moved across the sky snuffing out the stars he came to a long strip of shingle and started to run halfway across the sea splashed in kneedeep he struggled forward aware of its strength as it tugged at him it was already at his waist when he reached the sprawling mass of boulders heaped at the base of the island as his feet missed bottom he thrashed forward grabbed for a ledge and hauled himself out still the sea rose and he moved on aware only of the menace behind he skirted the base of the cliffs and finally reached a point of jagged rock no more than twenty feet from the entrance to the cave he jumped into the water and started to swim desperately but there was no need the tide swept him into the entrance on the crest of a great swell a moment later he bumped against the wall of the jetty at foxhunters stern he swam round to a flight of stone steps and climbed out of the water he was tired more tired than he had ever been in his life and the roaring of the sea seemed to have got inside his head he pulled off his lifejacket padded across the jetty and went up the steps keeping to the wall when he reached the landing all was quiet he opened the door cautiously and moved forward there were three doors on this section of the corridor all leading to rooms used as quarters by lalouettes crew he searched them quickly hoping for a weapon but found nothing as he emerged from the last he heard the muffled reports of several gunshots fired close at hand he stood listening intently another shot sounded he went along the passage every sense alert and paused at the end behind him a door opened he whirled round hands coming up and hamish grant stepped into the light the great hall was a place of shadows no fire burned in the hearth and a single light at the far end gave the only illumination mallory moved out of the doorway and stood listening but there was no sound and he moved forward followed by guyon and hamish grant there was a small lamp bracketed to the wall of the gallery and for some reason it seemed to grow dimmer as he went upstairs he paused swaying a little and guymons anxious voice seemed to come from a great distance are you all right mallory opened his eyes nodded and moved on putting one foot in front of the other mechanically it was only when they reached the door to the tower and he pushed it open that he realised how exhausted he was there was no strength left in him at all guyon and the old man crowded into the narrow hall and mallory bolted the door whatever happens now no one else gets in he said and the words seemed to be spoken by someone else he took a deep breath summoning together every final resource of body and mind and led the way up the stairs the walls spiraled round the night sky gleaming through the slotted windows and somewhere thunder rumbled menacingly when they emerged on the first landing the door to the radio room stood open and there was no one there mallory moved across to the set and switched it on there was a faint crackling of static he picked up the microphone and high in the tower three shots were fired in rapid succession a moment later fiona grant screamed jacaud paused on the landing took the liiger from the pocket of his reefer coat and removed the clip it was by no means full he could tell that by the weight but there was no time to reload he slammed it back into the butt replaced the liiger in pocket and opened the door de beaumont was sitting at his desk writing his hair silver in the soft light he blotted the sheet of paper carefully put down his pen and looked up a frown appeared on his face whats happened jacaud where are general grant and guy on marcel is taking care of them now jacaud said calmly taking care of them i dont understand dont you my brave colonel jacaud laughed harshly did you really think id stand to one side and allow you to fly off to paris to play le grand seigneur a de beaumont to the end how dare you de beaumont said hoarsely for you its always been a game jacaud said a great and wonderful game with bugles blowing and standards flying in the breeze like some medieval setpiece thats the way youve lived and thats the way you want to die but not this time colonel theyll squeeze you so hard youll tell them everything thats ever happened to you since you were three years old unfortunately for you that includes me de beaumont grabbed a glass paperweight hurled it with all his force and reached for the handle of the drawer containing his revolver jacaud jumped to one side the paperweight smashing against the wall and fired the bullet caught de beaumont in the left shoulder spinning him round and jacaud fired again twice the impact driving de beaumont forward he clutched at the mantelpiece the linen material of his jacket bursting into flames and reached up towards the old battle standard he started to fall his fingers catching at the fringe and it fluttered down to cover him like a scarlet shroud the door of the turret room opened and anne and fiona grant appeared the young girl screamed once her hands going up to her face jacaud ignored them he walked slowly across the room and stood looking down at de beaumont a dazed expression in his eyes behind him the door swung open with a crash as he turned raoul guyon hurled himself forward jacauds first bullet chipped the wall beside the door his second caught guyon just above the left breast stopping him in his tracks guvon groaned and fell to one knee jacaud raised the liiger took careful aim and fired again as the hammer fell on an empty chamber anne grant flung herself forward grabbing at his arm he hit her backhanded slamming her against the wall and reached into his pocket for some spare rounds mallory seemed to fill the doorway the eyes dark shadows in a face that was lined with fatigue he started forward swaying slightly from side to side eyes never leaving jacaud no expression on his face a dead man walking jacaud dropped the liiger seized the heavy brass poker from the fireplace and weighed it in his hand a savage smile on his face come on he said come on you bastard mallory stood there hands hanging loosely at his sides fatigue washing over his face and jacaud sprang forward the brass poker swinging down gleaming in the lamplight to mallory that blow was like a branch swaying in the wind as the poker came down he grabbed for the wrist twisting the arm up and out to one side taut as a steel bar using the same terrible grip he had used on the jetty at southampton so long ago jacaud screamed dropping the poker and the muscles of his shoulder started to tear mallory reached for the wrist with his other hand and twisted it round and up again there was a tearing sound as muscle gave and jacaud screamed again still keeping that terrible hold in position mallory ran him head first across the room towards the great window it dissolved in a snowstorm of flying glass and jacaud dived into darkness his last cry swept away on the wind like some departing spirit raoul guyon was propped against fionas knee his face hollow with pain and hamish grant stood in the doorway when mallory turned blood on his face from the flying glass they were all looking towards him strangely he started to fall and strong arms caught him easing him down to the floor and he looked up at anne grant that dark dear face so full of love for him raoul he said hows raoul is it serious hes going to be fine there was something else something important he frowned desperately and then remembered the radio room downstairs we must call jersey there are three motor torpedo boats just waiting for the right signal its all right she said everythings all right well take care of it she pillowed his head against her breast her arms about him he turned into their softness the sound of the sea in his ears and slept harry patterson
