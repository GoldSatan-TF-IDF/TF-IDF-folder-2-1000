my life where life is more terrible than death it is then the truest valor to want to live thomas browne part one next to lieutenant abraham glitskys bed the telephone rang with a muted insistence a widower glitsky lived in an upper duplex unit with his youngest son orel and a housekeepernanny named rita during his wifes illness hed deadened the phones ringer so that it wouldnt wake anyone else in the house when as often occurred it rang in the middle of the night he located the source of the noise in the dark and picked up the receiver whispering hoarsely glitsky what surfacing slowly into consciousness he didnt really have to ask he was the head of san francisco s homicide detail when he got calls in the dead dark they did not tend to be salespeople inquiring about his satisfaction with his long distance service provider it was nearly two hours past midnight on monday the first day of february and the city had produced only two homicides thus far this year a slow month in spite of that glitsky spent no time ever wondering if his job was going to dry up the caller wasnt the police dispatcher but one of his inspectors ridley banks on his cell phone directly from the crime scene it wasnt standard procedure to call the lieutenant from the street so this homicide must have an unusual element though ridley spoke concisely with little inflection even in his groggy state glitsky detected urgency a downtown patrol car had seen some suspicious movement in maiden lane a walking street just off union square when the officers had hit their spotlight they flushed a man squatting over what looked like and turned out to be a body the suspect ran and the officers gave chase apparently drunk the man staggered into a fire hydrant fell in a heap and was apprehended cuffed now in the back seat of the squad car he had passed out awaiting his eventual trip to the jail guy appears to be one of our residentially challenged citizens ridley said drily john doe as we speak no id of course glitsky was almost awake the digital clock on the bedstand read not his own but he did have the wallet the victim had a wallet to this point glitsky had been imagining that this homicide was probably another incident in the continuing tragedy of san francisco s homeless wars where an increasingly violent population of bums had taken to beating and even killing each other over prime downtown begging turf certainly the union square location fitted that profile but if the current victim had a wallet worth stealing it lowered the odds that the person was a destitute vagrant taken from her purse yeah it was a woman yeah a pause we know her elaine wager what about her shes the stiff glitsky felt his head go light unaware of the action he moved his free hand over his heart and clutched at his breast the voice in the telephone might have continued for a moment but he didnt hear it abe you there yeah what i was just saying maybe you want to be down here its going to be crawling with media jackals by dawn or the first leak whichever comes first im there glitsky said give me fifteen but after the connection was broken he didnt move his one hand dug absently into the flesh over his heart the other gripped the telephone receiver he simply lay there staring sightlessly into the darkness around him when the phone started beeping loudly in his hand reminding him that it was still off the hook it brought him to abruptly now he hung up threw the covers to one side and swung himself up to a sitting position and stopped again elaine wager oh god please no he didnt know hed said it aloud didnt hear his own voice break elaine wager was the only daughter of loretta wager the charismatic africanamerican senator from california whod died a few years before elaine tonights victim had worked for a couple of years as an assistant district attorney in the hall of justice no one was supposed to know it but she was also glitskys daughter somehow hed gotten dressed made it to his car he was driving the streets dark nearly deserted no one knew as far as glitsky was aware not even elaine herself she believed that her biological father was her mothers much older husband dana wager white rich crooked and connected in fact when loretta had found out she was pregnant by glitsky she kept that fact to herself and pressed him to marry her he didnt understand the sudden rush and when he said he needed time to decide he was still in college after all with no job and no money loretta dumped him without a backward glance and made her move with wager the other man courting her with whom shed not yet slept for nearly thirty years the senator had kept her daughters paternity secret even and especially from the girls true father until finally a time came when she thought she could use the fact as a bargaining chip to get glitsky to agree that sometimes it was ok for a senator to commit murder that strategy hadnt worked abe and loretta had once been lovers true but now he was a cop in his bones and three years ago shed killed someone in his jurisdiction the knowledge that their past union had produced a daughter wasnt going to change what he had to do which was bring her to justice so when glitsky let her know he was going to expose her she decided she wasnt going to endure an arrest a highprofile trial and the loss of her national reputation at the time she was after all one of the most prominent and respected africanamerican women in the country she chose her own way out an accident with a gun in her mansion after that glitsky had never been able to bring himself to reveal the secret to his daughter why would she need the baggage he asked himself what good could it possibly do her to know and now suddenly it was forever too late hed followed her life of course the path her career had taken after she left the das office plugged into her mothers political connections shed gone into private practice with rand and jackman one of the citys premier law firms through the grapevine glitsky heard that shed gotten engaged to some doctor from tiburon shed recently been shortlisted for appointment to a judgeship she also taught moot court at hastings law school and donated her honorarium back to the scholarship fund she was going to be fine her life was going to work out on its own without any interference from him he could take pride from a distance privately savor her accomplishments she hadnt needed him as a father now she was beyond needing anything glitsky had himself tightly wound down hands in his pockets he walked almost the length of maiden lane maybe a hundred yards from where he had parked his car on stockton at the edge of union square the body lay at the other end twenty feet or so west of grant avenue a small gathering of authorities and onlookers had already appeared and glitsky used the walk to steel himself he saw a couple of black and white cruisers what he supposed were some cityissued vehicles and the coroners van parked at angles on the sidewalk and in the alley itself he heard his steps echoing the buildings were close on either side of him halfway down the lane he suddenly stopped took a deep breath and let it out he was surprised to see the vapor come from his mouth he wouldnt have said it was that cold he wasnt feeling anything physical casting his eyes up for a moment over the buildings that rose all around him he noticed the starstudded sky here between the buildings it was full night the filigreed streetlights four of them two on each side glowed the street had that glassy wet look favored by cinematographers although the asphalt itself was dry a figure separated itself from the group and began walking toward him it was ridley banks after hed closed to within fifteen feet he stopped perhaps catching the keep away vibe that his lieutenant projected and waited until the two men were side by side glitskys usual style was all business in any event and today it served him particularly well whatve we got he asked tersely about as clean as it gets abe we got a body a shooter a weapon and a motive and whats that the motive they were still standing off a ways from the knot that had formed around the body banks kept his voice low robbery he took her purse the watch a gold chain glitsky was moving forward again hed made it down from his duplex to the scene in only a bit more time than it had taken the techs and now just as he came up to the main knot surrounding the body one of the cars searchlights strafed the lane reflexively glitsky put a hand up against the light pressed himself forward went down to a knee by the fallen body it lay on its right side stretched out along the pavement in an attitude of sleep it struck glitsky that whoever had shot her had laid her down gently he saw no blood at first glance the face was unmarked eyes closed hed come to love that face thered been a picture of her in the chronicle in the past year and hed cut it out and stuck it in the bottom of the junk drawer of his desk two or three times hed closed and locked the door to his office taken it out and just looked at her seeing her mother in her face seeing himself in recent months hed told himself it was possible that if they came to know about each other it wouldnt be baggage after all but a source of something else connection maybe he didnt know he wasnt good at that stuff but the feeling had been building and hed come close to deciding that he would tell her see where it took them the body was clad in an elegant overcoat still buttoned to the neck blue or black in color it looked expensive with its furtrimmed collar red satin lining one black pump had come off her left foot and lay on its side pathetically in the gutter she was wearing black hosiery and again there was no sign that it had snarled or that the nylon had run when shed gone down under the overcoat glitsky saw a couple of inches of what appeared to be a blue or black skirt with white pinstripes the lack of blood nagged glitsky stood moved around to her back side studying the pavement ridley was a step behind him and anticipated his question he handed the lieutenant a ziploc bag which held an almost impossibly small handgun one shot at the hairline in back close contact up into the brain no exit wound glitsky opened the bag and looked inside put his nose against the opening and smelled the cordite he recognized the weapon as a north american arms fiveshot revolver perhaps the smallest commerciallymade weapon in america it was most commonly worn as a belt buckle out in the open so small it did not seem possible that it could be a real gun it weighed less than ten ounces and fitted easily in the palm of his hand ridley was going on with his descriptions and theories and glitsky ached to tell him to shut up but he wasnt going to give anything away and he didnt trust himself to utter a word instead he left it to his body language zipping up the plastic that held the gun he gave it to banks without comment and moved off hands in his pockets the message was clear glitsky was concentrating thinking memorizing the scene disturb him at your peril ridley hung back with the body after a minute he started giving directions to the techs twenty minutes later they had triangulated the body in high beams and the alley had taken on an unnatural brilliance the crime scene people had set up a cordon of yellow tape uniformed officers black and white police cars all of them conspiring to block unauthorized access to maiden lane although due to the hour that wasnt yet much of an issue still half a dozen police radios crackled the first news team had arrived a van and its crew from a local television station and the negotiations over access to the scene between the perky aggressive newscaster and the supervising sergeant tempted glitsky to take out his gun and shoot somebody instead he accompanied ridley banks to the squad car and the officers who had discovered the body and apprehended the suspect two uniformed men exited the vehicle from both front doors at the same time introducing themselves as medrano and petrie that the shooter glitsky asked pointing to the backseat where the suspect sat propped against the side door slumped over i think ill talk to him the two officers exchanged a glance and a shrug the older officer medrano replied you can try sir but he hasnt moved in an hour drunk at least that and plenty of it the other uniform petrie hesitated for an instant then continued also appears to be mainlining something tracks up his arms hes gonna need some detox time glitsky received this not entirely surprising news in silence then he nodded and walked around to the other side of the squad car where the suspect leaned heavily against the door and pulled it open quickly with his hands cuffed behind him the man fell sideways out onto the pavement his feet stayed up in the car while his head hit the asphalt with a thick hollow sound the man moaned once and rolled over onto his back sounds like hes coming aroundglitsky said ridley banks pulled a toot sweet around the front of the car and got himself standing between his lieutenant and the lights at the head of the alley thered been so many accusation of police brutality lately that the media were watching for it at every opportunity and now his lieutenant was giving them something ridley motioned with his head a warning then spoke in a whisper cameras abe heads up glitsky was all innocence what the poor guy fell the suspect lay unmoving at his feet he hadnt moved after the first rollover the lieutenant looked over the hood of the squad car to medrano and petrie take this garbage to the detail until he wakes up petrie looked at his partner again neither of them had ever met glitsky before and he was making an impressionhe wasnt one your touchyfeely modern law enforcement community facilitators the younger officer cleared his throat and glitsky glared what petrie swallowed finally got it out the detail sir what about it medrano took over the guy looks good for medical eval lieutenant we were thinking wed show him to the paramedics glitsky knew that this meant the suspect would probably wind up going to the hospital where there were secure rooms for jail inmates who needed medical care this prospect didnt much appeal to him what for medrano shrugged it wasnt that he cared personally but the lieutenants suggestion ran counter to the protocol he wanted to cover himself get him cleared before we take him anywhere maybe start detox before he goes into withdrawal glitsky had a deep and ancient scar that ran across his mouth and now with his lips pursed it burned as a whitish gash under the hawk nose the jutting chin glitskys mother had been africanamerican his father jewishhis visage was dark intense hooded how do we know he needs medical care medrano risked a glance to where the suspect slumped against the door in the backseat he was at best semiconscious filthy still bleeding from where his head had hit the pavement we dont sir but the paramedics are here to be safe glitsky cut medrano off hes just drunk i want him in homicide you bring him up thats the end of this discussion petrie and medrano looked at one another and said nothing they were too intimidated to do anything but nod get the man back into the car and start the drive down to the hall of justice ridley banks bit his tongue glitsky was putting out the word that he intended to let this suspect get all the way into withdrawal before he would acknowledge any problem this would ensure that the man endured at least a little of what was purportedly the worst known hell on earth and the orders struck ridley as gratuitously cruel more they werent smart neither was the earlier dooropening incident he knew that if the suspect was in withdrawal from heroin the paramedics and people at county could set him up in short order then the agony of withdrawal could be mitigated theyd get a better statement from a setup suspect at san francisco general hospital than they ever could from a sick sweating junkie in withdrawal at the hall of justice if he was merely drunk he could be in a cell at the jail by midmorning either way they would have a clean interrogation within a reasonable period of time glitskys orders wouldnt accomplish anything good as he watched the squad car backing out of maiden lane ridley wondered what else might be going on he and abe had both known elaine wager worked with her when shed been a highprofile rising young star with the district attorneys office ridley himself had found his guts more than ordinarily roiling at the scene when he realized the womans identity she was one of their own part not only of the law enforcement but also of the africanamerican community even to ridley whose job was homicide on some level it hurt abes reaction though seemed a long march beyond hurt ridley had come to know most of his lieutenants moods which generally ran the gamut from grumpy to glum but hed never before seen him as he was tonight in a clear and quiet unreasonable rage breaking his own sacred rules about prisoners and regulations walking back to where the body lay the knot of people bunched in the mouth of the alley ridley decided to risk a question you all right abe the lieutenant abruptly stopped walking his nostrils flared under piercing eyes ridley thought of a panicked horse abe let out a long breath took in another one looked down toward the body yeah sure he said why not a pause fucking peachy abe made it a point to avoid vulgarity hed even lectured his inspectors decrying their casual use of profanity his troops had been known to make fun of him for it behind his back so ridley was surprised and his face must have shown it the lieutenants eyes narrowed you got a problem ridley no sir he replied whatever it was it was serious no problem at all on that same day monday february at a little after five oclock in the afternoon dismas hardy placed a call to another san francisco attorney he put his feet up on his desk and listened to the phone ring was transferred to voice mail heard the beep mr logan he began this is dismas hardy again if youre keeping track this is my fourth call id really appreciate a callback same number i left the other three times hanging up hardy stewed for thirty seconds then stood and walked out of his office on the top floor of the freeman building on sutter street in downtown san francisco his was the only office on the top floor and he had decided to take the stairs to the lobby a floor below him hardy leased his office directly from david freeman and was the only attorney in the building who did not work for freemans firm his landlord was pushing seventy he was short almost fat always slovenly dressed his greatest female admirers and he had several would concede that he had a prodigious nearly mythic ugliness unkempt hair eyebrows of white steel wool a turnip nose scarred by rosacea and alcohol hanging jowls liverish lips but he had a great if unorthodox personal charm and no one disputed that freeman was a brilliant lawyer who lived for his work with mel bellis passing he had assumed the mantle of most famous attorney in the city the receptionists station commanded the center of the lobby at the phones phyllis an attractive elderly witch with whom hardy had an offagain offyetagain relationship was handling what appeared to be several calls at once hardy sauntered casually past her station he even nodded genially as he took a few extra steps toward the long hallway that housed the tiny airless cubicles of the firms associates it was all an elaborate ruse his intention was to go and interrupt freeman without having to explain himself to the keeper of his gate and for an instant even as he hung a hard left and strode toward the great mans door he thought he would make it unmolested but it was not to be hes busy mr hardy hes not to be disturbed hardy stopped phyllis was facing the other way how could she have seen him further proof that she had a personal connection to the devil she could spin her head around in a full circle like the girl in the exorcist now she fixed him with favored visage no stern and unyielding he gave her back his winsome disarming irish smile pulled a de niro are you talking to me phones forgotten her body came around up and out of her chair in one fluid motion she was moving not toward hardy but directly to freemans door to all appearances ready to throw her body in front of it if need be to defend its inviolability hes trying to get a motion written he was very specific hardy kept his grin on inclined his head in the direction of the hallway where the associates toiled thats just to keep the kids from bothering him hell welcome some adult companionship watch striking like a snake hardy reached around the receptionist and rapped quickly twice on the door its open freeman bellowed from within come on in hardy stepped back spread his palms in a gesture that said see what did i tell you if hed have said go away id be gone promise he turned the knob and pushed at the door excuse me he said politely moving around her closing the door behind him pen in hand and a mangled cigar between his lips freeman squinted up over his yellow legal pad a thick bluish haze hung in the air hardy recognized the wine bottle by the telephone as a silver oak cabernet at least fifty bucks retail if you could find it the old man straightened up in his chair put the pen down and drained the last inch from his wine glass making appreciative smacking noises god drinks this stuff he said how does he afford it hardy crossed the room to the window and threw it open he enjoyed the occasional cigar himself but the smoke in the room was nearly suffocating and while were asking how questions how do you breathe in here freeman waved that off if you interrupted me on billable time to criticize my lifestyle you can use the same door you came in at otherwise get yourself a glass youve got to have a sip of this hanging by the window the afternoon breeze had picked up whipping down sutler pulling the smoke out hardy leaned against the sill as soon as enough of this clears to be able to taste it meanwhile ive got a great idea for a good time whats that we can fire phyllis right now itll be fun you realize that anybody wants to see you theyve got to mount a campaign thats what i pay her for he was pouring another glass for himself you got around her i notice keeps you sharp a slurping sip another sigh of appreciation so what else you didnt come to talk about phyllis no i came to talk about dash logan freeman frowned deeply what about him using the normal channels say the telephone i cant reach him i thought you might have an idea why do you want to one of my clients is getting sued by one of his clients there are also some criminal charges i thought id feel him out see where hes coming from freeman leaned back in his chair drew in a breath you want my advice forgo the conversation hell just lie to you id file the response and prepare to fight dirty still at the window hardy crossed his arms not exactly a ringing character endorsement read between the lines and it gets worse freeman shook his head in disgust the mans a disgrace diz personally and professionally if the bar had any teeth theyd have yanked his card years ago for what you name it malpractice bribery theft of client funds extortion perjury drug and alcohol abuse i cant believe you dont know him hardy shrugged ive heard stories sure but people tell stories about you too those are legends freeman corrected him logan well you know all the lawyer jokes most of em well they made them up about dash logan especially the one about the difference between a catfish and a lawyer ones a bottomdwelling scum sucker and the other ones a fish heres a hint logans not the fish you dont like him freeman chuckled but he wasnt amused i really believe theres good in a lot of people diz almost everybody almost he came forward in his chair again swirled his wine glass and took a mouthful talking about him almost sours this wine and that takes some doing hardy had taken a glass from the sideboard and held it out let a professional tell you how bad the sour is getting freeman picked up the bottle and poured what do you smell tobacco he held up a hand he was kidding then took a sip and his eyes lit up although i must admit theres a bit of wine in the aftertaste he crossed the room where he settled himself on the couch so if logan calls back ill tell you a story freeman pushed his chair away from his desk faced hardy and crossed one leg over the other he drank some wine fifteen years ago i got teamed with logan on a twodefendant murder case this was in the days before talking movies remember when we had a real da chris locke who would put people in jail from time to time also this is one of the few times in my illustrious career when i thought my client aaron washburn i still remember was mostly innocent maybe he was driving the car but thats all he was too young and too chicken to agree to be the wheel man for a hit in any case his main flaw was loyalty to the shooter logans client a real loser named latrone molyneux so anyway locke declares were going to have joint disposition of our two defendants either they both plead or they both go to trial but he needs fifteen years from my guy well i decide im going to trial one because my boy aaron didnt do it he wasnt the shooter and didnt know it was going to go down and even if he did they couldnt prove it and two because thats who i am im not taking my clients money and lots of it to plead em to half a lifetime in the joint and its not as though ive got to sink logans client remember my guy just says he was in the car the whole time and has no idea what happened somewhere in this recitation freeman had gotten to his feet reliving it again he paced the office door to window a caged bear all right now im working on my kids defense keeping my nogood colleague mr logan in the loop because you know thats what we do but i notice hes not making too many of our joint motion hearings hes got my witnesses spooked i hear rumors that hes actually scoring dope off some of these people the judge is getting pretty pissed off with delays and noshows and really awful paperwork but mostly old dash is walking the walk im giving him the benefit you know professional courtesy were taking this thing to trial and hes got to know what i know right then two weeks before were scheduled for jury selection guess what no dont ill tell you logan comes by here says hes decided hes going to plead latrone hes got his fee he doesnt have the time for a trial so as you might imagine things get a little hot between us i remind him he cant plead if im going to trial which im damn well going to do so he threatens me if i take it to trial latrone will rat out aaron say he was just standing around minding his own business when aaron drove up and asked him to go for a ride he latrone didnt know there was going to be a shooting it was aarons idea aaron was the shooter anyway long story short what could i do theyd probably both get life this way they both plead out fifteen years now you want to hear my favorite part that wasnt it no listen to this early on i decided it might be worth a try to get bail for these kids it was a shaky case first adult offense for both of them they werent leaving the jurisdiction anyway but dash logan wont go there gives me a line of shit about its too risky well alienate the judge itd be better to save any judicial favors for the trial the trial hah so he persuades me if i make the motion for my client he has to for his and that wont happen the judge will deny both so whats the point i give up hardy said what was the point the point freeman was nearly screaming now the point was he wanted to keep his boy latrone in jail you know why cause he was fucking latrones seventeenyearold girlfriend thats why well see hardy said at least he had a good reason but he was shaking his head and clucked in disapproval thats a pretty appalling story freeman was breathing heavily he went back to his desk and put himself on the outside of another inch of his wine then poured some more hes an appalling on the old mans desk the telephone buzzed he reached over and picked it up listened held it out to hardy its phyllis she says theres a woman out in the lobby asking to see you shes lying i dont have any appointments shes just trying to figure out a way to get me out of here return you to your blessed solitude i wonder does this guy dash logan need a receptionist freeman held up a finger listened some more dorothy elliot jeffs wife leaving his superb wine in its glass on the coffee table untouched except for that first sip hardy rocketed to his feet on his way to the door behind him he heard freeman telling phyllis hes on his way out right now dorothy greeted him with a nod an apologetic smile a few quiet words it was immediately obvious that something was terribly wrong her trademark cheerful spark was gone it was equally clear that she didnt want to discuss any part of whatever it was in the lobby the staircase was not wide and he let her lead the way following her he was struck by the stiffness of her carriage her wide shoulders back her arms hanging straight down at her sides one step at a time she was hiking a steep grade with a heavy pack at altitude it occurred to him that her husband jeff one of his friends and a chronicle columnist who suffered from multiple sclerosis might suddenly have died at the landing she stopped and he came up behind her put an arm on her shoulder she leaned into him for a second then he opened the door and they were in his office as he was closing the door she found her voice im so sorry to come barging in on you like this dismas i didnt know she lifted her hands dropped them her lip quivered sorrow or rage she set her jaw began again i dont know its all right he gave her a chance to continue and when it didnt seem she could he asked softly what dont you know is it jeff she shook her head no jeffs all right jeffs fine she blew out heavily hardy pulled a chair around and dorothy stared at it for a minute as though shed never seen one before finally with an air of gratitude she sat thank you she shook her head wearily i dont seem to know what to do i started to go by jeffs office but then i didnt want to interrupt him hes on deadline so i just found myself walking downtown and thought of you that you worked here actually i thought of you before before when before when i was at the homicide detail hardy found his desk and pushed himself back up onto it with a bedside manner smile he spoke quietly i dont think ive heard the homicide part yet dorothy maybe we want to start there why were you at the hall my brother did you hear about elaine wager being killed hardy said he did the news had depressed him not that hed been that close to elaine but he had known her had considered her one of the good guys they have arrested my brother for it hardy shook his head that cant be right dorothy i heard they pulled in some bum dorothys lips were pressed tightly together she nodded hes a heroin junkie my brother cole cole burgess not possible hardy thought flatly not possible dorothy elliot sitting in front of him was the picture of cornfed wholesomeness hed known her for over a decade since shed first begun dating jeff now they had three daughters and she still looked like a farm girl those big shoulders over a trim and strong body clear eyes the shade of bluebonnets a wash of freckles cascading over her nose onto her cheeks dorothy elliot was pretty smiling all the time welladjusted and happy there was no way hardy thought that this womans brother could be the lowlife animal that had shot elaine wager in the back of the head for some jewelry and the contents of her purse he sought some fitting response said he was sorry finally asked did your brother know her were they going out or something working together no nothing like that but the police are saying he was incoherent when they brought him in they couldnt even confirm who he was until this morning and when he finally could he called my mother which was of course no help and where is your mother jody dorothys expression was distilled disapproval she lives here in town now out in the haight with cole with cole so he wasnt homeless after all well that depends on your definition he wasnt with mom too often but she was there if he needed to crash he had a rentfree room she moved out here from home ohio to be near him another look of disgust to help him and she wasnt much of a help a snort but he called her from the hall anyway and then after she predictably flipped out and couldnt get anything done she called me what did she try to do a calm had gradually settled over her hands had come to rest in her lap shapely legs were crossed at the ankles there was no sign of her usual cheerfulness but her confidence was returning the topic was awful but she had facts to convey hes in heroin withdrawal diz he needs to be medicated she broke off and decided shed said enough about that anyway mom lost her credibility with the police in about ten seconds accusing everybody of trying to kill her son the poor lost little boy she paused again sighed heavily but he does need to get into a detox situation soon hardy matched her tone matteroffact they have programs in place for that as soon as they book him but she was shaking her head the police are saying cole is only drunk and theyre not through with him so youre saying he wasnt drunk probably that too she impatiently brushed some flaxen hair from her forehead but if he was desperate enough to mug somebody he was after cash for heroin that means probably he was already into withdrawal drinking to kill the pain with alcohol until he could score a silence settled finally hardy laced his fingers in his lap he had heard enough to know he really didnt want to be involved in this he liked jeff liked dorothy saw them socially three or four times a year and now dorothy wanted to hire him to defend the man whod killed one of his colleagues and though hed been successful in his three previous murder trials though hed gotten himself a reputation this time hardy wasnt interested hed known liked and admired elaine wager he had no desire to help her killer there were other lawyers who could live with defending dorothys brother a lot more easily than he could and they were welcome to do it but the longer they talked the more he would give her the impression of tacit acceptance in spite of that he couldnt resist the next question so what do you want me to do dorothy he needs to get into detox and i dont know the channels i need somebody theyll listen to who knows how to talk down there her eyes were telling him that she didnt like it any more than he did but it was family duty her heartland values wouldnt let her shirk it hardy told himself he wasnt agreeing to defend elaines killer hed see what he could do to get a suspect into detox he was helping a friend that was all another heartland value that he couldnt shirk it wasnt going to go beyond that hardy figured he could get the fastest results by going directly to the head of homicide who happened to be his best friend on the fourth floor of the hall of justice he exited the worlds slowest elevator and was looking at sarah evans a homicide inspector who was married to one of david freemans associates he and frannie would occasionally socialize with sarah and graham he considered her a friend and usually she greeted him warmly but today her look was guarded if youre here to see the lieutenant maybe you want to come back another day less than his usual bubbly self is he she just shook her head said good luck i warned you and pushed by him into the elevator so he was wondering as he walked the long hallway down to the homicide detail this was a spacious open area with grimy windows all along the back wall the twelve inspectors in the unit had their desks here most of them face to face with those of their partners the usual bureaucratic detritus cluttered up the workspace green and gray metal files a water cooler a coffee machine that from the look of it might have been joe dimaggios original mr coffee there was also the working stoplight which added a certain tone to hardys right as he entered the detail were three doors the two on either end led to interrogation rooms the one in the middle to the audiovisual controls room to his left the lieutenants office was a hundred square foot rectangle that some architectural wizard had carved out as an obvious afterthought glitskys door stopped him dead for many years there had been no door to glitskys office finally three years back after months of trying to cajole the bureaucracy into buying a door glitsky had had enough he came in himself on a weekend and hung one hed bought with his own money thereby admitting that he cared about it big mistake immediately glitskys prize door became an untapped bonanza for any psychologist who might want to study the effects of stress on otherwise normal people whose job it became to investigate murders after the first impressive flurry of graffiti and property damage in the weekend after hed hung it glitsky had made it a point of honor to refrain from comment or reaction no matter what his people did to it and they did plenty eventually the door had become a living testament to something profound and not particularly flattering about san franciscos homicide detail a large poster of bozo the clown with the international no symbol commanded the center of it but that was among the first and the mildest of desecrations by the last time hardy had come up here a few weeks before there hadnt been a pristine inch left burn marks spitballs chewed gum three bullet holes assorted bumper stickers picture ads for prostitutes photos of murder suspects from ancient cases the homicide inspectors thought it was a funny running gag glitsky didnt see it that way but he wasnt going to whine about it there were other approaches one night he had come down to the hall on a late call and happened to arrive as one of his inspectors carl griffin now deceased was adding some graphic flourishes to a wanted poster someone else had tacked to the door griffin had been engaged in his artwork and hadnt heard glitsky come up behind him didnt hear a thing even as glitsky whacked him on the head with his sap knocking him senseless for several minutes glitsky thought that was funny even funnier because griffin could never say anything about it without appearing to be an idiot but somehow the word had gotten out and the stakes had been raised now hardy stared the door was flat white he could still smell the paint and it was closed a rarity during the working day struck by the stunning blankness hardy whistled softly and looked out over the open room at least casually acquainted with most of the homicide inspectors he recognized marcel lanier who was seated at his desk a pencil poised over some paper the inspector was looking back at him he shook his head and spoke with a quiet authority i wouldnt somebody with him no when did this happen the door a shrug he came in after lunch with a bucket and a roller took him ten minutes is he all right a shrug it wasnt for a sergeant to say hardy thought about it two warnings from two solid professionals the smart move would be perhaps to skip it for now pick a better time but hed just driven down from his office paid to park come all the way up for this personal visit with his best friend it was the end of the day anyway whatever it was abe would deal with it maybe hardy could even help besides he was tired of wellmeaning gatekeepers trying to keep him from people he needed to see first phyllis with david freeman now sarah evans and marcel lanier with glitsky i think ill just see how hes doing he said no guts no glory he knocked on the post next to the shocking white door and heard the familiar growl of a response its open inside hardys first reaction was to reach for the light switch but glitsky spoke again leave it the room wasnt exactly dark but with the overheads off and the shades drawn on both windows it wasnt exactly light either you want to get the door hardy did as instructed i couldnt read a damn thing in this light i dont know how you do it its got to be tough on the eyes what do you want diz hardy found the wooden chair opposite the desk and lowered himself into it nice door i love the color no answer whats going on abe nothing you all right after a lengthy silence hardy said you want to talk about it theres nothing to talk about glitskys chair scraped he pushed himself back from his desk and leaned into the wall behind him on the chairs back legs hardys eyes were adjusting he gave it another try its after five oclock you feel like a drink i dont drink really since when hardy had only been glitskys pal for twentyfive years sometimes its not the worst idea in the world glitsky came forward in his chair clasped his hands on the desk before him when he spoke his voice had softened im trying to work something out all right meanwhile what can i help you with there was nothing to be gained from pushing glitskys issue whatever it was so hardy drew a breath and started youve got a guy across the way there cole burgess yeah elaine wagers killer alleged killer as we say in the defense biz are you defending him no i hope not and im not here to spring her killer ok then whats this about hardy calmly and briefly stated the reason for his visit his connection to coles sister dorothy the rest of it his sisters worried that he slipped through the cracks when they brought him in and the paramedics never got around to diagnosing him as a heroin user anyway the point is hes got to get into detox pronto or hes going to have a bad week really that would be sad well anyway he was drunk diz weve had him up here since last night mostly puking his guts were still talking to him yeah but now its been what eighteen hours he might still be hungover but hes dry all im saying is we know hes a junkie hes got to get in a program but glitsky was shaking his head no im not buying into that scam what scam couple of days on the county in a nice soft hospital bed thats not happening he was drunk thats all this was not the response hardy expected abe was a due process freak he played by the rules maybe hardy thought it was the other thing the dark room whatever else was eating him he started to debate cmon abe how can you know glitsky slammed his palm flat on his desk raised his voice he was drunk thats all he was all right we mirandized him hes talking well book him when were through you hear me just leave this one stupefied hardy sat back in his chair whats going on abe he asked quietly i cant just leave it you know that he killed elaine ok and we hope he burns in hell for it but his sister told me he was probably already in withdrawal this morning hes got to get some treatment glitsky remained unmoved when they process him in theyll give him the standard tests if its heroin theyll know soon enough when will that happen a shrug when were done here hardy took that in you mind if i ask what hes doing here right now answering questions glitsky came forward in his chair and fyi he waived an attorney though maybe if hed known it was you he doesnt know me hardy sat back shifted angrily in his chair youre sweating him arent you he glanced toward the door came back to the lieutenant if you were sitting where i am abe youd tell me something was wrong here that i wasnt doing my job right this isnt how its supposed to happen glitskys face was a slab he said nothing hardy sighed have you videotaped a confession a crisp nod i believe were in the process of doing that very thing hardys blood was running now he spoke carefully so if im moving ahead and getting him processed into a program youre telling me ive got to go around you is that it maybe a judge get a writ glitsky stared over his desk you do what youve got to do i intend to hardy paused i hope you know what youre doing its possible the lieutenant looked through him talk to you the visit was over glitskys conscience was a mangy dog gnawing at his insides after hardy left he remained sitting behind the desk in the dim confines of his office for over an hour until the quality of the light shifted outside it had come to dusk he rose went to his door opened it and looked out into the homicide detail the workday had ended but the door to the interrogation room was still closed he heard voices behind it ridley still had elaines killer in there he surveyed the detail the old school clock over the water cooler said it was six fifteen wearing headphones head down over his desk marcel lanier moved his lips and jabbed corrections with his pencil as he ran his interview tape and proofed it against what the transcriber had typed paul thieu who already knew everything anyway had his nose in a book with what looked like cyrillic script on the jacket he was working a russian mafiarelated homicide and glitsky thought he probably wanted to conquer the language before the case got too far along neither of the inspectors looked up nobody had messed yet with his door either he closed it behind him and pushed in the lock flicking on the light he got in his chair and pulled out his junk drawer lifted out elaines picture he couldnt look at it for long he realized that his daughter wouldnt exactly be proud of how hed handled things so far but hed told himself when hed given ridley his marching orders that this was an instance of bad things happening to bad people karma now he was trying to sell himself on the idea that it wasnt as though hed been actively complicit in torture but it wasnt easy though it truly had been glitskys intention to sweat the young man in the interrogation room this might be cruel but it wasnt unusual homicide inspectors did it frequently under the stressful conditions in that closedup space a suspect occasionally would waive his rights to an attorney or tell a story that he later wished he hadnt once in a while as in burgesss case he would even confess under conditions that might not qualify as legally coercive but now he realized that it had gone on long enough hed better go and tell ridley to end the interrogation get the suspect in the system burgess had killed elaine there was no doubt about that and it was important that no screwup create a hole he could slither through he stood grabbed his leather jacket opened his door again if ridley had gotten the impression because of abes obvious hostility to burgess that the suspect should be sweated beyond human endurance glitsky would have to try and correct that there was an important difference he knew between wishing pain and suffering on someone and making him experience it it was called civilization sharron pratt the district attorney of the city and county of san francisco sipped a preprandial newfangled cocktail concocted from gin and chocolate liqueur and served in a tall blue martini glass perched on a high stool at one of the financial districts power restaurants sharron cut an elegant figure in her tailored blue suit she wore her hair shoulderlength and made no effort to hide the gray that had once lightly peppered and now dominated it lightly made up a touch of mascara and a subtle shade of lip gloss she was very easy to look at rimless bifocal eyeglasses added a few years to her true age of fortyfour but behind them greenflecked eyes sparkled youthfully her wide mouth animated her face the plane of her cheeks was welldefined her skin smooth even with the added gray and the nononsense glasses she was a woman whod come into herself as shed aged and was now far more handsome than shed been a decade before but internally she suffered from a great discontent since the upset victory resulting in her election three years before sharron pratt had suffered a steady decline in popularity now with her chance for reelection coming up in november she had eight months to recoup the eleven points which the latest poll told her she had lost i dont understand how this has happened gabe i really dont gabriel torrey her chief assistant da and political mentor was methodically breaking apart the pistachios from the bowl on the bar gathering the nuts onto his napkin when hed accumulated somewhere between eight and a dozen he would pop them into his mouth washing them down with nonalcoholic beer torrey had no trouble understanding what had happened to sharron pratts fans conveying it to her was the difficult part he shrugged cracked a nut keeping a casual tone crimes up sharron convictions are down thats the short answer people are tired of it im tired of it too gabe pratt leaned forward on her stool moved a hand onto his sleeve but the damn police are so hostile and we cant seem to get any coverage what torrey was shaking his head people are impatient with the excuses too sharron its been three years people are thinking that if you havent been able to fix things in that time youre not going to hed only cracked two shells but he threw the nuts into his mouth early im sorry to be the bearer of bad news here but the agenda you got elected on last time just hasnt played in the real world it would though if everyone would just get behind it torrey knew he had to answer with a great deal of care this woman might be his bedmate at widelyspaced intervals when the stars were aligned just right but every day she was after all his boss traditionally she did not warm to philosophical argument shed worked the legal trenches in san francisco for years social worker public defender lawyer for various civil rights coalitions and she knew what played in this town her election had confirmed that the people were behind her they were ready for a change no more white guys prosecuting minorities it was going to be a new age she had won by among other things promising to do all she could to stop police brutality stop prosecuting victimless crimes dont charge petty drug users or prostitutes institute counseling and rehab programs for people whose emotional and substance problems caused them to break the law her administration was going to be known not for enforcing outmoded laws but for doing what was right and sharron pratt always knew without doubt what that was no matter what she was on the side of the angels but if torrey wanted to get sharron elected again he was going to have to get her to bend except torrey knew to borrow from an old song that pratt was an oak not a willow she did not bend maybe though he could get her to acknowledge that a private moral position did not have to be reflected absolutely in the political arena maybe there could be a gray area although gray areas too god knew or at least torrey did were not pratts long suit i dont know torrey began again maybe people didnt realize how the results of your our programs would affect them pratts nostrils flared and her vibrant eyes flashed what do you mean by that gabe well lets take the homeless for example now being homeless is not a crime in itself not a crime at all pratt employed a crisp schoolmarmism correction almost as a verbal tic but torrey was used to her and her response didnt slow him down and no ones saying it is but youll recall one of your campaign issues was that we treat the homeless with respect and that seemed to strike a positive chord with the voters absolutely as well it should also torrey was thinking remove the word should from her conversation and his boss would become functionally mute yes well in practice you have to admit the policy caused some problems this torrey knew was a whopper of an understatement after pratt had been swept to power on a tide of benevolent humanity she formed a coalition with the mayor and several supervisors and to a great deal of positive press announced to the country that under this administration san francisco would be a haven for the homeless no longer would the police hassle the poor and downtrodden there would be no more rousting there would be cityfunded programs for free meals armies of volunteers would move out from the soup kitchen base and take sandwiches to the hungry where they lived in short order this utopian policy resulted in a mass migration of many of the nations chronically unemployed to the city by the bay within months camps of vagrants drunks the psychologically impaired and drug addicts had essentially taken over golden gate park dolores park any number of neighborhood green areas the downtown streets became gauntlets of panhandlers drunks in doorways public urinators and then as the worst became bolder polite requests for spare change became belligerent demands and gave way to intimidations purse snatchings shakedowns and muggings but those werent the homeless we were trying to help sharron said they were the criminal element thats all people needed to see that we just need to educate them torrey was shaking his head no sharron theyll never see it they think you let the bums in you ruined the tourist industry pratt straightened her back and lifted her martini glass to her lips she sipped contemplatively is it too late let me ask you one sharron are you sure you want to keep doing this that you want to run again thats two she smiled halfheartedly lightly touched torreys arm again do i want to keep doing this she repeated weve done a lot of good gabe havent we again torrey crafted a careful response i think weve changed the agenda in a positive way sharron people are thinking about the office the district attorney in a way they never had before now more as a force for social maybe even moral leadership and all thats to the good but torrey popped a couple of nuts but the fact remains that most of the electorate seems to have returned to the theory that the main role of the district attorney is to prosecute people who break the laws and thats never been your forte you want to help people thats always been whats driven you which is why i ask if you want to keep doing this she sighed considering its a bully pulpit gabe were way ahead of the curve in our thinking we knew that going in we cant just keep building more prisons and throwing more people into them weve got to torrey put his hand on pratts arm stopping her they had to educate the masses and the criminals and the victims and do counseling and rehab and yada yada yada at some point before hed come to work fulltime in the hall of justice and become immersed in the stupidly hopeless march of crime through the system hed even believed a good portion of it but that day was in the past lets keep this discussion on point he said a little more firmly than hed planned but before his boss could react negatively he pressed on weve tried to raise the moral bar sharron weve done the right thing time and time again but the polls are telling us that the people arent getting the message or its not the one they want now the question is do you want to go ahead and if you do i really think the wise move would be to consider he paused refining your position slightly her mouth twisted in distaste no he almost said well that was a delightful exchange of ideas but the words that came out were no what you dont want to go ahead no i dont want to quit ive worked hard for this position for the peoples trust i am the absolutely best person for district attorney and lets not forget that im running the office the way it should be run torrey brought a hand to his mouth to hide the grimace that old should again pratts vision was at least entirely selfrighteously consistent he thought never mind the way things actually were pratt had a vision of a better world and the people who didnt share it were stupid damned ignorant venal criminal clueless or all of the above therefore they didnt count but her adviser had to try to get pratt at least to realize that their votes did ok he said then maybe its just a question of perception pratts bright eyes sparked she liked this direction of what that youre soft on crime the spark turned dark thats rubbish i hate crime why do you think i ran for the job in the first place its criminals the people that i dont hate i try to understand them see what happened how they got he brought some more pressure to her forearm sharron perception ok a show of reluctance then she nodded go on the killing of elaine wager by this vagrant that is so horrible i loved elaine gabe everybody loved elaine sharron thats my point heres a much loved wellknown community figure daughter of a popular exsenator and africanamerican to boot she is brutally murdered by a homeless white man for a few coins in her purse are you seeing where im going with this to his satisfied surprise he saw that his idea had clicked with sharron and one other thing he said whats that if you dont mind id like to try the case myself this did bring a clearly visible reaction almost a start but i need she slowed herself down why would you want to do that gabe torrey had stopped chewing his nuts he put down his glass met sharrons eyes when she first came up this is elaine he nodded when chris locke was da her mouth tightened in private sharron referred to lockes administration as the neanderthal years since her own election she had purged the office of all but a very few of lockes old prosecutors and it was no secret that this was part of the reason that now her office couldnt seem to convict anyone shed had to let them go for their political incorrectness to say nothing of the general culture of incorrigibility locke had been black but hed hired in pratts view far too many white males whod adopted a macho win at all costs mentality that had infected the office getting convictions sure but at what cost sharrons own motto was theres more to being a prosecutor than getting convictions to which the locke crowd tended to respond oh yeah like what so any mention of chris locke and his administration put sharron pratt on the defensive and it was immediately apparent that she was on it now the fingers of her right hand thrumming uneasily on the bar torrey carefully reached over and covered her hand with his elaine was having an affair with locke with the da while she worked for him how much younger was she than he was god that man torrey suppressed his desire to point out to his boss that the two of them he and sharron were in precisely the same relationship that elaine and locke had enjoyed there would be no point sharron would be hard pressed to see any similarity in spite of the fact that in both cases the da was sleeping with an assistant da but locke had been a predator of gullible young women she was nothing like that she and torrey had a mature relationship between equals and that could not have been true with locke and elaine instead he waited her out in silence then in any event after locke was killed she needed a shoulder to cry on and we pratt pulled her hand out from under his dont tell me i dont want to know it wasnt that sharron he took her hand again patted it soothingly it wasnt that ok she finally nodded ok there wasnt anybody she could talk to here the office was changing she felt there were spies everywhere he shrugged making light of it i was doing some neighborhood work in the africanamerican community outreach stuff you know just like you were anyway elaine and i we got to be close for a while platonically really he squeezed her hand shed lost her mother and her lover within a week she wanted to talk ideas what was the place of a strong smart black woman in a white mans world what was the price of her mothers fame was any of it worth it was it wise to have affairs with married men where was she going what had she done that kind of thing he paused eventually she got it together i put her in touch with aaron rand and you know the rest but she was just very special somehow and now a sigh i cared about her and now i feel i owe her something what you couldnt have prevented what happened with her it wasnt anything to do with you no i know that he considered his phrasing lets just call it a payback this bum who killed her if somebodys going to take him down id like it to be me two hours after hed left glitsky after a visit to frank batiste the chief of inspectors hardy was coming out of his shock but still wasnt sure how to proceed he had at least gotten cole burgess booked into the jail and now he wanted to talk to him get some take of the damage he took the outside corridor from the back door of the hall it was bitter with a wet wind and when he got inside the door to the jail he stood a minute getting the warmth the admitting sergeant at the counter was a short skinny caucasian with the name tag reilly and a buzz cut of orange hair glitsky was six foot two half black and all buffed after his first three minutes with reilly hardy thought it was amazing that they could look so much alike because whether he knew it or not the desk sergeant was giving hardy his glitsky imitation and doing a hell of a good job at it yeah he was pretty sure cole burgess had been processed in no he hadnt heard about any heroin sorry he hadnt made it into the computer yet he couldnt say for sure where he was even if hed been taken to the th floor or to the hospital hardy took that runaround until it became obvious then demanded to speak to reillys superior reilly told hardy that well darn he really wasnt sure whether anybody was in this time of evening deliberately pitching his voice so low that reilly had to lean closer to hear it at all hardy whispered all right sergeant then get me the watch commander and if hes not in ill call dan boles the sheriff at home oh and i almost forgot your inmate mr burgess is the brotherinlaw of jeff elliot who writes the citytalk column for the chronicle within two minutes reilly had located somebody who might know something big black and beefy the man appeared from a door behind the reception desk made a show of spotting the man in the lawyer suit pointed at hardy and closed the space between them im lieutenant wayne davies mr hardy said who he was laid out the problem then this man needs detox his medical evaluation hasnt moved forward not as far as i can tell your admitting sergeant tells me hes not even in the computer yet then hes probably not been processed thats when they do the med eval davies had his arms crossed his brow furrowed hardy was to understand that he was thinking hard about all this trying to remember one in what must have been dozens of people brought to the jail today for processing and youre his attorney he asked the veneer of patience now transparently thin hardy nodded his sister retained me on his behalf and hes been in custody now for almost a full day hmm and you say lieutenant glitsky brought him down look lieutenant im talking about cole burgess the suspect in the elaine wager murder hes here hes in withdrawal and youre responsible for him what are you going to do davies decided although he dressed it up for hardys benefit pretending it had all just come back to him elaine wager that guy yeah hes here but i dont know how far hes gotten what do you mean i mean processing him in it was busy today thirty admits there might still be some delay another elaborate shrug i dont know hardy had heard more than enough ok lieutenant lets cut the bullshit i demand to see my client now if hes not in detox immediately you personally can probably look forward to being named in about a billion dollar lawsuit against the city davies held up an authoritative hand keep your shorts on mr hardy im sure hes here well find him and get him checked out hell be upstairs in jail or on his way to county hospital you can see him either place when were through mr hardy but not before cole burgess wanted to be dead there was nothing but the pain and no way he could make it stop not here not without the god when he was a boy still active still doing sports hed get cramps in his legs that woke him screaming from sound sleep in the middle of the night the calf on his right leg or a muscle somewhere under the tendons of one of his feet knotted muscle curled on itself squeezing every nerve around it in a concentrated orb of agony but localized at least one place one muscle per spasm his mom would come in and rub it knead it out talk to him it would pass though the memory the ache would linger for days but it wasnt like this now when it was everywhere all at once never ending unbearable somebody please come and kill me did he say it he didnt know it was his only thought but there really wasnt any thought as such any words there wasnt even consciousness outside of the pain it consumed his entire being only the pain he hadnt had any god in three days his body was draped in the jails orange jumpsuit it twitched making small noises on the floor of the cell used for the psychologically impaired the guard opened the cell door and held it while two other guards lifted the body onto a gurney and began pushing it down the hallway to the elevator that led to the jails rear entrance cole burgess was sure he was getting his wish now dying any second it would end it would have to lights were exploding in his brain every flash accompanied by another blinding stab more intolerable agony beyond where he would have said if any communication were possible which it wasnt that no more could be borne no one could take this much torture and survive kill me kill me god god god god god davies returned without any sign of cole burgess mr hardy wheres my goddamned client the lieutenant remained tolerant your client is fine we had a computer problem and lost him for a few minutes thats all where is he i want to see him the smile didnt change you can see him but hes not here to see hes at county i cant guarantee hes conscious right now but youre sure welcome as all hell to go and find out for yourself you want i could call over and tell them to expect you frannie hardy had pulled her long red hair back into a pony tail and it hung halfway down her back barefoot she wore a pair of old jeans and an oversized green pullover sweater she was standing in the front doorway waving goodbye to her children as they ran out to their carpool hardy came up behind her put a hand on her shoulder called out have a good day guys see you tonight they turned together and walked through the family room back to the kitchen where hardy took his seat in front of his coffee frannie silently moved some dishes to the sink wiped a surface or two with a dishcloth finally some psychic energy shifted and frannie came over and sat down with him she smiled wearily reached a hand over and put it on her husbands hi a reflexive sigh hardys own weariness breaking through wow his wife nodded i know she is trying you know yep its not some scam to get our attention she really does worry he nodded never doubting it for a moment this morning once again his daughter had been afraid to go to school and theyd done their parental tag team trying to calm her myriad fears for nearly an hour while their son vincent grabbed his english muffin and disappeared into his bedroom so he wouldnt have to deal with it the becks fears the constant flow of news and information even her school curriculum kept the beck hyperkinetically aware of and sensitive to every disaster that happened on the planet a plane crash in calcutta a hostage crisis in balkans famine and genocide in rwanda church burnings in the south all the worlds problems brought home to her own little plate every day this was the backdrop of everyday life the white noise of her daily existence hardy had trouble believing that the nature of human beings had changed so completely in one generation surely there had always been criminals and perverts ugliness and evil it just hadnt felt as if it was everywhere perhaps life now for his children was not really much more precarious than when hardy had been a boy but now it seemed that nearly every detail of every crime everywhere got into the societal fabric via the front page television the internet a racial killing in detroit happened here an abusive father killing his wife and kids in miami was here a massacre at a school in north dakota might happen here today the beck seemed to feel that if she let her guard down for an instant she would die kidnappers lurked in every public bathroom you got cancer if you caught a whiff of secondhand tobacco smoke bombs and handguns proliferated in high schools everywhere you caught aids if you even kissed your boyfriend god forbid you got a sunburn or forgot to fasten your seatbelt government warning everyone who breathes dies watch out she was trying to sort it all out one fear at a time three out of seven days a week for at least the past year at bedtime on school mornings whenever something struck her it was wearing her parents down she worries frannie repeated i worry too hardy replied but im old thats my job the becks a healthy kid whose parents love each other and have enough money she ought to spend a couple of seconds thinking about that every week or two the good stuff in the world there is some left i hear sunsets food the occasional tasteless joke she tries dismas shes doing the best she can i know hardy sipped at his cold coffee let out another lungful of air i really do know it just breaks my heart the phrase hung in the room after a long minute frannie squeezed his hand what else she asked hardy paused then feigned ignorance what else what good try she said but not flying something else not the beck has been bothering you since you got home last night hardy glanced across at his wife she brushed a stray strand of gleaming red hair from her lovely forehead offered him a sympathetic look youre good he said she shrugged part of the job description so what is it he sighed a last time and gave in abe that doesnt sound like him at all frannie said after shed heard the story do you think its possible he had a crush on elaine the question was unexpected and hardy considered it carefully then shook his head no she was engaged besides abe isnt what id call the crush type he had a crush on flo for almost twenty years that wasnt a crush frannie they were married she gave him a pretty pout and the two are mutually exclusive he took her hand kissed it shook his head what i mean is i cant see him carrying some kind of torch hed come out with it frannie broke a halfsmile abe were talking the effervescent and loquacious lieutenant glitsky you want my opinion at every turn i think if he was attracted to somebody who was somehow off limits like engaged wild horses couldnt drag it out of him hardy sat up straight you dont think he would even mention it to the involved party no especially not her not unless she gave him some signal that she might be interested why do you think abe hasnt had a date in three years women hate and fear him dismas hes a hideous gargoyle it was no secret that frannie considered abe one of the more attractive men on the planet i dont think thats it either how about if he hasnt liked anybody enough maybe but not mostly i dont think she came forward on the couch he hasnt asked anybody out id bet you anything because he doesnt want to reveal anything going on inside him its his protection since flo hardy knew that his wife was mostly right on this since flo had died hed spent hours with glitsky both socially and professionally and knew that his friend wasnt exactly the poster boy for celebrating the inner child the walls were high and thick but frannie hadnt gotten it all and hardys expression grew serious i think hes scared all right but not about having somebody see who he is i think hes afraid that if he starts with somebody he might get to care about her that might turn into caring a lot and then he might lose it all again frannie put her hand back over his that was your demon dismas she said softly maybe its not abes hardys first son michael had died in infancy the event had plunged him into divorce with his first wife jane and then a decade of lethargy in a haze induced by guinness during which he eked out an empty existence on his bartender wages at the little shamrock his passion for his work and for justice for sunsets and food and sexual love too had dried up and then somehow the precise mechanism of it was still a mystery to him frannie had gotten through to him and hed begun to feel again to be able to handle feeling now he tightened down his mouth looked over at her maybe thats why i recognize it though with abe how did we get on this anyway he asked abe dating his possible crush on elaine hardy gave it another minute whatever it was it was serious he wanted the kid to suffer it was personal so what are you going to do now about abe i dont suppose youll have to do anything about abe hes got a way of taking care of himself i was thinking about the boy whats left for you to do are you in this after a minute of consideration hardy said lets say im not comfortable with the idea of defending the person who killed elaine i liked her if cole did it ill turn dorothy onto somebody else tell her ive got a conflict of interest you just said if cole did it he did frannie hes confessed thats usually a tipoff but youre going to want to find out a little more arent you make sure hardys reluctance showed like a fresh bruise his expression changed two or three times until it rested on a grimace probably knowing me he admitted although theres no such thing as sure it just feels a little pat up to now thats all id want to talk to him at least get his side of it but if it seems like he did do it strung out and screwed up or not ill let david or somebody else take him i wouldnt want to be involved in defending him but what if hardy held up a hand lets not go there not yet ok abe would be pretty unhappy though wouldnt he if you did he nodded somberly you know my love sometimes you show a remarkable talent for understatement it surprised hardy but neither jeff nor dorothy elliot had any real problem with his decision not to represent cole they even said they thought it was a smart one as they talked it came out that the boy had done a pretty good job of alienating everybody in the family when hed first begun having problems jeff and dorothy had tried to be understanding and supportive in his struggle cole told them that hed come out to san francisco because there wasnt any real empathy regarding his situation in the midwest he was trying but people just didnt understand so the elliots invited him to stay with them and their children until he got settled in in the next month jeff lost a watch and they had a daytime breakin where the burglar got away with most of dorothys jewelry dinners became upsetting for the children when uncle coles place would be set and he wouldnt show up on top of that cole had two minor traffic accidents while he was driving dorothys car both of them the other drivers fault except that in both cases the other car had fled finally when one of the girls piggy banks that had held four hundred dollars turned up missing theyd told cole he had to go and not come back so they understood hardys decision he was a friend to have gone to the jail in an emergency and make sure he got into the detox they didnt expect him to do anything else but for his own peace of mind hardy did want to eyeball the man and get to the bottom of this confession what had cole said glitskys behavior had stuck in his craw as well it wasnt that he thought that cole might be innocent but the fact that everyone was treating him as though it had already been proven that bothered the lawyer in hardy he didnt need certainty beyond a reasonable doubt he was ready to cast cole off in a heartbeat but he couldnt let go completely until hed at least totally satisfied himself that the man had actually killed elaine then let him be damned hardy wouldnt care in the womens room at rand and jackman law associates on montgomery street treya ghent tried to fix her eyes but she knew it was a losing fight between the horrible senseless murder of her dear friend and boss elaine wager and the unrelenting demands of her wonderful but highmaintenance fourteenyearold daughter raney she had averaged less than three hours of sleep for the past four nights she was at work this morning because she didnt want to use up any more sick days frivolously she needed to keep a bank so that she would be available if her daughter absolutely needed to have her stay home to care for a real illness or to counsel her during a real crisis and treya didnt kid herself raney was a teenager she was desperately going to need her mother from time to time in the next couple of years just as treya had needed her own mom and thank god raney like treya had been was the kind of child who would ask certainly she wasnt going to waste any of those precious sick days on herself she hadnt missed a day of work for anything related to herself in six years they paid her to be here and contribute and she wasnt going to let her employers down they counted on her but the eyes were going to betray the fact that this morning at least she was a functional zombie and she hated to have anyone much less clarence jackman the firms managing partner see that when shed gotten the summons that jackman wanted to see her in his office shed been sobbing quietly in her little cubicle and why not how could somebody have killed elaine it had wrenched her heart when shed first learned of it and the pain hadnt let up much since elaine had been a friend and confidante they often joked that they were sisters separated at birth she and her boss had been the same age thirtythree both were smart neither of them entirely black or white intuitively they both understood that the sometimes vast differences between their social standing their jobs and their prospects were merely the products of background education and that greatest of all variables luck she threw a last splash of cold water over her eyes blinked hard and patted them dry with a paper towel shed kept mr jackman waiting long enough too long really staring at herself in the mirror for one last second she willed a tiny spark of life into her tired eyes squared her shoulders lifted her chin ok girl she whispered firmly to herself no whining sixtythreeyearold clarence jackman was a power player the company hed founded with aaron rand thirty years ago was the most successful majorityblack law firm west of chicago though rand and jackman represented perhaps fifteen per cent of the bay areas minorityowned businesses the rest of their receivables came from a mix of premier entities without any reference to ethnicities the firms client roster included banks hotels construction firms hmos several silicon valley companies dozens of sports and entertainment celebrities and hundreds of other lower profile but highincome individuals and corporations imposing nearly to the point of intimidation jackman had been a star fullback at usc in the sixties he carried nearly two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle on his sixfoot threeinch frame he favored italian suits doublebreasted in browns and greens white shirts conservative ties intensely blackhued with an oversized head capped now in tightly trimmed gray knots just two months ago hed had a middleaged applicant for the firms cfo position walk out of the job interview before a word had been spoken while jackman looked him over to see if he could take it understandably jackman had not risen to his current eminence by having a soft heart the law business was competitive enough if you werent black if you were it could be startlingly brutal rand and jackman had known this at the start theyd felt that they had to build their firm on the assumption that if things ever went wrong with a client or a case they would never under any circumstances get the benefit of the doubt they could afford no mistakes they had to be the best not just the best black the best period and so perhaps ironically the firm was much more a meritocracy than most of its competitors the younger associates worked endless hours like well slaves so that they could become partners and keep working even harder mental or physical weakness excuses moral lapses failure all were grounds for termination jackman unhampered by any laws mandating sensitivity to race issues ran what he thought was a good oldfashioned firm when he and aaron had first started out theyd set the tone immediately getting rid of deadwood on sight and soon enough the word got out and the stars came calling from the good law schools and from other firms the diligent the brilliant the ambitious workers all here his attorneys could accomplish great things could kick some real ass and make real money without anyone wondering whether theyd been hired to meet some quota or kept on because they couldnt be fired now saddened on many levels by the murder of one of his true stars elaine wager clarence jackman was going to have to deliver one of the tough messages to one of the good people he had seated himself behind his desk always an effective tool for reinforcing emotional distance and was shuffling papers as the door opened he kept at it for a few more seconds then looked up ah ms ghent thanks for coming up youre welcome she was standing in a classic military atease position by the empire chair that hed placed in front of his desk please have a seat nodding briskly all business she thanked him and took the chair sitting ramrod straight and managing to do it without appearing stiff or nervous she looked at him expectantly then surprised him by speaking up first what can i do for you sir in spite of the message he was about to deliver jackman found himself almost enjoying the moment this was a woman with presence a slight puffiness around her eyes in no way detracted from her appearance if she was wearing any makeup it was very subtle she sat about ten feet from jackman and he saw no sign of any not even lipstick her face was handsome jackman decided that if she made it up it would be close to beautiful which was probably why she didnt bother it had an angular almost exotic cast some hint of asian bloodline in the racial mix conservatively dressed in a honeycolored silk blouse and kneelength skirt she still managed to project a powerful physicality there was no sign of any extra weight on her but she wasnt petite she came across more than anything as strong these impressions coalesced in the seconds it took for jackman to frame his response his own expression was grave his body language sympathetic as he came forward his arms on his desk well first he began in his deep soothing voice i wanted to see how youre holding up in the wake of elaine ive tried to do most of my crying at home he admired the selfdeprecating way she phrased it meeting his eye i havent always been successful its a tragedy jackman declared a terrible tragedy yes sir it is she inhaled deeply and waited jackman might be both sympathetic and sincere but he hadnt called her up here to share condolences it didnt take any time at all for the managing partner to get to it jackman pulled himself up straight in his chair and cleared his throat on another note a bit unpleasant im afraid i wanted to make sure that your situation over the next few weeks isnt any cause for awkwardness he paused i understand that you worked for elaine pretty much exclusively treya nodded in acknowledgment jackman of course wasnt guessing he knew that treya and elaine had evolved a working relationship that was unique in the firm all of the other paralegals floated between looselydefined teams of three to five attorneys taking assignments from any of them treya on the other hand got all of her hours assisting elaine though it was an unusual arrangement jackman had allowed it to continue because it had worked elaine had been a workhorse with a case and business load of incredible diversity and treya was organized and efficient enough to keep up with her but now the arrangement loomed as a liability jackman drove home the point i assume that over the next six weeks youll be helping out with the distribution of elaines caseload and that should keep your utilization high i was thinking the same thing good beyond that id like to recommend if i may that during that transition you also begin taking assignments from some of the other attorneys if they are offered to you yes sir i was hoping to do just that too splendid jackman didnt have to issue the warning any more clearly left unspoken was the hard truth that if treya could not find enough work with one of the teams to keep her fully utilized jackman wouldnt be able to justify keeping her on youve been with the firm quite a while now havent you almost seven years i came with elaine when she moved over from the city jackman had his fingers intertwined on the desk he was rolling his thumbs ponderously something was going on in his brain though his face didnt show it well he said with resignation your good work hasnt gone unnoticed he paused again offered an avuncular smile lets call it a soft six weeks shall we if you need a little extra time please come up and see me i will she said the discussion was over though they both sat unmoving for a long moment then as though on cue they both nodded and treya stood she said thank you without inflection and headed for the door as she walked down the hallway back to her cubicle the knife kept turning in her stomach whatever sympathetic spin jackman might put on it she knew the reality behind his words she had just been politely regretfully fired if she couldnt find another attorney in the firm whod want to use her six soft weeks she knew that jackman meant he might give her seven weeks maybe as many as nine if he let her continue to work through her two weeks notice my god she was thinking what am i going to do six weeks she knew that there was little chance that she would get anywhere near full utilization in that amount of time first her fellow paralegals were under the same pressure as she was to keep working nonattorney staff at rand and jackman would bank their overtime so that they could apply the hours to their utilization during slack periods though technically illegal in california the firm winked at the common practice too many weeks of low utilization the exact number was unknown but low you were gone and everyone at the firm knew it beyond that treya was aware that her special relationship with elaine had been a source of jealousy among her peers she had done nothing purposeful to make this happen she was unfailingly polite and friendly she bent over backwards to tell the truth but there was no denying that she enjoyed a slightly exalted status that some of the other paralegals resented a few lawyers might have harbored even more negative thoughts treya was a mere paralegal who on some level must have thought she was equal to someone whod passed the bar a ridiculous notion if ever there was one no one was going to throw her a bone and several people she could mention might even be glad to see her laid low so unless a miracle occurred and she had long since stopped counting on them she was going to be unemployed before springtime she couldnt let that happen not to herself and not to raney she had to whip her resume into shape get out there at lunchtime and start interviewing if only elaine oh poor elaine blinking back the unexpected new flash flood of tears treya hurried the last few steps to her cubicle she would be damned if shed let anyone see her crying if she could just make it back to the safety of her workstation she could get herself back under control these sudden attacks of crying had to stop before the beginning of this week treya couldnt remember the last time she had cried it must have been just after toms death when raney was two twelve years so long ago tom she couldnt let herself think about him not now about what they could have had if it would all be so different now if it hadnt been for the stupid red light the stupid truck her awful awful luck the floodgates threatened to open nearly bursting with the effort to hold back tears she finally turned the corner into her cubicle a hardlooking man was leaning against her desk his arms crossed impatience etched on his face he had a hatchet nose and a scar through his lips treya ghent he said brusquely straightening up and holding out a badge im lieutenant glitsky homicide id like to talk to you about elaine wager she collapsed into tears i thought youd already arrested somebody nearly ten minutes had passed during which time glitsky waited at the workstation allowing treya to go to the bathroom to regain her composure now she was back with him her emotions clamped down if anything she exuded a kind of cold fury hed seen before which he interpreted as selfloathing and anger that shed lost control she sat at her desk and hed pulled a chair around from someplace and straddled it backwards so they were at about eye level in the small cubicle we do have someone in custody yes so what does that have to do with me or with anything else that might have happened here more hostility this woman spooked by the police visit shattered by a recent murder didnt want to talk about it it should just all go away youre right it may have nothing to do with anybody or anything here he replied in his professional tone what could there be it was some bum wasnt it she didnt know him glitskys lips tightened were trying to make sure of that didnt i read that he confessed you may have the leak on that development hadnt made glitskys day and his face showed it well that ought to settle that dont you think glitsky crossed his arms on the back of the chair and purposefully looked away bringing his eyes back to her he waited yet another moment finally when he thought she was about to begin squirming he spoke quietly its my understanding that you and elaine were close the question deflected some of the anger treya bit at her lower lip then nodded yes then it would seem to me that youd want to cooperate in any way you could with the investigation into her death i do but glitsky cut her off sometimes people confess to things they didnt do did that happen here no the lieutenant drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly but even with a righteous confession we still need to collect all the evidence we can why because when the killer gets a lawyer which he will hell change his mind and plead not guilty after hes confessed it happens in fact it always happens what has he got to lose treya sat back in her chair digesting this then what about the confession a grim smile oh the argument will be that it was invalid it was coerced somehow or the police beat it out of him or his memory was impaired maybe it was a dream or he just mixed up what had happened mixed up that he killed somebody yeah youd think youd remember something like that but youd be surprised how many people dont after saying they did abe and treyas eyes locked in some kind of shared understanding across the small space between them not for long though both of them realizing it looked away so treya said you need evidence of what this was difficult for glitsky to explain for the truth was that he was grasping at straws it was bad enough that elaine was dead but to admit that shed died in such a senseless attack was almost too much for abe to bear she couldnt have lived her interesting and committed life done all shed done touched so many people only to have it all wiped away in a completely random moment as though she were no more important than a bug although of course thats exactly what did happen but with his own daughter he couldnt fit it anywhere couldnt live with it at least until he knew more about elaine about her killer the intersection where some meaning could be attached to it it was important it was stupid and made no sense he had to do it again he met the womans eyes if for example elaine worked at all with the free clinic or legal aid if she had any professional contact with junkies then she might have met with the man glitsky made a face the point is if elaine volunteered with any of these people treya was shaking her head she did volunteer do some pro bono work but not on the streets she considered those people lost for the most part if they were going to get back it was going to have to be on their own they werent her issue so what was students people who were trying to do something with their lives so she taught moot court at hastings for example she didnt have much patience for professional victims she always wanted to yell at people to not let themselves get in that habit treyas eyes briefly flickered bright with a rogue memory one of her great expressions was that there were only two kinds of people victims and warriors i like that abe said but maybe cole burgess hung out with some students law students i dont think so another shake of the head i dont remember ever hearing the name all right treya bit at her lower lip again and glitsky found himself watching her the swollen nearly pouting mouth when was the last time you saw her the question startled her why do you want to know that you cant think i was she was staring doeeyed in disbelief i dont think anything glitsky hadnt meant to spook her he softened his voice im trying to start somewhere get a time line of her last hours its really routine isnt that what the police always say when they suspect somebody that its routine glitskys mouth turned up a fraction of an inch another humanizing touch actually they do youre right but im not doing that now she sighed heavily sunday afternoon here at glitskys expression she felt the need to explain and pressed on im often in on weekends and she was doing some special master work glitsky nodded in understanding this wasnt unusual a special master was an attorney appointed by the court to help serve a search warrant on material that might be privileged doctors records lawyers files psychiatrists tapes and deliver whatever was not privileged in the requested records to the court if the person who had the records was uncooperative the master would do the actual searching and separate out what lawfully could be seized from the private records of other clients and patients whose right to privacy was therefore protected from the police and elaine came back here when she was done with that yes what time was that treyas face showed her concentration im not sure exactly it was just turning dark so maybe five thirty i was finishing up and what did she come back here for just to leave me some files then she was going out for a meeting and then home glitsky was leaning forward now this was an unexpected bonus treya had talked to elaine on the last day of her life within hours in fact of her death did she say who she was meeting or where no ive tried to remember for myself but she never said im sure she just said she had a meeting and shed see me tomorrow she was always going to meetings and she didnt seem upset did she act as if anything was bothering her treya hesitated met glitskys eyes again its so hard to say now knowing what happened everything has a different feel you wonder if you saw something or not but you think you did she shook her head im not sure if shed come in on monday smiling and happy i never would have given it a thought i know i didnt think about it when i got home sunday night i just thought she was overbooked like she gets got the tense shift bothered her and she stopped its ok glitsky had to fight the urge to reach over and touch her offer her some comfort instead he sat back no threat and no push and let her find the thread again its ok he repeated i know i know her look was grateful and she held it on him for an instant then she nodded and sighed now id say that yes something might have been bothering her she seemed a little detached treya hastened to protect her boss but shed get that way sometimes she always had a lot on her mind on her plate suddenly treyas expressive face took on a different look a sudden impatience with all this an almost angry frustration what are you thinking glitsky asked im thinking she didnt know her killer this is stupid her murder wasnt connected to anything nobody she knew could have wanted to kill her she raised her eyes a challenge with some barb in it that he didnt quite understand you had to know her i did glitsky replied i thought she was fantastic she never mentioned you as a friend suddenly the barb in her voice was pronounced unmistakable all of her protective instincts on display from out of nowhere well no not exactly a friend i knew her when she worked at the hall i knew that i knew who you were i was there then too as a clerk glitsky had no response to this although treya seemed in some way to hold it against him he attempted to get beyond it in any event thats another reason why id like to know what she might have been working on ive got kind of a personal interest as well but if he thought this admission would ally him with treya he was mistaken so youve kept up on her career since shed left the hall he answered guardedly a little bit yes in a kind of a handsoff way glitsky raised his shoulders awkwardly i guess youd say i admired her from a distance he wondered how suddenly everything had gone so wrong with this interview im sorry if ive offended you not at all she said youre only doing your job but elaine is very personal to me i know who her friends were and its a little insulting to pretend you were close to her too so maybe id tell you more that wasnt what i was doing really she asked with illconcealed disbelief then im sorry i got that impression perhaps i overreacted all business now treya cut off further inquiry as she stood signaling although it was not her place to do so that the interview was over im sure the firm wouldnt object if you got a warrant for her files or to go over her client list you might find something there that youre looking for glitsky rarely felt either inept or out of his depth but he now felt both and acutely perhaps it was a sense of foolishness because he found her so physically attractive and at such an inappropriate time whatever it was he was standing along with her not willing to risk falling any further in her esteem he hadnt gotten anywhere here and in fact hed had little confidence that any real evidence was going to come from this quarter but it had been the only place he could think of to begin to connect with someone who had known her ms ghent please his shoulders were sagging he was a pathetic figure he knew it regal she stopped at the entrance to the cubicle turned back to face him challenging her arms crossed her color now high in her cheeks i want you to understand that im not looking for specific evidence im trying to get a sense of her work her life if maybe there was some reason too close to revealing the nonprofessional truth about why hed come here he stood mute and helpless treya ghent gave every appearance of considering his words but when she finally spoke there was no sign of cooperation i really dont think so but if anything occurs to me lieutenant ill let you know this time it was a dismissal at high noon hardy walked into the small lobby for the segregated jailing rooms at the hospital it was a depressing and cold room dimly lit with high barred windows and a strong smell of antiseptic sweaty yellowing walls and a couple of battered wooden benches although no one was using them at the moment to his left a uniformed female officer sat at a pitted green desk equipped with a computer terminal and a telephone she looked up at hardys arrival with a kind of relief he went across to her and stated his business you know hes already got a visitor his mother it didnt take phenomenal cosmic powers to realize that jody burgess had made a poor impression on this woman hardy gave her a sympathetic smile her poor baby isnt a criminal hes sick theres been some terrible mistake you cant keep him here and its all your fault and shes going to sue the officer smiled back at him youve been reading my mail maybe i can calm her down maybe she pushed a button on her desk and an instant later another uniformed officer this one a large white male pushed open the door at the other end of the room hardy thanked her and she gave him a shrug have fun she said when the guard unlocked the door to coles room hardy understood why seasoned jailbirds might try to pull some kind of scam to get a few days here it wasnt the ritz but it was far better than a shared cell at the jail behind the hall of justice a private room with a window and a television set now blessedly dark and silent suspended from the ceiling cole was propped halfway up in a hospital bed a clean sheet covering him to the waist wearing a standard hospital gown he might have been any badly beatenup patient except for the handcuffs which shackled him to the beds railing an older slightly more cornfed but not unattractive version of dorothy elliot sat holding his free hand on the window side of the bed knock if you have any trouble the guard said and closed the door hardy took a step forward and introduced himself dorothys friend thank god jody burgess exclaimed standing up coming around the bed with a kind of buoyantly expectant expression and both arms outstretched mr hardy she enthused dorothy told me what you did and i dont know how well ever be able to thank you she wore an expensivelooking baggy dark green jogging outfit with an unfamiliar logo over the left breast as she came closer hardy noted the carefullyapplied makeup dyed blonde hair and a lot of baubles costume jewelry earrings and bracelets rings with large colored stones on both hands he pegged her at sixtytwo or three going for forty without great success i didnt really do much hardy felt that he had in fact done nothing from what hed been told cole had been here in the hospital by the time hardy had arrived at the hall of justice yesterday afternoon he assayed a polite smile they would have gotten to testing your son mrs burgess but dont be so humble if you hadnt stepped in cole would still be over at the jail they wouldnt be taking care of him like this the womans effusiveness was slightly overwhelming she grabbed hardys hand in both of hers and held it tightly eventually freeing his hand he cast his eyes beyond her to the suspect he had to work to keep his tone neutral and youre cole how are you doing jody popped right in answering for her son hes going to be fine just fine arent you cole protectively she was moving back toward the bed i dont know mom i dont know if fine really covers it the young mans voice was deep with a raspy quality and a slight but recognizable defect in enunciation hardy knew the latter could be simple fatigue but more likely that it was the telltale slur of longterm drug use another day in that cell he said shaking his head i dont know they were going to let him die mrs burgess offered they just wanted him to suffer hardy shook his head told her a white lie i dont think so he said not intentionally anyway they dont do that then why they process a lot of people every day at the jail this was just one of the times somebody fell through the cracks the good news is we found out soon enough hardy saw that he was going to have to talk through jody and didnt know how long he was going to have the patience for it he addressed himself directly to cole so theyve got you on methadone its kicked in yeah again the mother its to help with the withdrawal pains the idea is to lessen the dose so his body gradually mom she stopped clamping her mouth tight with a pained expression im sorry i just want mr hardy to understand her voice trailed off hes probably got the idea to hardy right some he softened his inflection gave her another reassuring smile mrs burgess a pause jody id like a few minutes alone with cole if you dont mind it hurt her anew but there was no avoiding that her worried gaze fell on her son came back to hardy of course sure i understand but she didnt move until he prompted her just knock at the door and the guard will come and let you out we wont be too long shes all right really cole said when the door had closed behind his mother shes trying to help but now suddenly with the innocent mother out of the room hardy abruptly abandoned chitchat mode he might have wanted to spare some of her feelings but he felt no similar compunction toward her son moving down to the foot of the bed he rested his hands on the railing looked cole hard in the face spoke with a flat deliberateness tell me what happened the other night the change in tone met its mark the young man inhaled sharply shifted his eyes from side to side finally focused on the sheet in front of him it was bad hardy gave it a second then reached over and slapped the bed next to coles foot startled cole looked up hardys expression made him take another deep breath which he let out slowly through puffed cheeks i mean i was in bad shape it was cold as hell man i remember that i hadnt scored all day why not i had to get some money i thought i might go and hit up mom but then he sighed again then the cramps started to come on so i didnt want to go all the way out where she lives wheres that like judah out in the sunset i score at sixteenth and mission it was too far so you decided to mug somebody instead no it wasnt like that hardy gave him no reaction so he felt pressed to explain further look my last score mustve been heavily cut ok i mean i was shaking already cramping up you know it was like midnight id scored a couple of pills but they werent doing it i had to do something hardy waited so i lucked out one of the bums was crashed with his cart his cart shopping cart in this spot i dont know exactly where south of mission i think anyway he was passed out and had most of a whole bottle of bourbon by his head just lying there so i lifted it i needed something you know he let you take his whiskey no he was out already i lifted it you didnt hit him and take it come on cole actually appeared offended at the question nothing like that how about the gun did you threaten him with that i didnt have any gun his brow darkened for a minute not then did you get it from him too no then i dont think so you dont think so hardy repeated but he had no choice but to accept it for now all right then what then i guess i drank most of it the bottle where were you then a shrug just around i dont know i was hurtin i mean hurtin you hear me for the record cole youre not breaking my heart howd you get up to maiden lane but the lack of sympathy had its price i dont know man maybe i levitated huh maybe i took the monorail hardy straightened up you think this is funny huh youre looking at the rest of your life behind bars and youre getting wise with me hey cole went to hold up his hands in a gesture of innocence the handcuff on his left wrist brought him up short im just saying i dont remember getting uptown i drank the booze i got loaded i walked around tried to keep warm maybe id run into somebody i knew i dont know maybe score some g g god smack you know heroin and pay for it with what cole shook his head miserably i dont know it didnt happen anyway so what did happen did you see elaine come out of some building or just walking alone what elaine hardys temper flared elaine wager he snapped but then checked himself got his voice under control the woman youve confessed to killing elaine wager what about her i asked when you first saw her i dont really remember you know i told the cops this why dont you just tell me too whats the first thing you do remember the gun in my hand cole made eye contact like there it was where well i mean it was there on the street and i picked it up anybodyll give you money for a gun right so you remember picking up the gun and then what he closed his eyes shook his head ive been through this already then i guess leaning over her you guess what do you mean you guess did you see her walking did you come up behind her or was she already on the ground coles face was taut with the effort at recall i must have blanked it what does that mean you must have blanked it are you saying you blanked on pulling the trigger as though trapped in a cage the young man looked from side to side for an exit well i mean i had the gun then i was leaning over her and saw all the gold the necklace then her purse and the other stuff hardys hands were white on the beds railing you dont remember firing the gun no ever cole gave it some thought then shook his head no but the cop said it was common blanking the moment like people in car wrecks dont remember the last minute before what cop the guy who questioned me black dude banks i think his name was hardy tore his eyes from the pathetic young man and looked through the barred window to the gray afternoon outside traffic was stopped in both directions on the freeway rows of boxlike apartment buildings clung to a duncolored hill he wasnt going to find any solace in the view and after coles last words he needed some but cole he began quietly listen to me you confessed to killing her he nodded yeah but you dont remember stalking her firing the gun no none of that but i must have why do you say that cole stared down at the sheet covering him i shot the gun they tested my hands i shot the gun he brought his eyes up to hardy so i must have done it and by then i couldnt hold out any more anyway hold out on what this got an exasperated rise out of him hey come on what are we talking about elaine wagers death cole how about that but he was shaking his head no man were talking g they got me in that room and im coming down hard im dying you understand then banks tells me hell see he gets me something as soon as i say i did it so i told him that you killed her yeah he shrugged but hell i would have told him id shot kennedy if thats what he wanted to hear the chief assistant district attorney of the city and county of san francisco did not have a big office in fact gabriel torreys office was the same size as the other third floor offices which were shared two to a room by the rank and file assistant das the big difference was in the furnishings a sofa and matching armchairs of exquisitely soft leather builtin floortoceiling bookshelves plantation shutters twin original tiffany lamps a persian rug over the hardwood floor torrey had installed and of course there was also the desk a large custom crafted beautifully finished crosssection of redwood burl from an oldgrowth stand of trees that had been clear cut in the late s the desk had been a gift to torrey from the ceo of pacore timber in those days torrey was a young attorney working as a lobbyist in washington dc representing whatever clients were willing to pay him back then regardless of their political agenda the provenance of the desk was old news by now it was simply the stunning centerpiece of an intimidating workspace the oldtime das a handful of old white guys who remained from past administrations remembered the office from the days when art drysdale had been the chief ada back then it had been just like their own a mess battered green files sagging metal bookshelves that held binders full of active cases a cork bulletin board one wallmounted sixfoot length of twobyfour that held arts baseball memorabilia but gabriel torrey believed in the trappings of power the prosecutors who reported to him would never have cause to doubt that he was hugely important more so than they would ever be victims of crimes and their families would be reassured that their cases were being handled at the highest level other visitors to the office personal guests as well as opposing attorneys and political acquaintances were greeted not by a faceless bureaucrat but by an affable selfassured gentleman in total control of his world the subtext torrey thought was clear this man didnt get here in these surroundings by mistake he was a winner you crossed him at your peril now a halfhour after hed finished a wonderful lunch at la felce he sat behind the desk the jacket of his armani suit draped over the wooden valet behind him he wore a silk tie in deep maroon with gold threads over a starched shirt with a subtle purple hue on the sofa opposite him was a midthirties attorney named gina roake next to her on the cherry end table a cup of freshly brewed blue mountain coffee untouched was turning tepid ms roake was so angry that she couldnt have swallowed a drop to save her life she was representing another woman named abby oberlin in a will contest between abby and her brother jim and things had gotten beyond ugly but my client loved her mother mr torrey she managed to say shes the one who has taken care of her for the past seven years jim hasnt so much as visited in i dont know forever five years maybe more which is why her mother left abby the lions share of her estate yes of course and its valued at around eight million dollars thats right a lot of money torrey let the words sink in and all of it to your client less your fee of course this got ginas back up she chose not to respond to the latter comment but she was going to stick up for her client she took care of her mother and loved her jim is just a selfish she bit at her lip he is lying thats all there is to it there was no abuse abby didnt the words stopped torrey leaned forward he was in prosecutor mode and ginas client stood accused of a serious crime gina could protest about her innocence all day torrey would listen patiently conveying that hed heard all this before from other attorneys in other similar cases and in his vast experience most of them had done what the other family members had accused them of he spoke quietly but with a firm edge nevertheless your clients brother contends that the will is invalid that his mother signed it under coercion additionally he has reported this criminal conduct of his sister and this office is going to have no option but to pursue a vigorous prosecution but it makes no sense theres no evidence of torreys expression became even more stern as he interrupted he tapped a file folder on the desk in front of him dont play games with me ms roake there is a real case here her mother fell she broke her hip then she tried to get up too soon and fell again it happens yes it does and after the second fall she contracted pneumonia and died gina could not entirely keep the panic out of her voice youre not implying abby killed her are you or caused her death somehow even jims not saying that and hed stoop to anything to get some of the money torrey shook his head im not accusing your client of anything what i am saying is that weve got significant resources that we can and will bring to bear in this type of investigation prosecuting instances of abuse of the elderly is one of sharron pratts highest priorities we can and will subpoena your mothers medical records jim oberlin contends that he believes his mother was oversedated he sat back lawyer to lawyer look ms roake you know how it works investigators will talk to abbys friends if shes ever complained about all the work her mother required well of course she did shes not a saint im sure there were days gina roake shook her head even so torrey spread his hands wide as if to tell her thats what he meant it could look very bad for abby oberlin he let a silence gather and then sighed heavily a brief wash of compassion coming to his face ms roake gina did i not ask you to come and see me as a courtesy she nodded why do you think that is he patted the folder again when based on the accusations your clients brother has brought against her i would have been justified sending out some officers to place her under arrest under arrest thats right her name in the paper with the whole story everything jim has accused her of no you cant do that its not visibly she brought herself under control when she spoke after half a minute her voice was calm reasonable jim just wants money mr torrey he has no career hell never hold a job thats just who he is hes desperate abby didnt do anything he says torrey crossed his hands on the desk reapplied the stern visage you didnt answer my question she wrung her hands im sorry what was it again why do you think i asked you down here today i dont know well ill tell you the tone softened again ive prosecuted more cases like this than id care to tell you about and ive developed a good sense a very good sense if i may say so of how these things play out in this case there was verifiable physical trauma to abbys mother a finder of fact will conclude that there are grounds for a hearing and after that in all likelihood a fullfledged trial you know this your client probably will be arrested he held up a hand stopping her protest although bail will be reasonable shell spend if shes lucky about half a million dollars in attorneys fees experts investigation which is good news for you except that she wont be able to take any of it out of the estate while its being contested the process will take a minimum of two or three years out of your clients life and after all that even if we dont prove she did anything shes charged with some civil jury might give her brother all the money on the theory that definitely he did no harm and your client might have gina had all but collapsed back into the soft leather of the couch so what do you suggest she asked helplessly talking all but to herself he leaned forward suddenly friend and perhaps savior the truth is that i believe you jim doesnt care what happened to his mother beyond that she is dead thats what ive been but thats not saying he wont let all of this unpleasantness proceed from where i sit its a nolose situation for him and its nowin for your client she came forward on the sofa shes not going to give him any of the money mr torrey he doesnt deserve it hes an evil man and this is wrong the chief assistant nodded in agreement nevertheless if this prosecution moves forward the next time i see you we wont be talking like this he leveled his gaze at her tell your client that although its a repugnant solution if you throw a bone to her brother i believe you could settle his civil claim and if hes satisfied i dont think wed see any need to file a criminal case if i were her from a purely selfprotective even selfish motive id think about that but its so wrong torrey couldnt argue the point and didnt try be that as it may thats my advice while im still free to give it after today were on opposite sides gina roake stood and thanked torrey he told her he appreciated her coming by and hoped that she would come to the right decision and she told him shed discuss it with her client but they would both consider his advice very seriously then she left he could still hear her footsteps in the hallway outside as he picked up the telephone shairon pratt chose the moment with some care she had been invited to give a talk at the commonwealth club on her tenure to date as district attorney the offices most notable successes and failures the evolution of her philosophy on criminal justice and her plans for the future quite a few members of the media were on hand as well as many of the citys business and political elite it was an ideal setting quite a bit more hightoned than a hall of justice impromptu press conference a slam dunk of a photo op a chance to explain her absolutely unexpected position shift in word units longer than sound bytes because it had been playing so well in the business community and the newspapers for over two years she began with a recap of her offices continuing highmoraltone campaign against gironde industries the french company whose winning lowball bid for the million airport baggage carousels had rocked the board of supervisors and infuriated many of the largest and most wellconnected construction firms who did business in the city a foreign company like gironde wasnt about to be able to fulfill their contract without working with armies of local subcontractors sheet metal workers tile layers painters electricians brickmasons and so on these companies in turn named by gironde in their proposal had all guaranteed that they were in compliance with the citys minority subcontracting quota gabe torrey understood business far better than pratt did and he had alerted her to the likelihood of fraud in the negotiations gironde simply couldnt do the job for the amount that they had bid otherwise torreys opinion was that gironde hired subcontractors for the proposal period then laid them off immediately thereafter that none of the subs had anywhere near the mandated number of women or minorities hed bet that many had women or minorities as titular owners and were paid minimum wage gironde would put people on the payroll then give them a handful of cash to stay home and lie about working on the project pratt had taken it from there and the district attorneys office had gone to work with a vengeance convening a grand jury subpoenaing witnesses obtaining search warrants on the offending subcontractors seizing their records without warning bringing the frauds to light time and again it developed into a major story reporters soon discovered that gironde had human rights violations reported on jobs they had worked on in senegal in the caribbean in the philippines the owner of the company pierre coteau owned another company that sold animal furs how pratt demanded could a benevolent and liberal san francisco award a contract to such a despicable company at the request of the board of supervisors gironde was now preparing a revised second bid with a new list of subcontractors but the feeling in the board and in the city at large was so strong against them and in favor of pratt on this issue that no one believed they would keep the job and pratt concluded this is the kind of law i will continue to practice in my second term these are the kinds of people i will prosecute those who would unfairly take jobs from the honest citizens and hardworking business people of this city the applause washed over her she loved gironde it was the perfect san francisco prosecution not only was the issue one of high moral tone it had opened the coffers of local contractors who before gironde would not have given her the time of day and now having reminded everyone of that she moved to crime with the usual pablum that her staff had spun from the statistical flotsam garnered from any number of often conflicting sources taking whatever numbers made her look best theyd had setbacks early on she admitted but the numbers on violent crime were down in the last several months actually only in january but this number had been down enough that sharron could bring in november and december when crime had actually been up and the average would still be less than it had been in the late summer and early autumn they were sending more criminals to jail this was true because the das prosecutors were accepting pleas in exchange for shorter jail terms rather than taking criminals to trial this speeded up the process and let felons out of jail sooner but pratt could say they were sending more bad folks to the slammer she followed up by stating that she was accomplishing all of her good works in spite of the continuing lack of cooperation from the police department during her last election campaign shed fashioned some minor unproven and isolated allegations of police brutality into a major plank of her platform she was going to seek out and prosecute bad cops she was going to create a task force she was going to bust the good old boy network of redneck cops never mind that the san francisco police department was fully integrated as to gender and race at all levels of command and also had fewer police brutality incidents or complaints than any other city of comparable size in the united states the district attorneys office pratt concluded was functioning with an efficiency that is the envy of every other bureaucracy in the city and county of san francisco she looked out over the crowd deciding that she had them that the time was ripe lifting some pages from the podium she dropped them onto the table next to her all that said she continued it must be admitted now that with hindsight i can see that some of the outreach programs initiated by my office in the early days of this administration and with the best of intentions may not have achieved the success that i hoped for a palpable sense of expectation swept the room suddenly people were sitting up straighter paying attention she paused significantly lifted her chin steeled her gaze in preparation for coming to talk to all of you today late last week i had written the usual political speech to tell you how well were doing and in fact as ive indicated there are areas of success to which we can point with pride now though im going to leave my prepared remarks please bear with me as i speak from my heart last weekend the city suffered a terrible loss im speaking of course of elaine wager not only the daughter of our late beloved senator but in her own right one of the great lights in the citys firmament pratt paused for a sip of water gathered herself and went on one of the most difficult lessons ive had to learn on the prosecution side of the bar is that there is real evil cast among us my training and background has led me to try and understand the causes of antisocial behavior and to seek solutions through incarceration yes but also through counseling and education i remain proud of the programs weve adopted that seek to temper justice with mercy that have tried to inject compassion and understanding into the judicial process but the events of the past few days have brought home some hard truths and today i am here to deliver a message that may have become blurred in my administrations zeal for fairness tolerance and empathy for desperate people who are driven to desperate acts and that message is this people who break the law in san francisco are going to be punished pratt let the substantial round of applause wash over her took another sip of water then waited for silence when it came she spoke in a voice thick with conviction it was time to go into campaign mode there are those who say that i am soft on crime that i am too compassionate to fulfill the duties of district attorney to those people let me announce what may be correctly interpreted as a sea change in the policy of this administration the police have arrested a man a homeless man a drug addict who has confessed to the murder of elaine wager a murder in the course of which he took her purse jewelry and other possessions california law defines murder in the commission of a robbery as a special circumstances crime and prescribes only two possible penalties life in prison without the possibility of parole and death pratt was aware of the drama of the moment the silence in the room was perfect even the waiters were still hanging on her conclusion i want there to be no mistake it is the intention of the district attorney to seek the death penalty in this case this is the word im putting out to the criminal element in this city the line that today i draw in the sand street violence all violent crime stops here the law will be enforced for as long as i remain district attorney here is the policy of my office if you are unfortunate or dispossessed mercy will still have its place her hands gripped either side of the podium as she looked out over the multitude but if you break the law justice will trump mercy every she brought down her fist single again the fist time after a short stunned silence a man at one of the front tables began to applaud and it was as though a dam had broken the ensuing ovation brought the entire dining room to its feet sick of conjuring with imponderables hardy called a fifteenminute recess for himself he stood up stretched and walked to the window late afternoon a listless gray day downtown he and frannie had their traditional wednesday date night scheduled to begin in a couple of hours and hardy was tempted to call it a day and go wait for his wife at the shamrock discuss some philosophical conundrums with his brotherinlaw moses who would be working behind the bar he could have an early cocktail on the theory that it was always five oclock somewhere he wasnt getting anything done here that was for sure his reaction to mondays problems with glitsky and the jail had settled uneasily enough but after his visit with cole burgess yesterday the whole business lay curdling in his stomach something was very wrong but he really didnt want to get involved any further he was too close to it one way or the other also he didnt want to risk a serious rupture in his friendship with abe over a lowlife such as cole burgess to say nothing of the logistical problems hed doubtlessly have with his friends jeff and dorothy and her difficult mother when the dust cleared he was all but certain that cole would cut some kind of deal and get low double digits in the state prison every homicide was a manslaughter to pratts trialshy prosecutors even the public defender called the citys system a plea bargain mill best case cole might even get out of san quentin with his habit broken in any event it wasnt hardys problem what was his problem right now though was dash logan the damned guy was proving harder to contact than the pope and hardys client rich mcneil was understandably losing some patience in the mideighties mcneil had just turned fifty and decided to invest his pension plan money in san francisco real estate he could have done better with microsoft but back then the stock market made him nervous in any event he wasnt complaining the sixteenunit apartment building on russian hill had cost a hefty million when he purchased it for a quarter million down its most recent appraisal pegged its value at six million plus rich was now sixtyfour years old primed to sell the thing and retire so here he was this nice guy and good citizen whod worked and saved the way good americans were supposed to and instead of some carefree years of leisure he was suddenly looking at some very serious trouble a year and a half ago hed finally succeeded in evicting manny gait whod been a tenant in the building for nearly ten years the tenant from hell as it turned out the first sign of trouble was when he painted his entire unit including the windows black when mcneil had demurred politely requesting gait at least to leave the outer windows clear gait had not so politely declined it was his fuckin place he said mcneil could go piss up a rope to say that san franciscos rent control laws favor tenants over landlords is to say that custer favored southern belles over the ogalala sioux so when hardys client explored the possibility of evicting mr gait over the paint job he found that this would be legally impossible gait had his five rooms he paid his fourhundred dollars every month and as far as the law was concerned that apartment was his and at that price until he gave it up on his own which he wasnt inclined to do over the years gaits one unit became a constant source of dissatisfaction to the other tenants as well and a regular feature of mcneils life became dealing with complaints about loud noises awful odors unsavory people gaits apartment was just inside the front door to the building on the ground floor and he decided it was a safer place to keep his harley than in the garage though he ostensibly and sporadically worked as a bouncer he once boasted to mcneil that he really got his money for gas rent and beer his only necessities selling or brokering crack and dope deals to other bikers the man himself was a giant a vulgar terrifying neanderthal with an enormous gut a voluminous unkempt beard and a shaved head he dressed perennially in black tshirts and leathers boots and chains if he bathed at all but no he couldnt have and smelled the way he did the only problem mcneil had with turnover in his building were the units adjacent to gaits over the years the average tenancy in these units despite the great location the cooperative landlord the reasonable rents was ten months finally one happy day eighteen months ago gait had suddenly disappeared mcneil didnt receive his rent check by the tenth of the month which was the statutory grace period he immediately served written notice and filed to evict under normal conditions in san francisco mcneil would have had to wait six months or more before any action would be taken on the filing but the unprecedented support of every other tenant in the building all of whom personally showed up for the hearing convinced the judge that this was an extraordinary situation and he ruled in mcneils favor when he opened the door to the apartment even mcneil whod expected the worst wasnt prepared for the damage the place was totaled eventually it took a crew of four men fortysix days to restore the apartment to habitability the removal of debris alone was a weeklong process after that it had to be cleaned deodorized cleaned again mcneil had had to install new hardwood floors and drywall new lights and fixtures all new kitchen appliances finally after the new paint was dry when the work was all done at a cost to mcneil of thirtyone thousand dollars and change he put it on the market for two thousand four hundred dollars per month and had eleven qualified renters the first day then gait returned he hassled mcneil for a few months came to his house a few times once with some biker friends scared everybody made a big stink eventually went away and rich had thought the nightmare was over at last but three weeks ago after all this time gait had resurfaced and in a guise beyond mcneils worst imaginings according to the complaints both civil and criminal filed in the courts gait came home to shock and dismay that he had been put out of his castle contrary to his landlords sworn statements he had not abandoned the property as mr mcneil well knew hed had to leave with his harley on an emergency road trip to kentucky to care for his dying mother before he left town he had paid mcneil twelve hundred dollars in cash for three months rent in case he had to be gone that long upset worried about his mothers health in a hurry to be back at her side he had not concerned himself about a receipt for the transaction he was a man of his word and assumed mcneil was as well theyd had a relationship for years it never occurred to him that either one of them would cheat the other he was stunned upon his return to find that rich mcneil had stolen his money taken away his home disposed of all his treasures after all gait had been a solid rentpaying tenant he had never not once missed a rent payment and now he was ruined with no place he could afford to live in the city he loved mcneil had obviously been driven to this inhuman fraud by simple greed after all he stood to make he was currently making two thousand dollars more every month on gaits apartment alone it was a horrible travesty so gait through his attorney dash logan was appealing the eviction ruling he was also suing mcneil to get his apartment back at the old rent to restore his lost property to compensate him for mental anguish the pain and suffering hed endured for his attorneys fees and for punitive damages to the tune of a million dollars what made it worse for hardys client though far worse were the criminal charges like everything else in san francisco rent control was a political issue and in her election campaign three years before sharron pratt had made it clear that she hated slum landlords nearly as much as she loved the homeless her administration had pledged itself to protecting the rights of the poor the unempowered the disenfranchised masses besides which renters in the city constituted a huge voting bloc and here was a russian hill nabob pitted against an unsympathetic biker it was the perfect opportunity to illustrate just how venal these landlords could be in their immoral pursuit of the almighty buck hardy knew mcneil well and considered his client pretty much a working stiff whod put in thirtyfive hard years behind desks in various management positions eventually reaching the eminence of executive vice president of terranew industries a biotech firm specializing in the everglamorous field of fertilizer products but in sharron pratts opinion rich mcneil by the very fact that hed been successful and invested wisely was of the landed class the privileged class never mind that hed earned it that was irrelevant and manny gait was low class in fact in the eyes of many he was barely a citizen at all this conflict boiled down to a class struggle it was as simple as that traditionally as pratt knew and if she forgot gabe torrey reminded her the rich mcneils of the world got their way by being in the mens club by having the money to afford better lawyers by buying elected officials to do their bidding and dirty work well as torrey had counseled her she couldnt let that happen on her watch nosiree it wasnt going to be business as usual in san francisco not while she was district attorney thats why shed been elected to shake up the status quo to ring in a new age she had to make the message crystal clear that her office saw through rich mcneils transparent grab for more income more money that he didnt even need pratt had to be the peoples protector here and this was her chance to show the traditional power structure that the old way wasnt going to work more than a landlordtenant dispute this had to be by her lights true whitecollar crime the kind that was too often tolerated in american society and she had committed herself to punish it so the city and county of san francisco brought criminal charges against rich mcneil grand theft perjury conspiracy to commit fraud if it went to jury trial and if he was convicted on all counts rich mcneil could be facing four years in state prison it was not the retirement hed dreamed of hardy was just turning from the window intending to throw a couple of rounds of darts when the telephone rang on his desk dismas hardy dismas the voice said what the hell kind of name is dismas its the name my parents gave me the good thief on calvary who is this the good thief thats great dismas dash logan here sorry its taken so long to get back at you ive been busy as a onelegged man in an asskicking contest hardy bit back a sarcastic reply i wont take much of your time then as i mentioned in my messages im representing rich mcneil and i thought we could a short barking laugh interrupted him from the falsely hale sound on the phone hardy formed the impression that logan might already have downed a cocktail or two oh sorry the voice said somebody said something there were unmistakable bar noises in the background ricky martin and the la vida loca so youre with mcneil and his fifteen witnesses hardy replied to what another disconnected laugh clearly logan was following another conversation or something going on in front of him on me on me jerry you let him pay ill break your arm look hardy interrupted if this isnt a good time no its fine fine im just down here at jupiter you know the place hardy did and said so a few blocks south of the hall of justice the bar was kind of the uptempo version of lou the greeks great fast food loud music bartenders with personality a major hangout of the law crowd serious drinker division you free cause im here a while meeting a client the voice shifted another focus yeah youre talking to the duck i heard it back to the phone so hardy what do you say come on down ill buy you a drink ive got clients too mr logan some other time maybe but id really like to talk with you anytime anytime you thinking you want to settle actually were talking more about a crosscomplaint this really seemed to strike logan as funny get out for what thats one of the things i thought wed discuss thatll be a short talk maybe maybe not hardy heard ice tinkling in his ear he felt a pulse in his temple this kind of posturing could go on forever and he wasnt up to it today mr logan he began but again the voice cut him off dash please everybody calls me dash david freeman appeared at his door and hardy held up a finger hed be right with him back to the phone so is there a time that might work better for you im here almost every day this time beyond that its pretty wide open but if youre not talking settlement he let that hang i think thats premature yeah but they crank up the criminal charges its going to be much more expensive first they have to prove them which they cant do yeah well thats what everyone thinks then they do just a friendly reminder ill keep it in mind ill be here the line went dead hardy clutched at the phone realizing that hed finally managed to connect with dash logan only to fail to discuss anything substantive about his clients case or even to make an appointment to meet with him he looked down at the receiver thanks a lot he said dash dash hmm freeman moved forward into the office that would have been the inimitable mr logan i presume either him or his impersonator hardy said and about as cooperative as youd led me to expect suddenly freemans appearance in his office struck him as the unusual occurrence it was so what brings you up here to the nosebleed seats dont tell me phyllis quit and you wanted me to be the first to know no that couldnt be it youd have brought champagne not that freeman said dear phyllis is still with us hardy shrugged ok then i give up freeman didnt answer right away and that in itself was instructive hands in his pockets he slouched his way across to the window where he stared down for a moment then turned and leaned back against the sill you may recall this morning we spoke about your involvement with cole burgess noninvolvement hardy corrected him i was just going down to talk to him at the hospital get his side of what happened i did end of story so youre not representing him hardy began to shake his head no then narrowed his eyes at the old man what happened he asked and the questions continued to tumble out he tried to kill himself didnt he he did kill himself no somebody else killed him didnt they tell me it wasnt glitsky freeman had to chortle easy diz easy hes alive as far as i know but my trained legal mind cant help but notice that you seem to harbor a little concern for him not really that a defensive shrug then he gave it up i came away not exactly convinced that the confession is righteous in what way he was in withdrawal and they promised him relief he would have confessed to killing his mother hell he might have actually killed his mother if they asked him to in any event it ought to be on the tape freeman shook his head knowingly no it wont no cop is that dumb they make the promise off camera then sweat him on it he straightened up and sighed heavily either way though whether he did it or not the boys got worse problems than he had this morning thatd take some doing well listen up evidently some doing got done freeman filled him in on sharron pratts speech at the commonwealth club by the end of the recital hardy had lowered himself down into a chair opposite the couch his expression was one of shock and disbelief he finally managed a word death freeman nodded unequivocally and the arraignment is tomorrow morning but pratts never even asked for specials before she is now she called it a sea change in her policy get tough get votes hardy still couldnt imagine it but he has no priors theyd never ask for death on a guy with no record freeman had no reply but hardy kept arguing death isnt possible for any number it is if she can prove first degree with specials but she can never hope to get a jury to do that even if he did kill elaine he was drunk or stoned or both at the time everybody admits that even the cops so you got a guy with no priors and serious psychiatric and substance issues they dont get death its just not doable maybe not assuming hes got a good attorney it was getting dark outside and the room wasnt bright but freemans eyes shone in the dimness dont give me that look david all innocence freeman spread his hands no look he said i didnt say he didnt do it hardy filled his lungs and let out the air in a whoosh i said i thought his confession might have been coerced thats not saying he didnt do it theres a lot of other evidence im sure there is freeman waited his basset eyes unmoving but the death penalty she cant go there hardy said calmly thats just flat wrong i thought you might feel that way the old mans poker face gave nothing away even his eyes had gone flat you dont want the case im on it but youre already there he thinks hes your client youve successfully defended death penalty cases before you hate pratt and everything she stands for especially this decision hardy stood up abruptly walked over to his desk tapped it a few times with his knuckles then turned back to face the old man so what am i going to do freeman nodded i guess thats what i came up here to find out glitsky left the office early carrying the videotape that contained the burgess confession tucked into the inside pocket of his heavy shepherds jacket back home at a few minutes after five he walked purposefully through the kitchen and down the hallway to the room on the left that had until recently been orel and jacobs bedroom now jacob was nineteen and living in milan the halfblack cops son actually getting small parts as an operatic baritone isaac abes eldest boy had left the home too he was now a senior at ucla majoring in economics pulling down a straight a average orel had moved down the hall to isaacs old room he walked the few steps over to the vcr punched the power button pulled the videotape from his pocket suddenly some sense of the place stopped him his shoulders settled imperceptibly he laid the tape on top of the television raised his eyes to glance around the room he closed his eyes feeling it the way it was only yesterday though that was four years ago the two boys had their bunk beds against that wall where the couch was now and here at the oak entertainment center had been the pair of backtoback desks where they did homework and piled their stuff there had been junk everywhere hockey sticks and football pads every type of ball in the known world sports and music posters all over the walls the ineradicable smell the incessant noise isaac still at home his room down the hall the growing boys filling every speck of the place with life with potential and flo flo singing in the kitchen or humming quietly at the livingroom table where she did the bills she was always singing or humming shed had a beautiful voice a deep and rich contralto glitsky was sure that was where jacob got his his wife hadnt really been much of a softie but she had loved melodic ballads show tunes over the rainbow till there was you the rose her favorite song from the day hed met her was unchained melody it was as though the song were part of her very being shed be combing her hair unaware that she was singing and abe would stop whatever he was doing caught in it he made it a point to keep his guard up but now somehow it had fallen standing there in his boys old bedroom inside a memory he never consciously decided to dredge up he started to allow himself to hear her singing it once again oh my love my darling the room came up at him he put a hand to his eyes lord he whispered blindsided he found himself over on the couch wondering what had hit him at the same time knowing what it was finally amazed in some way that these bouts occurred as infrequently as they did it was elaines death he decided stirring up all the other gunk that and the treya ghent interview this morning that still nagged at him too not only the lack of any tangible result about the burgess case but the reaction hed had to her the door to his office the foolish immature way hed handled the visit from hardy who deserved better than that he wasnt under constant attack here at home he couldnt be seen didnt have to work so hard to hide whatever might be troubling him so all of it flo and the older kids being gone elaine everything all of it had bubbled over for a minute here where it was safe that was all it had been ok now he had himself back under control he was in his tv room it wasnt some loaded mnemonic weapon it was four walls a window door and closet some inexpensive durable new furniture in three steps he was back at the vcr where he inserted the tape and turned on the television frannie reached hardy before hed left the office shed heard of a great new restaurant that they needed to try and shed been able to get lastminute reservations so instead of the shamrock for their date could he meet her at the redwood room in the clift hotel since this was less than a dozen blocks from where he worked he told her he thought it might be possible no promises but a pretty good chance well i shall arrive in ribbons and curls at seven sharp she said in her most cultured highbritish tones if youre not there to meet me someone else will ask for my company and i expect ill have to go off with another escort i expect you would he replied drily its the great curse of a certain superficial charm the swarms of men i can only imagine though ones heart is set on ones husband of course he shall then redouble his efforts to be prompt in that event sir i shall reward those efforts ones heart soars at the possibilities until then then until then ciao smiling he put the receiver in its cradle he hadnt moved a muscle when the phone rang again he snatched it back up dismas hardy and glitsky was on the line speaking without preamble what are you doing just a moment let me check i seem to be talking on the telephone are you going to be there for a while im meeting frannie in an hour and a half thats enough time for what to see the burgess tape hardy sat forward his hands suddenly tight around the receiver what about it i brought it home just watched it through for the first time compared it to the initial incident reports i thought youd like to take a look at what ive got this was highly unusual hardy and glitsky might be friends but the police did not make evidence available to defense attorneys that role called discovery was the exclusive providence of the district attorney but hardy wasnt about to look a gift horse in the mouth the video of the confession he said you could probably talk me into it there was an emptiness in the line then glitsky cleared his throat i also wanted to apologize all right if that was it its accepted you should know that ive got a few questions of my own glitsky responded with a long silence then i can be there in a half hour the confession was near the end of the sixth hour of tape cole was speaking in a voice thick with fatigue the camera was on him the whole time one continuous shot of an exhausted man sitting at a table in a small room patiently reciting his part without any animation it took seven minutes to watch it once they immediately rewound and were midway through the second viewing when hardy stopped the picture here he said right here he pressed play again on the screen cole was answering an interrogators question about the actual moment of the shooting i dont know im maybe ten feet behind her shes just turned into the alley the interogator asked what he did next she just got in the shadow so it was real dark go on what do you want me to say just what happened tell us in your own words what happened ok a long hesitation i shot her is that a question i dont know if you shot her you tell me did you shoot her coles confused eyes flicked somewhere out of the cameras line of vision then came back yeah i did i shot her then when she got in the shadow and what did you do then well she fell and i i remember i walked over to her she was this shape on the pavement so i crossed over to her and then the purse and the necklace and so on what about the gun the gun oh yeah i put it down on the street for a minute the necklace i needed two hands then the cop car hit me with the light and i remembered i had to get the gun and then then i started running the two men were watching maintaining an uneasy silence on either end of the couch hardy hit the remote and the screen went black he spoke into the air in front of them close contact wound the gun was right up against her head right and she didnt fall hard she was wearing hosiery that would have ripped or run or something somebody did her right next to her then caught her and laid her down not somebody glitsky answered burgess hardy threw him a skeptical look maybe maybe not but if cole was ten feet behind her and as drunk as we know he was how did he put one shot perfectly into the exact base of her skull in the dark with a gun just three inches long hardy thought hed serve his client better by being straight with glitsky than by keeping the letter of the attorneyclient privilege he told me he didnt remember shooting the gun but thought he must have thought he must have glitsky dipped into his own well of skepticism theres a phrase did he mention why they ran gsr gunshot residue analysis and he had it on his hands im not surprised glitsky said drily he fired the gun thats why a pause probably twice in fact probably twice talk about a phrase hardy looked him a question abe gave it up youll find out anyway one of the arresting officers medrano says in his report that the gun went off when they were chasing him went off yeah well abe while were talking fascinating turns of phrase the gun went off thats a funny way to put it dont you think no response hardy continued youre a street cop in a dark alley with one body already down youre on foot after a fleeing suspect the adrenalines off the charts and youre on full alert right youre telling me you hear a gunshot but youre sure the gun just went off it wasnt a shot at your own self but youre positive enough that you dont shoot back i dont think so its a stretch glitsky said its more than that abe hardy was fiddling with the remote again now on top of that weve got this this is the part i really dont like cole was back up on the screen i i remember i walked over to her she was this shape on the pavement so i crossed over to her hardy stopped the tape gave glitsky his full face notice hes says i remember what i think is that right here suddenly cole came back to what he really remembered not what ridley banks wanted him to say did you hear he says he crossed over to her does that sound like something youd say if youd just shot somebody point blank from behind and while were on that how does a drunk junkie get close enough to elaine wager in a dark alley to press a gun to the back of her head if it was a street mugging he grabs her purse and runs the lieutenant nodded ambiguously hardy could hear glitskys heavy nearly labored breathing and suddenly he needed to stand up walking over to his dartboard he pulled the three customs from it walked to the tape line on the floor and threw them back where theyd been sliding a haunch back onto his desk he looked across at his friend somebody hit her abes eyes met hardys cole burgess really glitsky raised his eyes let out a long breath the confessions bad thats all ridley got a little too enthusiastic sweating him it was my fault i gave him the message hardys mind raced over the variables in the situation it was ugly from any angle if pratt hadnt already formally charged cole with special circumstances murder and it wouldnt surprise him to learn that shed rushed the paperwork through shed at least gone public with her position more shed made it the centerpiece of her new campaign in the citys reality there was no chance that she would be flexible this meant that the progress of coles prosecution was no longer in abes jurisdiction the police had done their job arresting a guilty suspect if now the department hesitated even slightly after cole had already confessed there would be no end to the political ramifications hardy wanted to offer some solace but the pickings were slim as the head of homicide glitsky had overreacted leading his troops into unsafe and even forbidden territory as a result a man was looking at the death penalty and some of the evidence might be tainted and nobody could afford to question it in public glitsky got up he walked over to the windowand stood looking down into the darkened street you all right abe the confession cant be part of it it might be more than that glitsky knew what hardy was implying but he shook his head no dont kid yourself diz its burgess all right and now ive jeopardized taking him down when he spoke again it was all but to himself im too close i cant be in this what do you mean hardy asked glitsky turned to him i mean why elaine thats what i keep thinking about why elaine hardy couldnt remember ever seeing abe so distraught so downright human even while his wife was dying he had kept his public facade in place and now he was in visible pain his wifes theory on the nature of glitskys true involvement with elaine wager teased at hardy i didnt realize you two were that close glitskys head went down he parted the blinds with his fingers let them go when he raised his head again he was biting at his lip he stared ahead into nothing all right he said at last and told him frannie wore a basic black cocktail dress pearls spaghetti straps over her lovely shoulders which were often lightly freckled during the summer but now midwinter the color of cream her bright red hair was severely pulled back held with a thick gold ribbon she was waiting at the bar one knee crossed over the other a lot of fine leg showing the enormous highceilinged redwood room paneled with an entire trees worth of wood hence its name is one of the more elegant and festive locations in a city that is packed with them standing in the rooms doorway catching sight of his beautiful wife listening to the firstrate piano music hardy could almost for a moment forget the case that now that hed seen the confession promised to dominate his life for at least the near future he fancied that this was the way san francisco used to be or if not that surely how it liked to remember itself hardy wore jeans and corduroys with his sweatshirts around the house but he gloried in the fact that he lived among people who sometimes dressed for dinner who lived a bit on the large side of life celebrating the good things in it thank god but it wasnt just the physical confidence on display wherever he looked this room was an oasis in the vast desert of cultural vulgarity it fairly buzzed with energy and optimism sure but that was because there wasnt one television set to assault your peace and insult your intelligence no advertising posters desecrated the walls he loved the place he loved his wife for thinking to meet here for the reservations shed made to wherever the great new place might turn out to be unconsciously he straightened his tie checked himself in the mirror thinking that it was just plain neat to be a part of this san francisco at the turn of the new millennium he crossed to his wife kissed her and got kissed back pulled a seat at the bar gave a last expansive glance around at the glorious room this is the way the world should be you know that the new place was called charles nob hill hardy gave it a ten they sat at a table for two in an alcove of their own the waiter won their hearts by having the same name vincent as their son young knowledgeable not too funny he had mastered the art of appearing when needed and otherwise being invisible the restaurants walls were soft to the touch upholstered with the candlelight and muted golden color scheme a burnished glow filled the room hardy had eaten foie gras on portpoached figs then slices of rare duck breast over some ambrosial vegetables frannie her raw oysters and salmon now they were holding hands over the table splitting a decadent chocolate torte while they savored the last sips of their excellent pinot noir i still cant get over it frannie said or why he didnt tell us he never even told her frannie she was shaking her head but i really dont understand that how could he not tell his own daughter maybe he thought it wouldnt help her to know hardy sipped his wine he didnt know himself until a few years ago he didnt want to intrude but his wife had no doubt she would have wanted to know she would have dealt with it somehow and abe and loretta wager the senator theres that too the political side not exactly abes long suit i think youd agree although he now seems to be in it up to his neck hardy nodded at least that far maybe even over his head where he cant breathe i hope not they fiddled with the dessert crumbs frannie sighed so what is he going to do now follow up try to get pratt not to use the confession and that isnt going to happen then what i dont know resign maybe abe wont resign the jobs his life he talked about it it would be a stand against pratt i dont see that what i see is that shed love the brutal cops manhandling the poor but guilty suspect shed play it both ways suddenly she put down her fork and stared across the table at her husband dismas she might even prosecute him hell be ok fran hes a survivor but she was shaking her head again im not worried about him surviving its how hes going to live hes not exactly mr cheerful on his best day now without a job without something to do her voice faded away and i suppose if pratt goes ahead you will too he nodded i already called dorothy and jeff at least ive got to do the arraignment and when is that that would be tomorrow morning he made a face i cant let pratt hang this kid on bad evidence and of course that means your claim will have to be that somebody else killed elaine looks like so you and abe she gathered herself drank off the last drops in her wine glass well maybe you both can try taking care of each other but he shook his head making light of her worries it wont come to that abe and i dont she pointed a finger at him please dont say youre bulletproof i never would he replied thats david freeman not me i am merely methodical and fabulously competent those are useful traits now why dont you use them to make vincent materialize so we can go home and get to bed citytalk by jeffrey elliot in a highlypublicized talk before the commonwealth club yesterday afternoon district attorney sharron pratt put on a new hat and like the others shes tried on in her bedeviled administration this one doesnt fit her too well either yesterdays reincarnation of our most chameleonlike elected official featured herself as the toughtalkin straightshootin crimestoppin avenger of evil in our fair city and about time too with a new election coming up this fall and her poll numbers at an alltime low ms pratt needed something to perk up her fuzzyheaded liberal image and lackluster conviction rate although she has gone to bat bigtime for the interests of her political cronies and contributors especially in the ongoing gironde matter at this rate we may never have a finished airport this district attorney has declined to prosecute any number of lower profile offenses including prostitution recreational drug use vagrancy trespassing vandalism especially graffiti tagging which she terms a creative expression of underprivileged youth and many others up to and including murder if it appears the death might have been motivated by the proper political position if its not ms pratts kind of law shes not going to prosecute anyone for breaking it nevertheless yesterdays talk marked a breakthrough as it seemed to acknowledge for the first time that at least part of her job as the citys chief prosecutor is to put criminals behind bars actually in a flurry of hyperbole she took things rather farther than that actually going so far as to ask for the death penalty for the young man who is accused though note not yet convicted of killing former assistant district attorney elaine wager the mans name is cole burgess he is my brotherinlaw he is twentyseven years old a college graduate a homeless person and a heroin addict though he has confessed to the crime he does not remember committing it he expects to plead not guilty and a jury will have to convict him then sentence him to death to do so it will have to ignore the mans blood alcohol level as well as the fact that he was suffering from heroin withdrawal the jury will need to overlook that except for drugs cole burgess has little criminal history much less a history of violence he is no worse than two dozen other murderers where ms pratt has declined to ask for special circumstances much less death and yet she has already passed her verdict on mr burgess and has rendered her judgement politics dictate that she must call for the death penalty the district attorney has chosen well the first victim of her war on crime cole burgess isnt going to have many defenders a straight white male he is politically unconnected in our balkanized burg as a homeless man he is already hated by the majority of san franciscos citizens who have grown weary of panhandlers and bums as a heroin addict he is confused outcast and without hope one is hard pressed to believe that ms pratt does not know all this and has not considered it cynically but it will get her votes and shes going to need every last one she should be ashamed of herself although it wasnt ten blocks from his own duplex glitsky had never before been to the home of the chief of the inspectors bureau captain frank batiste now still before eight this miserable morning he found himself shrouded in fog ringing the doorbell on the front porch of a charming victorian house on cherry street hed passed from the sidewalk up through a trimmed yard a couple of matching white wicker chairs claimed some proprietary spots on the porch thriving plants sprouted out of pots all over the place for a fleeting moment he felt a stab of envy batiste had been glitskys immediate predecessor as head of homicide other cops whose careers had followed pretty much the same trajectory as his own how could they live in such serenity how did they get there not that his place was a dump he didnt think so anyway it was clean but the thought unwelcome in any case got interrupted by the door opening batistes honest face his hand outstretched hey abe youre the first one here come on in sorry to bother you at home frank a get real look please you want some coffee no i remember batiste snapped his fingers tea earl grey ok better than that good they walked the long hallway to the back glitsky vaguely aware of the family pictures all along the wall the dozens of sports trophies on a long thin table hed known frank for twenty years and was hardly aware that he was married much less the father of what looked to be at least four kids in the kitchen a huge black lab lay sprawled by the back door thats arlene batiste said crossing over to her petting her head she wont bite in fact she probably wont move she might be dead im not sure he grabbed a handful of pelt and pulled it back and forth arlene you dead yet the giant old dog opened one eye and batiste lit right up whoa arlene putting on a show for our guest now arent you he turned to abe she must like you then an afterthought not dead after hed left hardys office the previous night abe had paid a call on his old wise father nat theyd shot things around awhile and when theyd finished abe had called the captain he and batiste had served together in the homicide detail they had a long professional history and understood each other especially in their shared belief that politics sucked in the past couple of years glitsky had realized with certainty that in spite of his exalted rank frank was at odds with the movers in the department the chief dan rigby inhabited a different landscape seldom venturing from the rarified air of policy money budgets numbers arrest rates diversity issues rigby interfaced with the other city departments the mayors office the da all the crap for which glitsky had no use and in this he was sure that batiste was still a cops cop and hence his ally which was why hed finally called him and laid out his role in this situation clearly and without any excuses he admitted that things had gone wrong in the burgess case from the very beginning and it had largely been because of him his influence his attitude abe didnt feel he could do much in the way of correcting things until hed first cleared the slate with his coworkers with batiste medrano and petrie with ridley banks that matter of honor was his priority after that he could take his fight anywhere else he needed but not without telling his men first he also wanted the coroner john strout to hear what he had to say so batiste had suggested the early morning meet it was a modern kitchen and batiste moved about it easily he produced a genuine whistling kettle then a teapot he spooned leaves from a porcelain canister into a silver ball and closed it up dropping it into the pot be a minute he said then added without missing a beat so this things going to heat up he wasnt talking about the kettle arms crossed and face set batiste stood leaning against his kitchen counter the rest of them had taken seats around a battered plank wooden kitchen table that had seen a zillion meals the remnants of some recent ones still remained glitsky finished his spiel and scratched at a petrified lump of ketchup waiting for the reactions judging from the body language and the palpable air of tension in the room they were not going to be positive arlene still not dead groaned in the agonies of some dog dream inspector ridley banks scraped his chair forward straightening up at the table his face was a dark mask the voice strained the man confessed abe on tape he admits he shot her thats right and thats why were here rid glitsky didnt blame ridley for his fury he had given his lieutenant what he had wanted now because of it he was screwed the message here today is that the buck stops with me on this one im taking the heat if we dump the confession ridley said this of course wasnt the job of the police but glitsky knew what he meant if we go to the da yeah and you want to run by me again why we want to do that ridleys insubordinate tone would ordinarily have drawn a rebuke but not today because of what i just told you glitsky replied there are problems matching what burgess said with what apparently happened so what theres always problems the guy confessed he had the gsr as batiste had noted things were heating up its not about guilt rid nobodys talking about guilt but theres going to be a hearing on the confession and im going to tell the truth ridley glared youre saying im not no im not saying that you werent in the room abe i was i saw the tape rid i know what i told you to do and i did it by the book its my ass on guys guys easy this was batiste stepping in i think the point is were trying to get clear here on the confession isnt that right abe glitsky nodded excuse me sir ridley hadnt cooled off much he was talking to batiste not abe i must be missing something i got a confession from this dirtball anybody see on the tape where im telling him he gets some smack if he talks no no i dont think so what im an idiot nobodys saying that rid glitsky again no thats funny cause it sounds like youre saying i made him lie then tried to hide it off tape no only that he should have been cleared by the paramedics and i ordered otherwise uhuh no banks wasnt having it you didnt sweat him i did its me on the tape and its a righteous confession i dont think so glitsky said a good chunk of what he said is just wrong he said he crossed over to her after she was shot he remembered she was this lump on the ground the lanky coroner figured it was time he got on the boards meeting the eyes of the men around the table he stretched out his arms and cracked his knuckles inserting his laconic drawl into the silence she was shot with the gun right up against her hair there wasnt no abrasions on her knees legs anywheres she was laid down gentle as you please glitsky the voice of reason burgess was drunk as a lord ridley if hed tried to hold her up and let her down easy hed have fallen with her maybe he did the inspector replied he fell under her broke her fall he turned to strout no abrasions then am i right john strout cast a glance at glitsky it could have happened banks continued i really dont see the problem abe i didnt put a gun to this kids head and make him talk he wasnt in withdrawal he wasnt just agreeing to what you said maybe i dont remember exactly it was a long day but either way nobodys gonna prove it and even if he was what of it he could tell the truth and get the interrogation over with so for once in his life the scumbag made a good decision the details are all wrong so his brains fried he gets things wrong big surprise let a jury work it out we got plenty more than enough to charge him isnt that what we do glitsky was unwilling to give it up we cant get him this way thats all im saying banks shook his head burgess was there abe he took her stuff he had the gun he fired the gun he fucking said he did it all right jesus so he changes his story when he starts feeling better who wouldnt batiste cleared his throat abe the lieutenant raised his eyes its admirable that you wanted to protect your men when you thought youd pushed them to excesses but i dont see evidence that anything went too far here im coming down with ridley going back to pratt at this point would be pointless were going to stand behind the confession were going to stand together on it he let that hang the message clear glitsky defeated scanned the faces around the table well he said i want to thank you all for coming hardy checked his watch cole was already supposed to have been delivered after his experience at the jail three days ago he was finding himself challenged in the patience arena regarding the jails employees but here in the hallway behind the courtrooms on the second floor of the hall of justice he knew that five minutes was a unit of time that had no real meaning until somebody was at least fifteen minutes late they were on time so he cooled his heels outside the holding cell behind department and tried to ignore the show which given the traffic was not all that easy the hallway which ran most of the length of the building behind the courtrooms hummed with life or more precisely in hardys view with lowlife defendants in their orange jumpsuits went shuffling and clanking along handcuffs and sometimes chains escorted by their bailiffs this was the morning delivery from the jail next door to the courtrooms here a steady and depressing parade it reminded him of nothing so much as a zoo the inmates chained and moved from one cage to another by their handlers who only forgot the dangerous nature of their charges at their own peril hardy had been here a hundred times and it never failed to depress him because in fact he knew that every one of these defendants was a human being whod been born with rights dignity hope even in most cases a mother and perhaps a father who had loved them at least for a while now here they were reduced to little more than animals to be caged and controlled sadly he realized that this was pretty much the way it had to be if the system was to handle them because he didnt fool himself nearly every inmate passing him had lost their hope abandoned their dignity forfeited all but their most basic rights he wished theyd hurry up and deliver cole hed be ready for prozac himself by the time his client arrived so he leaned against the cell door then went inside and sat he put his briefcase on the concrete bench intending to take the opportunity to get some paperwork out of the way keep his attitude up but it wasnt to be he saw the whole thing since he was just checking the holding cell for coles arrival one last time when it began he heard the bell of the elevator and as the doors cracked open the sharp command move it move it now from the tone something was already going very wrong looking over he was watching as something huge filled the elevator door opening two bailiffs stood slightly behind and to either side of a gigantic samoan the man probably weighed three hundred pounds the bailiffs had no room to move the man was handcuffed but not shackled he wore a hairnet the jumpsuit hed been issued didnt even come close to covering the enormous flesh of his tattooed torso the sleeves ended midway between the elbow and the wrist hardy didnt know what had been going on in the elevator but by the time the doors opened the inmates face was a mask of rage one of the bailiffs prodded him it didnt seem to hardy as though it was the first time and suddenly with a true primal scream the man slammed himself backwards into the bailiff then with surprising agility he shifted and bodyslammed the other guard into the elevators walls the two guards were both on the floor jesus christ hardy leaped back toward the holding cell putting distance between himself and the samoan who was exploding out of the elevator in his direction but everyone on the floor had heard the scream and now doors were opening all over the place alarms going off bailiffs appearing from courtrooms judges from their chambers other inmates already under escort starting to get into it a klaxon sounded and voices were yelling lock it down lock it down the samoan had obviously been in the hallway before and knew just where he wanted to go he broke left in a shambling run taking out another bailiff who was stupidly trying to pull his radio and perhaps try to fight it out in a hallway jammed with humanity stopping the man was going to be a problem the samoan had reached the end of the hall bailiffs and other inmates hugging the walls lest they be crushed in the rush but there was no real way out the same alarm that sounded the klaxon effectively closed off the corridor automatically locking the double doors at the end of it by the time the samoan realized he couldnt open them and turned again for another run at the hallway three bailiffs stood in his way as well as three uniformed officers with their guns drawn hardy heard another scream an anguished and ragedriven cry other bailiffs and cops were backfilling behind the original five until in under another minute a phalanx had formed effectively sealing off any possibility of escape the samoan turned back to the locked doors turned around again held his cuffed hands out in front of him shoot me he screamed please shoot me because of the incident cole was even later he told hardy that theyd picked him up at the hospital during the night and this had obviously disturbed his beauty rest in his orange jumpsuit with his slack posture and unkempt hair the boy appeared malnourished and pathetic but hardy thought his eyes were clearer than they had been the day before that wasnt saying much but it was something and this morning hardy would take whatever he could get he was still shaken by what hed witnessed a little more critical mass of inmates and it would have been a riot another rush by the samoan and he would have been shot dead instead he had finally gone terrifyingly quiet he sat on the floor and let them come and shackle him and take him away belted down to a gurney cole sat on the concrete bench hardy had already done enough time on the damn thing this morning he was standing now leaning back against the door because the mornings routine had been so violently interrupted they werent going to get much time to work out any kind of strategy but hardy wanted to get at least a few things straight if he was going to defend this boy the plea bail money timing issues but again it wasnt going to be that simple whats waiving time mean cole asked after hardy had told him that he was going to have to do just that to hardy this was merely a logistical detail cole had an absolute right to a speedy trial in practice though defendants very rarely wanted one the conventional wisdom was that it was always to the defendants advantage to delay delay put off an eventual verdict and until a verdict was rendered you were presumed innocent a small detail but a critical one delay also provided the opportunity for key witnesses to get run over by a bus or disappear or forget what they had once clearly remembered thereby strengthening your case the victim or the family of the victim might lose emotional fire the need for revenge or if the delay was long enough sometimes even closure the cop who arrested you might get another job da priorities could change and you could get offered a better deal to cop a plea the possibilities varied but the general rule held true a continuance is half a dismissal delay was a good thing hardy tried to explain this to cole the courts are so backed up that no judge wants to assign a preliminary hearing in ten days so we just say were ok with putting it off for a few months a few months maybe longer if we can cole was shaking his head and i stay in here no way i cant do that i hate to break it to you cole but you have to do that youve got a da whos talking death penalty to help her get elected so at the very least we want to put off the trial until after the election which is next november nine months at least but cole was still shaking his head frowning struggling with it i cant stay in here for nine months he said id die youve got a lot better chance of dying shooting smack for nine months out on the street but this fell on deaf ears no cole listen i cant be here for nine months do you hear me it was a violent outburst and after the mornings earlier events it got peoples attention up and down the hall a bailiff was outside the cell before hardy had any time to react on his own everything all right here after assuring him that it was hardy watched the man move uneasily off then turned back to cole if you go to trial now cole with the city still pretty inflamed over elaines death some of the jurors will undoubtedly i cant cole interrupted i just cant my mom says you can get me off i havent even talked to your mother yet cole and i cant get you off in ten days if nothing else ill need more time just to decide how im going to approach the damn thing just say i didnt do it did you do it he shrugged hardy got a little short because youve already said you did on tape in case you dont remember thats going to take some undoing you can undo it as well now as you can in nine months dont you think no i dont the back door to the holding cell gave into the courtroom and now that door opened and a bailiff appeared they had called coles case first lets roll it out boys showtime hardy gave his client a last look well continue this later he stepped back and let cole pass in front of him out into the courtroom at coles appearance through the door there was an audible rise from the gallery hardy frustrated nearly beyond endurance nevertheless gave his client a friendly upperarm squeeze and urged him forward as they passed the prosecution table gabe torrey motioned for hardy to stop and he let cole go on over to the other side with the bailiff he looked again out into the courtroom more than a decent crowd was on hand and it seemed restless hardy knew torrey from half a dozen other dealings and he didnt like him he considered the chief assistant da pompous petty and political to say nothing of underprepared and officious now he would be talking death penalty and other similar nonsense and hardy knew it was going to get ugly probably sooner rather than later still theyd never before crossed the line into hostility and he saw no reason to go there now torrey put out his hand in greeting and hardy took it i just wanted to give you a little heads up diz you probably heard we want to move this one along due to elaines standing in the community theres a lot of outrage hardy listened with half an ear he noticed the gallery again it really was humming cole was turned around at the defense table his mother was leaning over the rail trying to talk to him but he too kept his eyes mostly on the prosecutions side of the gallery which projected a true sense of menace this was unique in hardys experience there were people in this room who hated cole already and he felt it torrey had finished the selfserving part and was getting down to his point with the confession on tape and all you know i could get a grand jury indictment in five minutes so if youre inclined to ask for a long delay you should know ive scheduled the grand jury for next tuesday unless of course you decide not to waive time then well do the hearing in two weeks as the law provides with a sick feeling hardy realized that torrey was right there were two ways by which a case got scheduled for trial there could be a preliminary hearing to determine if the evidence was sufficient to bring to trial or the grand jury could come to the same conclusion and issue an indictment hardy wanted to delay but his client didnt wouldnt torrey was telling him that he would seek an indictment and potentially an even earlier trial date if hardy tried to stall on the preliminary hearing actually he realized torrey might not understand it completely his strategic grasp of things lawyerly had always seemed weak but he was doing him a favor by letting him go for a preliminary hearing at all he could indict at will if hardy didnt waive time he would get at least another ten days to prepare for the hearing maybe even get his discovery the evidence in the case a little earlier but ten days it was an impossible joke still better than a grand jury indictment and maybe in that time he could at least convince cole that it would be in his best interests to agree to a delay before they went to trial but either way this thing had just jumped to the fast track where any number of disasters were more likely to occur and where the damage from highspeed impact was likely to be that much greater hardy forced a casual smile it never crossed my mind to waive time cole burgess from his bench judge timothy hill gave it the dramatic reading the judge was an ancient patrician wispy white hair combed back over his ears clung close to a bony skull his skin was parchment stretched over long bones and his robe hung off him like a shroud the physical look combined with an utter lack of personality had earned him the nickname of the cadaver but today with the full house he possessed if not a youthful exuberance at least a detectable pulse you are charged by a complaint filed herein with a felony to wit a violation of section of the penal code in that you did in the city and county of san francisco state of california on or about the first day of february willfully unlawfully and with malice aforethought murder elaine wager a human being hardy was standing in the center of the courtroom next to cole at the prosecution table in a highly unusual appearance in an actual courtroom sharron pratt had entered at the last second and taken a seat next to gabriel torrey judge hill nodded to his clerk who began to read out the special circumstances that could make this a death penalty case driving downtown hardy had tried to predict what pratt would produce on this score but she proved more creative than he was and he only got one out of two a killing in the commission of a robbery the one hardy hadnt guessed because it was so grossly incorrect was a hate crime in that elaine wager was black and cole was white and when he heard it he had to speak up your honor the words seemed to strike the cadaver with a physical force clearly he did not expect any objection during the reading of the complaint straightening to his full height in his chair he frowned down into the bullpen to what mr shuffling some paper mr hardy your honor he was willing to risk the judges displeasure this idiocy could not go unquestioned and hill might as well get used to it early with respect to the second special circumstance your honor regardless of who committed it there is no race or bigotry issue associated with this crime the chief assistant da was already on his feet im shocked to hear mr hardys characterization of the murder of a black woman by a white man your honor thats absurd just because someone of one race kills a person of a different race we cant assume race is the motive but torrey knew his constituency any time a black person is killed in a white neighborhood race is an issue hardy came back at him union square is not a white neighborhood your honor its downtown the cadaver scowled down from the bench enough i know where union square is mr hardy have you got a problem with the complaint file the appropriate motions meanwhile he looked at the prosecution table is this a capital case mr torrey yes your honor the people seek the death penalty hill nodded keeping it moving snapped mr hardy how does your client plead he and cole hadnt really formally gotten around to this but he nudged his client and the young man looked up very much aware he didnt hesitate at all not guilty your honor an immediate and angry buzz filled the room hill seemed to have been expecting it certainly he made no attempt to gavel things to silence but the electricity created an opportunity and hardy took it to turn around and check out the gallery again jeff elliot whose column in the chronicle had already significantly raised the level of dialogue around this case had gotten his wheelchair up to the front and sat at the end of the first row next to dorothy significantly hardy thought jody burgess was a couple of seats away not right next to her daughter the intervening spots filled with reporters to hardys left the prosecution side of the courtroom particularly continued its foment threefourths of the gallery on that side were people of color hardy was again struck by the thick nearly palpable sense of outrage he felt from elaines friends and colleagues and beyond that contingent at least a dozen young people hardy thought they must be students from elaines classes were turning and squirming in their seats reacting with an obvious disgust and fury in the front row hardy recognized a couple of assistant das and the homicide inspector ridley banks there was clarence jackman famous lawyer from elaines firm sitting next to a striking dark woman who was staring at hardy with a smoldering malevolence next to her a very handsome early middleage white man sat back in his seat a statue hands folded in his lap who was he hardy wondered glitsky hadnt made it down from the fourth floor finally suddenly judge hill had let it go on long enough perfunctorily he tapped his gavel several times and waited for the noise to subside then spoke to torrey the people seek to deny bail of course your honor this is a capital case there can be no bail hardy spoke up again your honor if it please the court the cadaver was losing patience with these interruptions this was supposed to be after all a simple administrative procedure he snapped out a response there is no bail in a capital case mr hardy yes your honor im aware of that but again there is no way this should be a capital case or even a special circumstances case hardy took a deep breath then forged ahead this charge is a clear case of politics with mr burgess as the pawn women get raped and murdered and this da doesnt allege specials policemen get killed no specials now in an election year all of a sudden we get not just specials but a request for death they want my client to die your honor so ms pratt can make a last shoddy attempt to hold on to her office and it stinks your honor please torrey was out of his chair his voice at full volume and it served as a prod to the gallery which responded with another outburst the anger welling all around but this time perhaps sensing a rising tide hill decided hed better take control and slapped his gavel hard three times in rapid succession there will be order in this court or ill have the gallery cleared he barely paused brought his gaze back to hardy spoke sternly now counselor if you want to object to the specials write your motion but for the moment there they are and bail is denied but hardys blood was up now and he found himself unable to let it go in that case your honor before we go any further in this game of political football ill also be making a motion about the socalled confession that the prosecution unethically keeps putting in the newspapers this really set off the crowd with several identifiable explosions hey he confessed the guy did it punctuating the general uproar the gavel banged away but hills real ire had become directed at hardy im warning you counselor this is not the appropriate time or place take it up at the prelim but it was as though hardy didnt hear him hed had enough for today already and his patience was at an end he raised his own voice over the hubbub your honor mr burgess was held for hours before he was charged he also was not adequately apprised of his right to counsel thats a black lie ridley banks was up in the first row we mirandized him as soon as he was drunk and barely coherent your honor the tape of his interrogation shows it clearly theres no way this tape will ever be played for a jury the prosecution has no right to try and prejudice prospective jurors by even calling it a confession now in the gallery things were truly getting out of hand everyone seemed to be talking yelling swearing hardy caught a strong whiff of sweat and couldnt say if it was cole and his fear or the collective scent of the mob coalescing behind him sit down everybody the cadaver had finally come to life bellowing down in the gallery he slammed his gavel again and again bailiffs the three men in uniform appeared from their various posts around the wall and began moving up to the bar rail ten minutes later the arraignment was over hill called a stop to the bailiffs slow charge as they reached the bar rail he really didnt want to have to try and remove nearly a hundred people by force not only would that be a bad precedent for his fellow judges he sure as hell didnt want the word to get out that judge hill couldnt control his courtroom by force of will alone the spectators in the room settled back down hill denied bail again and this time nobody argued with him when hardy didnt waive time for the preliminary hearing the judge asked him a second time to make sure hed heard it correctly then he set the hearing for ten oclock wednesday february in this same courtroom he ordered cole back to the jail and called a recess he stood without so much as a glance at anyone in the courtroom or gallery and left the bench in a swirl of black robe hardy realized that he had been lucky to escape without a contempt citation and he really hadnt accomplished anything substantive for his client though hed certainly succeeded in getting the judge and half the courtroom mad at him so as the disgruntled masses filed out behind him he stalled for time gathering his papers at the defense table he knew he had a gauntlet to run on the other side of the bar rail and out in the hallway but he felt oddly satisfied hed served notice no one was railroading his client without a fight he felt a light touch on the back of his shoulder and turned to face the da mr hardy he straightened up and nodded set his jaw ms pratt hardy and pratt had a history a year before he had gotten her a public reprimand from the bench for her offices cavalier abuse of the grand jury she in turn had nearly filed criminal charges against hardy for insurance fraud and had directed her own investigators to explore hardys possible criminal involvement in the murder case he was defending there was no love lost between them and now she had another crack at him that was a fairly unprofessional and tawdry display maybe it was hardys lips turned upward but no one would have called it a smile but i prefer that to selfrighteous hypocrisy are you really such a political hack that youd kill somebody for a few votes pratt turned red at the frontal assault making false accusations about my motives will get you in trouble with the bar mr hardy hardy nodded again i couldnt agree more which is why i dont make them false and while were enjoying such a full and frank exchange of ideas id be interested to hear about your decision to ask for special circumstances much less death she doesnt have to explain anything to you hardy this was torrey hardy had been diz before the arraignment had begun but now the gloves had come off you go play your cheap defense tricks and when we get to it well see what a jury thinks of them what a neat idea hardy said that was kind of my plan anyway see what a jury thinks if it ever gets to that which i doubt oh itll get there thats what happens when you get a confession the presumption of guilt goes way up it does thats funny hardy said id always heard it was presumption of innocence your man isnt innocent well there you go i guess were back to that jury thing again arent we torrey wore an expression of great disdain you knew elaine didnt you yes i did hardy answered without irony i thought she was great and the idea that youd want to kill somebody in her name that makes me gag torrey shook his head in disgust i just dont see how you can live with yourself its easy hardy replied ive got a really good personality lets go gabe sharron pratt all but pulled him by the arm oh and mr hardy if i were you id go easy on accusing me of playing politics with a mans life so what would you like me to call it she ignored that if you keep it up she said im not going to be disposed to drop it when this is over and youre going to be very sorry hardy took that in soberly then nodded thoughtfully you know thats sounds an awful lot like a threat are you threatening me she glared at him levelly you take it any way you want all right he said ill take it as a threat and as such ill be passing it along to the bar ethics committee since we started here talking about ethics thatll bring us around full circle torrey couldnt resist a parting remark you wouldnt know an ethic if it bit you on the ass for a long moment hardy gave him a flat stare whoa clever ive got to remember that one he turned to gather the rest of his papers hardy decided hed just as soon forgo the excitement in the hallway outside he was all too familiar with the back way out it was the way hed come in but his client cole had just had bail denied even when this was expected and it had been it was never an easy moment he caught cole just outside the holding cell behind the courtroom the bailiffs were busy transporting other defendants up and down from the jail and there was another defendant and his attorney waiting in the cell itself so theyd handcuffed cole to the elevator bars until they could get to him which would be when it was hardy stood next to him well keep trying on the bail he said it still could happen so what do i do between now and the preliminary hearing well have to talk a lot maybe see if you can remember something but cole didnt seem to hear him no he said as though to himself no what hardy asked youre not going to remember anything new not that i mean he rolled his eyes back and forth i mean remembering something thats not what im thinking about hardy knew what cole was thinking about his next hit thats what you ought to be thinking about cole maybe you can use the time to clean up a shake of the head no i dont think he stopped this was foreign soil to hardy hed of course been around for much of the beginning of the drug culture in the late sixties early seventies but as a marine in vietnam and then a cop before law school he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of illegal substances hed found his excitement without resort to chemicals and then later when he felt the need to escape from the pain of his failed marriage and the death of his son he gravitated to what the irish called the good mans weakness drink but even that had never controlled him he chose to drink sometimes copiously then chose when to stop this boy he knew was in a completely different world do you want to get out of it he asked cole shrugged if i do theres a program for it a mirthless laugh theres a program for everything isnt there it does seem like it it surprised hardy this first moment of connection hed felt with his client but he felt the same way here in san francisco tolerance and understanding for every human frailty or aberration had been politicized funded institutionalized someone was being paid to help you with whatever ailed you in san francisco and if nothing ailed you someone was being paid to find something that did is there anything i can do hardy asked cole turned his head what do you mean i mean if you decide to move the process along get you counseling like that probably not cole let out a breath if its going to happen it falls to me he tapped his heart in here hardy knew that this was true but it was still good to hear cole say it to acknowledge that his fate was to some extent his own responsibility maybe he wasnt completely lost after all so what happens next he asked in the law world next i file a few motions the stuff i was talking about in there he pointed at the courtroom door the procedural problems these special circumstances will that really work in what sense i mean if they didnt read me my rights hardy narrowed his eyes at the hospital the other day you told me you didnt remember if they did you thought not now youre saying if he corrected himself no they told me i wasnt arrested for the murder so i didnt need a lawyer yet they were just questioning me because i was in the alley and i ran so you do remember that that was after theyd kept me for hours i kind of woke up halfway through things hardy wasnt thrilled with the constant shifts coles story took but he saw no advantage in fighting about that now well if thats really what they said then you might have pulled yourself a break we could get it tossed ill tell you one other thing though about those special circumstances he shuddered involuntarily i sure as hell didnt kill that girl because she was black the world was suddenly still hardy sharpened his tone then why did you kill her what he snapped it out harshly under his breath why did you kill her if it wasnt because she was black after hed seen glitskys videotape and reasoned things out for himself hardy had come to accept at least the possibility that cole hadnt been the agent of elaines death so hed decided to stay with the case but now here apparently was a second confession unsolicited uncoerced coles face registered confusion at the rapid change in hardys demeanor from protector to inquisitor in the blink of an eye he twitched hey come on what all i said was it wouldnt have been because she was black wouldnt have been or wasnt if there was a difference cole didnt seem to understand what it was he strained to come up with something im saying black white brown who cares it wouldnt have been a race thing is what i mean i dont even think like that hardy leaned in close and this time the sweat was his clients you just admitted again that you killed her dont you understand that a deer in headlights cole was shaking his head i dont know i didnt i said that you dont know if you killed her finally a rise i dont remember killing her i told you that i dont think i killed her but i might have if i shot the gun you might have cole listen to me you just said you didnt shoot the girl because she was black those were your exact words but he was shaking his head from side to side side to side see no thats not what i meant ok tell me he sighed deeply did something with his hands that caused the cuffs to rattle against the bars hunching his head down into his shoulders he cleared his throat spoke in a voice barely above a whisper look if i was ever going to kill somebody which i wouldnt it wouldnt be because they were black ok so if i killed this girl elaine yeah elaine if i killed her which i dont remember so its possible maybe i didnt too that wouldnt have been the reason but if you dont remember killing her why did you admit that you had cole rolled his eyes didnt we already go through this i told you i was coming down so hard hardy reached over put a hand on his shoulder briefly stop just stop but he couldnt do that you know man cole call me dismas would you or diz ok but i also dont remember not killing her i just dont i dont remember the gun how i got the gun the voice trailed off did you find it by the body on the street maybe it seems like before or after you saw her he closed his eyes trying to bring it back i dont know it seems like before because after i mean there was no time after right im leaning over her and the cops came and you remember that cole grimaced the effort to recall out of his reach he shook his head hopelessly not really hardy leaned back again he had lived much of his adult life as a bartender and had great respect for the effects of alcohol but the kind of total blackout that cole seemed to be describing was far beyond that cole he asked gently what do you remember after you picked up your bottle of whiskey the young man raised his eyes they had become glassy i dont know man i just dont know taking the back steps hardy made it unmolested up to the fourth floor down the long hallway into the homicide detail four inspectors looked up from their paperwork but none of them ventured any kind of greeting glitskys stillpristine white door was closed again but this time there was light behind the shade somebody in with the lieutenant hardy asked the room a mute chorus of shrugs so he knocked its open he turned the knob and stuck his head in actually he said it was closed glitsky had his feet on his desk his fingers tented over his mouth why dont you make it that way again i could do that hardy did then reached across the desk opened one of the drawers and withdrew a handful of peanuts i must say though that the old opendoor policy you used to take such pride in seems to be in jeopardy and this in turn might precipitate a drop in your tremendous popularity with your troops which id hate to see it might have been in spite of himself but glitskys face softened all the way say from diamond to granite i wish i was irish and liked to hear myself talk as much as you do were hardy replied were what you said was i wish i was irish but its were present conditional contrary to fact takes the subjunctive i wish i were irish people dont seem to know that anymore glitsky shook his head pulled his feet off the desk thats exactly what i mean twenty words when five will do five can be good hardy replied brevity and all that but its not all its cracked up to be twenty words if theyre the right ones and that my friend is the key can be downright sublime and of course though few acknowledge it anymore in our jaded age proper use of the subjunctive is the hallmark of a civilized man worn down glitsky finally came all the way to a smile were i to care i would make a note of it he popped a peanut of his own so howd it go downstairs hardy sat back i somehow escaped contempt of court but i dont think by much he briefly outlined the highlights of the arraignment concluding with his surprise that glitsky had not been in attendance he indicated the empty desktop but then seeing the piles of work youre wading through a silence settled hardy continued afterwards i had another nice chat with my client it didnt exactly perk me up he doesnt remember anything the nights a complete blank which is more drunk than ive ever been and youve pushed the envelope a few times if i remember which you dont from time to time in my youth for research purposes only anyway i like to consider myself an aficionado on the subject and ive never had the kind of blackout cole is describing which makes me have doubts but glitsky was shaking his head theres all kinds of new pills nowadays diz the date rape drug also more easily available halcion could do it halcion the sleeping pill when you were doing your drink research didnt you ever take halcion before tying one on i dont remember really its all a blank but he broke a smile just kidding is that what happens thats the word complete blackout glitsky glanced at the closed door he lowered his voice anyway i had a meeting of my own this morning batiste ridley banks strout the guys at the scene i wanted to talk about the problems in the tape banks was downstairs in court yeah i figured he would be i told him we ought to back off from the confession you suggested that this was further than hardy thought abe would have taken it out loud yeah but ridley was a little sensitive to the idea that the confession was bogus seemed to think it would reflect on the way he conducted it and he wouldnt be all wrong and he knows that too the lieutenant blew out wearily its tricky diz these are my guys they gave me what i asked for i dont blame them for being ticked off i dont either but ticked off is one thing letting a guy go down on bad evidence is another well there you go anyway my colleagues and superiors were of a like mind there was plenty to arrest burgess still is he gave us more when we talked to him now he goes to trial its not our job anymore end of story it was hardys turn to sigh but its not abe you know its not dont give me that diz it might be and dont confuse bad evidence with not guilty your boy killed elaine all right its all about how we prove it i want a clean case thats all i think you want more than that glitsky cracked a peanut shell im trying to figure out how to conduct an investigation and get more evidence when weve got a suspect already in jail and presumably going to trial carefuully pointing a finger hardy stopped his friends response see i can be brief pithy even glitsky was about to reply again and again was interrupted this time by a knock at the door its open hardy clucked disapprovingly you keep saying that but in an instant it was true standing in the doorway was chief of police dan rigby himself accompanied by sharron pratt and gabriel torrey an uncomfortable frank batiste behind them was an amorphous assemblage of humanity workers from the das office uniformed cops a couple of reporters perhaps the random passerby hardy could see the homicide inspectors from the detail gathered around at the outer fringes well well well torrey said over rigbys shoulders isnt this cozy there wasnt room for a private party in glitskys office so at rigbys command the players trooped across the homicide main room and poured themselves into one of the interrogation areas in fact the very one in which cole burgess had spent his sweat time airless and without windows with a small table now pushed against one wall and three chairs the interrogation room probably wasnt a brilliant choice for a meeting either but the mood was somehow suddenly urgent torrey in a kind of triumphant rage kept repeating i knew this i knew it to whomever would listen rigby torn between the urge to protect one of his men and the need to contain any possible scandal on the force wanted a door he could close with all the principals behind it and he wanted it now we dont need mr hardy sitting in on this chief said pratt rigby ignored her he wasted no time on preamble but turned to his homicide lieutenant and let fly mr torrey tells me that this morning mr hardy here referred to a videotape at the arraignment on burgess howd he get to see it were nowhere near releasing discovery yet pratt butted in pointlessly he didnt get it from our office everyone already knew that rigby kept his eyes on glitsky abe but hardy whose slip in the courtroom had put glitsky on this hot seat wasnt going to let his friend burn i never said i saw a tape he said cole told me theyd videotaped him how did he know banks interjected come on he assumed hardy shot back its not like this is some secret procedure everybody gets taped but torrey was ready for this denial he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket directed his gaze to rigby heres what mr hardy said exactly i took the liberty of having the court reporter type it up for me he read he was drunk and barely coherent your honor the tape of his interrogation shows it clearly sounds to me like he saw it hardy wasnt backing down doesnt prove a damn but glitsky put a hand on his arm its ok diz he turned to rigby i played it for him after a shocked moment of silence banks blew out heavily jesus torrey pumped a fist fuckin a he whispered pratt cleared her throat well chief in light of this admission you cant sharron please rigby stopped her with his palm turned to his chief of homicide lieutenant glitsky are you telling me you gave evidence in a murder trial to a defense attorney am i hearing this right glitsky inclined his head an inch yes sir the chief sighed heavily all right his mouth worked he might have been grinding his teeth all right he repeated weve got to look into this meanwhile torrey whats to look into hes admitted meanwhile rigby bellowed to shut him up he turned to batiste meanwhile frank id like you and abe to meet me up in my office in he checked his watch thirty minutes lieutenant if youd like to bring a grievance officer along with you that might be prudent everybody else his voice hardened id appreciate it if anything mentioned behind these doors stays here until i can prepare a statement after we get to the bottom of what went on he glared at pratt and torrey and if there is a statement to make well make it together is that clear we can agree to that pratt stated though it should be sooner rather than later torrey added as soon as the facts are in rigby replied crisply he cast a last slow look around the room finally rested on glitsky shook his head jesus christ abe he said under his breath what were you thinking then he turned the knob and was out the door leaving it open behind him gene vissers law enforcement career began in a promising fashion he spent three years working the streets in a squad car then got moved up and he earned a stripe and an inspectors job in burglary after three years in that department he put two more in vice took the sergeants exam and applied for the next opening as inspector of homicide which was pretty much the top rung in the ladder for working cops when he got that promotion at thirty he was one of the youngest inspectors ever to attain that rank and position but visser had a couple of character flaws that were going to negatively impact on his aspirations in the force the first one was a tendency to theorize before all the evidence was in hed get a feeling about who among the various suspects in a case was the most likely culprit and hed focus his energies trying to prove his point the first couple of cases hed handled this approach had even worked quite often the guy who looks like he did it actually did but not always and the law of averages along with the complexity of motives and situations in reallife homicides finally caught up with him in a highprofile case this was where his second major failing a lack of focus regarding loyalty came into play visser thought it only made sense to have friends in the press and the das office as well as with the police it couldnt hurt to give a reporter a little advance heads up on what might be coming down the pipeline sometimes before it was supposed to be public these people the das and reporters after all were the end users of his product they ought to be entitled to an early look and in their zeal for convictions prepratt the occasional prosecutor would sometimes use visser to funnel something to the press that they couldnt say themselves if you were nice to reporters they were nice to you in print it was you scratch my back ill scratch yours visser may even have thought that everybody did it although in this belief he was mistaken until one day stunned he found himself transferred out of homicide soon he found it prudent to resign and get another job as investigator for the district attorneys office where he was pretty much like a police inspector but not really that new position lasted only eighteen months he could have stayed on of course he hadnt really done anything wrong but he felt frozen out he became the prosecutors last choice if they needed a real investigator finally deeply embittered by the system that had rejected him he quit and encouraged by several defense attorneys with whom hed become friendly and who promised him steady work he hung up a shingle as a private investigator visser had once been handsome with a full head of sandycolored hair chiseled cheekbones a welltrimmed goatee in the decade since hed had his own business though hed gained forty pounds and two inches of forehead hed also lost the facial hair that had hid his chins now the skin of his face stretched tightly over too much flesh through which smallish eyes perpetually seemed to squint right now he was on his way to see dismas hardys client rich mcneil at terranew industries he didnt have an appointment that wasnt his style mcneils office was on one of the upper floors of the companys headquarters on california street halfway up to nob hill the room was of reasonable size with modern furnishings builtin bookshelves windows on two of the walls looking out over downtown when his secretary buzzed him and said a private investigator with the manny gait case was outside mcneil let himself hope that maybe hardy had hired a pi and maybe he had come up with some good news about something and couldnt wait to tell mcneil directly but as soon as he saw visser he realized that this was wishful thinking this beefy hunk of trailer trash couldnt be hardys man still mcneil had let him into his office so hed be polite he rose out of his seat came around his desk extended his hand mr visser rich mcneil what can i do for you the big mans grip crushed his hand intimidation with a smile thanks for seeing me on such short notice you mind if i sit down a minute mcneil opened and closed his hand relieved that it still seemed to be working not at all im afraid i dont have a lot of time but i wont take much then visser pulled his pants at his thighs settled back into one of mcneils leather armchairs looked around the office nice place he said i got an office in an old warehouse on pier great view right on the water treasure island the bridge but no chairs like this well mcneil didnt have a chitchat answer prepared he pulled a chair up put on an expectant expression so he waited visser took another moment appreciating his comfort level the buildings out the windows he shifted his shoulders leaned into the leather came back to mcneil just so you know he began so were clear im working for dash logan mr gaits attorney he thought it might be helpful if you and me had a discussion about what were looking at here kind of off the record but mcneil was shaking his head i dont know if thats a good idea my lawyer told me no cmon hey lawyers i know i work for one dash talked to your lawyer yesterday which is why im here today call it a courtesy your guy hardy is it he seems to think settling this case out of court isnt a good idea says weve got no criminal case but i gotta tell you the squinting eyes shifted around the office what mcneil prompted with some effort visser brought his bulk forward on the chair heres the thing he began all sincerity his voice dropped a few decibels this stuff happens in these cases the lawyers they start pissing at each other pretty soon everybody loses mr logan he hates to see that well mcneil wanted no more of this he started to stand up be that as it may i really cant the thing is rich visser interrupted almost coming out of his own chair intimidating mcneil again back into his i used to be a cop a lot of years i know the kind of things theyre looking for and theyre going to get it i mean everybodys got a skeleton in their closet tax stuff couple of times you maybe took cash for rent without receipts this is stuff your guy hardy wouldnt know about id be surprised at that mcneil said levelly he used to be a cop himself hardy did mcneil pressed his advantage thats right so i get the feeling hes pretty much on top of whats going on and hes telling me theres no case which is also what i believe since i know manny gait is a liar especially about giving me cash for rent that didnt happen none of it happened so if thats all mcneil started to get up again thanks for coming by but im afraid we dont have anything else to discuss he braved a smile were just going to have to let the lawyers duke it out but visser didnt take the hint instead he leaned back again rubbed a palm against the smooth leather armrest well ok its just a case like this goes forward it can get ugly and mr logan doesnt want that neither does mr hardy well just have to let the facts decide he gestured with his palms out forced another smile well if thats all i do have a pretty busy morning at last visser got himself out of the chair ok but just for an example whats that you used to have a secretary named linda cook didnt you mcneil felt his stomach go hollow what about her that was a mistake a long time ago my wife knows all about it yeah sure but the kids you know the grandkids that whole thing comes up itd be kind of sad for them the whole way they think about you a shaky breath steel now in the voice get the hell out of here the fury and fear had no effect on visser he spread his own palms in a reflection of mcneils earlier dismissal all im saying is this kind of thing gets around in the public it doesnt do you any good you hear what im saying nobody needs that kind of aggravation huh arent i right they were in the front window of a tony little lunch place on union and jody burgess had given up even picking at her salad instead she glared across the table at her daughter who had just told her after a meal full of preamble that she and jeff were not going to contribute to the payment for coles defense i dont see how you can be so unfeeling she said this is your own brother dorothy hadnt even touched her sandwich and it was her favorite foccacio goats cheese sundried tomatoes she had no problem understanding how she could be so unfeeling shed had lots of practice that was how every time shed been tempted to feel something like compassion or sorrow or simple pity for her brother over the past half dozen years shed regretted it and now the temptation wasnt all that great any longer in fact it was no longer a temptation at all but she told herself that this was her mother and although theyd had similar discussions hundreds of times before she felt she still owed her somehow damn it so she answered with her trademark enforced calm my own brother she said desperately needed a place to stay and because i felt something for him i let him live in my house with my rather seriously handicapped husband and my own children and mom you may remember this you know what his thanks was he stole from us repeatedly from the kids own piggy banks even can you believe that one that was my reward for being nice to him that the kids now will always remember uncle cole as a thief if not a murderer and isnt that a special thing for them to carry around for the rest of their lives jody nodded swallowed shed heard all of this before and because it was her nature she was ready with a response hes not a murderer well he damn well is a thief he cant help himself dorothy hes in the grip of something bigger than he is oh please its true you know its true it may be mom but i just dont care anymore i dont care do you hear me jody stared into the face across the table reached out her hand touched her daughters honey no dorothy pulled her hand away no not this time so what are we going to do im not going to do anything youll just let him go dorothy nodded her jaw set yep theyre asking for the death penalty dorothy you cant want him to die a sigh this is san francisco mom no jury is going to give him the death penalty hes not going to die well the district attorney sure doesnt agree with you the district attorney dorothys gaze was flat hes gone anyway mom hes not coming back i dont believe that i know but you should because its true another silence jody often thought that she was beyond tears certainly only a few years ago if shed heard dorothy say that her only son cole wasnt ever coming back wasnt ever going to be her wonderful boy again she would have welled up but now there was nothing like that only a deep weariness but one that somehow didnt threaten her resolve look how about if we just talk to mr hardy and dorothy was shaking her head mom weve got three children to send to college if we can jeffs medical expenses are sure not going to go down we just cant help here even if we wanted to which we dont and frankly mom ive got to say this i dont know why you do hes my only son dorothy thats why thats not a good answer mom coles ruined your life dont you see that he hasnt oh no thats right hes enriched it i suppose dorothy picked up her napkin wiped her mouth nervously took a deep breath hes ruined your life you keep saying that because it keeps being true thats why come on mom look what hes done hes forced you to move out here jody held up her hand stopping her no there thats a good example he didnt force me you sold the house we both grew up in where youd planned to live the rest of your life you told me this remember because after we threw him out you wanted a place near cole in case he couldnt make it on his own tell me that isnt true dorothy couldnt say that since it was so now youre living in some dreary little apartment uprooted from all your friends everybody youve known your whole life all alone i get to see my grandchildren which wasnt an issue until cole moved out here thats not why youre here mom you know that its cole its always cole all the sacrifices and you know what he doesnt care they havent done any good jody cast her eyes around the restaurant to the street outside back to her daughter he has stayed with me he needs a place so let him get one mom christ hes twentyseven years old i cant let him die you cant save him dont you see that hell never grow up if you dont let him youre letting him go on the way he does i dont have any option hon he just needs stop talking about his needs dorothy suddenly had heard enough and her string snapped her voice had a hoarse quality but everyone in the restaurant heard it he needs to get a life he needs to beat this thing ok but you cant help him nobody can he needs to fail and figure it out or else he needs to die she brought the napkin back to her lips shocked at her own outburst but she wasnt really through not yet she leaned forward her voice more modulated and now youre going to pay mr hardy by yourself arent you do you know how much thats going to be its going to wipe you out your savings and then what then whats it all been for but he didnt kill this woman he needs a good lawyer he confessed mom which meant nothing to jody not really and if mr hardy can get him off then he can get in some program oh jesus when will it end give me a break can i get you ladies some more water it was the waiter solicitous in his white shirt and black vest some dessert coffee embarrassed getting the message dorothy shook her head just a check please thanks after hed nodded relieved and gone off she leaned across the table and whispered you know mom i shouldnt even have gone to see dismas that was my last mistake for cole i should have just let him die then in jail if he was going to get the whole thing over with dont say that her mom implored you dont mean that shaking her head in disgust dorothy threw her napkin down on her plate it was hopeless clarence jackman was seated at the head of the mammoth mahogany table that filled the center of the conference room at his firms offices assuming correctly that the arraignment of cole burgess would attract a number of elaines friends and colleagues jackman had arranged a catered lunch and had passed the word outside the courtroom that those whose hearts were in the right place were welcome this turned out to be a sizeable group nearly two dozen people although by now getting on to one thirty many had returned to their jobs or classes the general buzz had subsided and most of the food was gone jackman shook hands goodbye with a young law intern who wanted to send in a resume then grabbed a bottled water from the sideboard and pulled up a chair near the knot of people most of them jackman gathered from law school who remained at the far end of the room deep in a conversation that had progressively picked up some heat there wasnt any reason thats the whole point you admit a reason you give hardy his ammunition to get the scumbag off this outburst came from elaine wagers fiance jonas welsh in his midthirties big hair extraordinarily handsome face expensive clothes walsh was a surgeon who looked like he hadnt slept in a week and maybe he hadnt he was clearly not in the habit of hearing his opinions questioned and the wringer hed been through since elaines death probably made him sound testier than he intended the current object of his wrath was peter nesbitt associate dean of hastings law school he was a reedyvoiced logician in bow tie and corduroy sports coat all im saying nesbitt persisted is that if burgess in fact didnt voluntarily confess but he did for christs sake for corroboration walsh turned to the others gathered around am i wrong here is this really in dispute not really jonas treya ghent sat next to him it was obvious to jackman that the two knew each other perhaps well treya didnt really smile but there was something almost like humor in her attitude and body language as she attempted to pour oil on the waters she patted welshs hand reassuringly theyre only talking about lawyer strategy the ever fascinating one of the female students to general appreciation jackman again noticed the sense of quiet strength that the ghent woman exuded today as always she wore the simplest of outfits black slacks a fashionably baggy gray sweater a thin gold chain necklace little or no makeup he had to force himself to take his eyes off her billable hours or not he resolved ive got to think hard before i let this one go so what are you saying jonas jackman asked eager to be in on it whats the argument im saying that all this shop talk about maybe somebody having a reason to kill elaine it plays right into his lawyers hands hell youre a lawyer dont you think thats right jackman appeared to ponder looked over at peter nesbitt i suppose but what i hear from peter is dont let your rage over the act blind you to the facts if this man burgess didnt do it youd want to know who did right of course but he did do it nesbitt spoke up again shrugging what im saying is that this hardy fellow is just doing his job trying to create doubt from the outset its a good technique well excuse me all to hell if i cant get behind it what i know is that elaines gone it doesnt leave me much in the mood for all this hypothetical bullshit treya touched his hand again jonas they dont mean he hung his head ok i know i know abruptly he stood up rubbed a palm down the side of his face sorry he blurted this just isnt some mind game for me he looked around the table down in the courtroom all of you seemed as disgusted as i was and now here were only saying it raises some interesting points nesbitt said im not interested in them it seems to me they caught the guy now theyre figuring out how theyre going to let him go well the woman whod made the earlier comment said if she did have enemies and we all know she did welsh wasnt having it if she did it wasnt one of them it was this kid jackman felt he ought to intervene the young doctor was in the grip of his emotions he wasnt used to the endless debate which was the cornerstone of nearly every gathering of law students and which could jackman silently agreed in fact get wearisome we all agree with you jonas thats funny it doesnt sound like that we were all outraged by the events in court today i think you heard that during the arraignment we all walked in there having heard about the confession wanting blood believing that mr burgess was guilty i think we all believe it still nods from around the table walsh had remained standing now nodding in acknowledgment suddenly a shadow seemed to cross his face he bit down on his lip brought a hand up to his mouth im sorry he said his voice cracking i cant he shook his head again got some composure managed to speak excuse me then he was out the door treya ghent excused herself as well pushed back her chair got up followed him as her steps receded down the hallway the room grew silent several of the students exchanged glances an awkward moment the woman spoke up again the grieving man and his comforter but this time there was no appreciative chortle from the group if it were me nesbitt began his voice told it all he was in debate mode he addressed the seated students i think id go along with mr jackmans comments its important to nail the case down against every possible doubt eliminate every other possible suspect disprove every alternative do any among you not feel that way there werent any takers the thin voice pressed the point and yet dr walsh apparently has no interest in that pursuit which could mean what jackman wasnt in the mood to listen to any more theorizing nesbitts hypothetical point was the bloodless logic of the academic welshs genuine emotion was much more real he was simply too upset to deal rationally with the case in any event the table would be cleared soon and the last of his guests dispersed time was money he had to go back to work treya saw him turn into elaines old office across from her cubicle hed closed the door and she knocked waited knocked again no answer she turned the knob jonas whispering the shades were drawn and the room was dim but she had no trouble making him out slumped in elaines chair feet up on her desk hands over his eyes treya quickly checked the hall in both directions saw no one and slipped inside she closed the door again behind her are you all right yeah sure great he drew a deep audible breath i dont want to hear about her enemies i know she waited standing by the door when her eyes had adjusted more to the light she crossed the small room removed some of elaines files from where they sat on her usual chair stacked them on the file cabinet next to the desk sitting she waited some more he barely lifted his head pretty mature display huh could have been way worse i wouldnt lose any sleep over it i think id have to get some to lose it well when you do shed known jonas for a little over three years since he and elaine had first become an item and although over time he had ceased to be among her favorite people early on they had bonded as coconspirators this was because in the first few months of dating between her black activist boss and her white doctor boyfriend the relationship had been extremely clandestine secret meetings in hotel rooms daytime trysts where treya would loan them her apartment lunch in this room at the firm all this was before elaine had been ready to commit and treya hadnt been able to blame her though at first before shed seen his ego and tantrums and selfishness she did feel for the pressure it put on jonas as the daughter of a prominent africanamerican us senator elaine had been informally claimed by the bay area black community as one of its new generation of leaders the political side of her she did after all have her mothers blood loved it in the first couple of years after she left the das office she had been squired around to her fundraising appearances and campaign dinners by a succession of highvisibility black men over the years the chronicles society column had linked her romantically with not a few of her clients with a city supervisor with a running back for the ers with a coanchor on one of the nightly news programs elaine had liked each of them for various reasons though none of these or several other boyfriends had lasted more than a couple of months this wasnt a matter of much concern to her shed been in love once when she was younger and she knew what it felt like and it wasnt this she assumed it would only be a matter of time before she met the right man again and then she would marry him and settle down working at rand and jackman speaking at neighborhood organizations black business seminars inner city development projects she was leading a full busy life that only rarely intersected with the white community treya knew that elaine didnt think much about this segregation it was simply a fact of her life she had no strong prejudice against white people the man whod raised her dana wager had been white but except for formal gatherings there was little opportunity to meet anyone socially or otherwise who wasnt black then she came down with a stomach ache that sharpened and deepened right side localized over a twoday period on the third morning she was at her desk trying to work when treya came in with some papers and gently brushed against her elaine screamed nearly blacking out from the pain as her appendix burst the fever peaked at jonas was the emergency room surgeon and he saved her life but in the first months elaine didnt trust the feeling it wasnt at all like the earlier starcrossed love shed experienced with chris locke the older married district attorney no jonas was young brilliant sexy and the feeling shed confided to treya was nothing like anything else it was much better in fact she thought it was too good to last and since it would have to end elaine was at first afraid to threaten her standing in the community over a few moments of passion terrified of losing clients clout and credibility she wanted to keep the affair hidden until it blew over as it surely would but it didnt they went public and despite elaines concerns the whole race thing turned out to be pretty much a nonissue about the only fallout shed experienced at all was that shed lost a jihadoriented islamic student shed been mentoring and that elaine had come to view as a blessing finally a year ago she and jonas had announced their engagement treya for her part certainly understood the original attraction jonas had moviestar looks and projected a superconfident maleness that was undeniable she hadnt been completely immune to it herself on some level but after she got to know him she wasnt completely thrilled that this man had been elaines life choice his world she discovered revolved entirely around himself and his work during the courtship rush hed made time for elaine whenever he could but when that ended once hed won her love and commitment he reverted to his old schedule and his main passion which from treyas perspective was himself she told herself that maybe she was being unfair and to be truthful elaine really didnt seem to mind they both worked long hours under great pressure obviously they had reached some accommodation where stolen latenight hours or a rare weekend when jonas could get away was enough for both of them each was in their own way a trophy a catch treya understood that this was no small part of it for either of them maybe they were a true match two narcissists locked in a centrifugal dance around the image each admired but that really wasnt the elaine that treya knew treya couldnt imagine standing for it herself when jonas missed a dinner or a movie or a show because he was in surgery when he never made it home because of some hospital emergency elaine seemed to deal with it but if it was her if she got hung up at work and had to cancel out on one of his events treya remembered the first time shed seen it she had left a message for jonas that elaine was in a deposition that was running very late she and jonas had been due to go to la for some medical convention and elaine was going to have to catch a later flight she would miss the introductions the cocktail party shed try to make it down by the next morning at the latest jonas had shown up in front of treyas desk in a fury it was as though hed never met her before as if theyd never plotted together to find a quiet place he and elaine could meet if the deposition had been taking place in one of the offices at rand and jackman she had no doubt he would have broken into the room interrupting the proceedings but shed told him untruthfully she really didnt know where elaine was working well find her hed snapped at her after that treya had never felt the same about jonas walsh afterwards of course hed apologized told treya hed been under a lot of stress yack yack yack but she saw it from him heard about it from elaine too many other times even today the lunch theyd just left jonas unwilling even to listen he knew the truth it was obvious everybody should just stop wasting his precious time but for some reason elaine had put up with it even apologized for him hes under a ton of pressure every day trey life and death stuff you watch after we start a family hell get his priorities straight hes got a great heart now treya looked across at the dejected figure and in spite of their differences she felt for him as she felt for herself the world as they both knew it had ended and neither felt ready to move on a gust of wind slapped at the window and they heard the beginning of rain his hand was still resting over his eyes his face half hidden the voice came out guttural low enough almost to be distant thunder she was talking about leaving me he said though shed heard him clearly the truth of it didnt seem to register right away she would not have believed it possible that elaine had come close to making that decision and kept it from her im sorry what you didnt know now he did look over she really didnt tell you are you joking am i joking he shook his head she told me she hadnt told anybody yet i didnt believe her treya sat back stunned by the news she didnt tell me she said simply then added she never even said she was unhappy another halflaugh well there you go he brought his feet down off the desk swivelled in the chair to face her i wasnt going to let her go i told her id change from what but of course she knew he made a face all the hours but hell it wasnt like she didnt work around the clock either still i told her i could take on less work i would was that it then the hours thats what she said if we werent ever going to see each other anyway what was the point he left it hanging but another awkward shrug he began to say something stopped blew out some air after a minute he raised his eyes again met treyas hell you know me trey im not the best person in the world i know ive been shitty to you and theres no excuse for that i guess elaine too taking her for granted but my work he paused realizing that this wasnt going to fly no not my work it was me i know it was me his eyes implored her to believe him so what happened nothing really at least no one event thats what she said but i think it was the rain suddenly picked up loudly tattooing the window both of them turned their heads then welsh brought his attention back to her continued a couple of weeks ago you might remember we had a weekend planned go up to mendocino leave the pagers home but you had some intern problems and it didnt happen treya suppressed a smile she did mention something about that i bet she did well ok she wasnt happy jonas but she didnt talk about moving out treya paused she said she just thought you two needed to find some time to talk get some things worked out again she told you that a show of great relief he leaned into the chair stretching out with both his surgeons hands he combed the flowing black hair straight back off his forehead that helps the words the selfabsorption they betrayed struck treya like a blow how does that help jonas how can it possibly make any difference now no i dont mean with an apologetic gesture he started over of course it doesnt what i meant was i thought shed made up her mind she told me shed made up her mind but she might have listened again his eyes implored her to believe him i could have changed i could have convinced her to stay dont you think treya shook her head sadly i dont know jonas i really dont know i wasnt going to let her go he repeated now almost to himself i would have done anything she was pretty sure she knew what jonas walsh thought he was trying to say but what she heard sent a chill up the back of her spine there was a message from jackman on her desk another summons to his office his secretary flashed some attitude this time it was subtle enough to allow denial if it ever came up but treya read the message clearly uppity girl wasnt making any friends putting the moves on another partner same as she had with elaine too good to work with the rest of us and admitted inside right away too yes maam certainly mr jackman no waiting for this paralegal and isnt that a fine howdoyoudo when mr jackman had been known to keep the mayor waiting girl must think she is something but there was nothing treya could do about the jealousy it was an office after all filled mostly with women working for powerful men the claws were out protecting territory at all times so treya entered the sanctuary and jackman told her to take the seat set up in front of his desk she took it then thanked him for the lunch it was a nice idea i think people really appreciated the opportunity to talk the senior partner shrugged im afraid it may have upset dr walsh and that wasnt my intention no she paused wondering how much more to say he was upset to begin with sir he and elaine this time she stopped dead he and elaine what of course of course naturally jackman hadnt gone behind his desk instead he moved an outbasket from the corner of it and threw a leg across settling into a casual pose when was the wedding going to be june she cleared her throat june he nodded for a moment its awful he said just awful yes sir he nodded again got up walked a few steps back to his own window and looked at the rain it almost seemed to her that he was steeling himself to fire her early she held her breath well treya he began then caught himself do you mind if i call you treya what kind of name is that by the way a feeling of relief washed over her it felt like the first time shed smiled in a week treyas fine and i dont know what kind of name it is i think my dad was just weird sir he liked the sound of it ive got an older brother named sixto if thats any help and hes the first child sixto we call him six and who wouldnt smiling jackman walked the few steps back from the window put his haunch on the desk again leveled his gaze at her his expression grew serious so how is it going on the job front she drew a quick breath put on her brave face not too bad sir though its only been a couple of days ive still got a few weeks on elaines files but you do have some other work lined up not quite yet but ive put the word out im sure itll begin to trickle in before long these things dont happen overnight no i know that but jackman easily read between the lines there wasnt much if any firm work for her on the horizon my first choice is to stay here her expression revealed that she hadnt premeditated the remark was somewhat embarrassed by it well thats good news its refreshing to see loyalty in a person nowadays he threw a quick glance over her shoulder but he wasnt looking at anything his mind was working well he said matteroffactly i didnt want to step on the toes of any of my colleagues if theyd already claimed you to work but since it appears they havent it happens that i might have a small project of my own if you could find some time its mostly grunt work im afraid an old civil case thats been on continuance for four years and now suddenly judge branard has decided hes ready to review data all of which needs to be updated its probably five hundred deadly dull hours but it would give you some billable hours until you can fill your book five hundred hours he was giving her five hundred hours of work twelve weeks reprieve she struggled to keep her face impassive and wasnt entirely successful id be very interested in that sir i could start he nodded genially interrupting her next monday will be fine the files are still in storage and ive got to get them moved up here and i wouldnt want you to give it all your time say twenty hours a week i know youve got elaines work to finish but i must warn you again this is a tedious job you might want to look it over before signing on she heard herself say that that was a good idea although she knew that she would dance barefoot on hot coals if it meant keeping her salary and benefits lets say nine oclock monday morning then yes sir and thank you he smiled at her you might not thank me when you see what it is he turned to look at the rain hammering the window told her it was good to see the rain they needed rain she didnt get up perhaps she would like some coffee he always had some in midafternoon he tended to go all logy after lunch he had his own espresso machine she could bill the quarter hour or so to administrative when hed made and poured it he set the cups on the coffee table and gestured her over to the couch where they sat on opposite ends four feet apart it was excellent coffee jackman took a sip nodded with satisfaction placed the cup back on its saucer he stole a glance at her waited while she tasted the brew had put her own cup down apparently reaching some decision he turned slightly toward her i want to ask your opinion about something if you dont mind he took another moment choosing his words with care about elaine treya came forward on the couch put her elbows on her knees levelled her eyes at him you have concerns about the case i dont know if id go so far as to call them concerns if it wasnt a politicallycharged death penalty i dont know that id have given it another thought but since it is a shrug i dont know i ask myself what i would have thought if the police hadnt so conveniently found mr burgess leaning over the body if the da hadnt already crawled so far out on her public limb what would you have thought treya you knew her better than anybody else here if what specifically if shed been found shot with no suspects close at hand she let out a long breath remembered her coffee and picked up the cup to get herself a little more time held it in front of her mouth but that wasnt what happened how do we know what happened she had not asked herself why the hypothetical question had been so difficult for her maybe it was just easier having a ready answer to a painful question she didnt have to keep coming back to it now however it looked as though it wasnt going to go away when he talked to me lieutenant glitsky wanted to know the same thing if i knew anybody who might have wanted to kill her i told him that no one who knew her could have is that what you really think jackman leaned toward her onto something this lieutenant glitsky he pressed hes not a cop playing lawyer games is he no yet he had a confession and still wondered about if he had the man whod actually killed her that sounds like doubt to me treya shrugged he said hed need evidence even if it proved to be cole burgess he told me hed plead not guilty and theyd have to convict him at trial anyway they could expect years of appeals so if they could put elaine with him at a clinic or a school or something maybe theyd have a motive and that would help but he was really asking about other people jackman suddenly got up paced a few steps with his hands in his pockets turned back to her what im getting at is what that woman said at lunch in the conference room that everybody knew elaine had enemies and nobody really seemed to dispute it i knew of a few problems so im guessing you must have as well treya sat back into the deep cushions i suppose i must be a little like jonas it was hard enough getting it settled in my mind just putting the bare fact of it someplace she shook her head as if to clear it i dont know why you brought this up exactly sir what do you think i should do jackman came back to the couch sat again at the far end of it im not completely sure myself its just that no one knew elaine better than you did so you of all people might want to keep an open mind about who killed her or why suddenly treya cocked her head so youre really not certain it was cole burgess im not saying it wasnt just she was facing him on the couch now her eyes burning into his just that maybe it wasnt he shrugged he didnt know and now suddenly neither did she as a result of his meeting in chief rigby s office for the first time in nearly thirty years abe glitsky wasnt working as a cop the powers had decided to place him on administrative leave for an undisclosed period of time so he was relieved of his command of the homicide detail they had not asked for his badge or his gun but he had no trouble seeing that moment in his future they gave him an escorted halfhour to clear the personal items out of his desk and file cabinet it only took him fourteen minutes hed packed all his stuff into a battered black briefcase none of his inspectors were around to say goodbye he had the feeling that this was not a completely random event someone had passed the word to his troops that it would be better if they were gone while their exlieutenant cleared out rigby said he would be getting in touch in the next week or so after the preliminary investigation until then abe might want to prepare some defense and if not that lie low it was nearly six oclock glitsky had it on the highest authority that contrary to conventional wisdom the darkest hour was not just before dawn it was right now perversely the halogen lights over the parking lot behind the hall of justice had not switched themselves on further proof although glitsky didnt need it that even the inanimate world had entered into the conspiracy against him rain pelted the asphalt the heaviest downpour hed seen in the past couple of years hed set the briefcase down next to him hands in his jacket pockets he stood under the awning that covered the otherwise open and usually windswept corridor that led out the back door of the hall past the coroners office and the entrance to the jail his leather flight jacket was buttoned to his neck the furlined collar turned up nearly to his ears a gust of wind threw a spray of mist into his face and he backed up a step the effort to take his hands from his pockets and wipe his eyes seemed impossibly great three or four people passed him going to their own rides moans at the weather shop talk a snatch of laughter at what he wondered unable to bring himself to move forward he eventually turned around picked up the briefcase and retraced his steps halfway back to the door of the hall there he turned left ran a few steps on wet concrete and pulled at the glass door that proclaimed the offices of john strout coroner for the city and county of san francisco it was after hours though and the door was locked the night bell was marked out of order glitsky almost laughed might have even thought he was laughing except that the sound in no way resembled laughter the rain fell on his uncovered head trickled down the back of his neck he knocked hard the doors shaking beneath his fist then saving his knuckles he turned his hand to the side and pounded hard he was certain strout was inside this was the middle of the day for him he pounded again some helpful soul passing in the corridor yelled over that he thought they were closed thanks glitsky replied he waited a reasonable period of time then pounded again at the door a uniformed patrolman suddenly appeared behind him tapping him on the shoulder lets go pal he said glitsky noticed the rain dripping from the bill of his cap he had one hand on his nightstick and looked like it wouldnt take much in the way of temptation to induce him to use it no loitering here buildings closed up for the night lets move it along scowling which didnt make him prettier the lieutenant turned brushed the hand away easy cowboy he said im with homicide upstairs glitsky the cop did a doubletake and must have recognized him he all but fell backwards sheepish oh excuse me sorry sir i thought you were a bum glitsky nodded join the club part two hed be the perfect bartender not that glitsky had applied for the job or ever would but hardy thought his friend might profit from a spell working behind the bar at the little shamrock give him something to do while he waited out his suspension keep him from going stir crazy polish up those people skills that cops kept getting lectured about he was in the drivers seat stopped at a red light trying to sell the notion to his brotherinlaw moses mcguire who not incidentally was the majority partner in the bar threefourths to hardys quarter mcguire looked across the seat at hardy as though he were a martian in fact the two men had been in each others lives for nearly thirty years since theyd platooned together in vietnam where hardy had saved moses life later when hardys first marriage and life had fallen apart after the death of his son michael mcguire had returned the favor by giving hardy sanctuary a bartending job at the shamrock that hed kept for nearly a decade so the two guys were connected but hardys suggestion even in jest that abe glitsky work behind their bar was still too much to abide perfect in what way perfect honest hey theres an idea we could call him honest abe i bet hed love that im serious hed work hard show up on time take no abuse from customers because hed have driven away all the customers why would he drive away customers gee i dont know could it be because hes scary intimidating unfriendly abe we are talking about abe glitsky arent we the guy were on the way to pick up black meanlooking scar through his lips never drinks never smiles him moses atypically was dressed in a somber brown suit with a black shirt and black tie not so atypically he was having a morning tipple one of the airplaneissued oneshot bottles of lagavulin that he was carrying around with him in the pocket of his suit coat he was drinking early because hed declared it more or less a holiday he wasnt opening the bar today hed assigned the shift to one of the regular night guys because of the memorial service not that he had known elaine wager but his wife susan a cellist with the symphony had been hired with several other musicians to play at the service and he wanted to hear her the acoustics of the cavernous grace cathedral were legendary art garfunkel had once sung his vocals for an album there just him and a microphone and the vibrations off the old stones terrific stuff when hed heard that his brotherinlaw was going to the service too it cinched it for him they could make it a road trip a very short one true only thirty blocks or so but mcguire made it a point to take his fun when he could get it the car moved through the intersection hes a good guy mose mcguire was cleanshaven this month he hadnt been in a fight since before christmas the last broken nose had somehow set straight and with his saltandpepper hair combed back he looked almost dashing albeit twenty years older than his chronological age i know hes a good guy he said often ill say to myself that abe glitsky what a good guy but that doesnt mean hed be a good bartender you know why tell me because bartenders in theory should have personalities hardy threw a glare across the seat abes got a personality ok let me rephrase it bartenders should have good personalities warm inviting even charming much like myself he savored a mouthful of scotch even you on a good day in your youth from time to time would achieve the lower rung of charming but glitsky i dont think so no hardy turned the car onto lake pulled to a stop at a onceinadecade curbside opening almost directly in front of glitskys duplex it was nine thirty on a bright cold and sunny monday morning one week after elaines murder hardy let himself out of the car then leaned back in an afterthought i dont think we need to bring it up ok ill be my usual sensitive self mcguire assured him and tipped up the tiny bottle in spite of his promise to be sensitive mcguire started providing hot job tips almost as soon as glitsky got into the car hed already opined that maybe abe could find work selling real estate setting up web pages on the internet he could open a chop house with all the great gourmet restaurants in the city the place was crying out for a good oldfashioned chop house glitsky in the back seat dangerously calm started rattling them off alfreds johns jacks little joes ok then ok forget the chop house how about maybe private investigator for diz it went on and on maybe it wasnt too late for abe to go back to school become a doctor or lawyer or something an accountant was abe good with numbers like mcguire glitsky was in a business suit although he rarely saw the need for it the lieutenant could dress when he wanted to adjusting the knot on his electric blue tie he squinted out the back window then reached into an inside pocket removed some sunglasses put them on mcguire happened to catch the move i like it he said very samuel jackson he was twisting the cap on his third little bottle a thought struck him and he stopped snapping his fingers hey maybe acting hardy glanced sideways wishing his brotherinlaw would shut up but he was shooting more scotch oblivious until suddenly hardy didnt even see it glitsky was leaning over the front seat his gun in his hand up against mcguires head his voice rasped but the tone was one of exquisite calm im going to blow your fuckin head off he said mcguire swore violently pulled himself away banging his head against the passenger window dropping his scotch his face was a mask of terror hardy was startled too slamming on the brakes tires squealing he swerved right jesus abe but quick as hed come forward glitsky was leaning back into his seat getting comfortable replacing the gun in his shoulder holster in the rearview hardy saw the scar burning white in his lips glitsky was actually smiling enough to show a few teeth which was almost unheard of acting he said nodding i think i could do that i had you guys for a minute there didnt i the rest of the way downtown mcguire didnt say a word parking on a normal day was bad enough but elaines memorial service drew a substantial crowd hardy couldnt find anyplace within five blocks since grace cathedral is at the summit of nob hill they had a long walk all of it steeply up when they rounded the last corner and came in sight of the churchs steps they stopped and mcguire took the opportunity to tell them he wanted to go inside early make sure he got a spot where he could see his wife glitsky and hardy hung back hardy didnt think it was because they needed to catch their breaths that was a nice little moment back there subtle though i did almost crash the car i knew you wouldnt i wasnt worried about it glitskys mouth lifted a quarter inch well hardy said that made one of us hardy felt as though he wanted to say a little more about it but realized that the subject had been thoroughly covered all issues resolved messages delivered they stood together awhile in silence glitsky got out his sunglasses again put them on perhaps against the glare of all the people he recognized from his work police brass were showing up in significant numbers you sure you want to do this hardy asked there was no trace of a smile now ive got to do this this was what hed told hardy over the weekend he hadnt been there for his daughters birth or in her life he was damn well going to be here for this and this was the only reason hardy had decided to come moral support for his pal who in the wake of recent events could certainly use some now though catching some sense of the mood of the place hardy wondered if it would turn out to be a good idea after all yeah but you dont have to be seen here with me glitsky shrugged i mean you and me together i know what you mean he said ill try to keep my hands off you i promise there was no impetus to move inside in the open area by the cathedrals main entrance people continued arriving on foot got let out of cars and taxis singles couples small groups it was twenty minutes until the service was scheduled to begin and already the forecourt was packed a snatch of narration carried from somewhere expecting close to five hundred mourners from every walk of the citys public life this charismatic young womans tragic death has fired the imaginations of it being san francisco of course there were already several groups of demonstrators hanging around any excuse for a party they were just starting to get organized on the periphery of the crowd hardy could see placards for and against the death penalty in the park across the street he could make out where earnest groups had set up tables giving out literature on drug abuse awareness programs the nation of islam homeless advocates gun control lobbyists and their opponents a mime dressed as a world war i doughboy had sprayed himself head to toe in bronze paint and gotten himself up on the pillar by the cathedrals door he didnt move a muscle a living statue with his rifle trained down on the crowd three of the local news vans had scored some primo reserved parking nearby and teams with their reporters and cameras were unloading and shooting getting some broll local color a limo slowly pulled up through the congestion and stopped behind several others as the mayor emerged from behind the tinted windows one of the news crews recognized him and yelled something about it around hardy and glitsky the crowd seemed to become more dense pressing into itself it no longer seemed cold lieutenant glitsky turned around nodding matteroffactly how you doing ridley the young cop shifted uncomfortably not too good i guess tonguetied it wasnt much glitskys nature to give anything away but hed considered himself in some ways the boys mentor in the years since hed come up to homicide so he cut him some slack making conversation indicating hardy you know my friend banks said sure nodded again didnt offer a handshake though he kept his attention on abe i thought youd be here he said awkwardly looks like you were right glitsky could throw him a bone but he wasnt about to spoonfeed him if ridley wanted to say something hed have to figure out how it took him a minute the thing is he began ok im not blaming anybody else it was completely my fault but you should know that torrey sandbagged me no response none the sergeant continued when the arraignment got over we were standing around outside in the hallway afterward you know talking about it all of us pretty pissed off mostly at uh he made a gesture let me guess hardy put in that would have been me banks seemed grateful for the help yeah so anyway i knew you had problems with the tape i knew you and hardy here you went back so torrey is all bitching and moaning about howd hardy know so much about everything so soon and i just blurted out that i wouldnt be surprised if you showed him the tape sometimes blurting out is a strategic error banks looked directly at hardy yeah but in court you made it pretty clear youd seen it back to glitsky torrey didnt seem to remember that but i did so i figured it had to be you abe glitsky finally was moved to speak deductions a great tool it didnt come out as a compliment ridley kept on but i didnt think hed i mean i didnt know it was going to go this way that wasnt why i brought up the tape to get at you i know we disagreed about it you and me and i didnt want you to think what it was was we were just all talking wondering out loud and i guess i got caught up in it the rambling narrative wound down ridley looked as though hed been having a miserable few days worrying about all this glitsky couldnt say that the boys malaise bothered him too much maybe ridley would pick up a useful lesson about politics that would serve him well in his dotage but in the here and now the sergeant had messed up his lieutenants life pretty good now he was saying he hadnt meant to do it which helped exactly zero glitsky removed his sunglasses and folded his arms over his chest his voice when he spoke had a resigned quality to it the anger all leached out well i guess we both got caught up in it then didnt we rid after a moment banks realized that this was about all he was going to get from glitsky in the way of absolution he took in a breath let it out heavily so what are you going to do now im waiting until somebody in rigbys office decides something a shrug a glance at hardy meanwhile im exploring some other career opportunities hes thinking of opening a chop house hardy pokerfaced not really banks asked it could happen glitsky replied equally deadpan you never know the church bells began to peal cutting off the riff it was a quarter to ten still fifteen minutes until the service but at the signal the crowd shifted began to move ridley wasnt ready for that yet he still wanted some more resolution anyway abe listen if theres anything i can do glitsky raised a hand a farewell he was going inside now rid listen its done dont worry about it he turned for the cathedral leaving banks out where hed found them hardy hustled a step or two and fell in beside him you know what i cant believe he asked whats that my brotherinlaw doesnt think you have a sense of humor glitsky threw him a sideways glance hes not paying close enough attention it was the day that treya was supposed to begin on the grayson project for mr jackman but he and mr rand had closed down the firm for the morning so that all of elaines coworkers could attend the memorial treya had arrived early to pay her own private respects she found grace to be an odd sort of cathedral with its classic lines stained glass and cavernous open space in some ways it almost seemed to fit the medieval mold an imposing edifice calculated to reflect the majesty and glory of god but this church for the past twenty years or so had also been the locus of compassion support and empathy for the victims of aids and now the heartbreaking quilts hanging over her seemed to fill all the open space humanizing the cold stone in a tragic way yes but treya found it strangely comforting she felt it strongly this was no longer the home of some harsh and angry deity but a true community center with an almost palpable sense of forgiveness acceptance serenity outside the large crowd might be milling uneasily but in here there was only peace shed wandered about inside for a while and finally seated herself in the sixth row on the right she had no need to claim any pride of place people had begun filing in talking quietly among themselves it was no surprise to see a lot of her colleagues if she wanted to use that word from the firm it was even less of one that they held mostly to their cliques none of them sat in her row clarence jackman tapped her on the shoulder said hello introduced her to his wife moira a regal matron in black treya recognized some of the students from hastings who had been to rand and jackman for the postarraignment gathering last week the mayor arminarm with the district attorney then her chief assistant torrey the prosecutor at the arraignment someone who was actually trying to do the right thing to bring elaines killer to justice the volume steadily increased echoing in the open space and treya turned in her pew to catch a glimpse of the incoming flow she had to catch her breath as almost directly behind her she recognized abe glitsky and she had a hard time even believing the gall of it the lawyer hardy whod been in the courtroom representing elaines killer the lieutenant seemed as disconcerted to see her as she was to see him he put out a hand stopping hardy then nodded now abreast of her he halted is this pew reserved in somber and measured strides gabriel torrey walked up the center aisle and slowly mounted the lectern to the left of the altar at the front of the cathedral the dying strains of the string quartets powerful arrangement of amazing grace still seemed to hang in the air the chief assistant district attorney wore a charcoal armani suit a white shirt with a black silk tie his left lapel sported a little red aids ribbon his right a tiny red rose for a short while he gathered himself when he was ready he raised his head and looked out over the enormous congregation more than five hundred souls were seated in the pews and standing behind them and to both sides filling in all the space to the far walls after adjusting the microphone he spoke with a quiet even intimate familiarity his voice firm and evenly pitched this is a remembrance he began midway through the service she couldnt take it anymore suddenly she stood walked the length of the pew away from glitsky and strode for the back door of the cathedral outside the cold sunlight glare stopped her and she stood on the steps blinking drawing gulps of air are you all right she turned knowing who it was hed followed her out her hand went to her neck her hair she started down the steps before her eyes had adjusted stumbled he was right with her and caught her by the arm preventing her from falling as soon as she recovered and realized he was still holding her she all but shook off his hand immediately he let go and stepped back are you all right he repeated im fine fine she straightened up i dont need your help no its just that you i thought you might faint i dont faint ive never fainted in my life shaking her head she spun for a moment back toward the cathedrals doors then took another step away from them toward the park getting away finally her breath hitched and she focused on him i cant believe you came here i think its appalling he backed away a step but she wasnt through yet and your friend thats a great touch elaines killers lawyer whats that all about him being here this is supposed to be for her friends for the people who miss her not for not for somebody like him and you having said her piece she was done goodbye lieutenant she started down the steps again glitsky didnt know what he was doing not exactly he certainly hadnt planned to move into her row in the church to sit next to her to follow her out now she was telling him goodbye again dismissing him and he was following after her ms ghent please after a few steps she slowed and came to a stop her shoulders heaved in a deep sigh and when she turned to face him he noticed that her nostrils had flared in anger or frustration or both hipshot she crossed her arms what im going to need to look at elaines files he really didnt know what he was doing now there was no way on earth he could look through elaines files he was on administrative leave he couldnt get a warrant it was ridiculous even to suggest it but suddenly he knew what he had to do the police his own police department werent going to look it was going to come to him to lock down this case and elaines files were the best place to begin havent we been through this didnt i just see cole burgess arraigned the other day for her murder she took a breath look i know those files and hes not in them ok she didnt know him im not saying she did so what are you saying he realized that hed been seeing her face since the last time hed been with her now he raised his eyes looking out behind her he had to take off the gloves and he didnt want to see the effect it would have on her features the first thing is im wondering why youre so hostile now he did meet her eyes a cold empty stare came back at him he ignored it normally somebodys so hostile to the police we wonder why that might be her reaction if she had one at all seemed to be a greater depth of loathing if glitsky thought intimidation would affect her he was dead wrong she set her jaw narrowed her eyes in disparagement whats the second thing the second thing he wrestled with it internally the second thing is im not absolutely positively beyond any doubt sure that we have the bastard that killed elaine and ive got to be sure of that and get what do you call it the collar another feather in your cap surprised at this direction he shook his head i dont care about that another short pause i cared about elaine this time she snapped back at him and thats why youre here at this memorial arent you because you care because you were her friend she was in a high fury her eyes threatening to spill over and thats why you brought your friend with you i suppose because you both care so much well let me tell you something its pretty damn transparent and it makes me sick what is what are you talking about im talking about your pretending to be close to elaine so maybe witnesses will talk to you glitsky was rocked by her vehemence he held his hands out supplicating i dont even have any witnesses and even if i did why would i do that i couldnt care less if witnesses like me you never get a witness who likes you and who cares they talk if you can make them he didnt realize it consciously but the habits of twenty years were kicking in he was a cop this was turning into an interrogation what i want to know he said is why you dont want to talk to me you were elaines friend coworker maybe confidante and yet you dont want to help me make sure about who killed her i wonder about that she challenged him with her expression spoke into his face i dont believe you how about that i dont believe anything you say you didnt care about her then and you dont now she moved forward almost close enough to kiss him she knew she whispered hoarsely about you dont you understand her own father her real father and you never acknowledged her never even tried glitskys mouth opened to defend himself but there was no defense and no words came treya kept at him and she didnt dare approach you big tough hardass homicide lieutenant with the big sign saying keep away everybody keep away and youre trying to tell me you cared well excuse me but i was there i saw how much you cared how much it hurt her how you broke her heart glitsky was a stone embedded in the pavement behind them the doors opened and the strains of the string quartet floated out a lone trumpet played a mournful solo piercing the morning air finally glitsky turned as the first mourners appeared there was a tingling sensation in his face and then on its heels a great almost unendurable pressure in his chest he turned back to treya ghent the beautiful outrage the righteous indignation he opened his mouth again and again no words came his own heart felt as though it was exploding pain shot out through his limbs and he felt himself falling crumbling he felt the cold of the day come up at him he had a vision of an almost purple sky of a noise like a rushing wind of treya ghent somehow reaching for him just as hed caught her minutes earlier and then it was dark it was dark hardy rubbed his hand over his eyes and realized that night had fallen outside while hed been sitting at his desk he looked at his watch had he called frannie to tell her he was missing dinner said goodnight to the kids he didnt even remember oh yes he did now frannie knew what he was going through and he could stay down and catch up as long as he needed things at home were under control the kids had already finished homework and were on their way to bed tomorrow would arrive bright and early maybe it wouldnt kill him if he wanted to put something off come home but it was his call no pressure he stood up and put his hands on the small of his back did a half turn in each direction trying to get the crick out coming around his desk he flicked on the room lights by the door to his office hed been reading in the pool of light created by the green bankers lamp on his desk studying the first of the discovery documents in the cole burgess case pictures of the crime scene the arresting officers reports autopsy interrogation transcript with ridley banks outside in the hallway he stood a minute listening for other signs of life in the building nothing he walked down the halfdark stairs until he could get a view of david freemans office the door was closed and no hint of light came from under it so apparently even the old man had gone home for the night the laggard he thought imagine freeman going home before ten whatever for he had no life outside the law but hardy wished he had been there wished he could talk to him he stayed for a long moment on the stair then walked the rest of the way down into freemans unlocked office if phyllis could only see him now he thought but it gave him no real solace he went to the wet bar and poured himself three inches of scotch then went back to the door with his glass and took a last look at the room lazy slug he muttered aloud back upstairs in his office his drink on his desk he pulled three darts from the board and paced off the distance to the tape line hed put down at the eightfoot mark throwing easily willing his mind to go empty he hit the and on the first round he noticed but just barely and went to the board to retrieve the round then went back around his desk swallowed a mouthful of his drink and picked up the telephone again punched in the hospitals number intensive care nurses station he said glitsky was still incommunicado as of now it wasnt certain he would ever again be otherwise he was under heavy sedation the call got bounced to the nurses station where they filled him in on more of the nothing that had changed in the two hours since hed called last time there was no one else at the hospital that hardy could talk to glitskys father and son had gone home his condition was listed as guarded hardy hung up looked at the darts still in his hand wondered where they had come from he drank some scotch halfheartedly he opened one of the folders in front of him and there it was again staring him in the face the damning nearly incontrovertible evidence against cole burgess who hardy reminded himself not to forget had never once denied that he had killed elaine wager after all at best hed said he couldnt remember and hardy didnt kid himself he thought that there was an excellent chance that cole had in fact killed elaine he might be able to fashion an argument to convince a jury that his client was legally innocent he absolutely believed that this was not a special circumstances death penalty murder no matter what but nothing could hide the terrible fact of what had happened and if cole had been prowling the alleys looking for prey and that appeared to have been the case and then killed elaine because he was strung out and just didnt quite understand what exactly was happening then hardy didnt like where he was and the more he looked the more he saw both of the arresting officers told essentially the same story even if their reports had slightly different details most notably one of them said he heard a shot and its ricochet during the chase but the rest of the facts were undisputed and from hardys perspective depressing and damning one of the most difficult problems hardy was going to face when this thing came to trial was the whole question of the character of the defendant now the good news regarding character is that neither side could mention character in any relevant context unless the defense brought it up first after that though it was open season so hardy sensed that he was going to be faced with a dilemma if he brought it up that cole was really an ok person who just had a disease addiction and could supply witnesses such as high school teachers old friends his mother and so on to prove it then torrey could bring up the years of theft petty crimes and minor assaults that were part and parcel of coles history and even if hardy didnt raise coles character in the guilt phase of the trial the jury would hear about the facts of this crime and they were particularly ugly the police had come upon cole after he had picked the body clean of its jewelry they discovered all of it on his person in his pockets he had ripped a heavy gold necklace from around elaines throat slicing the skin of her neck in the process hed pulled a halfcarat diamond engagement ring off her finger breaking the finger at the knuckle as he did so he had ripped the earrings from her pierced earlobes he had inflicted all of these injuries post mortem according to the autopsy they were the only bruises and marks except the bullet entry wound on elaines body and cole had quite definitely inflicted them he didnt remember that either hed gone through her purse taking the money from her wallet leaving the credit cards apparently realizing even in his stupor that no one would mistake him for an elaine which led hardy to the whole question of coles sobriety or lack of it during the commission of the crime everyone the arresting officers banks glitsky agreed that he seemed to be either drunk or stoned but as he read over the documents hardy realized that there was no proof of that either no one had given him a breath or blood test and theyd sweated him long enough that by the time hed been admitted to the hospital his bloodalcohol level was about at zero the prosecution could easily argue that coles apparent unconsciousness after his arrest in the police car was an act and hardy would be hard put to refute it especially in light of coles flight when the arresting officers flushed him his eventual crash into the hydrant notwithstanding cole had run swiftly and with determination away from the pursuing officer so much so that he had been pulling away during the chase and if not for the hydrant nearly invisible on the dark night at street level would quite possibly have escaped he was not staggering not speaking with any slur more noticeable than his usual drugaddict drawl after they put him in the squad car he apparently passed out hardy could argue that the adrenaline had kicked in then worn off but it was not going to be an easy sell he closed the folder again looked at his drink which had evaporated checked his watch it was ten thirty he considered calling the hospital again but realized he couldnt bear to hear it tonight if glitsky were dead hed still be dead in the morning the alcohol hadnt touched him it was time to go home wearing his paper slippers and orange jail jumpsuit a sullen inmate named cullen leon alsop sloped into the visitors room in the homicide detail he got himself arranged in his wooden chair leaning back as comfortably as he could with his hands cuffed a slackjawed smirk in place it was the middle of the night after lockdown and he was alone here except for the cop whod escorted him over from the jail a black guy he incorrectly figured to be about his age cullen knew he was a cop but he couldnt have told from what he wore a blue nylon windbreaker black shirt with the top button loose royal blue tie across the table in the airless room the cop adopted pretty much the same posture as cullen and the inmate found this disturbing he was the one turning over important evidence in a murder case they ought to be treating him with more respect give him some donuts and coffee or something at least get his cuffs off and instead heres this spearchucker yoyo giving him tude he had half a mind to call the whole thing off but he had to get out of here and this was the only way so he settled deeper into the unyielding wood and waited the cop finally came forward with a weary exhalation of breath he withdrew a small portable tape recorder from a pocket and put it on the table sergeant ridley banks badge fourteen oh two its ten thirty on monday feb eight and im in an interrogation room on the fourth floor of the hall of justice san fran talking to consummately bored he consulted the folder in front of him cullen leon alsop white male twentyfive years old case number he rattled off a bunch of numbers alsop had had enough hed been through this type of thing more than once and this wasnt feeling right to him he interrupted hey banks looked up eyes dead quiet please cullen shook his head made some i dont believe this gesture straightened up in his chair hey he repeated i got a deal going here with the da and you banks reached for the recorder and snapped it off did i just tell you to shut up when i ask you a question you answer me otherwise i dont want to hear you do you hear me cullen shrugged and banks came forward like an attacking animal up out of his chair slamming a flat palm with a noise like a gunshot on the table that was a question i asked if you could hear me so if youre smart you say yes sir do you hear that cullen decided to be smart ok yeah yes sir good banks picked up the recorder pushed the button again resumed in his monotone now mr alsop for the record youre in jail for selling crack cocaine your fourth offense is that correct yeah but you were out on the street again on probation this seemed vaguely amusing to cullen three probations man i mean i dont know why you guys dont all talk to each other or something who all you guys cops das the judges decide between you whether its against the law or not to deal in this town ok next time youre worried about it heres the answer it is cullen barked out a laugh so tell it to some judge i got three convictions in the last seventeen months im talking convictions man not arrests the judge says hey cut it out really i tell him ok i promise and he puts me out on the street that day and tomorrow im back in business next time its hey you promised so i say im sorry and promise again then the third time same thing well this time it isnt the same thing a shrug maybe well see anyway its why were talking right now about the gun yeah that the one i lended to cole lended yeah lended something wrong with that he paid you money for it he was gonna that was the plan when after he got a day job cullen leon alsop conveyed his disbelief at bankss stupidity but saw something in the inspectors eyes and cut it off heres the deal he said we hang a lot together sometimes i get him stuff you know put him in touch but saturday hes got no money and he needs to score i mean bad you know and im out too or he woulda done me im sure friends or no friends but i got a hold of this little popgun howd that happen an evasive shrug eyes all around the room somebody traded me one a few weeks ago who i dont know some guy for what what did you trade it for i dont remember something i had you know you got a big barter community out there banks made an impatient face and cullen got back onto the point anyway so i showed it to cole and why did he want it the gun to rob somebody cullen flashed an empty smile hey good maybe you oughta be a cop you got it all figured out something in bankss face backed him away though changed his tone so he was gonna go score bring me back the piece and fifty bucks on top for my trouble but i didnt know he was going to kill anybody with it he wasnt planning anything like that thats not who he was normally so who was he a shrug a guy to hang with party you know i dont know actually i understood he lived on the street most of those guys dont go to a lot of parties yeah but he lived with his mom he could get his hands on some wheels when he wanted them he just liked to party thats all score get high for a few days then maybe he wouldnt get home and crash somewhere else banks was digesting this but not comfortably ok but you got arrested last time when was that maybe tuesday morning i dont know you could look it up easier than me half an hour later ridley banks was at his desk his elbows were planted on the blotter in front of him his hands steepled at his lips a couple of times a minute he blew into them heavily his eyes burned with fatigue it had been a long day in the field and then returning to the office after nine hed picked up his messages and heard about glitskys heart attack and also cullen leon alsop the purported source of the gun that cole burgess had used to kill elaine wager he hadnt felt right since hed gone up against his lieutenant on the burgess confession then came the startlingly swift decision to put glitsky on administrative leave now the cardiac arrest ridley couldnt shake the feeling that it was all related and part of it was his fault abe had been his most ardent supporter helping to get him promoted into homicide from robbery then once he was aboard hed acted as ridleys mentor getting him up to speed keeping him from at least a dozen egregious errors in his first year or two and he asked himself was this his payback to abe for all of that loyalty and concern he hated it hated himself this was why hed seen this lowlife cullen immediately if at least some new evidence came to light that could make the case stronger against cole burgess ridley would be able to console himself with the fact that he was even more right than hed been before it wasnt all going to come down to the confession hed played that over both on the physical tape and in his mind almost continually since theyd busted abe in his career ridley had sweated maybe half a dozen other suspects into confessions he kept asking himself whether he treated burgess any differently than any of those he couldnt really say he had except maybe for the heroin connection the supposed withdrawal but hed done the same kind of thing before by simple persistence by using whatever leverage worked the pressure applied by a trained relentless interrogator could be great this didnt make for false confessions in his experience while people sometimes would confess to something they didnt do usually this was when they werent even suspects in the first place some lunatic would walk in or call the station and say that theyd committed some crime banks had once seen a man come in and confess to a murder because hed become enamored of the published pictures of the woman who was actually on trial for the murder and he thought shed be grateful to him for taking the heat off her putting it all on himself greater love than this and perhaps later when the guy got out of jail or acquitted at trial because after all he hadnt really done it he and the woman could date or get married or something raise little murder suspects of their own but ridley believed that the burgess confession which hed carefully wrung out of him did not fall in this category he believed that if you had a suspect at the scene of the crime when the crime was committed with the weapon nearby and physical evidence that gave him a reasonable motive and that person finally got persuaded to admit hed done it it was a virtual certainty that he had people wanted to confess to tell what theyd done this was human nature although sometimes you had to use a mental cattle prod to get down to basics it was far more a cerebral endeavor than a physical one and even on the physical plane it hadnt gone nearly so far as to be cruel and unusual there was discomfort perhaps cole hadnt been on a picnic up here but ridleys interview in his mind and memory had been a true interrogation a far cry from the paininduced confessions of the worlds myriad torture chambers even given all that though another link in the chain of culpability was always a nice thing and cullen leon alsop might have been just that this was why late as it was tired as he was ridley had wanted to bring him up here and interview him right away if he was convincing if he had something truly substantive to add about the provenance of the gun maybe tonight ridley wouldnt toss in bed until the fitful dawn broke big ifs and neither had panned out to ridleys satisfaction which was not to say that cullens evidence wouldnt get a lot of attention apparently it did eliminate one of the unanswered questions in the prosecutions case where cole burgess had acquired the gun it also strengthened the argument for murder if he believed it he did believe in the truth of the rest of the facts in this case that was the irony hed been there sitting four feet across the table from cole burgess when hed said hed done it after all he was sorry he didnt know why he didnt really remember but he did do it he was sure of it and ridley had believed him believed theyd finally come to the truth but now cullens vague unsubstantiated testimony which seemed to fill a hole but which was really unprovable testimony of the he said but then he said variety and the timing of it bothered him the snitch appearing at such an opportune moment it didnt make him doubt that cole had killed elaine but it did make him wonder a yawn overtook him and he stretched like a cat his whole body all right he had to get some sleep enough was enough but the interview with cullen hadnt gone on for too long maybe fifteen minutes he should listen to the tape once through and make better notes before copying it for the da they wouldnt get the transcript back to him for at least a week and he wanted a clear memory of what had been said so he rewound the tape pushed the button and began listening after his intro and cullens first interruption the next words he heard were i got a deal going here with the da and he played it again ridley himself hadnt made any deal with cullen the da hadnt mentioned a deal to him the message from that office had been that an inmate at the jail had information on the cole burgess case and ridley might want to interview him but no one had said they had made a deal although it seemed as though cullen was under that impression one thing was for sure ridley was going to look into it and find out mom treya was in her tiny breakfast nook six elongated windows in a semicircle off her slightlylarger kitchen there was one light in the nook off now a fan under it spinning gently although the night outside was cold and the house cool she was sitting on the first four inches of her chair ramrod straight both palms flat on the table she might have been trying to make it levitate mom raney stood silhouetted in the dim light from somewhere in the back of the duplex she was already taller than treyas five feet seven skinny with no hips and justbudding breasts she wore her hair shoulderlength and had it tied off to one side in a kind of pigtail tonight shed worn jogging shorts and a giants sweatshirt to bed is everything ok treya had tucked her in nearly an hour before and come out here turning out lights as she went she poured herself a glass of tap water sat down at the table hadnt moved oh im fine treya often thought that it was her fate to exist in a limited world with a single acceptable public posture crisp and when possible cheerful efficiency all the rest of her feelings emotions aspirations and opinions had best remain unspoken unexpressed it was safest that way where nobody could fault you for a bad attitude an unguarded remark she had always most keenly felt this need for control in the presence of her daughter in this complicated world raney didnt need a role model who complained who couldnt cope who might die like her dad had raney needed strength all of treyas strength she didnt need to see anything else treya put a false brightness in her tone but what is my girl still doing on this side of dreamland on a school night youre going to be dragging come morning she started to force herself up ready to tuck her in again ive been standing here in the kitchen for ten minutes mom you havent moved a muscle what are you thinking another smile i guess i just dont know hon to tell you the truth i dont suppose im much for thinking this time of night maybe i was sleeping sitting up your eyes were open you were just staring straight ahead well an embarrassed shrug she sat back down tried to smile although it came out a little crooked raney moved up next to her and put her arm around her shoulders keeping it there she pulled a chair up close and sat in it then laid her head against her mothers are you sad about elaine treya didnt know if she trusted herself to talk she cleared her throat forced a matteroffact tone people die girl the living have to carry on for an answer she felt her daughters arm tighten around her shoulders she felt her lips kiss her temple i love you you know she let out a deep and labored breath there was a policeman at the service this morning she said lieutenant glitsky about elaine she nodded waited whispered he was her father raney straightened up i thought her father was dead no she replied another sigh its a long story but her mother the senator loretta wager well she and lieutenant glitsky were lovers when she was young before she got married she paused just before anyway loretta was pregnant when she got married and she made her husband believe that elaine was his did she tell lieutenant glitsky no not till much later just before she died you mean all that time he didnt know his own daughter right thats horrible id be so mad if that happened to me treya wasnt much in the mood but she had to smile well thats yet another great thing about being female girl you generally know it when you have a baby but elaine didnt know it either didnt know her own dad no not until after her mother died shed left her a letter a letter about something like that there was a lengthy silence so then what did she do elaine did she go and see him no she didnt think it was her place she thought he should come to her which he never did never she shook her head it never happened hes just a cold man he didnt care was that why why what why didnt he tell her didnt he care i would think so treya reached for her water glass and took a drink why else wouldnt he she shrugged maybe the same reason she didnt tell him he might have thought it wasnt his place he didnt want to butt in the simple truth of it rocked treya and she shook her head no youd have to meet him hes just hard as nails maybe he just doesnt show things i know somebody like that the arm tightened again and treya leaned into it so he was there this morning what happened she was back to the thought that wouldnt go away i think i might have killed him at jupiter things were hopping at earsplitting volume with the bass boosted to rattle the bones shania twain was telling her honey she was home and wanted a cold one and the way the bartender was hopping behind the bar she wasnt the only one it was a rectangular room sixteen feet wide and a good bit more than twice that long the stools at the bar itself were all taken fifteen men and six women all of them between twentynine and thirtyfive none of them destined to go home alone tonight another three or four dozen people stood behind them on the thin stretch of floor between the bar and the booths or in the bullpen opening just behind them shoulder to shoulder and hip to crotch the young professionals drinking here were mostly in law enforcement police and attorneys law students and clerks a smattering of excitement groupies who loved the scene jupiter was their place they could let it out here among friends and colleagues most of the people here felt that outside they lived in a constricted powder keg of frustration tension even danger some of the married ones existed in a constant state of schizophrenia their daily life in the cop world and their home in suburbia jupiter was the decompression chamber that allowed them to survive the passage from the souleating mindnumbing pressure of the one to the souleating mindnumbing boredom of the other tiny windows high up in the bare yellow walls dripped with condensation and gave a subterranean feel to the place even in the daytime with its long and narrow shape the bar felt like the inside of a submarine but by night this feeling was especially pronounced it is illegal to smoke cigarettes in eating or drinking establishments in san francisco yet the air was blue and acrid thick with tobacco smoke a few complaints had actually been filed from random walkin dogooders but somehow theyd all mysteriously gotten lost whatever it was that rose from the vats of french fry oil and the hamburger grills back in the kitchen added their own weight and odor to the air tonight at eleven fiftyone the temperature outside was degrees it was degrees hot in the furthest of the six booths from the front door in that booth dash logan had removed his coat and draped it over the naugahyde behind him the top two buttons on his dress shirt were undone his tie was loose cleanshaven with a boyish face and perennial smile he passed in the dim light for midthirties the gold post in his left ear didnt hurt either he fancied that the neat short ponytail and the subtle dye job drew attention away from the fact that the reddish hair was thinning and he might not have been all wrong certainly tonight he was doing all right with connie and she couldnt have been thirty yet hed had his eye on her since she came in with some secretaries he knew from the federal courthouse she was a first timer here at least he hadnt seen her before and he would have noticed and in this showroom you didnt waste time if some quality merchandise moved itself out onto the floor he knew one of the girls with whom connie he loved that name even had come in and before they knew what had hit them he got himself introduced and bought a round for the bunch of them connie had undone some of the top buttons on her purple silk blouse too she was turned on the seat toward him and the light material fell tantalizingly away from her breasts he could just make out the black lace at the top of her bra shed had four whiskey sours since shed come in just across the table at the same booth one of connies friends had hooked up with another guy dash knew him a young lawyer with the public defenders office married they had been talking yelling over the music about some case for most of the past hour and it looked to him as though thats where they would stay her pretending to be interested in his work him trying to find the guts either to finish what hed started or to call it a night dash thought he probably wasnt up to either the problem with youth these days he thought in spite of ads exhorting just do it everywhere you turned they couldnt seem to just fuckin do anything this waffling right across the table with one of connies own friends could ruin the whole vibe hed seen it happen the girlfriend hits her boredom quotient looks at her watch and goes oh connie look what time it is and weve got work tomorrow and then they both split but dash was going pretty good here telling funny stories keeping connie laughing keeping her drink filled he had a good feeling about tonight but he had to act before this dweeb across the table ruined everything he wanted to yell at the kid get a clue shes half in your lap with four drinks in her and her tits falling out of her blouse what do you think she wants it was time to make some magic connie he had to lean in closer to be heard he kissed the side of her cheek pulled back sorry he said i couldnt stand it anymore its ok she was smiling at him perfect teeth great skin one of those terrific northern italian noses that was cute cute was good he thought hed take cute so are you a little warm you want to go outside and cool off she nodded that does sound good actually here ill get your coat her girlfriend noticed where are you going dash leaned across the table back in five promise save our places will you with a light hand on her back he guided connie through the crowd then outside when the doors to the bar closed behind them dash came up beside her loud in there connie was hugging her arms but cold out here he had carried both their jackets out and helped put hers on better some but clearly not enough with no hesitation he took his own coat and draped it over her jupiter was in an industrial neighborhood and the street was wide with a railroad track down the center of it streetlights illuminated the entire block it was a cop bar city services tended to work the street though deserted actually looked inviting he held out his hand she took it and they began to walk hed parked twothirds down the street and they stopped to admire his bmw z would you like to sit in it he opened the door let her in went around to his side it was a convertible but the top was up and inside he turned on the motor and the heat ok he put on an accent you want to kick it up a notch she nearly squealed with delight oh you watch emeril i love him dash was shaking his head nobody loves him as much as i do i even love it that theres nobody on the food channel anymore except him except one other what is it the iron chef something like that connie was into it but emeril lets kick it up a notch bam i love that he reached over and touched her knee the skirt had ridden up to her midthigh he popped the glove compartment and took out a small vial of white powder kick it up a real notch in half a minute he had poured it out onto the mirror from the glove box and arranged it into four short lines just good oldfashioned nose candy i dont want to force you to do anything one of the lines disappeared up his nose see harmless then he made a face and blew out comically she watched him he finished the second line you know some nights ill get home all wired and turn on the tube and watch like three emerils in a row now that is loving the man what i dont understand is how come he doesnt get tired i do three shows in a row at two am and im gonna be dragging i promise not with that in you in ten minutes they were talking about going back to his apartment which wasnt more than three miles up across market but what about your friend oh she drove we talked about it if im not there shell just go home at seven fifteen on this tuesday morning rich mcneil bundled in a heavy overcoat was looking over a guanostained railing into the green waters of the bay further along the railing a lone asian fisherman smoked and walked back and forth pausing every few steps to tug at one of his lines in the fifteen minutes that mcneil had been waiting hed pulled up two small fish and put them in a burlap sack that he had suspended into the water a light but steady glissando of traffic noise emanated along the embarcadero wheels hissing on the dewslicked cobbles the water vanished into a moderate fog at fifty yards and somewhere far off seals were barking their cries carried over the trackless distance in a symphony of desolation hands deep in his pockets mcneil shuddered against the chill at the sound of footsteps approaching behind him he turned hey diz hardy wore a raincoat over his business suit he extended his hand and the two men shook this is a cheerful spot mcneil turned his head as though seeing where he stood for the first time it is a little bleak i guess ive got some deliverables coming in by boat at pier eighteen and i want to be there to meet it but i wanted to see you first before work he hesitated before i had any more time to change my mind about what although hardy had a pretty good idea well he took a breath steeling himself i appreciate all youve done for me on this problem with gait but ive talked to sally and weve pretty much decided to just say the hell with it sell the damn building take our money and pay off that bastard just so hell go away maybe the insurance company will cover the civil settlement hardy had his hands in the pockets of his raincoat he cocked his head to one side are you sure you want to do that rich your insurance wont cover it theyll say the theft charge isnt covered by your policy its going to cost you close to what you originally paid for the whole building well he sighed i know i know sally and i were just thinking about what the trial was going to put us through cost us all of that and for what to keep manny gait from shaking you down rich how about that you didnt do anything hes accusing you of mcneil shook his head wearily if we lose though i could go to jail diz we wont lose theres no case a brittle smile but you cant guarantee that can you youve told me a hundred times you just cant predict what a jurys going to do and if they find me guilty i go down thats a big if though but its my life why do i want to risk it it was an unassailable point and hardy couldnt answer it still it galled and upset him he jammed his hands further into his pockets walked over to the railing and peered down into the waters of the bay then turned back to his client youre just going to let him steal a quarter million dollars from you because hes an asshole a desultory shrug mcneil was embarrassed by the decision although that didnt mean he was going to change it back the buildings going to go for five and a half or six million thats plenty to live on ill put it on the market like everybodys been advising for the last decade give the cretin his goddamn blackmail money well worth it to get him out of my life at last but hardy just couldnt let it go i thought we were going to press our own countercharges against him punish him because he not you was the one doing something wrong if i remember you were pretty pissed off you wanted to fight him so did i so do i i know hardy waited his client tried another tack itll cost almost the same as a trial anyway no it wont a quarter mil is about twice as much as a criminal trial would cost you rich at least hell ill knock my own court appearance fees down to my hourly rate hardy charged private clients three thousand dollars for every trial day in court far in excess of his hourly rate of two hundred dollars if the trial goes a week that alone will save you a ton mcneil shook his head its not about money diz thats kind of my point too gait is the criminal here not you so why are you the one being punished after all hes put you through dont you want to get this guy no answer mcneil pulled his own overcoat more tightly up around his neck so look he said what do we have to do to get the charges dropped this morning like most mornings a goodsized crowd waited in a cold and sullen line that extended out the door of the jail and along the outside corridor behind the hall of justice jody burgess wore jeans and a down parka hiking boots and gloves shed been living here now for over a year and still couldnt get used to the california weather this morning for example it felt really cold arctic cold which was funny because back in ohio when it was in the midforties in february it felt almost like springtime people would go out in shirt sleeves crunching through the snow commenting about how nice it was how warm here though in the damp fog the cold ate right through to her bones even bundled up she shivered finally she got inside the lobby to the jail where it was a little warmer anyway she gave her name to the guard and waited some more she tried not to spend these interminable minutes worrying or thinking about how all this would turn out she would just concentrate on trying to be there for cole who was a good boy in his heart he might have made some mistakes might have some serious problems hed have to overcome but he would never intentionally hurt anyone he was a good boy the time came and the guard escorted her down yet another hallway to yet another dark doorway she thought there must be at least a couple of visiting rooms this one felt different from the last one shed come to yesterday the high windows let in a different light although otherwise they were pretty much identical fifteen gray metal chairs on this side of the glass each one at its own station all the chairs taken now except the one to which they were directing her she got to the seat and sat down cole wasnt across from her yet she reached out and touched the little mouthpiece embedded into the glass her son a guard let cole through the door on the other side and pointed to the chair opposite her the boy nodded shrugged doing what he was told he didnt even look to see her just the chair where he was supposed to go and sit slack hair shuffling gait flat expression the orange jumpsuit again always she tried to conjure an image of when hed been younger she still had his high school graduation picture on the dresser next to her bed at home his hair was shorter then neatly combed freckles and a wide open smile where had that boy gone although she knew she knew hey mom hey cole she waited to see if he had something to say but evidently not she leaned forward her mouth close to the speaker are you all right his first answer was a humorless chuckle but he didnt want his mom getting upset so softened it better he said yeah fine really well the massage girl didnt show up last night but other than that but theyre taking care of you youre eating he leaned back and patted his stomach theyre fattening me up for the kill jody frowned thats not funny dont say that he came forward again serious its really not so bad you just stay out of peoples way but youre getting your medicine so far his flat gaze challenged and its not medicine mom its methadone i know that she answered quickly i know what it is and youre doing ok with it its all right he brought his own mouth closer to the glass im thinking nervously he ran his hand along his jawline what he considered it for another long moment well i dont know you know my lawyer yes cole i know your lawyer mr hardy yeah well he suggested maybe i ought to think about asking them to cut back on the dose if i wind up being in here a while it might i dont know jody did not dare succumb to hope but it was the first time shed been tempted in years she was careful to try and phrase the reply in neutral terms too much enthusiasm from mom might kill the impulse it might be worth a try cole but youve got a lot of other issues youre dealing with through this he leaned back folded his arms across his chest a deep sigh escaped im thinking it might be the only issue she nodded carefully i really do he said after a minute i mean itd be easy enough to try here if it didnt work i could just go back to where i am now well jodys voice was resigned lowkey its worth thinking about theyve got a program then he added quickly im not sure she was happy to leave it there if you think you could handle it i dont know he said maybe he came forward again you dont have to come here every day you know i know that but i want to i like seeing you after all this admission seemed to make him uncomfortable though and she changed the subject you should know that im meeting with mr hardy today to talk about money and things you dont have to worry thats all under control she glossed over it and kept on talking has he mentioned anything to you yet about what he plans to do in terms of your defense not really we havent really talked jody frowned well ill get something on that today too but did you see do you get the paper in here he shook his head no mints on the pillows before bedtime either in fact no pillows but why she scratched at the counter because there was an article this morning about cullen what about him well evidently hes saying he gave you the gun cole came forward sat up straight what gun the gun that was used to kill elaine wager the murder weapon cullen she nodded he never gave me any gun well in the paper today theres a story about cullen giving you the gun when did he do that did it say friday or saturday friday or saturday he was trying to dredge it up that didnt happen jody leaned up to the glass her mouth all but flush up against the talk box she whispered are you telling me the truth here cole i want to be able to tell mr hardy cole was glaring his mind engaged ill tell him myself mom cullen didnt give me any gun on friday or saturday or any other time i picked that gun up out of the street it was such a little thing at first i didnt even know what it was just sitting in the gutter down next to her and he stopped his mouth was open his eyes searching somewhere within himself what for a terrifying moment jody thought that her son might have had something like a stroke cole whats wrong the recovery was as abrupt as its onset his eyes snapped back into focus and if his mother wanted to see a greater clarity in them perhaps she wasnt entirely mistaken i didnt kill her he whispered in something like awe she was already dead after his dawn meeting with rich mcneil on the embarcadero hardy had turned around and driven back out to st marys hospital which was halfway back to his home from downtown now he was next to glitskys bed in the icu on the other side of the bed a green heart monitor beeped steadily and repeatedly drew a jagged line across a small video screen so he was saying theres these two guys and the one goes thats how i want to die just like my grandfather where hes just sitting there talking enjoying life and suddenly his jaw drops down on his chest and his eyes close and hes gone yep thats the way i want to go hardy paused not kicking and screaming like the other guys in the car dying jokes glitsky shifted under the sheets youre telling me dying jokes the patient blew out a long and slow breath and closed his eyes hardy thought he looked like hell his pallor was pronounced an oxygen tube wrapped around his face and settled under his nose some ivs were set up and apparently dripping into him he opened his eyes again ive got one hardy took it as a good sign hit me this rich guy is near death fretting that he cant take his money with him when he goes glitsky took another deep breath adjusted the oxygen tube into his nose so he asks god if he can please ive been good and god finally gives in and says ok he can take one suitcase full of anything he wants to heaven so he decides that gold is always good and fills his suitcase with bricks of the stuff howd he do that if he was near death hardy asked gold weighs a ton hed have to get out of bed go to the bank if they even keep gold in a bank how sick was he anyway what did he have glitsky glared at him a heart attack i dont know suspend your disbelief for a minute yeah but a detail like that anyway sure enough the guy dies and about time too glitsky collapsed back into his pillows never mind what you want to hear this or not hardy acquiesced ok the guy is dead right he gets to the pearly gates st peter says hold it no luggage allowed and the guy tells peter that in his case god made an exception peter should check with the boss this is a long joke hardy said glitsky ignored him forging ahead so god says our guy isnt lying hes allowed to bring one suitcase and peter says you know ive been here a long time and nobodys ever brought anything with them before id be curious to know what it is so the guy proudly opens his suitcase and peter looks at him and goes pavement you brought pavement hardy crossed a leg and sat back a smile played at the corners of his mouth thats not really a dying joke glitsky pushed the button to raise his bed his eyes now with some life in them what are you talking about a guy dies in it so its a dying joke ok its not like theres a formal definition a partition sheet hung from the ceiling and set off abes bed from the others in the room someone was pulling it back and hardy turned to see abes spry and spunky seventysomething father a yarmulke over his white hair plaid pants baggy polo shirt definition of what he asked a dying joke hardy said hi nat i got a good one of those nat replied how you feeling today abe abused hardy smiled translating normal nat went around to the monitor side leaned over the bed and kissed his son on the face they have toothbrushes here maybe you want to use one glitsky had been extraordinarily lucky although that did not mean he was out of trouble yet at the peak of nob hill grace cathedral had seen more than its share of heart attacks more even than the famous and appropriatelynamed cardiac hill the steep and lengthy grade upon which some genius architect had erected the main walkway into com park almost anyone walking any distance to grace from any direction had to climb and history had shown that many elderly hearts and some not so elderly werent up to it accordingly a wellattended event such as elaine wagers memorial service usually featured an ambulance staffed with paramedics parked nearby there had been one there on monday morning when glitskys heart had gone into ventricular fibrillation theyd had the electrodes on him and shocked the muscle out of its spasm in everyone agreed a miraculously short time so what are they saying now hardy wanted the facts but they were maddeningly inexact whats the prognosis theyre saying it was moderate glitsky told him which means what nat put in glitsky cast an eye over to his dad more or less it means they dont have a clue what happens next swell hardy said thats really swell i like it abe said agreeing with him it could be a dying joke after all what are the options nat asked the boys liked to run with toughguy irony but nat didnt find any part of it funny what are they actually telling you anything i ask although like everything else if you know nothing about something its hard to pick the right questions glitsky drank from his water glass he lifted his shoulders the only way they can figure actual damage to the heart muscle for now is the enzyme count which they say is in the moderate increased range also theyre doing an angiogram before they let me out of here to see if ive got blocked arteries which looks like a good guess then theyll either do a bypass or decide i dont need one so what does moderate heart muscle damage mean hardy asked it means maybe not as much muscle died as could have so ive got a chance to keep living nat needed to clarify you mean some of your heart could be dead right now the muscle and you wouldnt know it glitsky nodded the part that didnt get any oxygen for long enough thats my understanding but they dont think that was too much but if it was nat persisted a shrug then it ought to show up in a couple of days and that would be a problem how big a problem a problem glitsky repeated his fathers hand was on the bed and he covered it with his own but im lucky so far dad theyre saying these enzyme levels are ok lets go with that if nothing gets complicated im out of here by the weekend dancing nat looked across at hardy this i would like to see dr campion midfifties exuding competence had come and gone hed shooed both hardy and nat out for the morning exam when he came out he told them hed ordered the nurse to give glitsky a light sedative they could go back in to say goodbye that was enough visiting for this morning he cautioned both of them to refrain from talking about anything that might be upsetting the feeling was that they were just going to give him another day to rest then theyd evaluate the situation and make some decisions hardy stood by the bed and waited while nat talked domestic details abes youngest son orel was in school today but would be back by visiting hours tonight nat hadnt heard back from isaac the eldest until late last night he was driving up today from la and hed be by tonight as well nat hadnt been able to reach jacob in milan but he was still trying dont do that abe was appalled at the idea theres no reason to bother him about this you dont think hed want to know his father had a heart attack wouldnt you want to know if god forbid i ever have a heart attack you dont have those genes this he said pointing to his chest was mom or forty years of junk food and no exercise hardy smiled helpfully glitsky glared at him and spoke back to his father besides whats jacob going to do about it over there how about fly home make sure youre ok abe was shaking his head he doesnt have the money for that ill pay for it abraham glitsky raised his voice im not trying to get out of paying dad im saying he doesnt need to come by the time he gets here ill be home im fine nat took his case to hardy hes fine his heart muscle might be already dead inside his chest and hes fine hardy decided he ought to step in abe shut up your sons need to be here all of em end of story thank you nat touched his forehead in a gracious gesture listen to your friend here abraham he knows whats good for you glitsky took in the two of them god help me he said nat went away muttering glitsky had motioned hardy to stay back a minute now he sat down again dr campion said keep it short and were not supposed to upset you really glitsky deadpanned good going he also said the nurse gave you a sedative im thinking you palmed it or something it must not have kicked in yet but to hardy it seemed that it was starting to glitsky laid his head back against his pillow and closed his eyes for a moment then visibly seemed to gather his strength so that he could talk so what did i miss on elaines case hardy shook his head that would go under the general topic of things that might upset you not telling me will be worse was there something hardy sighed he didnt know about treya ghents verbal attack on glitsky the day before and therefore didnt know that it was a good bet as the proximate cause of the heart attack he did know however that his friend had lost his daughter and his job in the same week that could do it too and the doctor had warned about creating more stress still glitsky was probably right if he didnt tell him it might be worse some snitch is saying he gave cole the gun on saturday what is cole saying about that i wish i knew hardy gestured frustration the story broke in the paper this morning i havent had time to see him what with you and all glitsky chewed on it for a long moment it was in the paper this morning yep front page the last unanswered question in the case if memory serves and it does hardy ran down the details on cullen leon alsop when he finished glitsky said so pratt leaked it how do you come to that because a snitch would have drawn ridley banks hes the inspector of record and he doesnt leak it would be interesting to see the timing on the leak if maybe it got to the paper before ridley even found out about it hardy was intrigued which would mean what again though glitsky leaned back into his pillow and closed his eyes opening them he lifted the corners of his mouth a fraction of an inch see im not upset im relaxed good but we were on a restraining hand i know where we were a couple of months ago there was another little stink about a snitch maybe you remember pratt denied it but hey thats what she does what was it same kind of leverage this was a third strike case one of those drivebys where nobody died not even the usual three innocent bystanders so it didnt go highprofile still it was a screwup hardy waited through another hiatus another recovery they couldnt put a weapon together with the shooter so there was this story in the paper that this snitch ok i do remember that now suddenly it came back to hardy he knew where the gun was in the shooters girls garage or someplace but then after he talked to the police he changed his mind right decided three strikes and life in prison beat being dead which would happen if he snitched but he told us the da had offered him a deal if hed plant the gun with the guy they knew was the shooter of course pratt denies this but the story ran before he talked to any inspectors and the snitch sure didnt leak it on his own no access to the press right so it was the da but why in the world would they do that what leak or create bogus evidence either second nature they get something they gotta tell some reporter it makes it real the headline is good pr and later when it goes to hell its old news and nobody pays attention glitsky had closed his eyes again if it got to the paper before ridley talked to this bozo jeff elliot might be able to find that out hardy hung his head hands clasped and elbows on his knees thinking about it for a minute when he looked up glitsky hadnt moved a muscle abe he asked quietly a long pause then again abe he put a finger to his friends neck waited until he felt a pulse let out a sigh of relief and stood up hardy had no memory of his last meal he was leaving the hospital when a stab of lighthead hit him so hard he had to stop and sit quickly on a convenient low wall just outside the main doors for an instant it crossed his mind that he might be having his own heart attack until he realized that there was no pain or pressure just a gaping hollowness somewhere in his center he tried to remember the last time hed eaten he thought it must have been breakfast yesterday morning but he couldnt recall if hed even been home he just didnt remember anything except he drank some scotch last night then this morning mcneil had woken him up with his urgent business and hardy had run out before coffee it was now nearly ten oclock in the morning the day loomed full before him he knew he had to go see cole at some point though his inclination was to wait until after hed had his business meeting with his mother there was also mcneils proposed settlement and that meant another six or eight calls before dash logan probably drunk at jupiter found it in his best interest to return one of them the thought of it curdled his stomach it was growling at him now which brought him back full circle he had to get some food frannie hardy had majored in urban planning at usf but work in her field was scarce after she graduated she had rent to pay so her first jobs had been a couple of entrylevel clerical positions these did not bring her any great sense of personal fulfillment within two years she was married and pregnant with rebecca the direction her life had taken had determined her career for the past decade or so the kids were growing and so was a void within her but the concept of urban planning had lost whatever thrill it once had held for her she saw things on a smaller scale now a more personal one individual relationships marriages parents and children she wanted to work doing some kind of counseling she was filling out applications for graduate school at the dining room table when she heard the front door opening hello she came up out of her chair yo her husbands voice its only me maynard he came into view shrugging out of his raincoat maynard maynard g krebbs surely you remember maynard g krebbs with all that junk in your brain how do you ever remember anything important but why are you home then remembering her breath caught oh god abe hes doing ok so far they think so far they think i know real strong he shrugged more tests today and tomorrow hes cranky as ever im taking that as a good sign his dad was there the boys are coming in today hardy was moving toward the kitchen as for me my wife hasnt been feeding me ive been driven to forage on my own following him in she clucked understandingly she must be awful he nodded pretty bad he pulled his castiron pan off the marlin hook from which it hung on the wall behind the stove he sprinkled salt into it a grind of pepper in the refrigerator he discovered vegetables peppers potatoes green beans an onion and laid them on the cutting board along with three eggs cutting now he asked her how the application process was going and she said it wasnt too bad she was doing one of her admission essays on abe and elaine hardy stopped chopping what not using names of course no ok but what about them abe knowing he was her father but not telling her for all this time why hed want to do that i dont think he wanted to fran knowing abe he probably felt duty bound not to tell her and look at the toll it took it didnt make his heart stop fran maybe not but on top of everything else i thought it was pretty interesting just the idea she paused that he never even told us and were his best friends hardy was back to cutting people have secrets elaine had her own life she didnt need him dont kid yourself kids needs their fathers frannie folded her arms and leaned back against the counter i find it sad that he didnt ever get to know her that he chose that for whatever reason hardy dumped vegetables into the pan i think hed agree with you i think thats half the reason he keeps looking for more evidence so hell have an excuse to get to know her in spite of the confession hardy cracked the eggs directly into the pan and stirred with a slotted spoon the confession was bad thats all theyve got enough evidence to convict cole without it abe just needs to keep looking she waited then asked so what do you need what do you mean i mean why are you defending him if he killed elaine he stirred his omelette and considered for a moment i guess because no matter what this shouldnt be a death penalty case im trying to keep that from happening thats all even if he did it even if he did it it wont make it harder to get him off it wont make it easier it doesnt matter it doesnt matter god i hate it when you sound so much like a lawyer i do too hardy admitted ruefully but the sad truth is thats what i am and now the lawyer was trying to get around to doing something else he detested talking about fees jody burgess was sitting with him on his office couch he didnt like to put his clients across his desk from him it put a psychic distance between them that felt awkward but jody was filled with optimism fueled by good news she wasnt ready to discuss the cost of the trial and hardys representation like prannie like so much of the rest of the lay world jody seemed obsessed with the fact of coles guilt or innocence according to her hed recovered a repressed memory that morning one that contained the absolute and final new version of the truth of the events of early monday morning to hardy this simply meant that cole was changing his story again first he did it then he didnt remember doing it now he didnt do it at all who knows he thought next he might remember that hed actually been by her side trying to save elaines life hardy thought he preferred door number two where cole didnt remember either way whether or not hed done it that answer comported most closely with the facts of some kind of unconsciousness defense which in turn seemed the most likely to succeed thinking this he realized with something between pride and a pang that he must have been hanging around david freeman too much he was really beginning to think like a lawyer it was a cold afternoon outside the fog having lifted to a low cloud cover but his office was warm jody though still wore her heavy coat she was drinking hot coffee hardy almost started sweating just looking at her finally he broached the fee issue since he had an idea that really was reasonable given what they had to work with and it was certainly the least expensive way to proceed since it would end things fairly quickly where i thought wed go he was speaking carefully because low cost notwithstanding this was not going to bear even a slight resemblance to good news was get the charge lessened in exchange for a guilty plea he pressed ahead quickly that way the da gets to count it as a conviction we get out of the death penalty arena before we even have to argue the special circumstances he spread his palms everybody wins for a second he thought she might not have understood a plea bargain she said but he didnt kill her at all well hes really not too sure about that but this morning he really remembered i saw it in his eyes this great relief im sure you did she put down her coffee cup with a clatter you dont believe me hardy told her he believed her completely but i dont know whether a jury would and thats the problem jody sat with it for a while eventually she went back to her coffee lets just say we dont make a deal just for discussions sake what then then we have a hearing next week during which mr torrey will show the tape of the confession and that should be enough to convince the judge that theres sufficient evidence to go forward with the trial but wont you argue that the confession was coerced of course beyond that ill argue that coles words contradict the facts as we know them but in the real world out there in the courtroom neither of those things will make any difference why not jody didnt like to hear this but if anything hardy was sugarcoating he had to get her to understand the gravity of coles situation because a preliminary hearing isnt about whether cole is guilty or not guilty its only to determine whether or not theres a case then it goes to trial she was still having trouble accepting it this is so unreal she said after another minute she shook her head in frustration and finally sat back on the couch with almost an air of collapse hardy waited until her reaction had run its course then decided it might be useful to agree with her it does feel like that i know he couldnt leave it at that though he had to instruct her but it is real believe me and the decisions we make right now are going to matter later so we ought to make sure theyre the right ones she rose up challenging her voice shaking and you think the right one is saying he did it when he didnt you know for sure that he didnt you are a hundred per cent certain she didnt even have to think about it absolutely hes not a murderer hardy nodded not at the validity of the point but in acknowledgment of what had to come next if he was going to continue with his representation of her son if he was going to get anywhere here with her today he would have to break through her resistance her blindness it was time for hardball mrs burgess has cole ever lied to you the question surprised her this is nothing like he held up a finger stopping her its a simple question has he ever told you a lie she found herself unable to answer many lies more lies than you can remember has he ever stolen anything from you i know he lied to jeff and dorothy when they put him up he stole from them he stole from their children mrs burgess did they tell you anything about this shed come forward to the first couple of inches of the couch she crossed her arms low over her stomach as though the questions were hitting her there well ok but do you know anyone that your son hasnt lied to in the past several years or stolen from do you think hes trying to get off heroin right now yes yes at least that he could see she thought he was throwing her a rope he said he thought he might get in a program has he done that has he done anything in that direction other than talk about it do you think he was trying to kick the habit before all this happened i do hed been back to the halfway house i know that was pretty recently he was really trying its really hard you know its not that easy she was leaning over into her arms now as though her stomach was cramping i appreciate that he said its hard enough when youre really really trying when youre in a program and working with counseling was cole in one of those i mean outside no but he couldnt find the right mix somehow you know some of those counselors dont its the counselors fault he couldnt quit is that right and when he came and stayed with you and then stole your car for example you punished him for that didnt you you let him know hed done something really wrong yes yes i did she was almost pleading with him now her eyes becoming glassy with unshed tears i did tell him how disappointed i was mr hardy that i loved him and how much it hurt me it did hurt me hardy hated to continue but his only hope to work with her demanded that she recognize the reality they were facing and he said he was sorry she fired it back at him he was sorry he just he was and so because he was sorry you let him come back and stay with you again right what was i supposed to do mr hardy im his mother let him sleep on the streets other parents have he said simply its been known to happen well i couldnt he was trying she took a deep breath he was trying the staggered breaths kept coming as though shed been running he wanted to ask if she thought cole had been trying monday morning when he stole the other bums whiskey and went off wandering downtown trying to find his g but that would just be more talking more arguing he had a different idea one that he suddenly knew would be far more effective his discovery documents were on the desk at his elbow and he lifted a labeled manila folder extracting from it what he needed one of the coroner closeups of elaine wagers ear he crossed back to jody and laid the perfectlyfocused fullcolor eightbyten on the table in front of her look at her ear mrs burgess he ordered harshly where cole ripped her earring out he also broke her finger getting her ring off mrs burgess was he trying then was that trying was that your good boy youre horrible she screamed he didnt yes he did mrs burgess he snapped back his own voice raised he sure as hell did hardy turned abruptly calming himself and when he felt he could speak he did its horrible all right he said softly but its not me he was breathing hard himself now half expecting that the next sound he heard would be the door opening and closing behind him instead he heard nothing and eventually he turned she was doubled over her whole body shaking he came around the table and sat closely next to her he put an arm around her shoulder it didnt seem to help afterwards the office seemed a little constricted and they went downstairs to the buildings unique conference room the residents had nicknamed it the solarium because when there was afternoon sun which happened frequently though not today this room miraculously caught some of it enormous potted plants thrived under its greenhouse windows and glass roof it opened onto a small enclosed garden that in the summer bloomed with impatiens and pansies vinca and lobelia and that today featured dirt a bench and a hundred square feet of brown lawn hardy brought his discovery documents down with them jody had recovered somewhat after first breaking down completely shed wanted to see all of the photos then to scan the police reports so hardy put his folders in front of her and sat on her right in the garden area outside he watched some sparrows flit about picking in the lawn after about ten minutes she closed the last folder hardy waited another moment or two then spoke conversationally thats the person torrey wants the jury to see if he succeeds cole is in trouble i need you to understand that these pictures what these policemen wrote it looks like she swallowed her own words couldnt continue yes it does and even if we argue that he just came upon her after she was dead the theft of the jewelry doesnt exactly cast him in the most sympathetic light and youre pretty sure he took the jewelry that he did that he was loath to punish jody any more but this he couldnt deny all of it was on his person when they brought him in the best you could say is that he knew she was already dead while he was robbing her he wasnt hurting her she dabbed at her eyes thats not much of a best no its not whether hed been excessively cruel or not hardy now at least had her where she might be receptive to what he had to say this is why im talking about a guilty plea once we get to trial if we do this case will be hard to win on its merits in front of a jury do you understand what im saying she nodded miserably thats why i thought it would be worthwhile to explore some legal solutions short of trial where you admit he did it where he pleads guilty yes which is not exactly the same thing in return for what i would hope for no death penalty to begin with then a possible parole someday oh god prison she looked at him sharply what do you mean you hope i mean it wouldnt stun me to have torrey turn us down he explained that the das office was already taking a lot of flak for pleading out important cases sharron pratt had already handpicked this one hitching her political fortunes to it getting her to agree to a plea wasnt going to be a slam dunk by any means and the bad news wasnt over yet even if we go to trial and convince a jury that the murder was a lesser offence which is about the best we can expect were going to wind up about where we are today in jail going to prison for a very long time jodys face told hardy that this was the first day of her season in hell her eyes were shot with red heavylidded and swollen her skin had taken on a mottled look she barely dared phrase the question but what if they do find him not guilty what if you convince them then he goes free he reached over and touched her hand but jody so we have no misunderstanding i have to tell you im not inclined to try to do that earlier in the afternoon she might have regarded that announcement with horror now she closed her eyes for a moment took in a deep breath gathering her strength why not because heres that story cole a heroin addict is walking around drunk and maybe stoned early on a monday morning hes carrying a gun but he isnt he said that wasnt true hardy acknowledged that but so what the jury will have heard he was carrying the gun hes looking for someone to rob so that hell have money for his drug habit and he happens upon elaine wager when the police arrive like two minutes later elaine is dead and cole is stripping her body of jewelry he runs hes fired the gun a few hours later he confesses to killing her hardy softened his voice nearly to a whisper the jury is going to hear all that jody there is physical evidence to back it all up im not even saying here that i think he did it this isnt me this is the jury if i go in front of them and just say no all of thats true except it wasnt cole who killed her you know whats going to happen theyll convict him of everything and then when we argue that they should spare his life our credibility will be shot she looked at him knowing he was right he had to go on i can do that if thats what we all decide we can try to get cole straight and put him on the stand all dressed and cleaned up and he can deny it deny cullen gave him the gun tell the whole truth but if i let him do that im not giving him his best defense even if its true that he didnt kill her yes even if he didnt kill her even if he was just the unluckiest man alive on monday morning he has no alibi theres precious little if any evidence in his favor hardy knew it sounded hopeless what was worse the more he talked about it the more he was coming to believe that it was hopeless he tried to explain it a last time jody i want to tell the truth to the jury and i believe the truth is that whether or not cole killed elaine he wasnt in his right mind as the law defines the term he was unconscious he shouldnt be executed and thats what i should be praying for that my son wont be executed hardy nodded somberly he looked out at the sparrows again still pecking for crumbs in the dead winter lawn it might be a good place to start gene visser was whistling the childrens song its a small world through a toothpick as he exited the elevator into the basement of the hall of justice he was accompanied by his friend and employer dash logan and a sergeant of narcotics named bills keene whose father had been a fanatic follower of football from buffalo as a child bills had been a tough enough kid to grow into the name he still rooted for buffalos team which last night had killed the ers on monday night football im telling you dash it was the best night of my life here i am giving ten points and i had half the department lining up to give me their money visser stopped whistling you were giving ten on the bills next time call me keene looked over happily ill put you on the list or you can direct deposit into my account either way so howd you make out dash asked they were moving into the reception area just off the records roomevidence locker the time was a little after three oclock in the afternoon and they were the only people downstairs except for the officers assigned to evidence security eight hundred forty dollars logan whistled impressed i hope youre declaring it every penny keene was grinning broadly having a fine old time on an otherwise slow workday the cop behind the window came up and greeted them including the twenty of officer mcdougal here hey gary how bout them bills huh mcdougal had his wallet out and handed keene a twenty over the signin counter want to go double or nothing next week were talking my own buffalo bills right mcdougal was appalled get real were talking the niners who cares about the bills logan was enjoying the exchange as well he appeared to have a bit of a runny nose and from time to time would sniff delicately am i mistaken logan asked or is gambling still frowned upon in this state absolutely mcdougal replied with a smile its a scourge keene added but you know the mafia everybody enjoyed the moment of the manly camaraderie so what brings you gentlemen down here today down to business logan gave a small sigh and put his briefcase up on the counter im going to trial on people v lawson next monday he gave mcdougal the case number its inspector keenes case here i thought i ought to look at what the da had actually collected before i tried to save my clients poor ass mcdougal shook his head in mock disbelief i dont know how you do it logan looked at him questioningly what keep your clients if you dont even look at the evidence until a week before trial dont they get a little pissed off a blustery laugh followed by a sniffle what i tell them come on get a life but then he backpedaled a bit i generally know whats supposed to be there it usually is if it isnt i make a motion to dismiss he shrugged its worked out visser added his two cents his real talent is making it look like hes not working the man works all the time logan made a gracious gesture toward his private eye an unsolicited testimonial from an unbiased source thank you eugene sniff he turned to keene so sergeant shall we go mcdougal buzzed the door for them and logan and keene went inside to sign the book visser at the reception window leaned in and asked how long they would be logan shrugged looked a question at keene who did the same i dont know fifteen twenty hey gary you mind letting gene in sit his ample posterior on a chair we might be a minute mcdougal frowned at the request he wasnt supposed to let in anyone who wasnt accompanied by a police officer and they had to sign in to a specific case but he wasnt supposed to gamble either especially here on police premises and these were pretty good guys he knew them all visser had even been a homicide cop when mcdougal had first come up there was a chair he could sit in right next to his own it wasnt as though visser was here in the evidence lockup to rip something off hed never be out of mcdougals sight he spoke up to keene you want to sign him in on your ticket from out at the window visser said it wasnt any big deal he could stand but keene said sure buzz him on in so whatd you guys do to pull this assignment visser was seated next to gary mcdougal in the signin area making conversation with him and another young cop the name tag read bellew from the gun room next door he knew that being stuck down here in the basement as records and evidence room custodian was not exactly a soughtafter position among the uniforms it wasnt quite an official onthebooks reprimand but neither did anybody ever mistake it for a reward mcdougal made a face shook his head with disgust we ate a couple of donuts we didnt pay for the men all exchanged glances i know mcdougal continued you dont have to say it but bellew felt like he did it was some bullshit omc sting to fight police corruption in the big city the omc was the office of management and control formerly called internal affairs the department that policed the police you being an excop mcdougal said youll be amazed to hear that sometimes its hard for us street guys to pay for coffee snacks like that seems like people were out guarding their stores they feel grateful sometimes they make us a sandwich pour us a cup forget to ring it up im shocked to hear it visser said thats almost as bad as gambling the officers both chuckled from over by the entrance to the gun room bellew took it up yeah so anyway omc gets a bug up their ass that guys are abusing their public trust taking a goddamn sandwich so they put a couple of their guys behind counters and one son of a bitch gives us both donuts mcdougal which get this i offer to pay for and he says no thats ok dont worry about it and they bust you guys for that bellew answered they hit maybe twenty of us in one day said we ought to take it as a wakeup call yada yada but they sent you down here six weeks no overtime visser took in the immediate surroundings institutional clutter ruled here in the signin area the walls were lined with green metal shelves to the ceiling stained and rusted metal tables sagged with the weight of cardboard boxes filled with junk that had lost its case number confiscated cell phones batteries radios bicycle tires tools from his time in the police department he knew that the rest of the place was an enormous cavern nearly a city block on a side a home to the records and evidence in every crime committed in the city and county over the past ten years there were miles of case files there was a freezer for blood soiled clothes the occasional body part there was an entire room for bicycles another for computers a locked walkin safe for narcotics and the gun room adjoining the signin and how much time have you already put in he asked four weeks two to go but whos counting mcdougal stood as a homicide inspector marcel lanier appeared at the window with a yellow folder bulging with stuff when the two men had been talking a minute visser leaned over the table and interrupted marcel how you doin lanier stopped his paperwork nodded with a question in his face and visser answered it im just waiting for dash logan doing some babysitting hows the murder biz a little shaky at the moment glitsky had a heart attack you hear that visser chatted about that for another minute or so establishing still further with mcdougal and bellew that he was really in the club buds with keene friendly with lanier in homicide familiar with glitsky a sympathetic guy about their beef with the omc at the counter they went back to logging in laniers evidence visser already standing turned to bellew that box full of pieces still here he asked it never goes away bellew answered you mind if i look at it he turned back for a minute gary he pointed guns ok mcdougal waved him in sure nonissue like the signin area the gun room was floortoceiling shelves and files packed with yellow storage envelopes identified by case numbers in black permanent marker and each of which held a gun four or five hundred file drawers with a minimum of say forty handguns in each one several of the file drawers gaped open possibly visser thought because they were too stuffed with hardware to allow closing on the wall behind bellews station rifles and assault weapons threatened to flow over onto the floor another large box of rifles sat open on bellews table below the table a wooden crate was open on the floor half filled with assorted confiscated handguns unloaded of course but fully operational unassigned to any specific case the police found them in the streets in hedges garbage cans dumpsters and dope houses where all the occupants had fled out the back they were destined to become manhole covers and good riddance the piece box had been in the same place under the table here in the evidence lockup albeit with a continuously changing assortment of guns at least since visser had started with the force twentysome years before and probably for a long time before that when a gun came in they put the serial number into the book a set of records going back almost seventyfive years and on the last day of the month every gun was logged into the computer dumped into a crusher and destroyed now on february visser estimated that the crate held about forty handguns everything from little or caliber derringers to uzistyle repeating pistols from tapehandled saturday night specials to shining new glocks visser knew that by the end of this month every month the weapons would be spilling over the top of the crate clattering onto the tiles guns guns guns bellew was delighted with the company anything to break up his enforced boredom he and visser were a couple of kids in a candy store picking up one piece then another clicking off a bunch of nonrounds checking actions dropping the cylinders out of the revolvers the clips from the automatics telling the occasional story behind one of them time was flying they were having so much fun then suddenly mcdougal was at the table with them delivering the message that logan and keene were signing out eugene logans voice calling in lets roll it out of here mcdougal next to visser picked up a random revolver from the table spun the cylinder pointed it at the safety first poster on the wall and pulled the trigger smiling as it clicked fun stuff isnt it he said i almost feel bad about it visser was fastening the seat belt in logans z i keep telling myself it just cant be this easy every time the lawyer looked over at him hey eugene please the cops let you go remember that you werent good enough for them i know but still metal detectors at the doors to the hall so you cant get a gun in except you can stroll right out armed to the teeth i mean whos thinking here dash logan nearly fishtailed getting into traffic out of the parking lot it wasnt convertible weather by a long shot and he had the top on his nasal attack appeared to have kicked in again and he was in high spirits heres a little wellkept secret eugene you can stroll right in too how do you do that no signal and dash changed lanes accelerating to fifty he passed two cars ran a red light swung back into his original lane he pinched his nose with his thumb and forefinger sniffed back how do you think all those guns in the lockup get inside the hall theyre evidence ive brought a bunch in myself in my time right and what defines evidence dash let him work it out it didnt take him long an evidence tag correct a little piece of paper that says evidence on it you want to bring a bazooka inside the hall you put a tag on it walk right around the metal detector tell the guard to have a nice day if we werent the good guys id say it really wasnt fair whoa suddenly he braked hard and pulled into a spot at the curb jupiter already he flashed a grin at his passenger no wonder they call me dash gabe torrey hung up and immediately started to punch in the numbers for sharrons direct line but decided this was important enough to warrant a visit in half a minute he was in the anteroom outside her office where madeleine pratts secretary waved him in as a matter of course the district attorney of san francisco was hard at work even pratts enemies conceded that she was a tireless workaholic the complaint if there was one was that often her work produced no tangible results but she put in the hours no one denied that she was sitting at the computer next to her desk her fingers flying over the keys hearing the door she looked over torrey saw the telltale ghost of displeasure and impatience playing on her features but then it flitted away she didnt like being interrupted but since it was him he closed the door behind him interesting news he said i hate that word interesting with a sigh pratt pushed back from the computer you might as well just say bad somebody tells you about a movie and says it was interesting do you want to go out and see it never and if you do guess what it sucks torrey heard out the tirade is this a bad time he asked mildly not particularly im just trying to get this article written for american lawyer they had discussed this over the weekend the magazine was getting input from das around the state on the question of how various communities were handling the problem of socalled victimless crimes such as prostitution and drug abuse sharrons position was that basically you didnt prosecute them and since the legal community in the state was aware of this torrey had been under the impression that hed convinced her to farm the task out to one of her junior staff people so you are writing it yourself there was no defensiveness in her answer she had made her decision and it was the right one and that was that i told you i thought it would be better me than somebody else who couldnt express it as well exactly id just wind up doing it over myself anyway and if my names going to be on it i know weve been over this youre wasting your time with this detail work thats why you have a staff im wasting my time reading incompetent drafts gabe so hire a good writer im a good writer she snapped i know what i want to say and i say it well he was never going to win he nodded with resignation we agree to disagree ok fine she bit off the word this wasnt the best start for what might prove to be an important and controversial meeting torrey considered taking her dismissive tone to heart and making his exit leave her to her damned article he could come back to it tonight when shed be more receptive after a drink or two but he didnt get a chance to move before she said so whats the interesting news torrey had no choice he willed all trace of the earlier tone out of his voice and delivered it flat dismas hardy called me ten minutes ago he wants to deal pratt looked at him actually she said that is interesting what does he want murder two murder two clearly it surprised her she barked a cold laugh he wants to go from death to murder two the mans got a tremendous imagination what did you tell him i told him i had to talk to you pratt fixed him with a hard eye thats a nice flattering answer gabe but what did you really tell him thats really what i told him he pulled a chair around and sat i said that since youd made this particular case a campaign issue it wasnt going to be that simple she frowned but it is that simple she said theres no way in fact torrey had told hardy that they would have to work out the details but in general he thought a reduced charge in return for a guilty plea was a workable idea after the election of course hardy could waive time for a few months and then after the dust had settled on the results they would do the deal pratts administration had grown infamous for its willingness to plead out cases rather than take them to trial in this regard it had by far the most lenient record of any jurisdiction in the state torrey saw no reason to let the campaign change the basic policy so pratts refusal here hit him like a broadside theres no way what theres no way we cut a deal on this ive gone on the record saying i want the death penalty in this case she came around in front of him and leaned back against her desk i cant believe i have to explain this to you theres no other option i hope you see that her adamance here was what surprised him perhaps she just needed him to explain a little further well i told hardy it couldnt be till after the election of course but even then she brought her face down directly in front of his gabe you of all people youre the one who came up with the idea im expecting our friends at the democrat a small alternative newspaper sympathetic to pratt to start beating the drums for it any day now people hate the death penalty all right but im confident theyll come to hate this kid more and this crime well all thats fine sharron but after the election it wont matter anymore he still had to try to bend her if she would allow cole burgess to plead guilty on a lesser charge then it would be over and trials even an apparent nobrainer like this one were always uncertain that was their nature anything could happen he got up from his chair took a half lap of the room he came to rest and faced her but weve still got hardy what if hell take murder one with specials lwop this was life in prison without parole but the da wasnt budging we still ask for death sharron he put his hands on her shoulders listen to me you cant ask for death if he pleads guilty and says hes sorry youll come across as bloodthirsty if it gets to there after a trial its different the kids unrepentant shows no remorse ok otherwise he let the word hang it was her turn to walk to the window separate the blinds look down onto the street she stood there a long minute i want to go to trial on this one gabe the evidence is rock solid and its all with us the boy did it and people dont like him when we send him down theyre with us even if we dont get the death penalty and we probably wont we still get lwop and look tough your instincts were right he stood in the atease position his head bobbing as though he were in thought all right he said she looked back out the window for an eternity setting her mouth she directed a steely gaze once around the room then finally over to her chief assistant her voice had a raspy quality but it was firm that bastard hardy has impugned the integrity of this office and accused me personally of playing politics with a mans life no deals torrey kept himself from showing any reaction he knew the look argument would be futile she had made up her mind her eyes went back out the window to the dull gray afternoon torrey looked at her for a moment then bowed slightly from the waist and turned on his heel the attorneys room at the jail was a good deal more pleasant than the general visitors room where cole would meet his mother behind a barrier with a dozen other inmates on either side at ten by twelve feet it wasnt exactly spacious but there was room for a table and two chairs with some floor left over for pacing the far wall was made of opaque glass block and this seemed to brighten up the room although hardy realized that this was possibly an optical illusion more likely it was the glaring fluorescents overhead cole sat across from him in his orange jumpsuit his face was troubled his brow clouded his eyes clear but i didnt kill her he went through it all as he had with jody the difficulty of getting a notguilty verdict the seriousness of the special circumstances allegations the strong physical evidence against him his own confession his client listened until hed finished then he shook his head no he said i didnt kill her i wont plead guilty hardy started over quietly hummed along in low for a while before he blew it out and got loud he paced the room slammed his fist on the table a few times damn near threw a chair he would have done cartwheels if he thought they might have had an effect im sorry cole said when he finished i can get a public defender if you dont feel you can stay in but im not pleading guilty i didnt do it for which ultimately there was no argument the events of the day had beaten hardy down he told himself that his biorhythms were low now in the early dusk hed perk up any minute when torrey got here his adrenaline would kick in as it had with rich mcneil this morning then with glitsky at the hospital as it had a couple of times in his grueling session with jody burgess and then again with cole to say nothing of each of the three times hed left increasingly curt messages for dash logan to please get back to him if his busy schedule allowed he brought a hand up to his eyes had all those disasters occurred during this one day did he have any adrenaline left and now he had to face gabriel torrey and tell him cole wouldnt plead he was sitting in front of the chief assistants power desk in the same old room he used to love back in his own prosecuting days during the civil war hed come in here just at this time of the evening and sit around with his boon colleagues arguing the law and their strategies with his old mentor art drysdale the good old days this wasnt them anymore after jody hed felt cocky if he could convince her he could convince anybody he could just wriggle out of this entire dilemma cop a plea for cole get the boy in a rehab program in prison collect a nice fee for his efforts and move on it was an impossible case to try anyway so hed called torrey and set up this meeting before discussing it with his client a mistake and now he was on the das turf in an entirely different mode than hed intended a side door opened and here was the man himself professional even cordial diz he began proffering a hand i want to start out by apologizing for the other day in court a selfeffacing smile ive got a short fuse i was protecting my boss im sorry hardy was on his feet shaking the mans hand it happens i got a little emotional myself sometimes and this was one of those times it bothered him when he went along with his natural inclination to be a pleasant person to adhere to social conventions when hed been younger he didnt remember this as one of his primary character traits now he tended to be rude only when it served a purpose he wasnt sure this was an improvement over the earlier model he took his seat while the chief assistant went around the desk and got himself settled so torrey began without any more preamble i was in with sharron after our phone call well about that hardy didnt want to waste any more time on this cole wasnt dealing there was nothing to talk about if torrey hadnt appeared cooperative as he made the appointment hed have phoned it in now though he felt as if he at least owed him a personal explanation but before he could say anything else torrey kept on im afraid she wasnt inclined to deal this was a far cry from what hed been led to believe torrey had told him he was sure they could work something out and he had to wonder what had happened he cocked his head at all torrey shook his head she wont even go to life without no response this from an administration that has never even asked for lwop before much less death right hardy brought a finger to his jawline and scratched at it thats pretty raw the offer didnt matter at all of course cole wasnt going to take anything that involved a guilty plea but hardy felt his blood beginning to boil he turned down the volume on his voice so me coming here to see you tonight this was in the line of a joke im supposed to go back to my client with that torrey spread his hands hardy found himself thinking of the william h macy character the slimy car salesman in fargo sharron has strong feelings about this case she said it was a matter of principle hardys bile continued to rise his pulse pounded in his ears he knew that if he remained seated here across the desk from this liar his commitment to la politesse was going to be tested and found wanting he didnt believe he could endure any more conflict today he knew where they were coming from it didnt matter anyway he noticed that his knuckles were white on the sides of the chair as he stood up well he said as long as its a matter of principle glitsky thought they certainly liked to keep those beds empty in the icu in case somebody got admitted who needed one he hadnt had a heart attack in all of about a day and a half so by hospital lights he guessed he was out of immediate danger although it didnt seem so to him they moved him to a semiprivate room at a little before five in the afternoon he had been sharing his thoughts about this with his new roommate roy an elderly gentleman who was getting over pneumonia trying not to sound too querulous but voicing the opinion that maybe it was a little soon to be off the monitors roy chuckled drily last time i was here i got copd he explained tapping his chest bad lungs so im in here all the time now but last time i passed out at home just after i punched nine one one it took the paramedics a while to pick me up and so anyway by the time i got admitted to the emergency room i was doa dead right dead right so they slapped me around with some cpr got me breathing again and gave me a new oxygen bottle so i called my brother to tell him where i was and by the time he got down here they told me to go on home home im dead an hour ago and they send me home whats that about this was all new to abe but he was getting the hang of it bemused resignation seemed to carry the day managed care thats my guess roy shook his head my brother wouldnt let them do it made a big fuss wondered if anybody thought it possible i might stop breathing again since i just had eventually they let me stay overnight one night a shrug hey i lived through it no hard feelings because what would be the point is anybody going to care so my doc comes in and says see i could have gone home after all nice of him hell of a guy roy agreed probably figured a little guilt never hurts maybe next time i get admitted dead i wouldnt push so hard for a bed you were actually doa yeah i saw it on my chart admitted two nineteen doa i love that telling people i died he broke a smile im in my resurrection phase now though ive been disappointed to discover its pretty much the same as last time around they fell into a silence for a while until glitsky shifted in his bed and sat up straighter you mind if i ask you something roy shoot did you see any white light or anything like that while you were dead he thought about it briefly you know i cant say i did one minute im dialing nine one one and then im in the er here with a tube down my throat and somebody pushing on my chest how about you no i wasnt dead heart attack he explained i didnt see anything either though my wife died of a heart attack roy said they gave her all the tests and everything and told her it hadnt been a bad one she was fine she ought to come get another checkup in a week but meanwhile she didnt need to be in a hospital she should stop smoking and lose a little weight change her lifestyle which she didnt get much of a chance to do seeing as she died about two hours after she got home im sorry abe said hey roy lifted his shoulders mangled care glitsky hadnt seen his oldest boy isaac for the winter break with a group of his friends he was skiing at mammoth for the first week then they were all going to the grand canyon until school started again he told his father hed try to make it back up for spring break but everybody was talking about a road trip up to chico state a college in the northern foothills of california which was getting itself something of a reputation for throwing a weeklong revelry lauderdale west naked chicks loud music dancing and fights and allnight raves vandalism riots rivers of beer or isaac could come home to the spring fog and watch tv in their duplex while his dad went to work tough choice but now no planning for it here he was coming through the door to abes room he seemed bigger somehow but then he always did after an absence his head was shaved a shock but glitsky realized at a glance that it looked powerful and terrific there was a lot of his mother in the face though without her coloring isaac was a few shades darker than abe or the other boys the words came without warning as did the gloss over his eyes oh my beautiful boy isaac either didnt hear or chose to ignore the remark the handsome face wore a smile concern all over it a completely adult expression a tiny gold star of david glittered in one ear the black body shirt said hed been working out a lot abe almost felt whiplashed by the impressions but above them all rode the flood of emotion and relief he and flo had raised a fullyformed civilized wonderful person isaac might not be a finished product but he was certainly no longer any kind of a child he leaned over the bed and rested his head a long moment on his fathers chest gripping him tightly abe kept an arm over him patted a few times hugged him closely a last second then isaac pulled up and looked in his dads face what is this bullshit he asked by the time hardy arrived with frannie and the kids at a little before eight it was a fullfledged party orel and isaac were on chairs on either side of abes bed rita his housekeeper and orels daytime guardian hovered near his head ready at any opportunity to get him more ice or refill his cup of tea nat roy and roys brother fred had struck up their own conversation about forming an infirm old men unit for the bay to breakers race in may glitsky was all the way up to a full seated position hed removed the mornings plastic tube from his nose to hardy it appeared that hed been up out of bed there was a gloss to his hair as though hed washed it any trace of the mornings pallor was gone beyond that he simply looked good talking with some animation to his boys doctor diz he said by way of greeting then to frannie mrs doctor diz because abes own children had been trained that it was proper to stand when a woman entered the room they stood up if hardy didnt know from years of experience that it was physically impossible he would have sworn his friend was smiling and these would be the young children of doctor and mrs diz uncle abe the everflamboyant rebecca ran to his bedside put her arms around him ive been so worried theres nothing to worry about he gave her arm a welcoming squeeze people have heart attacks all the time orel snorted a laugh good one dad pretty reassuring the glare watch it junior i mean they have heart attacks and get better frannie had moved up behind her daughter completely better beck sometimes even better than when they started the older son said from the other side of the bed hardy took the opening that wouldnt be too hard frannie was staring over abes bed she put a hand to her face oh my god isaac a smile played at his mouth thats me i wouldnt have recognized you the smile broadened i think you just did when flo glitsky had died abes boys had lived with the hardys for a month isaac and frannie had become especially close even if they hadnt seen each other now in three or four years isaac beck shrieked coming around the bed hugging him i didnt know who you were just me girlfriend same old me like not she said ok maybe stylin a bit more he picked her up with one arm kissed her on the cheek put her back down then narrowed his eyes at hardys son yo vin cool hair isaac vincent eleven years old and the quiet one in the family finally logged in what hair hardy put in he doesnt have any hair vin ignored him can i shave my head too mom hardy answered for her the next time uncle abe smiles vin hes smiling now vincent thought he had him this time doesnt count in fact tonight doesnt count your father means the next separate time on another day thats not fair why not frannie asked because uncle abe never smiles he does sometimes hardy said and when he does you can shave your head promise promise glitsky joined the discussion you remind me vin and ill make a special effort hardy turned to him its got to be a sincere smile not one of those phony im going to rip your legs off in a minute smiles like cops make you cant change the rules vincent said this was serious stuff you said a smile dad just a smile sometimes he smiles at home orel was a hero to hardys kids i could call you at home vin this whole discussion is pathetic isaac said but he was clearly enjoying it i go away for a few years and the level of discourse devolves to this point discourse hardy said devolves what is that is that college he turned to the bed abe youve got to help us here but suddenly glitsky had lost all interest in the conversation he was staring over hardys shoulder he was wearing his old face his everyday face the smile gone all trace of it gone abe hardy repeated and suddenly everyone else became aware of something a different vibration heads turned the silence was profound just inside the doorway treya ghent had stopped where she stood she was holding a large mixed bouquet of winter greenhouse flowers daisies daffodils carnations her daughter shifted nervously beside and a half step behind her im sorry she said i dont mean to interrupt i just wanted i thought glitsky cleared his throat and the awkwardness held until frannie turned completely broke a wide and genuine smile moved toward her those are beautiful she said abe loves flowers i should have brought some myself it was nothing like treya thought it would be it hadnt really occurred to her that he had a family friends a life since he had never functioned as a father to elaine shed assumed he didnt have that gene until hed collapsed yesterday morning hed only been a cop to her not a person now here was glitskys father an old jewish man of all things yarmulke and all two wellbehaved and goodlooking boys that awful attorney hardy elaines killers lawyer from the arraignment and his pretty wife and sweet children shed heard the conversation about one of them shaving his head before theyd seen her the obvious warm connection between everybody it was the last thing she expected the tough and heartless lieutenant glitsky uncle abe people and now here she was in the midst of them introductions to frannie dismas isaac nat an hispanic woman rita taking her flowers exclaiming over them raney and orel checking each other out but cool about it fast eyes we cant really stay she said i just wanted to see if you were all right she felt she had to continue about yesterday lieutenant it wasnt you he said but she shook that off i didnt think the lieutenant raised a palm please stop ok it wasnt you he repeated he turned to his frannie somebody needs to tell ms ghent she didnt make this happen yes sir frannie went with it you didnt make this happen she said to treya she made eye contact somehow making her feel welcome then back to the lieutenant what though im starting to think it didnt happen at all frannies husband was being inclusive too there was none of the anger treya had seen from him in the courtroom he spoke matteroffactly to her humor in the tone abe will sometimes do this kind of thing to get attention he lives a sad and lonely existence we all feel sorry for him frannie added the little boy vincent couldnt follow the irony we do i dont i like uncle abe thank you glitsky said his mother patted him on the head were kidding vince we like him too we dont really feel sorry for him i do the attorney said smiling he too rubbed a hand in his boys hair gave him a wink treya could see that no one was going to acknowledge that shed played a role in the lieutenants collapse she realized with some surprise that these were good people protecting her while supporting him glitsky spoke to her i appreciate your coming down i really do but this would have happened anyway she didnt believe it for a minute well she said im still sorry treyas plan apologize drop the flowers and run disintegrated in front of her dr campion came in and frannie hardy took control and dispatched nat and rita with the two teenagers and the younger kids down to the gift shop to get ice cream so treyas daughter now part of the gang was gone and so they were staying at least until she returned when campion left the four that remained clustered around the bed treya and frannie had the chairs with frannies husband and abes son standing now without all the people diffusing the energy treya much more acutely felt like an outsider she sat listening to them all talk about glitskys release which the doctor thought would be thursday although everyone else seemed to think that would be too soon but the lieutenant was explaining that was how they did it nowadays besides he said turning to hardy if youre doing the hearing a week after that ive got some work to do dad youre not going back to work well grandpa said you were on leave anyway this was news to treya what did that mean he was on leave and if he was when had it begun and why had he interviewed her but he was telling isaac that hed take it easy he wouldnt push things then he came back so diz did you ever talk to your client about the gun the snitch who said he gave it to him hardy slapped his forehead i would have if i wasnt brain dead but we just talked plea glitsky sat up straighter what about his plea no deals hardy answered we go the scar in the lieutenants lips went white he was sitting forward now his back off the mattress why would you do that what do you mean why hardy asked frannie spoke up i dont think we need to talk about this now she was on her feet up from the chair by the bed the color high in her face i really dont glitsky turned his face to her its ok fran its fine just a little business it is not fine flint in frannies tone and i know you two its not a little business she turned to her husband this can wait dismas ok this is exactly what the doctor meant five minutes ago when he said to avoid stress no glitsky was trying to keep it light normally not his strong suit he meant physical stress i shouldnt lift heavy objects like that this work stuff he indicated hardy its just a job it rolls right off me isaac piped in i dont think so he turned to his son you havent been around ike im much more mellow now dad five times as mellow would still put you in the top ten per cent of uptight treya had to smile at that but then glitsky was looking at her but i did want to talk to you about elaine though before you leave she looked to frannie as though for permission a silence clamped down again over them all whos elaine isaac asked hardy jumped in too fast out of rhythm elaine wager the victim in this case we were talking about but it hung there everyone but isaac knew and they were all aware of it finally glitsky looked over to his son ive got to talk to you about elaine too what about her i didnt know her no but frannie started abe i dont know if now is the time but he held up a hand if anybody should know he turned back to his son when i was about your age ike i went out with loretta wager who became the senator mom mentioned that you dated her we all knew that yeah well what maybe didnt get mentioned is that we were pretty serious he hesitated then came out with it anyway to make a long story short a few years ago i found out id gotten her pregnant you didnt know back then when it happened she never told me suddenly she dumped me and married dana wager but it was your kid he nodded elaine yeah isaac ran a palm over his skull looked around at the assemblage wow but isaac was an intelligent young man and the other ramifications began to kick in treya could see him beginning to process them i mean footsteps and highpitched laughter outside in the hallway stopped him then rebecca exploded through the door at a dead run a step or two ahead of her brother i win i win treya thought that the lawyer and his wife gave a damn good example of what zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior really was it did her heart good since shed just about come to believe she was the last of the breed with no hesitation both of them were laying down the law in tandem unheard of beck hey vincent enough what are you doing dont you know people are trying to sleep this is a hospital get it sick people think use your brains have a little respect all right by the time they were through and had marched both kids over and had them apologize nat rita and the teenagers were back and frannie was up by the bed bussing glitskys cheek thats enough excitement for one night well be back tomorrow maybe without children its date night hardy said definitely without children treya was standing too raney had come back over by her side put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed visiting hours werent officially over but everybody was heading out rita and nat shooing orel over to his dad to say goodnight although isaac wasnt quite ready whats the earliest i can get back in here tomorrow he asked morning might be tricky abe said mentioning angiograms and perhaps some other testing but any time after that he turned his head and ms ghent treya please all right treya then about elaine if you get a little time she nodded ill see what i can do with all the bedlam glitsky found it hard to believe that roy had gone to sleep hed pulled the sheet around his bed though and the light was off on his side of the room more tellingly so was the tv which had been gently droning for the entire rest of the day if it was off roy was sleeping he wasnt even slightly tired but he turned the room light down lowered the back of the bed slightly and settled himself against it nat had brought him a book by patrick obrian called master and commander according to his father this was the first in a long series of seafaring tales that he was sure abe would love hed loved hornblower as a young man and nat thought this stuff was better although abe was skeptical what could be better than hornblower but the gift also delivered the subtle hopeful message that abe would be around to read more books in the series which had been running now for nearly thirty years that abe had never heard of it nagged slightly at him but you set your priorities and hed had other things hed been doing reading was even among those things but most of his reading over the years had been to improve his mind or to feed it more facts which he consumed like the peanuts in his desk the few novels he read tended to be mysteries and with a few exceptions more often than not he put them down halfway through the law people who populated them bearing little or no resemblance to anyone in the real world of cops and killers in which he lived so books about the royal navy set a couple of centuries in the past he couldnt take the time now holding this new book in his hands he wondered why that had been so he closed his eyes remembering he used to love stories like this one promised to be pure adventure with the foretgallant sails and the mizzenmasts whatever they were and the salt spray in your face as shot and ball peppered the quarterdeck if vincent were here mr hardy would have to let him shave his head he started back into awareness on some level equally thrilled both at the sound of the contralto laughter that accompanied his surprise and at the unexpected sight of the woman whod produced it i didnt mean to startle you treya said you looked so happy she pointed i love those books are you just starting sheepish he looked down at the book in his hand i havent read a page yet i was remembering hornblower and smiling and smiling i suppose dont tell hardy i wont she was sitting in the chair now moved up close to the head of the bed her hand rested on the railing hornblower was great too wasnt he still is id bet he looked at her a question why was she here on the icecream run your dad got the kids talking even the teenagers nat glitsky said the guys a miracle apparently anyway it turns out my daughter and your son both play basketball for washington we you and me live about five blocks from each other so im trying to work out with raney when i could get back and talk to you about elaine and your dad overhears and asks me why dont i just stay now while im here hell take raney home make sure shes locked in she shrugged apologetically it seemed like a good idea i hope you dont mind were you going to sleep i could come back another day if youre tired im not tired good she said she looked down i also didnt really want to leave until i told you i was sorry i mean yesterday and before even i dont think ive been fair to you its all right no it isnt she took a breath i was sitting up last night worrying about all this not able to sleep i told a little of it to my daughter why id jumped all over you and she said maybe you felt the same way elaine had why she didnt feel she could come to you she felt like it wasnt her place i was busy enough with my own life i didnt need her in it mucking it up if it was important enough id come to her right genetics her mouth softened maybe that funny how ive got all the excuses down pat its like you practiced them plus there was always tomorrow i could always just decide it was time maybe if id known that she knew he shook his head regretfully how stupid we are she let a moment go by can i ask you a question no at her reaction a fractional clouding of her brow he realized hed hurt her somehow he reached out his hand touched hers on the railing then withdrew it quickly im kidding im a great kidder famous for it in fact he met her eyes you can ask me anything you want your son mentioned you were on leave but when you came by to interview me that was before he recounted enough of the story to give her the idea theyre not going to fire you are they unlikely maybe knock me down a grade which wouldnt be the worst thing in the world back to doing cases or transfer me out of homicide which would be worse but you were investigating elaine that was because it was elaine normally i dont get involved with investigations a bitter chuckle which is for the best if the hash i made of this is any indication theyre all probably right he just made a bad confession but there isnt any doubt he did it but youre not sure again her eyes drew him no not that exactly then no not as sure as i want to be in a lot of ways i just i cant accept it he shook his head stopped what the eyes pleaded with him what and he gave in this will sound strange even downright weird but its as though shes finally talking to me telling me there has to be a better reason than a chance encounter with some junkie and after all the denial ive had with her up to now i just cant make myself ignore it a pause dumb i know she pondered a moment why did you come to me first a shrug as opposed to who else i dont know maybe jonas her fiance i would have gotten to him but you were close by i talked to clarence jackman and he told me that if she was involved in something squirrelly with her work or any of her projects youd probably know about it a rueful expression probably but you said there was nothing treya shook her head that was that first day i was so furious at you at who you were that i wasnt going to help you period no matter what you were asking i didnt believe you were working for elaines interests i was i am i see that now and was she working on something honestly i dont know nothings jumping up at me she gave him a hopeful smile but at least now im disposed to look theres progress glitsky said but before you even start that why did you mention her fiance were they having problems treya made a face hesitated maybe you should talk to him i intend to but youre here now he waited finally she came to the decision well a couple of things she told him about the argument in the rand and jackman conference room on the day of the arraignment how jonas had been so adamantly opposed to any discussion of the validity of coles confession he just didnt want to go there at all and this meant what she shrugged i dont know i thought it was pretty understandable myself but other people thought it was funny they said if cole didnt do it shouldnt jonas want to find elaines killer whoever it might be of course this was a room full of lawyers and law students so were not talking about a typical crosssection of humanity or humanity at all well but she acknowledged his point with a nod still everybody seemed to think he should have cared more somehow glitsky pondered that a moment whats the second thing he asked well this is more she hesitated he told me she was leaving him did you already know that no a questioning look wouldnt that be odd you not knowing her not telling you i thought so maybe she hadnt finally decided maybe she was too embarrassed to admit it to me why would that be maybe because when she was first getting together with jonas we were kind of conspirators together elaine and i to keep anybody from finding out then after that when they were together jonas changed a little changed how a shrug she didnt like these revelations but they seemed relevant a little more impatient then she added like i was the help not a friend anymore another small pause if i ever had been anyway elaine saw he hurt my feelings and she tried to smooth it over a few times make excuses for him so then if she was thinking about leaving him after all i could see where shed feel embarrassed with me but jonas told you glitsky asked with an air of disappointment yes why does that bother you a shake of the head because if it was a motive for murder a motive for murder you mean jonas she shook her head in surprise or disbelief thats who were talking about right her fiance i know but i never thought he killed her you may be right glitsky said at least if she was leaving him and that was his motive for killing her i cant see him telling anybody about it she came forward on her chair except if he thought i already knew then his not mentioning it would be significant right so he had to say something about it to cover himself glitsky allowed himself a smile not a bad point suddenly her eyes opened wider in surprise are you wearing contact lenses she asked no she was staring at him youve got blue eyes she said i do youre kidding me im not its not all that common for a black man to have blue eyes its not all that uncommon when the black mans father has them actually i like to think of them as the color of cold blue steel thats a good color for a cops eyes dont you think ice in the veins steel blue eyes he narrowed his gaze fixed her with one of his hard looks how can you be smiling right now he asked that look strikes terror into the hearts of hardened criminals its terrifying she admitted its very good if i didnt know you were putting it on for show id be very scared at this moment lieutenant he relaxed the scowl by the way you can call me abe he said al the song is you can call me al not abe the cop is abe not al the loudspeaker came on announcing the end of visiting hours treya looked at her watch frowned did you say you were getting out on thursday i could have a good look at elaines files by then now that i know what im looking for thursdays the plan if all goes well tomorrow whats tomorrow he shrugged it off just some tests make sure my arteries are working so should we make an appointment say thursday your lunchtime your office she stood up that sounds good ill be ready if i get hung up here for some reason ill call and leave a message she was just saying goodbye when a thought struck her she got her wallet and a pen from her purse withdrawing a business card she wrote on it handed it to him save you from having to look it up and thats my home number if you need anything else he used the card as a bookmark thanks while youve got your pen out he gave her his telephone number as well and she wrote it on another card ok then she shrugged awkwardly she lifted a hand slightly abe did the same and she turned to go as she reached the door glitsky called after her treya she stopped and turned thanks for coming back and for the flowers youre welcome she pointed to the bedside table enjoy your book goodnight abe an excellent french restaurant the rue charmaine occupied the ground floor of david freemans apartment building freeman sometimes ate there as often as four times a week after which hed walk up the flight of stairs to his own spacious onebedroom flat last night hed had dinner there with a fortyyearold female attorney named gina roake theyd shared an extraordinary bottle of romaneeconti talked law and politics law and the theater law and the recentlyconcluded football season after dinner gina had asked if david would mind her staying over and he said he thought that would be very nice now just after dawn freeman was whistling tunelessly puttering about his cluttered kitchen in an ancient and threadbare maroon bathrobe and his lounging slippers normally his battered and pitted kitchen table sagged with documents law books and files on his cases but this morning hed cleared all that away covered the wood with a white linen tablecloth and laid out a formal coffee service sugar cream butter jams and jellies and a still warm and crusty morning baguette from the rue charmaines morning delivery freeman paused and smiled appreciatively as the strains of mahlers fifth began to emanate from his living room at a barely audible volume a moment later gina made her appearance combing out her stilldamp hair delightfully filling out the still plush bathrobe hed once purchased from the bel air hotel you look lovely he said she crossed the few steps over and leaned up to kiss him then she withdrew to arms length smiling up at him i feel lovely she said for a moment there i had this awful feeling that you were going to tell me i looked lovely too she laughed actually he wagged a finger i dont think we want to go there come sit down coffees hot he poured for her then for himself when they were settled freeman took his first sip nodded approvingly and put down his spoon all right he said if you still want to talk about it i suppose im as ready as ill ever be the previous night during their dinner in one of their law discussions gina was talking about one of her cases and suddenly atypically freeman had stopped her saying hed prefer not to ruin such a fine evening by talking about dash logan now he made a face this is the second time hes come up in the past two weeks or maybe i should say crawled out from under his rock or wherever it is that he lives im taking this as a bad sign for our profession he sighed so whats the case again last night my mind was on other things she smiled at the compliment then briefly sketched in to the point where hed stopped her last night on the oberlin proceeding the district attorney was bringing criminal charges against ginas client abby who had taken care of her mother for the past several years and who had inherited the vast percentage of an eight million dollar estate it was obvious gina said that jim the nogood brother was behind the charges and simply was extorting his sister for a portion of the take freeman listened chewing absentmindedly on a crust of baguette so let me get this straight the da is filing charges what are they alleging i gather elder abuse all the way to manslaughter they havent filed them yet this brought a frown why not if theyve built the case i dont know for sure i think gabe torrey might just be dragging his feet her tone conveyed some skepticism he said he didnt want to try this case although elderly abuse is high on pratts agenda apparently he didnt like jim the brother freeman nodded impatiently hed heard the name once and of course didnt need to be reminded so whats like got to do with it your client committed a crime or she didnt she didnt david he held up his bread hand im not saying she did gina im saying thats got to be torreys position but she was shaking her head and evidently it will be he will green light the investigation and get to the charges pretty soon but he wanted to give me a chance to settle maybe save abby some grief freeman had stopped chewing stopped all movement his eyes bored into emptiness somewhere between himself and gina my lord he said what he answered her with another question and if memory serves this humanitarian brother jim is our connection to dash logan hes his lawyer a nod right and already on board nestce pas you see anything wrong with this picture gina she stalled sipping some coffee finally shook her head to this point not really she leaned forward except it felt funny somehow its why i brought it up to you ill tell you why it felt funny because the da doesnt do that but she didnt agree i think gabe did it on his own my take was that gabe was trying to do the right thing off the record the right thing it does happen not as often as you think gina not as often as you think well maybe this time though but he kept at it and this right thing this time would be to make your client give away a million of her dollars that wasnt exactly the spin he put on it he was talking about saving her half a million a couple of years of hassle and a lot of trouble and he just happened to find this particular case out of the blue out of the hundreds the da is prosecuting and felt sorry for your client whom his office is about to charge gina fidgeted with the crumbs on her plate maybe thats why it made me uncomfortable because you have good instincts thats why freeman stood up walked over to the window looked down onto the street so the next step is gabe tells you to call this guys lawyer is that it essentially she saw his reaction what that seemed to make sense it still does hows that im a lawyer im not going to talk to the brother im going to go through channels through his counsel how do you know he has one how does torrey know he has one hes talked to the guy remember thats how he probably mentioned it freeman had paced back to the stove he leaned back against it arms crossed ok ask yourself this a guy thinks a crime has been committed he goes to the police right right then the crime gets charged and hes working exclusively with the das office with the prosecutors are you with me here catching on gina nodded hes already got an officefull of lawyers working for him who also happen to work for the da exactly freeman said the das office so what does he need his own lawyer for i mean handling the same case hes not a defendant so he doesnt need a defense attorney hell hes not even a plaintiff in a civil case hes just a guy reporting a crime he goes to the da he doesnt need his own attorney well the light was coming on but gina still couldnt quite see people have lawyers david abby my client she told me theyd been fighting over the will she and her brother or you and her brothers lawyer well no the first but now dear old jims got a lawyer whos ready to settle freeman had switched into his justlyfamous flamboyant courtroom mode he took a couple of steps forward toward the table his voice took on a note of urgency and then torrey says old jim will withdraw the accusation he made torrey tells you he knows this he holds it out to you as pretty much guaranteed a done deal well answer me this how can he possibly know that unless hes talked to jims lawyer who i might add shouldnt even be in the picture around these criminal charges and who happens to be the most unsavory person practicing law in the great state of california freeman grabbed his breakfast napkin and wiped it across his forehead leaving a couple of damp crumbs in its wake then he sat down with a satisfied expression returned to his normal voice spoke as though to himself god i wish just once hed try something like this on me he looked across the table do me one favor please of course if i can what dont settle dont talk to logan see what torrey does next she thought about this for a long moment but what if he files the charges hes holding all the cards here david if the investigation even begins my client loses did she do what theyre alleging did she commit this crime no he leaned back in his chair pulled at his bushy eyebrows scratched the corner of his mouth well people hate me for saying this i wont hate you he touched her hand if i were you what id do is trust in the wisdom and fairness of the law she studied his face saw he was completely sincere a person could get to like you a lot she said then a cloud crossing her visage about settling ill try to hold out just after eight in the morning she stopped him as he was crossing the lobby on his way to the staircase and his own office mr hardy he stopped on a dime turned ninety degrees to his left marched across to her station and looked her in the eyes phyllis my love how are we this fine morning very well thank you if youre free mr freeman would like to see you in his office right away well that makes this both of our lucky days i wanted to see him too but i didnt know if youd let me anytime you need to mr hardy you know that as long as i have an appointment those are mr freemans rules not mine well thank you phyllis youre welcome as he closed freemans door behind him hardy was grinning ive got it chewing on the nub of a pencil the old man sat at a desk completely littered with case files he looked up got what the automated voice on all those phone message menus you know the ones he put on a voice for security and training purposes and to help us serve you better this call may be monitored for your convenience i especially love the convenience part but that voice freeman put the pencil down what about it its phyllis hed put his briefcase down and was over at the side counter pouring himself a cup of coffee i cant believe i didnt recognize it until this morning i think its probably because we dont talk as much now as we used to but its her david im sure of it that same girlish enthusiasm the clarity of purpose the joie de vivre humming through every syllable why do you think she hasnt told us a celebrity in our midst imagine freeman let him go on in the same vein waiting until hed taken the seat in front of his desk had his first sip of coffee ive got a friend whos got a client he began without preamble the clients name is abby oberlin he went on for a few more minutes outlining the case as gina roake had done for him that morning ending with a question and who would be your guess for abbys brother jims attorney at least i know why you wanted to talk to me hardy said i assumed it would occur to you that asshole freeman almost never got truly upset although the mention of dash logan was one of the things that could do it he was spinning his pencil rapidly between his fingers ive been living with this thing for an hour now and i wanted to bounce it off a decent legal mind before i decide what im going to do with it however the phrase decent legal mind sounded hardy knew that freeman meant this as high praise ok hit me he said and freeman told him what was on his mind in his office upstairs hardy removed his coat and hung it over the back of his chair the comeandgo fog had this morning gone again so he raised the blinds in both of his windows letting in a feeble winter light for a few minutes he stood looking down at the traffic on sutler street then he whirled and went over to his desk where he punched the buttons on his telephone rich mcneils secretary told him that her boss wasnt expected in until midday could she take a message hardy considered for a moment and said hed be at sams at one oclock he had some news if rich couldnt make it he should call otherwise hed expect him there he had just hung up intending to call next to check on glitskys progress when the telephone rang perfect he thought heres the son of a bitch now calling him back at precisely the wrong moment well hed let his machine answer except it wasnt logan it was glitsky himself saying something about the burgess case hardy grabbed at the receiver glitsky started over youll never guess who i just talked to dont tell me hardy said joe montana allison garbutt im proud of you who is she shes the inspector on the case where elaine acted as special master they just turned the seized documents over to judge thomasino ok and this is important because i dont know if it is and yet youre telling me about it its a fact we dont know anything about thats all i know you and thomasino get along all right this was true enough hardy and thomasino werent close friends by any means but they knew each other from the courtroom and shared a mutual respect there might be something there hardy wasnt going to look a gift horse in the mouth glitsky was giving him a free fact possibly just another in the endless accretion of them surrounding a murder case and experience had taught him that all facts were worth collecting you simply never knew youre right he said there might be what was the name of the case petrof insurance fraud of some kind and what do you know about it completely nothing beyond that except that elaine was around it working on it the day she died it occurred to me as i was lying here i thought it might give you something to do to while away your many idle hours i appreciate it dont mention it the two men traded health and beauty tips for a few more minutes talked logistics about glitskys eventual release from the hospital after they hung up hardy paced his office for a while unable to say why his adrenaline was flowing he realized that it made little sense he hadnt even been thinking about cole burgess but suddenly here at least was something to do for his client a lead to follow finally he picked up the telephone again and punched some numbers he knew by heart it wasnt yet nine oclock and court wouldnt be in session until nine thirty in a perfect world judge thomasino would be in his chambers right now or at least his clerk would be in as it transpired for an instant all was perfection judge hardy said after their greetings i understand you signed off on a warrant on an insurance fraud case i dont even know if its been settled or tried people v sergei petrof the judge sounded weary of it no its not been settled yes theyre still doing motions bunch of russians faking car accidents what about it you appointed elaine wager special master in connection with it yes and then she gets herself killed in the middle of it as im sure youve heard the judges tone reflected his frustration thats the way the entire investigation has gone you wouldnt believe one delay after another some cases now it seems ill need another special master for more warrants before we can proceed and i dont know his voice brightened up you wouldnt be on the list would you diz in fact he was although he hadnt been called to serve in years he told that to the judge but my plates pretty full right now your honor and ive more than heard about elaines death im representing the accused in that case cole burgess a dissatisfied grunt so i cant use you all right what was your question well im afraid its not too specific i was curious because elaine was involved in it wondered if it might somehow be related to anything i could use in your murder case stranger things have happened judge i thought you might be able to tell me a little about it see if something might be worth pursuing thomasino gave it a beat well all right it isnt any secret he began the fraud unit starts getting calls from insurance companies about a rash of similar accidents in the last six months all russian surnames same doctor same type of car same lawyer for half of em so i sign a warrant to pull the records and elaines got to go along and supervise normally you know a piece of cake except if one of your colleagues is particularly uncooperative wont give the special master any direction wont even tell her where any of the files are says find em yourself this whole investigation is bogus anyway the belligerent son of a bitch what do you mean one of my colleagues is this a friend of mine no sorry i just mean it was another lawyer not to lump you all together certainly not in this case hardy went with his hunch you wouldnt be talking about dash logan would you maybe with my apologies if hes a friend of yours hes not hardy replied no the judge sighed somehow i didnt think he would be on his way down to the hall hardy decided to stop by the chronicles main office and see if jeff elliot was in a virtual certainty at this time of the morning hed just gotten into the reporters office and said hello when the building began to shake reflexively hardy backed up under the door said earthquake get under a beam elliot was in his wheelchair he kept his hands on his keyboard cast an amused tolerant look across the room ok sure im on it the shaking really no more than a quick minor jolt passed hardy stayed under his beam and jeff held out his hands as though feeling for raindrops two on the richter he said i dont move till we get to six he indicated a chair on the other side of his desk you can stay in the doorway if you want but it might be five years before another good shake youll get pretty bored the seats more comfy hardy waited another moment for the possible next temblor when after a few seconds it didnt come he moved forward its good to see a man with no fear of natures wrath elliot glanced out into the city room where the small quake had pretty much passed unnoticed my computer didnt even blink diz im not going to die in an earthquake i promise you way less chance than lightning and thats the rule in our house you have a rule about lightning in your house us hardy said sitting down we just flat dont allow it no not lightning getting killed by lightning you have a rule about getting killed by lightning jeff sat back pulled his hands off his keyboard and rested his arms on the sides of his wheelchair actually yes ridiculous as it may sound we have a rule about not worrying about something unless its more likely than getting killed by lightning i like it hardy said let me guess your girls are plagued by the occasional random fear ha occasional id pay large dollars for occasional its everything he tried a smile to make light of it but hardy could see it was about as funny as his own daughters constant fears which was not at all everything i swear to god jeff repeated plane crashes aids the hantavirus terrorists zits snakes nuclear accidents spiders child molesters on every street corner the dark lord the dark walking home alone everything you left out heart attacks hardy said the becks afraid of getting a heart attack now since glitsky did dont worry jeff replied if nicole hears about that its on the list i tell the beck that twelve year olds rarely die of heart attacks she doesnt care it could happen couldnt it and no warning abe didnt have any warning i tell her abe isnt twelve ask me if she cares this until eleven thirty last night hardy was leaning back an ankle on his opposite knee he dragged a hand across his eyes sometimes i think it must be us always telling them to watch out for this watch out for that especially the girls so this rule hows it work exactly whatever it was if it worked hardy wanted to know about it this time jeff got all the way to a smile he scratched at his beard perhaps embarrassed that it had come to this but it had damn it it had well we finally had to come up with some lowest threshold for paranoia that we could take seriously i mean there are legitimate fears she should worry about once in a while i suppose right right although i doubt if either you or me or our wives ever had them maybe its a new millennium thing maybe hardy agreed although i remember worrying during the cuban missile crisis i hate to say it diz but there were adults who worried then too and you know why he raised his voice because there was some real goddamn thing to worry about or as it turned out not exactly so anyway we finally had to tell nicole that whatever she was worried about had to be more likely than getting killed by lightning which for some reason shes not afraid of if it was less likely we werent going to talk about it especially after lights out at night and what are the odds of that dying by lightning strike thirtytwo thousand to one in a seventyfive year lifespan more or less hardy whistled impressed thats a good statistic jeff shrugged it still leaves a hell of a lot to be afraid of youd be surprised but at least it gets rid of death by earthquake spiders snakes plane crash atomic bomb blast none of them make the cut its really helped actually im bringing it home tonight hardy said its a great concept it is jeff agreed but i dont believe thats why youre here and if its about cole hes not my topic today he indicated his terminal screen half filled with words gironde again due in two hours i wish theyd invent a program to actually write the words im sure its on the way hardy said so whats new at the airport aside from that its never going to be finished jeff looked at his screen fixed something came back to hardy the way its going diz they may never even start this last phase given all the subs who supposedly didnt have their minority quotas on board its been seven months and everybody and their brother has had their personnel records subpoenaed gironde cant start work will probably even lose the contract and the da hasnt brought one charge yet not one three subs have already gone under because theyve lost the work it just sucks to hardy this was an old song thats how pratt works jeff make a big public stink then drag on the followthrough are you on girondes side on this i thought they were the bad guys a shrug all i know is that apparently fair and square they won the biggest contract this citys seen in ten years now everybody hates them the supes are asking for another round of bids and its all based on pratts office deciding to very publicly look for minority hiring irregularities which now its turning out may not exist he made a face it smells diz it really smells he looked back at his terminal and ive got to write it so cole its not specifically about cole specifically theres a good word so more specifically what and we do have to make it fast all right hardy said you know everybody in the city right oh yeah elliot said flatly me and everybody else were all pals how about dash logan the by now familiar reaction a faint line of distaste what about him thats what i was going to ask you has he got something to do with cole i dont know hardy broke a small grin not specifically but the topic had gotten jeffs attention and he reached for a cup on his desk sipped some coffee beginning to concentrate the only thing that comes to mind is that logan represents a lot of dope cases a lot people say he takes fees in trade then he sells it this was close enough to cole to get a rise out of hardy heroin no cocaine evidently hes got his own jeff paused i was going to say habit but i dont know if its to that point probably just recreational he functions evidently not well hardy said if returning calls is any indication well enough to make a good living jeff replied he drives a z wears nice clothes keeps up an office hardy sat up straighter his office thats the other connection to cole what was the first one hardy glossed over that elaine was working at logans office the day she was killed ok jeff sat back in his wheelchair and this means hardy shook his head spoke with a weary tone i dont know thats what i cant figure out its making me crazy why was she there hardy briefed him on elaines special master duties the russian insurance scams logans lack of cooperation on the earlier search at his place when he finished jeff was still interested but saw no point of connection so these insurance scam cases did they have drugs around them am i missing something weve got to be hardy said theres too much logan but maybe not enough he sat back in his wheelchair and looked over the desk that separated them you know diz we run into this all the time in journalism youre on a story and if this one last little piece falls into place they can start printing up the pulitzer citation for you i mean you want it so bad and then guess what what you want to write didnt happen its not true just coincidence good story no facts hardy considered a second his jaw was set thats not this at least i dont think so ok how about gabe torrey how about him in what sense david freeman has a theory about a connection between torrey and logan what i want to know is are they old friends did they go to school together maybe theyre gay having an affair here jeff stopped him theyre not gay logans a notorious cocksman in fact and torreys sleeping with pratt this intelligence nearly knocked hardy off his chair what jeff laughed you didnt know that were off the record now they try to keep it quiet cause pratts happy to let the feminists think shes a lesbian but the shadow knows my god see you do know everything you ought to print that in due time say nearer the election when it might do a little more good i cant believe it san francisco was a small town but apparently not so small that there were no secrets ok so theyre not gay maybe theyre bi maybe their mothers were pen pals i dont know jeff youre the ace reporter finger on the pulse of the city and if there was something i would have heard it right right hardy came forward expectantly jeff met his gaze a hint of humor in his eyes as far as i know they have no personal relationship hardy sat back thats the wrong answer i thought it might be cole was the first person in hardys experience whose looks and demeanor had actually improved while he was held in the county jail hed asked for and received a short hair cut some of the scrapes and bruises from his life on the street to say nothing of the night of his arrest had begun to clear up hed shaved off the wispy downy growth of beard three squares a day for only these few days had already added a visible overlay of flesh to the bones of his face eradicating the intimations of skull he wasnt yet anyones idea of robust but neither was he heroin chic hardy sat across the table from him in the attorneys visiting area the light room with the glass block walls coles speech would lapse into hazy around the edges from time to time but today it seemed more a habit than an impediment that he spoke clearly for long periods of time meant to hardy that he could do it anytime he thought about it he had simply gotten into the habit of mumbling to fit in on the street where he had grown used to a numb mouth and no reason to enunciate words to communicate anything beyond his most basic needs well hardy thought he had a reason now and he was rising to the occasion glitsky are you kidding me his eyes were clear as well he was on methadone and had in fact asked for an accelerated detoxification all to the good if he stuck with it but at the moment he wasnt on that page he was mostly angry were talking the same glitsky that dropped me on my head he couldnt catch you in time is what i heard a snort he tell you that cause its a lie hardy had a haunch on the edge of the table in the visitors room and now he leaned forward hovering over where his client sat how do you know what happened you were unconscious well coles hard gaze gradually gave way but theres no way hes trying to help me no hardy agreed i dont think he is not for your sake anyway the thing is cole hes a good cop an honorable person another dismissive grunt the concept for him obviously difficult to believe ill tell you what it is hes worried well decide to charge him with brutality after all hes trying to cut you off on that figures if he pretends to be on our team itll all go away hardy sat back you got it all worked out huh its not rocket science no youre right so we dont want his help is that your position for an instant coles expression sharpened hes not offering any help hes covering his ass hardy nodded stood up cricked his back when he spoke his tone was harsh see if you can wrap your brain around something cole theres nobody else in the entire police department whos looking for anything about this case let alone anybody else who might have been involved in elaines death but glitsky is hes doing it on his own for his own reasons and youd be smart not to care too much about what they are you want to know the truth yeah hes covering himself he felt his voice getting away from him his anger building glitsky doesnt want your conviction overturned because you made a stupid stupid confession thats where hes coming from cole he wants to nail you on righteous evidence thats what hes about he doesnt give a shit about your poor sorry ass he almost added that he didnt much either if it wasnt a death penalty case hed have been long gone but anything he does find is going to be against us hardy still wound up whirled on the boy what hes trying to find cole is the truth which correct me if im wrong is supposed to help us coles eyes bounced around the corners of the room getting his tone back under control hardy sat on the edge of the table again look he said i dont care at all really what glitskys motives are if he wants to convict you thats fine by me and it ought to be by you he doesnt want the confession in because as soon as that happens weve got grounds for appeal appeal is after im convicted i dont want to talk about appeal oh ok lets not then hardy brought a palm down sharply on the table get a clue here cole youre in deep shit and glitskys the only one doing anything that might help you whether helping you is his intention or not thats assuming the truth helps you hed challenged cole a minute before with the same point and now he waited again for a response denial outrage something but none came he sighed now listen glitskys a fact well use him if we can if you cant live with that then im gone too cole met his gaze i dont trust him hardy dropped his trump well hes been my best friend for like thirty years so id have to say i do now youve got two options you can live with it trust my instincts and talk strategy he threw a little edge into it or you can tell your mother to hire another lawyer this brought a rise its not my mother yeah cole yes it is dont kid yourself unless you want to take responsibility on your own but thats not what you do is it he waited surprised that it had come to this he hadnt intended to have any of this discussion but now that they were in it hed follow it until it ended even if it meant terminating his involvement with the case hardy thought that his client needed a dose of some hard life truths almost more than he needed a good attorney cole swallowed rapidly a couple of times in succession he set his jaw finally raised his eyes for the first time hardy saw something like resolve in them all right cole said im listening well do it your way whats the plan hardy felt the tension break in his shoulders he was still angry and frustrated he still didnt much care for his client but for now at least they could work together maybe he leaned back arms folded over his chest the strategy is twopronged first if you did it wait a minute i said im not sure if i mean i didnt you wait a minute hardy came forward fed up to here with objections and interruptions here in all probability sat the man who had killed elaine wager maybe he didnt deserve the death penalty but hardy didnt have to endure his selfserving excuses i dont want you to tell me whether you did or didnt kill elaine any more do you understand me i dont care about your denials or your admissions thats not why im defending you and right now im talking you listen thats the deal maybe youll learn something coles eyes narrowed any hint of his methadone lethargy had vanished he slumped back in the chair his arms crossed pissed dissed and dismissed hardy ignored it all he picked up in a relaxed voice our first line of defense is unconsciousness the facts here are going to make it very difficult if not impossible to even get to reasonable doubt about whether you did it i hardy held up a palm not interested of course we argue that you didnt do it but whats really going to matter is if we can prove that even if you did you were so drunk that you couldnt have realized what you were doing with six or eight drinks in you youre legally drunk with twenty and in withdrawal youre comatose what about the gun though i was going to ask you the same thing i didnt get any gun from cullen hes lying why would he lie i thought he was your friend yeah right a shrug hes out on three separate probations for selling rock hes got three or four strike convictions robberies they pull him in another time he figures this time theyve got to keep him so he makes this up and they trade hey you know this stuff happens all the time and in this case somebody wants to see me fall more than him so they go for the trade who would want that and why i dont know somebody with the da some cop maybe your friend glitsky i dont know hardy felt his blood heating up again but tried to ignore it you know anybody either place have you had any runins i ought to know about screwed around with some cops daughter anything like that no he shook his head then decided the denial wasnt strong enough hey i swear to god no nothing like that hardy was fairly sure that he was telling the truth and the fact was cole didnt need to have a personal enemy in the das office there might be nothing personal in it pratt had to win this case that was all to fill a hole in the prosecutions theory of the crime a witness needed to appear to account for coles possession of the murder weapon and lo it had come to pass hardy knew he needed to have a few words with cullen leon alsop get a better feel for that situation before too long but first he needed cole to understand his strategy to be on board with it so plan a is unconsciousness you dont remember but i do remember he pushed ahead over hardys warning expression seeing the gun i dont know why its just that like a snapshot i didnt have the gun it was in the gutter next to her she was already down i swear hardy was almost tempted to believe him i swear cole repeated all right cole you swear but moving along id also like to address the point that if you didnt kill elaine someone else did hardy didnt really think so but mentioning it to cole would serve as a popquiz for his credibility as he sat across the table from him now he would have given about eighty per cent odds that in the next few days his client would develop another snapshot of monday night and this one would feature the proverbial onearmed man im surprised jeff would even talk to you about me hardy had told him about his visit to the chronicle that morning whys that i havent exactly been like the perfect relative to those guys so i hear so why hardy started gathering his documents his legal pad his pens he stood up and had an acute flashback of coles mother in his office yesterday the later years of her life now reduced to pain and guilt because of cole even if he hadnt killed elaine hardy looked across the table at him maybe with jeff its like your friend cullen cole something else is going on youre in it but youre not it you know what im saying theres a whole universe out there and guess what what it doesnt all revolve around you i think i was a little hard on him hardy clinked his martini glass against david freemans in theory hed given up martinis at lunch about ten years before but he always made an exception at sams hed walk through the door there would be the old tiny darkwood bar the male waiters in tuxedos the buzz of busy people fortifying themselves with honest food for a productive afternoon and suddenly the thought of not having one martini would always seem to be an unnecessary denial of one of his lifes great pleasures hardy hadnt missed a day of work because of alcohol in half a dozen years and a martini wasnt going to slow him down this afternoon so he ordered bombay sapphire gin up very dry one olive and ice cold in a chilled glass freeman didnt agonize half as much as hardy hell he didnt agonize at all he was standing waiting at the bar when hardy entered nodding in approval at the order he said hed have the same and raised his glass when hardy raised his own im sure he had it coming hardy broke a cragged grin so heres to tough love huh or failing that just plain tough both men sipped appreciatively a waiter informed them that their booth was ready he would carry their drinks for them sams was already a popular san francisco lunch spot by the turn of the twentieth century and though it had changed some it still retained a bit of the feel of a private mens club with a public dining area in the main room a side room provided more privacy with booths along both walls that could be closed off by curtains and it was to one of these that the men repaired mcneil hadnt arrived yet it was possible that he might not show up at all although hardy had kept his invitation vague enough to whet his clients curiosity had manny gait agreed to a settlement already mcneil had been so anxious for it that hed called a postdawn meeting yesterday he would want to know right away but he might also wonder why hardy couldnt just leave a message he would make the meeting if he could but in the meantime there was plenty to talk about and hardy tried to keep the excitement out of his voice as he filled freeman in on the unexpected appearance of dash logan again this time in his murder case the old man pensive twirled the stem of his glass russian insurance fraud he was frowning sounds like the kind of work hed like the guy is everywhere i find it pretty intriguing depressing is more like it maybe more than that hardy sipped gin put his glass down i cant shake the feeling hes going to show up around cole burgess freeman was shaking his head from side to side i doubt it ill give you a scenario logan wasnt being cooperative the judge told me this when elaine came to do her special master work dash wouldnt show her where the files she needed were if she wanted to pull them shed have to find them first have i already called him an asshole freeman muttered hardy nodded several times so elaine just turned herself loose in his office going through everything and she found something she wasnt supposed to see freeman almost choked on his drink youre saying you think logan killed elaine because of that or one of the russians or another of his clients youve been watching too many movies all im saying is we can make the argument and drag our friend dash through the mud pretty good and i know that would make some people at this table very happy he shrugged at least its somebody to point at david something the jury might want to think about freeman wasnt convinced dont get me wrong diz i love the concept he said but its pure speculation maybe she saw something and then maybe somebody killed her because of it i dont think so no judge would let you introduce it at trial hardy didnt pursue it further though his client had arrived as mcneil slid in beside him in the booth it was clear he was both surprised and unhappy to find another guest at the table freeman had no real business being there and when mcneil realized that he wasnt one of hardys old friends that hed spontaneously asked to lunch no he wanted to talk about mcneils case he was as close to hostile as hardy had ever seen him as always at sams the waiter came by immediately mcneil saw the other two glasses and ordered a martini too vodka if not for that the brief defusing hiatus hardy thought he might not have stayed the pressure hed been under recently threatened to escape in an explosion the blood was up in his face when he turned to hardy there was nothing but anger youre trying to bring somebody else into my case at this stage what kind of bullshit is this i thought i told you it was over we were settling and whatever it was all confidential it is rich david knows nothing about the facts of the case itself hed better not freeman wasnt inclined to stop himself from jumping in and jump in he did im here to tell you about one of my cases not the facts the way its being handled and im going to care yes sir i believe you will mcneils florid face showed no sign of softening he shot a glare again at hardy then took in freeman with his rheumy basset eyes his rumpled brown suit the shaving stains on his shirt collar the tufts of hair growing from the tops of his earlobes this pisses me off he said unexpectedly he grabbed at the curtain and violently pulled it closed all right im listening hardy let freeman talk and as always he was impressed by the mans brilliance although hardy had tried to leave out specific facts in his recital of mcneils problems to david he was sure hed let a few slip out in the telling by contrast freeman told his own clients story completely without reference to the details of the case it was a masterly performance freeman told rich that he had a client with both civil and criminal cases pending the leverage of one against the other the offer to drop the criminal charges in return for a cash settlement finally the name dash logan the similarities in the logistics not the facts of his mcneils case and hardy by the way would never have mentioned anything at all about rich if freeman hadnt first acquainted him with everything he had just recounted by the time the story ended mcneil had cooled a long silence followed during which the waiter returned drew back the curtain delivered richs drink and took their lunch orders sweetbreads for freeman sand dabs for hardy and mcneil wine freeman asked abc everybody ok with that dont know it mcneil said anything but chardonnay hardy explained and finally his client smiled hardy thinking freeman the goddamned genius yeah rich said sure sounds good is one of you gentlemen a mr hardy he looked up yes he hated this someone tracking him down at lunch it could only be bad news an emergency a disaster and he wondered where the beck got it the waiter was the soul of professional deference your office called do you know someone at st marys hospital theyre trying to get in touch with you you left your pager at the office and evidently your cell phone is turned off thanks he used his napkin there was no need to panic ill be right back hardy followed the waiter through the main dining room empty tables now for the most part up to the bar a large delivery truck had pulled into the alley by the front door blocking any view casting the room in shadow as they handed him the phone a large pallet of something fell outside with a tremendous crash even the bartender jumped glitsky was dead he knew it he called information for the number let them connect it for him for an extra thirtyfive cents he didnt trust his brain to hold the number for the time it would take him to punch it in you have a patient named abraham glitsky one moment please hes in the icu im not sure hell be able to take your call please hold his heart was clogging his throat he cleared it it made no difference they were playing feelings in his ear while he was on hold it didnt make the wait any shorter the operator came back on im sorry sir what was the name again dismas hardy he said tempted to add whats yours phyllis no she said the patient abe glitsky he wasnt in the icu last night he had a room with another man she couldnt have cared less the computer has him in the icu it doesnt say hes left it do you think you could maybe call the nurses station there and check maybe someone would remember where they moved him if hes not still there oh thats a good idea she said brightly please hold again sorry feelings oh oh oh then finally a tone a ring someone picking it up glitsky hello for a minute he felt lightheaded with the rush of relief did you call me yeah i thought you were having all kinds of tests and stuff today that was this morning it all went like a top in case you were wondering i havent thought about anything else all day he said except just now i was sure you were dead nope he said but somebody else is whos that cullen leon alsop former famous snitch diz you still there yeah how od uncut heroin he got ord released on his own recognizance yesterday afternoon and i guess he thought itd be fun to go out and celebrate how did you find out ridley banks called me here he was slightly upset this kind of majorly complicates cole burgess for him and its been a mess from the beginning he didnt like it when cullen came up with the gun story before and he doesnt like this even more i dont either i didnt think you would which is why i wanted you to know right away would he talk to me banks hes a public servant i dont see why not perhaps because the last cop who talked to me got himself suspended that would be one reason maybe you can wear a disguise or fake a heart attack appear feeble and harmless speaking of which i appreciate the call but are you sure you should be working already glitsky didnt say anything for a long while then maybe somebody else did kill her diz im going to find out not if you die first then ill make sure i dont the thing about freeman that hardy found so continually impressive was not only that his personal arsenal was so huge but that he could pull out any weapon from it at the moment of its peak effectiveness at the precise instant hed managed to become both rich mcneils drinking buddy and his father confessor even going so far as to pull the curtain again to shield them after hardy pulled it back he saw that freeman had ordered a second bottle of pinot grigio and theyd already put a significant dent in it the two of them having moved from hostility to something approaching intimacy in about a quarter of an hour mcneil was leaning back into the wall of the booth the earlier tomatored flush of anger having softened to a rosy glow hed loosened his tie undone his top button hardy got settled in next to him and poured himself some ice water rich was just telling me an interesting story freeman said do you know gene visser used to be a cop sure though i dont know what hes doing lately now hes a private eye youll never guess who he works with hardy could figure it out his eyebrows went up he turned to rich how did you meet him mcneil lifted his glass drank off another half inch he came to me one day last week at the office said hed been doing some work for mr logan didnt want to see us get involved in a lot of ugly accusations freeman chuckled without mirth we can bring this to the bar and im going to but im sorry rich you go on the expression was apologetic i should have told you diz i just thought it would be easiest to bail out im just so tired of all this what mcneil sighed from his shoes fifteen eighteen years ago i fucked up got involved with another woman my secretary stupid stupid stupid pure disgust he sipped wine anyway i did it she got pregnant had the child sally found out it was awful but we worked it out it was awful he repeated and the girl linda hell it wasnt her fault anyway i wound up having to let her go essentially paid her off out of our own savings got her set up with another job and now shes blackmailing you mcneil shook his head not her diz but the main thing sally and i wanted to do was keep it from the kids you know id made a mistake and i was paying believe me i was paying but it wasnt going to ruin our family and visser found out about it a nod he must have gone digging around in my old company for dirt on me there had been rumors probably some resentment i left a couple of years afterward but people remembered and now he shrugged helplessly so visser threatened to tell your kids and drag linda and her kid through it if you didnt settle hardy sat back considering you know rich its not as though this kind of thing is going to make headlines you had an affair you and your wife worked it out youre sorry mcneil looked across the table i know thats what david was saying too it was just that after all this time hearing it from visser knowing the kind of person manny gait is what else he might do i panicked i guess totally understandable freeman was controlling the moment and this was precisely where he wanted mcneil anyway diz i suggested that he and sally just gather the family together maybe not the grandchildren but the kids they should just simply honestly humbly lay it all out for them he poured out his heart across the table theyll understand rich i promise you you know i see it now i think they would of course they would mcneil had his hand on his forehead as though rubbing away a headache he wore his feelings like a billboard it was all going to work out at last finally he looked up so both of you guys you think i should just wait a few weeks thats all freeman said hardy added you can always settle it never has to get to the criminal trial that i really dont want id sell the building before that thats the right decision freeman said forcefully nobody could blame you but lets not breathe a word of it until when lets say march first three weeks hows that sound mcneil gave the decision its due then nodded i can do that images smells feelings were beginning to break through the fog cole didnt remember the last time hed felt any kind of hunger except the craving for g but after this mornings meeting with his hardass lawyer they took him back to his cell and he realized he was ravenous hed gotten his pill from the orderly then had his four slices of white bread glass of milk orange juice two sausages two eggs for breakfast only three hours before but now he was counting the minutes until eleven thirty when theyd bring up lunch as a capital murder defendant he was still separated from the general population in a sort of wing with six cells three on each side of a ten by twenty foot common area which they were rarely permitted to use he was in front right with only one neighbor cole didnt know his name he thought of him as jose a tattooed rail of mexican steel who spent all of his time doing pushups then watching the public television which was left on sixteen hours a day above the common area in the center of the pod of cells there was some game show on now and he stood at the bars for one of the segments between commercials then gave that up jose was doing pushups again and cole watched him for a while before deciding that this wouldnt be the worst way to spend some time he dropped himself and ripped off ten before it got a little difficult by twenty he was done his biceps and chest muscles such as they were screaming at the exertion he looked over and jose was still methodically pumping his head craned up to the side to follow the tv cole lay on the cold concrete catching his breath loathing what hed become it didnt even feel like a memory he could close his eyes and recall it perfectly the sense that he was sixteen yesterday he and steve polacek in his garage their huge twenty dollar bet over whod be the first to press his weight a hundred thirtyone pounds that was cole polacek was seven pounds heavier wanted a handicap for a while he remembered their warmup had been fifty pushups fifty he couldnt bring back whod won the bet if either of them had ever made it to their weight probably both that was the way they were back then but he remembered the garage they never parked cars in it not even in the winter just his dads tools on the wall the workbench the pingpong table in the middle bikes and skates skis and balls and sports equipment all over the place pretty good jock family up till his dad died his sister dorothy training with him that whole last summer she was home before she went to college they were going to ski crosscountry from des moines to iowa city when she came back on christmas break cole lifted his cheek off the floor pulled his arms up to beside his shoulders pushed this time even the first few were hard eight turning onto his side he sat up then pulled his mattress off its concrete pad onto the floor he rolled onto it hooked his hands behind his head tried a situp once upon a time he could really do situps sixty in a minute polacek couldnt touch him again he started fast again he faded quickly but he forced himself through fifteen and on to twenty he wasnt going to accept less than twenty although the last couple felt like they ripped something inside him but he got to it turned on his side away from jose gulped for breath closed his eyes the clang of the outer door to the common room jolted him up cole had dozed through the twenty minutes that inmates were allowed out into the common room every morning two guards with the trolley holding the lunches banged again on the outer door back in your rooms girls when everyone was back where they belonged the guard entered his code into the box outside and all the cell bolts slammed into place seeing the mattress on the floor with cole crosslegged now on it the guard distributing the trays couldnt resist a little moment of clever repartee having a picnic alice he asked nice day for it he slid the tray under the door cole barely heard and didnt care eric was the social worker who passed out the pills he stopped at the door this was the first dose cole had told him he was going to miss hed get his usual come dinnertime again and eric wanted to check to make sure cole was comfortable with the idea he was then finally the food if cole thought hed felt a jab of hunger before it was nothing compared to now with another of the jails fullfledged meals actually in front of him all the meals hed had so far included four slices of white bread and four pats of butter the butter was soft warm and he smeared one of the pats onto a piece of the bread folded it over and put it all whole into his mouth while he chewed he looked down at the tray today lunch was two thick slabs of meatloaf with gravy mixed peas and carrots mashed potatoes and more gravy canned peaches in a plastic bowl milk and two chocolate chip cookies the bread went down cole stabbed at the meatloaf so hard that he broke his plastic fork it didnt matter he used his spoon shoveled in a few more bites began to savor to taste prodded by the mnemonic smell of the gravy to remember polaceks kitchen a winter day later afternoon snow outside an afterschool snack before hockey polaceks mom pouring reheated gravy over bread and cold meatloaf polacek he hadnt thought of him in years and now he found himself wondering where his old best friend was certainly no place like here he probably had a job someplace maybe even was married polacek with kids imagine the last year of high school they had stopped being friends over the dope marijuana then polacek really believing it was the killer weed didnt want any part of it so cole started hanging with the other guys reece baugh neillsen parducci baugh was the best of them he had even been friends with polacek before as cole had the good students through grade school little league boy scouts then after coles dad died when cole had been trying to get through that darkness baugh turning him on the first time no doubt he had good intentions that was who baugh was trying to make cole feel better about life with his sister gone away to college his dad gone for good hey life isnt easy people need to laugh get high forget themselves it was an unbelievable bummer his dad dying marijuana bfd come on cole its totally harmless marijuana never killed anybody baugh was dead now four years though polacek trying to get him to stop a few times coming around the house worried about how much cole was changing yeah well people change cole wasnt hooked on anything he could stop anytime he wanted the other guys reece neillsen parducci his mom kept up with their moms last cole heard reece had become a cop back home he knew neillsen worked at gm parducci was still playing ball second year in triple a might make the bigs telling himself soaking up his gravy didnt hook any of them didnt hook me either not the marijuana another flash the last time he saw polacek a party at notre dame cole had dropped out after a semester and his mom sent him up to visit his old friend subliminal message that maybe hed see how great steve was doing and clean his own act up subtle as a cherry bomb but hed gone cole in his own mind nowhere near any kind of junkie this is recreation thats all the only kind he knows anymore constant doping but he can quit anytime hes shocked at steve in a frat now with his alligator shirt drinking beer dancing to hootie just like so unaware so naive whereas cole that night he was the king there was this girl somebody somebody by now he was into cocaine whenever he could get it dealing a little to cover costs so he and this girl theyre upstairs in the bathroom theyve got lines laid out and one of the dorks comes in and next thing theres polacek angry but calm laying some trip about him being a guest and abusing their friendship coles got to leave right now they cant have cocaine in their house the college could close them down they could lose their charter cole s temper out the window half the blow wasted now scattered in the commotion who gives a shit steve about any of this screaming at him everybody here cole everybody whos trying to make a life polacek the dweeb never saw him again and good damn riddance the best friend though that hed ever had hey alice you done whats a matter they put too much pepper in that for you ten years ago when sharron pratt had been a city supervisor she had lobbied to pass an obscure change in the citys law regarding business announcements in the communitys newspapers previously if you wanted to file a fictitious business name statement a notice of application to sell alcoholic beverages a notice of foreclosure or any number of other legal notices the law required that you publish this information in any newspaper with a paid circulation of at least one hundred and fifty thousand sharron had persuaded the other supervisors that this law unfairly discriminated against the smaller more communitybased newspapers that proliferated all over the city and which could receive no revenue from this lucrative market largely as a result of her efforts the law was changed to require filing of these notices in any newspaper with a print run of over ten thousand copies of which the most wellknown in the english language was the daily democrat as a practical matter this change in the law made a millionaire out of chad lacey the daily democrat publisher a friend and political ally of sharron pratt suddenly laceys community bulletin distributed for free on racks or as a throwaway on driveways mostly in the haightashbury district found itself on the receiving end of almost three hundred thousand dollars per year in city money alone lacey could now afford to hire a few wellknown guest columnists and to pay several fulltime reporters with the papers new respectability distribution went into three more districts in the city the sunset the richmond twin peaks and the democrat became the citys premier free newspaper its print run had grown to twentyfive thousand and it positioned itself as the voice of the people the downtrodden the disenfranchised the political pals of lacey and pratt before any papers had been filed in the matter for example the democrat had run a fivethousand word piece on the tragic plight of a powerless and lawabiding citizen named manny gait whod trusted his landlord paying advance rent in cash while hed gone to care for his dying mother for a few months he returned from this errand of mercy only to find himself evicted from his longtime residence in flagrant defiance of human decency and the citys rent control laws by a grasping crooked and heartless developer named rich mcneil theyd run a picture of poor manny on the front page and he had indeed looked very sad and downtrodden sitting there on his motorcycle now sharron pratt stood over her desk and punched numbers on the phone so hard that her whole desk shook she had the speaker on so her voice would boom slightly on the other end i need to talk to mr lacey right now yes a personal matter this was their code phrase pratt wouldnt call the democrat under her own name and appear to be giving orders to its publisher to do so would do fatal damage to the credibility of his objective editorials she waited impatiently looking at her watch less than a minute elapsed im here lacey said how are you im not well chad not well at all whats the matter the matter oh lets see perhaps its the fact that last week we talked before my speech at the commonwealth club do you remember that sharron do you remember telling me youd make sure this deathpenalty decision i announced would get a lot of favorable press editorial coverage like that lacey didnt respond pratt took a breath and softened her tone and yet i notice you have rather loudly stayed silent while your colleagues over at the chronicle particularly jeff elliot have been having a great deal of fun at my expense she picked up the receiver spoke in a still more measured tone i certainly dont mean to tell you how to run your paper chad but i was under the impression that you were in my camp have i offended you in some way if i have im sorry but ive kind of been waiting for you to step up she heard his sigh over the line well weve had some problems sharron i suppose i should have called you sooner about what what kind of problems the publisher paused well frankly some of my reporters as you know sharron we havent been much in the deathpenalty camp here over the years well neither have i chad but this is a special case i know it is sharron i am on your side the thing is were having some trouble figuring out how its so special and then what kind of spin to put on it i had to personally kill the first article i got on it you know why because it sounded a lot like jeff elliots citytalk who was it whoever it was he works for you doesnt he if he doesnt write what you want it seems like youd have some leverage it doesnt matter the individual hes a good reporter hes been on your side a lot he doesnt like this thats all pratt pursed her lips stripped off a piece of scotch tape from the dispenser on her desk began dabbing at imaginary spots on her skirt ive got an idea chad she said why dont we do an exclusive interview you and me one on one the spin is that while in general the death penalty is the wrong penalty it is the only remedy for a hate crime such as this one this was a hate crime make no mistake and i believe chad that a hate crime like this calls for blood vengeance she could almost swear she heard him thinking about it that might play he said at last damn straight she replied the two of us we can make it play it has to play treya was supposed to start on mr jackmans project the grayson matter on monday morning but the firm had been excused to attend elaines memorial in the aftermath of glitskys collapse she had been unable to make herself come in for the rest of the day she knew that under other circumstances this would have been inexcusable she herself would not have condoned it and to make matters worse the time shed spent at home had been wholly unproductive now it was wednesday afternoon mr jackman at least seemed to understand but she felt awful about it yesterday she did come in but she worked only about six hours all of it on grayson mr jackman had been right it was about the most tedious number crunching that she had ever experienced after her sleepless monday night she had made almost no headway and finally she realized that if she was going to call on lieutenant glitsky at the hospital that night which after her behavior seemed a sacred duty she would need some rest first so shed signed out early again shed come in this morning with a new resolve went directly to the abandoned associates room that was her workspace for the new project seventyfour cardboard boxes filled with data stacked around the walls into the bookcases everywhere and began where shed left off the night before on the third manila folder in the first box and could not do it in four and a half hours she estimated that shed done twenty minutes of useful work at twelve thirty she checked her watch looked at the pages spread out before her and got out from behind the desk his secretary was at lunch the gatekeepers desk deserted his door was open a crack she heard him talking on the telephone the conversation wound to a close and she knocked on the door and pushed it open slightly further mr jackman excuse me can i bother you a minute he looked up surprised his hand was still on the phone and now he stopped placing the receiver back into its cradle ms ghent what can i do for you hows grayson coming along she steeled herself and told him the truth that it wasnt the project it was her she was wasting the firms time these past few days and after hed been so kind to her he stopped her whats really bothering you he asked she drew a long breath and stared across at him that i cant seem to get focused on anything except elaine the rest of it glitsky and her feelings there was too nebulous to mention she pressed on the talk you and i had last week about her enemies that you knew about some of them she paused looked down at her hands back up at him told him shed gone to visit glitsky at the hospital i felt like id made it happen somehow what his heart attack a nod it sounds ridiculous i know she shrugged i just felt i had to make sure he was all right and was he he seemed fine wonderful in fact but she merely nodded again but hes still worried about the case jackmans face grew grave did he say why or give any reason she thought of what hed said it was as though elaine were finally talking to him and knew there would be no way to communicate that nothing specifically but the reason is all wrapped up around coles confession he thinks its internally inconsistent maybe inadmissible to the point that its completely invalid not just inadmissible but untrue she shrugged her shoulders i dont know he cocked his head intent but what do you think treya she hadn t worked it through completely yet although she found it compelling that a veteran cop like glitsky would believe it enough to get laid off over it i think its a gap worth closing and that isnt happening with the police with glitsky treya still resisted giving it up glitskys position as a lieutenant of homicide was the font of his power and she found herself reluctant to undercut that so she temporized well you know theyve got a suspect in custody whos been charged with the crime she left the conclusion unstated the point is hes doing it on his own eliminating any other possible suspect but burgess jackman rocked in the chair behind his desk yes she hesitated leaned forward which brings me to what i wanted to say he waited im probably the best source of what elaine may have been working on and this means i think i could be valuable to an investigation if the lieutenants interested jackman drew in a lungful of air interested in what precisely he asked carefully if youll forgive me speaking up sir elaine was one of this firms premier assets it seems to me that its in the firms best interests to make sure that her murderer doesnt get off the firms best interests he said dubiously in what way cole burgess took something from you sir the lieutenant doesnt want him getting away with it and i dont believe you would stand for it either she knew that shed hit the right chord someone had stolen from him from everything hed built up from scratch and nobody was going to get away with that for a moment her bosss eyes were alight with intensity and she realized that it had become personal now somehow shed made him see that you do what you have to do he said finally bill it to admin she stood up her employer too got out of his chair and came around the desk now he stood perhaps a foot in front of her she looked up into his face what bothers me she said evenly is that i didnt even know she had enemies i know we confided in one another i think she would have told me jackman drew back half a step he folded his arms and stared out at something beyond her right shoulder maybe enemies is too harsh he said more like competitors she was strongwilled vibrant she wanted her way and got it people were jealous of her thought her aloof and arrogant that she was unaware of that reaction maybe even of the people themselves having it only made it worse perhaps youve experienced some of the same thing yourself even here at the firm and of course he was right she acknowledged the truth of it with a small smile i know she could rub people the wrong way so in that sense yes she had enemies jackmans face suddenly set itself in ice i was one of them it was closing in on dusk and ridley banks was back at the same crime scene to which hed been summoned just after dawn hed had a busy day putting a greater concentration of investigative field work into the past ten hours than he normally would get to in a month the results were mixed as they almost always were in homicides anyway but they were also in his opinion provocative in the extreme the victim had been found dead in room of the excelsior hotel at th and mission in spite of its name the excelsior is not a hotel in the usual meaning of the word rather its clientele rent rooms by the week or the month and these tended to be casually bartered by its inhabitants mostly for drugs but also for sex booze clothes money there was no current guest registered to the room containing the body of cullen leon alsop the door had not been locked when hed been found still the homicide team upon its arrival had little trouble indentifying him his wallet bulged in the back pocket of his jeans which he was still wearing he also had his jail release and or papers on him stuffed into the front pockets so it was cullen all right and ridleys name was on one of the sheets so he got looped into the call the inspector spent a few hours at the scene asking questions of the crime scene investigations unit he then decided it would be instructive to wait for john strouts arrival he wanted to talk to the coroner before things moved too far along because while people died quite often from heroin overdoses in the city especially in this neighborhood there was too much coincidence in this case for ridleys liking the sergeant with the csi team was of the opinion that somebody else had been with cullen and then not too surprisingly when he realized what was happening fled he was surprised though that hed left the baggie with a reasonable amount of white powder still in it on the small table next to the bed this stuff was far more valuable than gold to any addict it was unprecedented in the csi sergeants experience that this much would be left behind regardless of what had occurred in the room cullen also had six hundred and fiftyfour dollars in cash a couple of joints and a matchbook from a bar called jupiter jammed into his other front pants pocket when strout came he was his cautious but helpful self after hed examined and autopsied the body and all forensic evidence relevant to it the coroner would eventually release his opinion on the official cause of death before that strout wasnt going to be hurried nor was he inclined to make any official pronouncement before he had time to analyze all of his facts but there were a few informal opinions he could share with an inspector of homicide to guide him in his investigation the first was that the residue left in the bag appeared to be an unusually pure form of heroin possibly almost uncut china white strout told banks that if this was a representative sample of the latest stuff to hit the street they could expect half a dozen overdoses maybe more in the next couple of days neither strout nor the csi team could see any sign of struggle and that combined with the probable cause of death suggested to strout that this was most likely an overdose situation an accidental suicide not a homicide banks couldnt shake the feeling that in this the coroner was mistaken over the next two hours he talked to everyone whod been in the building and who hadnt managed to escape before the word got out that the police were on hand of the twentyseven people he interviewed fourteen admitted to knowing cullen at least by sight but none of them had seen him come into the building none admitted to knowing hed been there last night the manager was a toothless midfifties gnome in a limegreen bathrobe and combat boots he had no idea how that poor boy had gotten into the room it was vacant see he still had the key far more concerned with getting reimbursed by the city for the rooms rent during the time the police kept it closed off as a crime scene than he was with the death the manager had not seen or heard anything unusual in the past couple of days of course he would have said the same thing even if he had personally witnessed the second coming in the next four hours ridley had first called his old mentor glitsky in the hospital after that cursing himself for everything he was and everything hed done in the past ten days hed gone back to the beginning and remembered the matchbook from jupiter armed with a mug shot he got to the bar at around two thirty and five people including the bartender a lawyer a private investigator and two random daytime drinkers recognized cullens face yes hed been there had a few drinks seemed impatient but didnt cause any trouble ridley was glad to run into some cooperative witnesses the five of them had been helpful sitting in a circle around him at the bar trying to help him connect the dots the lawyer and the private eye logan and visser were sure that they had left the bar before the victim had so they couldnt vouch for when he left but the other three witnesses came to an agreement that cullen had left at a little after dark now ridley was back where hed begun on the streets surrounding the excelsior he pulled his shirt out untied his shoes and adopted a slouch in a halfhour hed made a friend who directed him to one of the neighborhoods salesmen damien was parked in an alley a block and a half from the excelsior selling prewrapped packaged brandname dime bags of heroin out of a shiny buick skylark in another five minutes whatever streetlights still worked in the city would come on ridley looked around to be sure nobody was watching he reached under his jacket and pulled out his gun and badge and walked up to the car lucky for you dirtbag he said im in homicide get out real slow backing up to let the door open ridley nearly had his own heart attack to his right at the back bumper of the skylark stood another bum his face in the dim light vaguely familiar he too had a gun in one hand in the other he held out a badge he was smiling dangerously damien had one foot on the pavement when the other man sprang forward in one long step grabbing him by the collar he dragged him the rest of the way out of the car and threw him to the ground hey man damien whined my clothes you know both men kept their guns trained on him damien damien damien the bum with the badge clucked sympathetically some people are just never going to learn do you not have brains is that the problem are they defective cant you tell a cop yet after all this time havent you and i done this enough he shook his head dishearteningly i swear its depressing he looked over at ridley still holding his badge up to avoid any misunderstanding then he went back to damien still on the ground this man here he said indicating ridley is inspector banks from homicide he flashed a smile speaking over his own shoulder jan falk narcotics i tried to get you coming out of jupiter but you were too fast sorry if i spooked you just now ridley was coming back to earth finally recognized falk as one of the daytime drinkers from jupiter undercover and fooled him clean ill get over it you guys going to kiss now or what damien asked falk smiled at him again put on a mincing voice if we want to damien in fact were going to do anything we want to and i get the feeling inspector banks wants to ask you some questions is that right inspector thats right well you can ask my lawyer i didnt do no homicide banks gave damien a heartless little grin of his own i didnt say you did now did i ill tell you what falk said im going to make a phone call now to some friends of mine and meanwhile let you fellows get to know each other a little better hows that sound inspector a halfhour later damien was leaving the alley on his way downtown in the back seat of a squad car inspectors banks and falk waved goodbye then went to lean against the bumper of the skylark to wait for the police tow truck to come and impound the vehicle by now they were laughing about it you were damn lucky i didnt pop you where you stood banks said i know i realized that about a second too late it just seemed too good an opportunity to pass up i hate that little pecker havent seen him in a couple of years howd you know where i was going you said excelsior drug overdose i guessed im made here so i dont hang much about but i saw you and thought it would be fun to stroll through the old neighborhood and what do you know we both run into damien ridley phrased it carefully not wanting to step on a fellow officers toes he wasnt very hard for me to find you know no we figure it takes maybe a halfhour for a new guy one of us to make one of them then we leave em alone but you just busted him that was purely for fun inspector we got twenty damiens in this square mile if you hadnt connected with him i wouldnt have done a thing theyre just literally holding the bags not worth the trouble their only value is maybe leading us to their source and even at that next level he shrugged it was terrible but it was reality every policeman knew that arresting the intermediaries in the drug trade was at best a stopgap measure a nuisance for all concerned between damien and his ultimate supplier whom damien would never meet or know or possibly even hear of there were probably six to ten layers of intermediaries each taking their money most cutting the product anyway you wanted something from him i thought i might put him more in the mood to be cooperative you find what you wanted it was ridleys turn to shrug i have trouble believing insurance salesmen are telling me the truth and damien scores a little lower than they do what did you want to know if there was something new superpure on the street thats what my guy died of what did he say damien he said no same stuff all the time lately guaranteed you know ive got to say i cant believe they put brand names on this stuff those bags damien had on him heavenly daze jesus sure theres all kinds of great shit nirvana china sleep tar babies but your guy had something else the coroner said unofficially of course that he thought it was nearly pure and it wasnt in any container just a plain baggie falk took his heel off the bumper and walked off a few steps he stood there a couple of moments nodding his head as though reaching some conclusion then he turned back around this is why i came out looking for you after you left why cause im on a thing out of the jupiter theres a lot of cocaine in and out of there and since its mostly a law crowd people want to see it cleaned up before it gets busted am i making it clear yeah ok so yesterday im passing a slow afternoon and your man cullen comes in just like we all said today but hes not like a little impatient hes climbing the walls so hes halfway through a beer and he gets up and goes to the bathroom couple of minutes later one of the guys today the pi visser he gets up and goes to the bathroom now i been in there the bathroom and its one stall one pisser and those two guys are in there swear to god ten minutes before visser comes out first and sits back down in his booth of course its jupiter late afternoon nobodys paying any attention except me so what not what youre probably thinking another minute and out comes your guy cullen leon alsop now hes mr mellow sits and finishes his beer has another one while visser and his lawyer friend leave ridley shook his head i must be missing something this wasnt cocaine this was heroin but falk had a scent either way he said visser was in there and gave him something then this morning the guys dead i never thought of it until you came in today asking questions but as soon as i saw that kids face im going click click click you know i know the feeling ridley said im getting it now a decent legal mind frannie whistled impressed david actually said those words every one of them in that order behind the bar of the shamrock moses mcguire slid a black and tan half bass ale half guinness stout across to his brotherinlaw hes buttering you up he said ill bet he raises your rent in the next few weeks you watch but hardy was shaking his head it was a sincere compliment you had to be there i doubt if he even realized he said it were talking david freeman frannie said flatly if he said it he realized it shameless flattery moses said and not much of it at that hardy sipped at his brew mose i once heard freeman say he thought oliver wendell holmes wasnt too stupid if the greatest jurist our country has produced is not too stupid and ive got a decent legal mind you see where that puts me at least in line for the supreme court frannie said i cant wait in line for a rent increase is more like it moses wasnt to be persuaded i wouldnt go anyplace expensive for dinner tonight youre going to need the money it was date night normally they didnt do the redwood room at the clift followed by charles nob hill on a typical wednesday they would meet hardy from downtown and frannie from their house out on th ave at the little shamrock midway between them at th and lincoln they would have one drink usually at the bar with moses behind it and then repair to dinner wherever the mood took them a young couple had seated themselves at the bar by the front window and moses walked down to wait on them hardy covered frannies hand with his own gave it a gentle squeeze put on an apologetic face and reached for the beeper on his belt sorry i meant to leave it in the car now though since you didnt but she was used to it the constant interruptions were always unwelcome but they had ceased to be an issue when they got to wherever they were going for dinner she would remember to have him take the beeper off his belt leave it in the glove compartment she put her hand over his now kissed him lightly on the cheek its ok go ahead he used the phone behind the bar which he figured was the last working rotary in california the callback number wasnt immediately familiar to him and this was in itself a bit unusual hardys legal mind might only be decent but he had almost an idiot savants knack for remembering telephone numbers and this one seemed new to him banks he heard homicide inspector this is dismas hardy thanks for getting back to me the voice wasnt enthusiastic sure i try to return calls what can i do for you you said the lieutenant he didnt finish the sentence i talked to abe this afternoon he said maybe this cullen alsop thing is related to elaine to cole burgess maybe the voice wasnt any more inviting i understand the gun story felt a little funny to you and now the overdose the day he gets out at some point hardy hoped banks was going to catch up and run with it but he also knew the cause of the reluctance and respected it somebody might have wanted to shut him up possible banks was noncommittal strouts leaning toward calling it an accident what do you think hardy let a silence develop this wasnt working he wasnt getting through to the young man professionally they were still on opposite sides he had to find a way to bridge the gap banks said well about to end the call hardy cut him off remember the other day at the funeral inspector asking abe if there was anything you could do no response this might be it all im asking is give me a halfhour another long pause then the voice more matteroffact a decision reached i got an appointment coming up ive got to make its on this after that i thought id go down and see the lieutenant around the end of visiting hours maybe nine nine thirty as it happens i was going to stop by and see him after dinner myself it was a way for ridley to justify what he was about to do that appeared to be what he needed so it would just be a coincidence if we both got there around the same time the weather had cleared and warmed up slightly not that it was balmy by any stretch but the biting damp wind of the past week or so had abated and now the air was calm the stars bright overhead hardy and frannie had miraculously gotten a table without advance reservations at pan y vino a longtime favorite italian place just up from the marina and when they finished they decided to take a walk theyd already discussed what seemed to be every possible permutation in the lives of their children frannies progress with her school applications shed gotten them all off the terrific food they were eating moses abe his health and his children even treya ghent and what had that been about the degree of personal involvement in her showing up at the hospital this was what date night was for to catch up to stay in touch personal lives they were holding hands strolling with the mass of other pedestrians up union street it wasnt yet eight thirty occasionally they would stop and look in a window at something eventually frannie squeezed her husbands hand smiling she looked over at him im sorry what he asked i was saying and then my grandmother died i think that must have been what you heard that woke you up sorry he said again i guess im a little distracted but she didnt want to criticize him all right she said youve been the soul of patience we can declare the date over if you want talk about whatever it is out of the topics they could talk about in the first years of date night one had come to predominate hardys work from time to time he would become so involved in his cases that he would suggest they drive together to crime scenes or maybe stop by the jail to interview his client they would theorize cases to death over meals that neither of them tasted finally they had outlawed discussing his cases during date night it still did creep in but generally the law was respected and in fact treasured but she was right tonight hardys input to the various family and personal discussions was minimal at best distracted was hardly the word she already knew that he and freeman had made some crucial strides on one of his cases at lunch there was some inkling that much of his involvement in several cases might be related somehow he would be seeing glitsky within the hour getting new information from ridley banks the connection between the relationships might become clear it was all he could think about i just dont want to waste ridleys time with stupid questions he said by way of explanation hes not going to want to help me without abe anyway i dont want to wind up threatening him getting him all defensive scaring him away how would you do that i start talking about the videotape on cole the confession and hes gone why because ridleys the one who got it hes still standing by it but this new overdose makes it a little funky he doesnt really know why and neither do i but its there and also abes lost his job over it and then nearly died all that may or may not be related but either way ridleys conflicted and you hope to straighten him out hardy nodded with my decent legal mind at least identify the issues maybe which are he stopped walking and stepped out of the stream of foot traffic it was still chilly enough that his sigh produced a visible plume of vapor thats the problem i dont know fran ive been wracking my brain all day especially since i ran into dash logan connected with elaine which of course is coles case but im not convinced hes killed anybody and i really dont see any connection between elaine and rich mcneil none of it makes any sense none of it relates except for logan who seems to be in the middle of all of it well frannie said if abes got the doubts and now ridley and neither of them are exactly prodefense then maybe youd better start considering that cole is telling you the truth it wasnt unconsciousness he just happened upon her after somebody else did her she shrugged it could have happened could have happened doesnt meet much of a legal standard fran i cant argue that in front of a jury how about just a judge how about at the hearing hardy didnt even have to think he shook his head no the hearings a formality the standard is probable cause not reasonable doubt torrey demonstrates that and the confession alone ought to be enough on that score and thats it we go to trial i know i know but listen her eyes were alight with the idea theres something about this particular case thats causing all kinds of confusion even among you professionals right youve got to admit that i mean abe getting put on leave over it come on that is not normal now ridley banks agreeing to talk to you even you yourself and your decent mind decent legal mind the rest of its often pretty indecent ok still im saying you might be able to get a judge to feel that way too not a jury but one person if you could get all the questions out in front of one of them his eyes had turned inward a couple of times he seemed about to speak but the thread eluded him finally he looked at her the problem is fran that presupposes that he didnt do it after all and i think he did he put up a hand to stop her from breaking in im not saying he meant to i dont think he planned it maybe even as he did it he didnt get it but ill tell you something he sure had means motive and opportunity hes got the opposite of an alibi his voice was becoming harsh unyielding hes exactly the kind of pathetic loser who makes mistakes and ruins lives and then really truly wishes he hadnt done it maybe even to the point of believing his own lies but frankly i think he deserves to be punished for it not death not even life without since nobody else in san francisco gets it thats why i took the case at all but he ought to get a good long spell in the slammer during which maybe hell come to have a little bit of a clue but probably not probably not hardy agreed law of averages probably not so youre going to try for unconsciousness his eyes flashed impatiently and that fran would be a major triumph even if he didnt do it he did do it he says he didnt doesnt he everybody says they didnt smart lawyers dont even ask but if the best defense the law allows is proving he didnt kill elaine that hes telling the truth after all dont you have to try for that otherwise maybe you should give him to somebody else im not giving him to anybody else she let him live with that for a second when you talk to abe and ridley maybe you ought to really listen to what they say that was my actual plan believe it or not what did you think i was going to do she looked into his eyes her voice was gentle without any threat in it i thought you might be looking for something to argue not something to believe she rarely saw any sign of her husbands irish temper it surprised her that he was on the edge of losing it now over cole burgess it made no sense unless the boy had come to represent something beyond himself she reached a hand out and touched his arm whats going on dismas she asked im not looking for something to believe thats for sure his voice was harsh then what are you arguing against whats so terrifying whats so terrifying he snapped back how can you even ask me that thats what i want to know you cant envision our sweet little vin where cole is someday or even the beck you dont think thats terrifying she tightened her grip on his arm that isnt going to happen dismas that doesnt make any sense thats my damn point frannie it doesnt have to make any sense it just happens sometimes it just happens and suddenly the source of his terror was clear to her educated white middleclass raised by caring parents cole burgess was dismass own private vision of the devil the personification of everything he feared and could not control their own children might turn out just like cole if they werent ever vigilant with them and maybe even if they were and beyond that the dangers everywhere in the modern world the threat of random violence terror out of the dark night the tragedy inherent in every moment of temporary weakness why the struggle must never end not for an instant she lifted her hand up to touch his face and he backed off by all signs angry at her during his little speech his color had gone progressively to a deep red to the union street crowd it probably seemed that they were having a fight dismas she said softly he was furious tears of rage had come to his eyes and he was determinedly blinking them back she stepped into him put her arms around his back held him its all right she said everythings going to be all right it was old home week around abes bed again isaac had picked up jacob after his arrival from milan and the two of them came straight from the airport to the hospital nat and orel were already there the first time the whole family had been together in nearly two years there were only the five of them and that was just as well since the word was out about elaine there was a lot to talk about at a little before nine hardy and frannie showed up looking a bit the worse for wear they had both cheered slightly at the sight of jacob as they had with isaac the night before but after a while the edge between them appeared again it didnt help that hardy was expecting ridley banks to come and talk about cullen alsop and that he never appeared and with the boys and nat there it wasnt a good time to talk murder cases anyway by nine fortyfive everyone had gone home glitsky leaned back into his bed and closed his eyes tonight he was tired his groin throbbed where they had inserted the angiogram into his femoral artery the blisters on his chest mementos of the defibrillation itched uncomfortably they had him on some bloodthinning medication and he still felt wiped out from sedatives he fancied that he could feel his heart that the presence of all of his sons and his father tonight had filled it almost beyond its capacity early on before the hardys came and after the first flurry of questions and answers about elaine hed asked jacob if he would sing them all a song with his newlytrained italian voice then surprised him not by asking for anything from the opera repertoire but for unchained melody hed sung it so beautifully that the nursing staff and other visitors seeing patients had come into the room applauded when he finished the melody came back to him now it had been flos song but the image now was not of his past wife he opened his eyes grabbed his book took out treyas card and reached for the phone still in his scrubs jonas walsh commanded his own table in the st marys cafeteria his newspaper was spread out over every inch of the available surface area all the sections separated his tray held the remains of his midmorning snack the empty bowl that had held his mixed fruit the plate for the dry toast three empty juice glasses he sat back at some distance from the table an ankle resting on a knee he held his cup of coffee out at arms length for one man he took up a lot of room it was ten thirty in the morning and his four scheduled hernia surgeries had all gone without incident as they always did nevertheless his posture reflected a great deal of frustration he hated being out here but the idiot operating room schedulers had been unable to book in all his patients even though he had them lined up waiting thered been a couple of cancellations and the hospital hadnt been able to fill the damn time and when you only have two surgery days a week youd better make sure you pack them in but now instead of ten hernias today he had only eight which meant thirtytwo hundred dollars out the window plus he had to endure a muchdespised break for a couple of hours before he could start making more money with another four in the afternoon at this rate he was never going to pay off his loans at least youd think they could have moved up two of the late afternoon jobs let him get off early but no no thought he was going to complain to the administrator get somebody else on scheduling who had some kind of clue he finished sports and grabbed at the business section where he noticed that his stocks remained in the tank shaking his head in disgust he brought his cup to his lips sipped the coffee had gone tepid and he swore is this chair taken a large black man with a hatchet nose and a scar through his lips hovered on the far side of the table he stood casually his expression relaxed his hands resting in the pockets of his windbreaker he was in need of a shave and walsh thought he detected a slight pallor under the pigment an almost jaundiced quality to the whites of his eyes was the man sick whatever he wasnt welcome jonas looked around ostentatiously there were maybe ten other people in the entire room forty unoccupied tables all around him sorry im busy he said not here pal ok his eyes went back to his newspaper youre jonas walsh the man had taken the seat cleared a space on the table in front of him a dark glance im dr walsh thats right and i just told you im busy i can see that the man replied calmly and i could take out my badge and show it to you but maybe youd find that embarrassing walsh snapped the paper down stared for a while then youre glitsky thats right elaines father walsh fixed him with a challenging look i guess the words out howd you find out about it how do you think we didnt have secrets we were engaged you know you also might have heard that glitsky nodded thats why were talking right now and you were happy everything was fine with you both yes a pause of course he waited for glitsky to pursue it and when he didnt added some more sure why not no reason glitsky stared across at him he wore his most bland expression and it finally wore walsh down what the doctor asked what do you want what i want is to fill in a few blanks you know weve got a suspect in custody but we dont know why elaine was downtown at that time we dont know who she was meeting if our suspect knew her somehow a shrug all of that if you two didnt have any secrets from each other maybe you could help of course id like to help if i can walsh pursed his lips tightly cast his eyes briefly to the upper corners of the room came back to the lieutenant when he spoke hed found his professional courteous bedside voice im sorry if i was rude just now its been a difficult couple of weeks i would imagine so im sorry he took a minute so on the sunday the night she didnt come home did you expect her to be out late more or less yes i guess she called and left a message you werent in no we had breakfast in sausalito and then she went into work and i took a long bike ride over tamalpais back through lucas valley its the only exercise i get did you go with anybody walsh hated the question and seemed tempted to reply angrily but in the end he just shook his head with resignation no i went alone so you got back home tiburon right and there was a message what time was that when you got back five thirty or six just dusk and the message was that she wouldnt be home until after three in the morning the question slowed him down well no not specifically just that she had an appointment and shed be a little late where does three oclock come into this that was when we got around to notifying you glitsky made an effort in the direction of a smile she said shed be a little late though the doctor sat back again took a measured pause where are we going with this lieutenant glitsky thought it was a fair question well if you thought she was only going to be a little late and she didnt get in by say three surely walsh understood what he was driving at i would have called the police by then i would have been worried the question came up thats all walsh took another minute deciding whether or not he was going to answer any more stupid leading questions posed by the police when he did the frustration was back in his voice first i went to bed at nine thirty id ridden many many steep miles that day i was tired and had to work in the morning second elaines meetings often ran late sometimes very late so no i wasnt worried and she didnt say who she was meeting not then but i knew who she was meeting earlier in the day suddenly something else struck him you know it seems like this is an awfully long time after the fact to start asking these kinds of questions youre right if we didnt have a suspect wed have moved on it faster now were not really looking for anybody as i said were filling in blanks we might not need any of it its just gravy still wed like the case to be as tight as it can be does that make sense obviously good they were making progress glitsky brought his hands together a kind of clap of approval so the meeting earlier in the day who was that with you really dont know how would i know because it was you guys glitsky showed his surprise the police walsh explained about elaines special master duties on the russian insurance fraud case she had gone in with a team of police officers to serve a warrant on the law offices of dash logan on sunday a shrug evidently the first time theyd all come by logan had really been a pain he didnt want anybody looking at his files wouldnt tell elaine where anything was if he even knew why wouldnt he know because this according to elaine there wasnt any order to it elaine said shed never seen another law office like it ever she thinks she thought he must be on drugs or something logan glitsky shrugged a lot of people did drugs if they didnt kill people because of it it wasnt homicide and wasnt his job anyway walsh continued then they found another couple of these russian guys cases logan was handling they figured this time it would be easier to do the search while nobody was there but him so they woke him at his house brought him to the office and served the warrant they actually went to his office that sunday i dont know lieutenant i assume so that was the plan you could probably find out easier than me this was the truth and glitsky accepted it ruefully and you didnt hear from her again walsh bit down on his lower lip suddenly glitsky got some sense of emotion no just the last message you know its funny i havent been able to bring myself to erase it which was all well and good and perhaps sad glitsky reflected as he walked away from the table but all in all not as interesting as the fact that walsh had lied about the current state of his relationship with elaine he also had no alibi for the time of her murder on the other side of the cafeteria glitskys father and the two older boys were at their own table reading different sections of the newspaper glitsky got to them and pulled a chair around straddling it backward nat looked up not to nag abraham but maybe you want to sit like a normal person maybe now you go home and get in bed and rest enough already with talking to people on this thing glitsky looked at his kids not to nag he says back to nat its my job dad except last i heard they put you on leave am i wrong here tell me im wrong also tell me im wrong you had a heart attack three days ago maybe you noticed i noticed but ms ghent told me that he he pointed across at walsh that he worked here thursdays i was right here it was too good an opportunity to pass up besides they wouldnt let me out of here if i wasnt ok famous last words abraham dont worry this parachute opens every time glitsky threw a halfamused glance at his two boys both of whom had stopped reading to follow the exchange and enough with that look nat shook a finger at him that same look your mother had that she was ok too so she goes home and does a load of laundry and dies god forbid she dies with dirty clothes in the hamper abe held up a hand ok dad ok we go home nat nodded his head violently included the boys finally your father says a smart thing he pointed a finger at his son and rest a nod rest is good glitsky admitted although he had no inclination to get any acting on the information treya had given him last night about the doctor glitsky had called walshs office first thing and learned that he had a break in his surgery schedule it turned out that it coincided with the arrival of his father and sons with his clean clothes here to take him home glitsky had put on the clothes but didnt take the time to shave hospital rules mandated that they use a wheelchair to take him outside so they had wheeled him out the front door where hed stood up and turned around and walked back in to corner dr walsh his family in tow nat kvetching all the way now they were finally in the car isaac driving his father next to him in the passenger seat so how did that interview go he asked nat started to mutter an objection from the back seat but abe spoke through it pretty good he only told one little fib jacob interested leaned over from the back seat is that normal what that he told a lie or that he only told one nat still unhappy interjected again your fathers line of work nobody tells the truth i dont know how he stands it glitsky spoke over his shoulder are you kidding thats the best part but he really lied knowing you were a cop i mean hes not some criminal isaac said hes a doctor glitsky got a kick out of that theyve done experiments he said you can be both jacob piped in so did you call him on it not yet maybe never why not isaac asked if you tell a lie youre hiding something right a nod that would be the general rule jacob again well well you can call someone on a lie or you can catch someone in a lie and the second ones way more fun fun in the back seat nat sounded disgusted what do you know from fun abraham hardy had had enough of waiting for ridley banks to get back to him he was reasonably friendly with a fair number of homicide inspectors and not a one of them glitsky included had as his first priority a callback to a defense attorney but that didnt mean he couldnt pursue an investigation of his own he killed time at his office for an hour while he waited for the phone to ring then finally decided to walk the half mile or so down to the jail and the hall of justice when he got there force of habit made his first stop the homicide detail but without an appointment with banks and in glitskys absence the reception he got was a little bit cool inspector sergeant marcel lanier knew hardy fairly well but he was handling the administrative overflow left in glitskys wake and stuck at his desk he was neither a happy camper nor inclined to chat no he didnt know what was happening with abe but he hoped whatever it was wouldnt take too long no he hadnt heard from banks so what no doubt hed check in when he got far enough behind on his paperwork john strout the coroner was in the middle of an autopsy up to his elbows and couldnt see him either hardy left a message asking him to call when he could and walked across the corridor to the jails entrance where he couldnt make himself go inside he still tasted a kind of bitter residue from his ruined date night with frannie although he was certain that his client would be thrilled to have any visitor cole burgess was the last person he wanted to see he walked back through the hall out the other side and jaywalked across bryant street lou the greeks was a bar located there in the basement of a bailbondsmans building lous served food too for lunch since lous wife hailed from hong kong these were mostly chinesegreek combinations hot and sour lemon eggdrop soup egg rolls stuffed with hummus the culinary equivalent of colors not found in nature it was a dark and somber bar pure and simple its popularity now on the wane due to the young hip legal crowds attraction to loud jumping musicfilled meat markets such as jupiter and just down the street the circus today though still early in the morning and deserted except for lou behind the bar the place fitted hardys mood perfectly hey diz the bartender slid a napkin across the pitted wood hardy nodded ive got a question for you lou you want a drink while youre asking it no im good maybe some coffee he waited while the greek turned and poured a cup into an old ceramic mug came back and placed it on the napkin even in the dim light hardy could make out a faint lipstick stain on the rim cleanliness was never a big issue at lous he turned the cup around to drink from its pristine side nearly burned himself on the bitter brew lets say youre a lawyer lou crossed himself backwards smiling he said something but it was greek to hardy who pressed on youve got a client you think is guilty the evidence says hes guilty he the client even starts out by saying hes guilty he confesses to the cops now get this the cop who arrests him comes to you and says no wait i dont think the confessions any good then the other cop the one who took his confession he starts to have doubts this guy your client is he a hypnotist or something hes a heroin addict hes been known to take a drink too lou nodded my kind of guy not the heroin part though so whats your question wait im not there yet lou raised his eyes and scanned his dark and empty bar he raised his voice anybody need another round he came back to hardy ok ive got a couple more minutes but my rates are going up fast heres the problem my client is charged with robbery and murder i believe ive got a better than decent chance to get him off by arguing to a jury that he was too drunk or stoned or both to have planned to tie his shoes much less rob or kill anybody you with me lou guessed that he was okay but if i argue that best case he gets years in prison whereas if i argue that he didnt do it at all and the jury believes that he gets off completely the problem is no jury is going to believe it since ive got no alternative suspects hell i dont believe it myself lou a lifelong bartender knew that hardy wasnt drinking alcohol but he also knew that any conversation with even a sober customer that lasted over five minutes was somehow bad for business he cut back to the chase i hope were closing in on the question almost so im supposed to do whats best for my client give him the best defense the law allows now the question is what do i do lou cocked his head youre kidding me thats the question whats best for your client prison or walk out the door he jerked a thumb out the door no contest but ive got no chance to win i cant prove he didnt do it lou hadnt worked in the halls watering hole for a lifetime without picking up some rudimentary knowledge of the law i thought they had to prove he did do it they do well dont let em it doesnt matter what you believe besides ask your client hes not going to think prison is winning lou thought another minute picked up a glass from the counter under the bar and began to wipe it with his rag for the first time in the conversation hardy had the feeling that hed engaged his mind you got any idea what youre going to be doing in ten years diz if youre even going to be alive ten years nope lou nodded same with most people i bet hardy worked as a defense attorney but as he walked the second floor hallway in the public defenders office he felt very much out of place although it had been nearly a decade since hed been a young assistant da in his heart he still considered himself very much in favor of the prosecution if it wasnt for the politically misguided and extralegal idiocy of sharron pratt and her administration he had no trouble envisioning himself working hard and long to put bad people behind bars here in the public defenders building however two blocks from the hall of justice the ethic was the diametrical opposite just walking to saul westbrooks office gave hardy a strong sense of unreality as though hed suddenly made a turn into an alternative universe it seemed to extrude from the very plaster in the walls it shouted from every bumper sticker cartoon or poster on the doors and bulletin boards hes not guilty until you prove it strikes bad law no victim no crime alternative sentencing works the vibe hardy thought so different from his own it was disorienting from lous hed gone back to the hall and discovered the name of cullen alsops lawyer saul westbrook had been in his office when he called him and said sure come on up now he knocked at the open door the office was about the same size as those of his prosecutorial counterparts over in the hall of justice ten by twelve feet crammed with two desks overflowing file cabinets cardboard boxes bulging with threering binders metal bookshelves to the ceiling mr westbrook he was the only person in the room the other desk was empty westbrook didnt look as though he was old enough yet to shave he wore blue jeans and tennis shoes a white shirt with a collar but no tie and either had just won the masters golf tournament or had his own green jacket from another source he looked up stood extended his hand saul dismas hardy dismas so were both named after a couple of early christian saints huh hardy cracked a grin i think my guy was first i think youre right saul had an open angular face with a sincere smile a shock of surferlength blond hair flopped across his forehead the smile faded briefly maybe between us we can try to put a word in to god about poor cullen hardy was tempted to like him right away but he couldnt duck the truth ill need to wait until i find out if poor cullen screwed my client before he died cole burgess westbrook said and it wasnt a question the expressive face seemed to sadden i dont think he did you think he had the gun i dont know why would he make it up burgess was a friend of his hardy wanted to tell westbrook to give him a break the list of good works by addicts to protect or save their friends was short indeed in his experience addicts did not have friends in the usual meaning of the word they had sources but no friends but he didnt wish to antagonize westbrook so he was matter of fact maybe somebody made it up for him and it got him his or out of jail on his own recognizance so he could stay high thats why the idea was distasteful and saul shook his head who would have done that im his lawyer if i was sharp and crooked i might have dreamed up something like that but im the only one who would have been motivated and im not and i didnt how about someone who wanted to strengthen the case against cole burgess but that would behe stopped then spoke carefully one of the das hardy shrugged its torreys case but that would mean if cullen was killed the young mans voice trailed off it was the kind of moment hardy knew that would eventually put some age on sauls face its a long shot hardy admitted i dont have any idea if cullen was an accident or a suicide or what he was i was hoping you might have an opinion they shared a look saul sat back in his chair picked a paper clip off his desk opened it up you know ridley banks i talked to him last night a nod he came by yesterday asking about the same thing which for a cop i thought was a little weird what did he say to you but here hardy was stymied hed had the impression ridley was going to tell him something about his suspicions but with the noshow he never did he kept it pretty vague hardy could do vague too but i got the strong impression the coincidence made him nervous the discussion was threatening westbrooks world view and his reply came out sounding defensive but coincidences do happen spoken like a true defense lawyer hardy thought but he said undoubtedly this would be a particularly unlucky coincidence for my client though so id like to be a little more sure it was one im waiting for banks to get back to me now which im sure he will but listen in the meanwhile if you dont mind i wanted to ask you how this whole plea thing came down at sauls dubious look hardy prodded i dont see how it can hurt your client now the face softened youre right still working the paper clip he rocked back in his chair actually the first i heard of it i got a call from cullen from the jail and it was already pretty much a done deal this was over the weekend he just remembered yeah maybe monday so hed been in jail how long on his own thing westbrook came forward now opened a black calendar book on his desk and leafed through it briefly he was arrested on the second his expression became confused so he started trying to cut the deal on i guess the eighth six days in jail hardy said i wonder what made him think about it or more to the point made him forget it for so long thats a good question has he ever snitched before howd he know who to go to howd he know the gun was the missing link in my case suddenly the young mans face looked miserable i dont know he said at last i think youve got to talk to banks they dropped nat off at the synagogue where he liked to spend his mornings after that isaac drove them home where glitsky climbed into bed and told the boys they should go out and enjoy the city theyd have dinner together tonight maybe rita could whip up some of her famous enchiladas as soon as the door closed after them he was out of bed he shaved and changed into slightly stylish clothes pressed slacks a beige merino collared sweater tasseled brown loafers then he called a cab and took it downtown arriving at rand and jackman well before noon at elaines office he knocked treya sat behind a stack of files piled high on the desk checking her watch she looked up in surprise it cant be lunchtime already then apparently concerned for him how are you feeling im moving a little slow but im moving she tilted her head fetchingly to one side are you sure youre all right being out like this he made light of it i dont think its much more strenuous than laying in my bed he pulled up a folding chair and sat in it see i walk a few feet and sit back down dont even break a sweat i could do this all day shed hung the gray jacket to her business suit over the back of her chair she was wearing a thin gold chain around her neck gold stud earrings a sleeveless teal silk blouse and under it he couldnt help but notice a black bra he felt the beating of his heart under the circumstances both comforting and scary last night on the phone they had discussed elaine and the case both pretending that there was nothing personal in abe calling her at home at ten oclock then just before they hung up treya had said if youre not feeling well enough tomorrow promise me youll stay there dont feel like you have to come down to the office just because you said you would but then i wont see you i could call and tell you what ive found thats not what i meant there had been a long pause after which in a different tone shed whispered i know i know what you meant but first you need to take care of yourself thats my plan its a good one stick to it yes maam then shed added please abe if you need to stay there longer you can just call me and ill come all right now a foot away from her his arm resting on the desk between them he wanted to say something personal how nice she looked how grateful hed been for her visit for talking to him last night the scent she was wearing but he found he couldnt take the step it was too soon too uncertain too perilous instead he straightened up his back against the back of his chair i did connect with jonas walsh by the way at st marys you talked to him two hours ago he seemed to think he and elaine were doing fine her brow clouded she pursed her lips well thats not he told me i dont think thats true i dont either now that they were on his business talking came more easily but i dont know it means anything maybe hes convinced himself they were going to get back together so nobody needs to know but he told me youre different you were a friend im a cop plus he didnt know id talked to you it might be something but by itself it isnt much not as much for example as the fact that he had no alibi for the time of her death you told me that elaine had this appointment sunday night after which she was going home do you remember that thats what she said ok did you get any idea at all that the appointment might have been with walsh that then they would go home together she reflected for only a second no i dont think so it was somebody else dash logan maybe she shook her head i doubt it she really wanted to avoid him when she got back from his office she told me how glad she was he had been in better shape than the first time how the search was so much easier he still refused to help but she didnt even have to talk to him glitsky drummed his fingers on the desk and theres nothing in her calendar no she touched his hand for an instant then quickly instantly pulled hers back i would have told you frustration was written all over her she just said she had a meeting then she was going home thats all she said but when we first talked you said you thought she was a little detached maybe yes a little but i dont know what from it could have been anything he indicated the mass of stuff on the desk so hows all this coming im only just starting on the gs g maybe she had a file on me meaning it as a joke she did she raised her eyebrows and gave him a halfsmile then rummaged for a minute found what she wanted and handed over the thin manila folder glitsky opened it up and was startled to see an eight by ten glossy of himself a copy of his police academy graduation photo he couldnt believe hed ever been so young where had elaine ever gotten her hands on this glitsky didnt even have one himself as though reading his mind treya said she was pretty good at getting what she wanted he nodded dumbly behind the photo there was an envelope and he removed the letter from it and scanned it quickly it was from her mother delivered after her death informing elaine of her true paternity refolding the letter he put it back where it had been then there were twenty or more clippings cut from the newspaper the few times in his career that glitsky had been hailed as a hero his promotion to lieutenant and head of homicide various community involvement moments including one featuring glitsky as a private citizen standing as the proud father with his arm draped around a beaming orel when his son was chosen pop warner player of the month a year ago glitsky was the coach of orels team the same picture still hung on the bulletin board in their kitchen it was more than strange to see it here in this setting here was a picture of himself and elaine together seated at the head table at gino and carlos during a champion of the people roast theyd had when art drysdale had left the das office a couple of years back abe looked up quickly flashes of that night coming back to him it had been the closest hed come to telling her since the first days after her mother had died he remembered theyd laughed a lot for glitsky a rare enough event in itself funny there was gabe torrey on the other side of elaine abe had no memory of his presence but that wasnt really surprising hed only just come on as chief assistant and abe had had few dealings with him to that point also with elaine next to him he wasnt much aware of anyone else closing the folder he let out a long breath well this time when treya put her hand over his she left it lets go have lunch she said god real food they were reading the menu at the window bar at glitskys favorite deli davids an old nofrills establishment on geary he looked at treya you ever wonder what they do to food in the hospital to give it that special bland quality its a secret spice she didnt miss a beat that makes everything taste like cardboard its really good for you promotes healing ten ways but tastes awful a shrug they tested it on mice she said they loved it and this is why health food tastes like cardboard only the real good stuff she said the rest is pretty bad glitsky chuckling was back at the menu theres nothing i can eat here anymore you wouldnt believe the list of what im supposed to avoid from now on she looked over at him i would bet the chicken soup here is good and thats what he decided upon along with a toasted bagel no butter and a slice of kosher pickle she ordered a pastrami and coleslaw on rye and to drink the waitress asked ill have a celery soda treya said wait a minute sitting back glitsky nearly fell off his stool you cant order celery soda i was going to order celery soda treya patted his hand i bet they have more than one no glitsky said what i mean is that nobody i know drinks celery soda well you know somebody now the waitress put in her two cents actually its fairly popular ive never had one myself but im sure weve got tons in the back see treya was smiling triumphantly tons then to the waitress were living large today can we get a whole bottle each you might even try one yourself theyre really pretty good by two fifteen hardy had left a message with dash logan to call him hed left another message with ridley banks a callback at any old time would be fine glitsky at home strout even torrey to ask for further discovery in burgess specifically any transcripts that might have come in on the cullen alsop interviews with the police or with prosecutors since it appeared that no one was ever going to call him again he decided to get some work done in his office he did have other clients after all so he reviewed some documents in a few of these cases reached his party three phone calls in a row and decided to run a victory lap down the stairs and across the lobby to the coffee machine the phone rang stopping him before hed reached the door he crossed his office in a couple of strides and picked it up before it rang a second time diz david he said whats up i wondered if you could spare me a minute have you cleared it with phyllis shell be holding the door open for you ill be right down phyllis was not in fact manning the door but she waved him by the reception area with barely so much as a glance when hardy entered the office he saw that freeman wasnt alone there was some kind of associates meeting in progress hardy knew all three of them although none of them very well jon ingalls amy wu curtis rhodin since freeman didnt offer partnerships in his firm his associates didnt tend to stick around for long they did however tend to work like slaves and learn a lot of law in very little time the old man cleared his throat ive made a decision about the burgess matter he began in a gruff tone but ill need your permission before i proceed hardy glanced at the associates back to his landlord im listening heres the situation im beginning to believe that this case is going to dominate the news once it gets to court i know that after the hearing youll be handling the guilt phase in california a capital case such as this had two components a guilt phase and a penalty phase typically each phase had its own different lawyer the lawyer in the penalty phase was termed keenan counsel after the appeals decision that had created the precedent freeman was going on i want to offer my services as keenan counsel with the profile the case has already achieved the advertising value alone is priceless i want to be involved hardys fondest dream had been to ask freeman to fill this role all along if it came to it hed hesitated up to this point because of money jody burgess had retained him not freeman to represent cole and freemans standard rates were nearly double his own nearly triple for courtroom time jody could never afford him and now the citys most famous lawyer was volunteering for the cases advertising value not that hardy for a minute believed advertising was the reason but hed certainly accept it thats a generous offer david he said ill take it under advisement freeman kept up the charade i do have one demand i will insist on using my own able associates to help investigate factor k elements if any this included other potential suspects or anything else that might produce lingering doubt in a sentencing jury they can be under your immediate supervision and direction but their time will be charged to the firm for my administrative oversight he kept it up straightfaced a sales pitch i really believe this partnership could be beneficial to both of us diz its just too good a business opportunity to pass up i hope you agree hardy glanced at the young and eager associates the three musketeers apparently ready to go to work immediately he nodded i think i could live with it he said glitsky went back to rand and jackman with treya after their lunch and spent the afternoon looking through miles of files near the end of the day he checked his messages at home got hardys and called him at his office treya had a meeting with jackman planned for after close of business and hardy volunteered to swing by and drive glitsky home which he was doing now abe wasnt in high spirits i am such a horses ass ive been telling you that for years but he didnt come back at him with some clever riposte and this was worrisome whatever it was it had gotten under abes skin at the moment though it was difficult for hardy to feel anything but pumped up if not elated then at least thoroughly heartened but enough about you he said cheerily i want to talk about this incredible offer do you realize if we need to now we can interrogate half the state i dont think half the state hated elaine hardy stopped at a red light and looked across the seat ok what nothing oh right nothing lets see why this doesnt scan youre trying to carry on your own investigation without manpower money or time we just get given about a hundred grand worth of our own damn dream team and yet and yet youre even less than your usual cheerful self which isnt much to begin with glitsky looked over at him it bothers you so much you can let me out here ill get a cab im not asking you to be wildly enthusiastic but youve got to admit that this is a positive development im thrilled abe said honest the light changed and hardy moved ahead its the woman isnt it her names treya he could barely say it shes with jackman idiot that i am i thought he was married oh then it couldnt be married men dont have affairs i forgot abe was brooding and hardy tired of it decided to let him but after a few blocks he spoke again how do you know did you ask her i didnt have to it was obvious so one of them was wearing a sign one of those sandwich board things maybe glitsky nodded might as well have he paused were sitting in the window at davids and jackman comes walking by down geary he sees her and they both light up like christmas trees he comes inside shes off her stool next to him then its like oh yeah this is that cop i was telling you about jackman sticks around orders a sandwich then after i leave tonight shes off to his office obvious hardy said another shrug you had to be there i was at the hospital the other night i thought that was obvious too a glance what me and her well we both read it wrong then if you say so but if it were me and it mattered even a little id ask her theyd come out along california street and were getting to the turn for glitskys block how am i supposed to do that what am i supposed to say shes with him ok hardy repeated making the turn fine she is im not arguing with you i hope theyre happy he pulled up in front of abes duplex turned in his seat you pick up the telephone dial her number asks if she wants to go to dinner or something we call this a date if shes involved with somebody else she says no if she likes you she says yes its a simple concept even in your enfeebled state i think you can grasp it glitsky shook his head disagreeing weve got to work together in the next few weeks diz it would be too awkward shell say no anyway and i wouldnt blame her but you never know and you wont if you dont ask hardy saw that abe was suffering with it and his voice softened you know how you told me the other night how you wished youd talked to elaine when you had the chance that was different only in the sense that everything is different from everything else its also a lot the same i know its not your preferred means of communicating but talking isnt so bad once in a while whats she going to do laugh at you i dont think so worst case shell be flattered you asked he brought a palm down on the arm rest between them all right thats my spiel im done you want me to swing by in the morning for another beat glitsky didnt move then he bobbed his head and pulled the latch for his door out in the street he leaned back in ok hardy had a small patch of grass in front of his house it grew behind a white picket fence and was bordered on the back by a flower garden that they tried to keep up even during the winter months a short walkway bisected the lawn and led up to an inviting porch his house was the only singlefamily dwelling on the block and its curb appeal to hardy was enormous tonight though after the fourblock walk in the fogbound darkness from the nearest parking place hed been able to find he considered tearing out the whole thing and paving it over he really thought he might do it except of course that the downside other than loss of his lawn was that someone someday would park in his own private spot maybe even by mistake it wouldnt matter hardy would have to kill him the porch lights were on as were those in the front window their living room he opened his door smelled the oak fire burning in his fireplace put his heavy briefcase down daddy rebecca came flying out around the corner and had her arms around him then vincent nearly knocking him over he enfolded them both in his arms dragged them laughing a few steps roughhousing frannie was coming up the hallway with a glass of wine in one hand and what looked suspiciously like a martini in the other what did i do he asked as it turned out hed done nothing special frannie had lit the fire and the kids were laying on the floor in front of it writing up their valentines day cards for everyone in each of their classes shed called out for chinese food which would be there any minute so she wasnt cooking shed like a glass of wine if her husband got home at his normal time she thought hed enjoy a martini too handing him the glass she kissed him sometimes it just works it continued to work the phone didnt ring once the dinner arrived punctually and was delicious neither rebecca nor vincent had any kind of crisis and they were both in bed by nine thirty the name cole burgess never came up in the age of mangled care dr campion proved himself extraordinary he had called three times during the day and receiving no answer finally got worried enough to decide to see for himself he got to abes duplex at a little after dark it turned out that he made about one house call a week the three boys and nat were already home which made all the glitskys except the one he wanted to see the doctor was probably more angry than all of them but it was close campion couldnt believe his patient wasnt home but when that message finally made its way through he reiterated his instructions underlining them for everyones benefit this was no joke hed released abe from the hospital yes but he wasnt out of danger his instructions had been that glitsky could walk around inside his house but should take it easy and avoid all stress there were no circumstances the doctor could imagine that could justify abe being outside presumably stressing about a murder case the walk down his twelve front steps alone his heart had been seriously weakened the muscle damaged it was still not clear how badly there was a reasonable chance of another serious even fatal attack he should religiously be taking the blood thinning medication that was on the table next to his bed its seal unbroken campion waited around for half an hour then finally left his cellphone number and left when abe did finally walk in the door it was to the riot act they all wanted to know what he thought he was doing did he want to die nobody considered that what hed done was even remotely defensible they spent fifteen minutes repeating all of dr campions horror stories then marched him into his room where they watched him take his pills made him get into bed much to everyones surprise he admitted to complete exhaustion and fell asleep almost immediately the rest of the family had a powwow in the kitchen and decided that theyd spell each other keeping an eye on him he wasnt going anywhere not without the doctors permission frannie kissed him you might not be as good as you once were but youre as good once as you ever were it was sometime a little after ten they were in their relatively new upstairs bedroom it gave them privacy they would have considered unimaginable in the old configuration of rooms theirs adjoining their two childrens downstairs now they still might not be able to scream with rapture but the occasional sound of pleasure could occur without it being followed by one of the kids knocking at the door asking if they were ok did somebody get hurt thank you i think he took her earlobe between his lips and gave it a tug youre not so bad yourself then after a moment quietly youre my one they lay contentedly in spoon fashion for a while then when her breathing had become regular he kissed her again extricated himself and turned onto his other side the last embers crackled in the bedroom fireplace he closed his eyes somewhere far away a siren screamed it was coming closer abruptly his heart racing he sat up and threw off the covers it wasnt a siren it was the phone on the desk across the room frannie still asleep shifted behind him made some noise he got to it before it rang again yo mr hardy this is jon ingalls it took a moment one of his new team the clock in front of him read whats up jon im in the car now i just left jeff elliots his house yeah he was talking about quitting hes super pissed quitting what the paper what for ingalls told him this afternoon the democrat had come out with a story suggesting that when cole had been staying with jeffs family he had undoubtedly used heroin there in jeffs presence if not with him it was the most crass and unsubstantiated attack ridiculous to anyone who knew jeff but the chronicles editor parker whitelaw had called jeff right in he wasnt to write another word on the burgess case jeff had tried to explain that his connection to cole was aboveboard and strictly as family whitelaw didnt care jeffs credibility as an objective reporter he said was compromised with this kind of accusation in the citys political atmosphere a simple denial wasnt going to be enough there would have to be some show at least of an investigation the entire future of his column might be in jeopardy anyway ingalls went on jeff thinks pratt set this up i think id agree with him so whats he going to do he doesnt know hardy sat holding the phone getting involved with this case seemed to be bad for job security first abe now jeff it was intriguing maybe even a little scary mr hardy ingalls asked i didnt wake you up just now or anything did i hardy laughed are you kidding i was just suiting up for my midnight run halfway to morning hardy was still awake the das interference in what was increasingly becoming every part not just of the burgess case but of what seemed like his whole life had become a real issue now sitting downstairs at the kitchen table he was writing names and drawing circles and arrows on a legal pad mcneil torrey alsop burgess logan elaine he wasnt anywhere near yet to taking notes it was all too ephemeral still he looked down at the paper and wrote another name freemans girlfriends client abby oberlin had definitely received a settlement offer from torrey and that settlement would profit logan but so what lawyers profited from settlements every day except that logan was also connected to elaine and therefore to cole and since logan represented manny gait he was involved with mcneil too god hardy wished that logan had been cullen alsops lawyer but that had been that nice kid this morning westbrook he didnt know what it would mean logan knowing cullen but the symmetry of it was appealing as hell reluctantly he drew a line through cullens name another thought struck him and he hastily scratched out his own clients name if as appeared to be the case they were working on the assumption that cole was innocent mcneil oberlin torrey elaine logan it was a small town circling back on itself rather like a noose isaac glitsky was adamant hes not going out anywhere doctors orders but yesterday yesterday jacob interjected from behind his brother he snuck out made believe he was going to bed sent us out to have a nice day then went out and tried to kill himself can you believe that hardy nodded sounds like your father hes been asleep for twelve hours isaac said his body wants to recover even if he doesnt hardy was confused i thought he told me i mean they let him out to go home maybe putter around in the house avoid stress thats all isaac had his arms crossed over his chest let me guess he left that part out he said he was fine cleared ready to rock and roll which he is not jacob said maybe in a week maybe the older brother wasnt making any promises the hearts got to heal before he stresses it again youd think that would occur to him youd think so hardy agreed he shook his head frustrated i love your father but the man can be a moron tell him i said so then sit on him if you have to glitsky might be reluctant to call treya but hardy had no problem with it it had occurred to him that since everybody was essentially working to the same end it made sense that everyone do it in the same place hed called her at rand and jackman first thing this friday morning and she had agreed shed be delighted to come to his offices and help facilitate the work of the associates she might even have some ideas of her own hardy told her hed be happy to use them amy wu stood an inch over five feet tall she had large enough breasts so that people rarely noticed the bit of thickness at her waist halfchinese and halfblack she had an unusual and extraordinarily compelling face under a small and flattened nose her sensuous lips might have been collagened but were not her complexion was dark honey smallpored unlined she was twentysix years old and had never bought a drink in her life without someone asking for her identification there was a heaviness to the lids under dark brown almost liquid eyes although she was rarely taken for an asian thick straight shining black hair cascaded a few inches past her shoulders at the office she dressed in a womans business suit but today she was in jeans and hiking boots a black turtleneck sweater shed already spoken to five students who had been in elaines moot court class they had all directed her to a single student muhammed malouf adek was more than happy to talk to her as what young man would not be he was sitting on the floor in one of the hallways at hastings a book open on his legs he was eating an apple amy hovered over him until he looked up what are you studying she asked smiling down in fifteen minutes they were in the cafeteria she told him a version of the truth about who she was and the general reason she was here to talk about elaine it didnt seem to bother him people say that you and she were close at one time he shrugged she was my teacher id understood it was a little more than that her eyebrows went up ingenuously all right they have a mentor program here i signed up for that i was doing poorly in my other courses muhammed looked at her with a kind of challenge in his eyes she pegged his age at perhaps a year older than she was maybe he was even thirty which was slightly old for a law student but his eyes were too bright too hard and piercing his beard was short extremely thick almost like wool his teeth were white but very uneven and his hygiene was poor he hadnt washed his hair in a while his jeans looked as though they would stand up by themselves it appeared hed worn the brown shirt for most of the week and you became friends i dont know about that we did not go out amy wrinkled up her face confusion all over it he couldnt take his eyes off her whats the matter only that ive heard differently i wanted to talk to somebody who knew elaine pretty well and if thats not you she made to get up he gripped her arm above the wrist we had coffee a few times he said but there wasnt anything between us realizing what hed done he released his grip what do you want to know about elaine for anyway she was not what she pretended to be and what was that he hesitated decided against answering muhammed she said youve heard she died last week havent you he nodded it was the will of allah well yes but it was maybe a little more than that somebody killed her he sat up abruptly that was not me they arrested that other man i know no one is saying it was you im not saying that she smiled again please muhammed were just talking all right but what are we talking about were talking about who she was she leaned in closer to him we were thinking of some kind of a memorial maybe a statue something like that it will be very nice out in the lobby as a tribute to her to elaine amy realized that treya had chosen a perfect cover story for them clearly infuriated muhammeds eyes were burning yes elaine but you know its political we would not want to go to all that trouble and expense if there was some embarrassing if she she was a whore a liar and a whore she believed in nothing well surely he slammed the table all around the room other students looked up startled out of their studies muhammed was oblivious of it she pretended to be coming to islam i would read from the koran and she would nod pretending yes she would say thats interesting thats good but it was all false she was white inside she sold her body for their money for her doctors money there was spittle on muhammeds lips his breath came in ragged little gulps when was the last time you saw her she was here he rasped she was always here here at the school yes but i mean alone did you see her alone after she got engaged i told her she had to stop it was all a lie she was tormenting me stop what you mean call off her marriage no teaching here coming here that was tormenting you he nodded every time i saw her i knew she was laughing at me that i had believed her i told her she had to stop when was this this new semester just now he gripped her hand again so hard that it hurt her you must not make this thing this memorial she was a whore she was laughing at allah and of course the eyes the eyes were crazy he laughed that is what happened you know he put an end to that abe are you all right im under house arrest my boys dismas said you were in bed that would be accurate but the prescription wasnt bed rest the doctor just doesnt want to see me out walking the streets but hed actually like me to move around a little here but today your heart is pumping away even as we speak im sorry i didnt call you earlier myself i just woke up thats a long sleep its almost eleven oclock are you sure youre ok something else didnt happen did it no nothing happened really really how are we doing on our work its moving along but im not calling about that im calling about you im fine this is routine honest a couple more days and im dancing but not till the doctor says so ok my jailers will see to that but you yourself me myself too would you promise me i promise it seemed forever before she spoke again all right then she said all right treya knew that jonas walsh took friday afternoons off so she had called him at home thursday night to prevail upon him to let somebody from the firm come by the condo he and elaine had shared in tiburon and look at elaines things the next day she wasnt demanding as a matter of law but requesting as a favor as a friend elaine might have left something lying around that might prove useful to their investigation he didnt like it but the question of what he was going to do with elaines belongings was still unresolved and treya knew that after his apology in the r j offices here last week that she had some leverage hed let them look she was right but that didnt mean he had to be pleasant about it walsh shook hands perfunctorily with curtis rhodin but made no effort to try to be friends this is a total waste of some very valuable time treya had briefed rhodin about what to expect from walsh in any event it was unlikely the greeting would have thrown curtis who was no wimp off his stride he exuded confidence and savoirvivre at sixthree he towered over the other man there was no sign of fat on his body although he carried two hundred pounds to walshs one seventy the charcoal brioni suit had set him back nine hundred dollars but he fitted into it so perfectly that it might have been his daytoday lounging attire his face was long and slender his eyes somber if modigliani had painted men rhodin could have been one of his subjects if youve got somewhere else you need to be doctor ill be fine here on my own they were in a large bright living room with sparse almost antiseptic modern furnishings and floortoceiling windows the condo was set on a hillside overlooking the yacht harbor the sun was out brightly here twentyfive miles north of the city and from where they stood in the living room the panorama was breathtaking the marin headlands and mount tamalpais on the right angel island and the graceful though largely unsung richmond bridge in front of them a glittering whitecapped bay under a robins egg sky this is beautiful rhodin said i couldnt get any work done if i lived here this isnt where i work the doctor replied and i hope the view wont be too distracting today i dont really understand all this continuing investigation into elaines murder theyve got her killer in jail for christs sake id like to see an end to it rhodin nodded understandingly and tried to sound prosecutorial were on the same page then but we need to make sure some surprise doesnt come up during the trial to tell you the truth i dont even know what im supposed to be looking for if youve got other plans thats fine but if not and youd like to show me where to look it might move the process along reluctantly walsh led him into the back of the condo past the gourmet kitchen a granite countertop with dishes piled on it more dishes stacked in the sink a strong odor of garbage there was an office to his left down a short hallway two desks two computers some file cabinets the bedroom was a few steps further along on the right and walsh showed him in he hadnt made the bed and made no apology for it thats her closet he said pointing the near one is her dresser ill be in the office left alone rhodin went to work in spite of what hed told walsh he had received a reasonably specific laundry list from hardy and glitsky the day before mostly it was stuff hed expect to find in the office a rolodex file maybe or old checkbooks and financial records perhaps a diary but there might be something elsewhere it was worth looking everywhere curtis rhodin was a methodical man he had known elaine only slightly she was older and a partner at rand and jackman and light years from him on many levels and it felt strange to be going through her things but he knew what he was supposed to do and he was going to do it she had a lot of dresses thirty pairs of shoes there was a smaller builtin set of drawers in her closet containing sweaters blouses exercise clothes at the bottom of the lowest one under a pile of sweatshirts he found a smallish flat white box taking it out and opening it up he recognized it for what it was elaines collection of meaningless memorabilia from her past rhodin smiled to himself he had a similar stash himself although his was a cigar box in which he kept twenty or thirty stupid items that he just couldnt bring himself to discard a jade rock he got diving off big sur a guitar pick from a bb king concert hed gone to in college his first pocketknife a diamond tie tack in case they ever came back in style a signed willie mays rookie year baseball card junk but priceless junk elaines box wasnt all that different really considering she was a woman there were several pins for various political campaigns her mothers chris lockes sharron pratts a mans college ring a garter a caliber bullet a packet of business cards with a rubber band around them many coins from different foreign countries he closed the box back up this was coming back with him a framed picture of elaines mother rested on top of her dresser next to the lamp in the drawers he found underwear socks foldables condoms the top right drawer however contained nothing at all and this straightened rhodin up in surprise he walked across to the office and asked walsh if he could come in for a minute sighing putting down his magazine the doctor labored up and followed him do you know what she kept in this drawer curtis asked walsh looked shrugged i guess not much did you just take something out of it no it was like this was it always like this another shrug i dont know i didnt go through her drawers no of course not rhodin said but there was nothing at all in this one that seems a little odd doesnt it i dont know walsh repeated i didnt take anything out of it but it sure seemed like he might have he was back now at freemans office in the solarium reporting to treya and amy hed eventually left tiburon with a cardboard box now about a quarter filled with what hed collected from the office and the rest of the house including a copy of the koran and of course the white memento box on a whim at the last moment hed also thrown in the framed photograph of loretta wager but it was the empty drawer that had captured his interest any of you guys have a completely empty dresser drawer drawers dont get empty amy said they get full about ten minutes after you move in someplace then too full its a law of nature he must have cleaned it out treya disagreed he would never have done that and left it empty knowing we were coming to look through her things he would have put something back in before we got there rhodin had his own suggestion maybe he didnt really imagine that it would make any impression i mean it was just an empty drawer doesnt mean anything no treya was sure of it if he emptied it he would have remembered and it would have seemed significant then she emptied it amy said elaine they were all with their thoughts a moment treya finally spoke up if she was leaving him if theyd had a fight and she walked out one night she might have just taken a handful of underwear ive got another one rhodin said in the bathroom she had a couple of months worth of birth control pills but in her dresser she had maybe a dozen condoms amy had an answer for that so she really didnt want to get pregnant or she wasnt being faithful rhodin said treya looked at both of them or she knew he wasnt dash logan the lawyer looked up from the newspaper he was reading which happened to be the democrat jupiter was beginning to hop in the long slide of a friday afternoon but he was sitting alone in his usual back booth a bowl of pretzels on the table next to him a half full glass of beer growing warm at his elbow the look on his face was welcoming untroubled you got me he ran his eyes down the man whod addressed him extended his hand and youd be mr hardy i presume dismas was that the name dismas still is hardy took the hand a firm grip and slid in across from him you are one tough man to get a hold of logan nodded sympathetically i hear that a lot sorry i must be having some kind of midlife crisis or something my motivations just gone in the toilet i got your calls though thats nice i was starting to think the phones werent working didnt i say you could always get me here yes you did well then he flashed a smile it seemed genuine enough hardy didnt have to remind himself though that the greatest con men oozed sincerity it was their stock in trade hey listen let me buy you a beer for your trouble if its any consolation i would have called you monday but i figure now friday afternoon nobodys in when you call them anyway itll wait for the weekend right he raised a hand flagging the bartender wally a couple of cold ones see voo play what do you drink dismas hardy made an apologetic gesture ive got to stick with water i see a client at five and they wouldnt want their lawyer to have a drink in the afternoon i hear you wally just one and some of that stuff fish fuck in a grin back at hardy you know ill tell you thats why i stopped working out of my office whys that dash why cause when clients come to an office they see the trappings you know youve got the secretary and the law library and the phones and all that shit which is just what it is shit and they get so they expect the rest of the package that goes with it hey thanks wally heres looking at you dismas he held up his new glass of beer and touched hardys glass so anyway im not that guy used to try to be but it didnt work so people would come in with these expectations and id dash em they wanted a different kind of lawyer and god knows theres enough of em but if they want me and a lot of folks do they can come down and meet me here and they know what theyre getting no frills maybe but no bullshit either and most of em end of the day they go away happy so his limpid blue eyes fixed hardy over the rim of his beer glass im assuming youve reconsidered on settling with mcneil actually not hardy sat back and enjoyed dashs reaction the quick snap in the mellow facade a blink of an eye then the impressive return to how hed been im here on another matter entirely do you know a kid named cullen alsop logan appeared to think about it some cop banks i think his name was was asking about him in here the day before yesterday od wasnt it yeah looks like so this boy alsop logan asked was he your client no hardy said my clients cole burgess if the name registered logan didnt show it elaine wager his face fell oh elaine logan had sympathy down pat he clucked such a shame about her it was hardy agreed though id understood the two of you had had some problems no noth the smile you dont mean that special master thing that was nothing to do with elaine really i heard she might have taken it that way he shook his head back and forth no that was all for the benefit of the cops they call me down here the police do no no my office i thought you didnt have an office hey what am i stupid no i keep an office i just dont use it much so anyway im down here having a couple of brewskis my girl calls all in a panic the cops are there they got a warrant theyre doing a search well i go a little ballistic and whos gonna blame me hardy lifted his shoulders ambiguously so im smack in the middle of something in the female line here and ive got to run uptown rush hour time i get there im not feeling my most cooperative now patsy my girl she makes a nice presence at the door you know what im saying but shes a little weak on the business side filing stuff like that so i say to the search party fine youre showing me this kind of respect youre treating me like im vermin you can go find the shit yourselves he wore his apologetic look again his voice back to calm and reasonable so thats all it was with elaine she got in the middle of it that was all nother couple of weeks i would have gotten back to her and told her i was sorry if she hadnt gotten herself shot the recitation seemed to tire him out his expression went strangely blank then he recovered grabbed a pretzel picked up his beer glass and drank but howd we get on elaine you were asking about the od cullen right cullen ok and the guy who killed elaine your client cole burgess cullen snitched him out he was the source of the murder weapon and im supposed to know these guys how do you get to that i dont really i went by the hall today to see if i could get my hands on some early discovery on cullen since coles prelim is next week cullen had a matchbook from here on him yeah thats what banks said hardy shrugged youd told me you hung out here i thought there was a chance you might have known him logan couldnt believe it dismas turn around would you hardy did how many people you see here hardy did a quick count thirtyfive forty thats about right logan popped another pretzel at four oclock you know how many people are jammed in here come nine or ten you cant take a deep breath cause theres no room to put it so the odds of me knowing one guy he let the sentence drop shook his head at hardys optimism forget it well i thought id ask he said couldnt hurt thanks for your time he started to get up logan stopped him but the mcneil thing youre really going ahead on that my guy still might settle but who knows for how long i think youre missing a bet that could be hardy conveyed that clearly he believed it was the least of his worries and in spite of all his talk about cole and cullen carrying that message to logan was the primary reason for his visit here maybe the news that mcneil wasnt going to settle would flush something he smiled politely it wouldnt be the first time driving up from jupiter to his office he stopped on th street and this time got lucky with strout the coroner lanky and laconic knew hardy from several trials as well as his days as an assistant district attorney it didnt matter that he was doing defense now generally strout had no ax to grind over which side the courtroom you called home he was a scientist who dealt in medical facts equally useful or not to both the prosecution and the defense it was near the end of the workday and he came out himself to the lobby to let hardy back into his office a large room filled with medical books and a famous collection of murder weapons from antiquity to the present many were under glass but an equal number including a reputedly live hand grenade on a candlestick pedestal on his desk were out there for anybody to grab wield and use hardy could read the upsidedown title of the book that was open on strouts desk the golden age of torture germany in the th century theres a sweetlooking little tome hardy remarked keeping up on the old research are you are they teaching that in med school now strout lifted the book ran a finger fondly over the open page put the volume back where it had been if you ever wonder why cruel an unusual punishment made it to the bill of rights he drawled you dont need to look any furthern this the stuff people was doin to one another back then just as a matter of course slightly cruel was it the coroner chuckled i tell you diz the least of em is moren most people would believe anybody without serious mental problems ever did to one another and here we got our judges splittin hairs over whats cruel and unusual what the foundin fathers meant they all ought to read this book settle their minds on the matter i mean this tongue clamp here for example john hardy held up a hand maybe another time huh not your area of interest today strout settled into the chair behind his desk chuckling contentedly he reached for the hand grenade and threw it gently from one hand to the other no lemme remember cullen alsop ten points strout nodded and came forward his hands hovered an inch above the desk and he bounced the grenade nonchalantly on the blotter well it was pretty much what i thought it might be heroin overdose all right as expected i asked the police lab to do a quick analysis of the heroin left at the scene and its really their report im drawin on moren anything in the blood itself but lets just say in laymens terms that if he used one syringe which needle marks indicate hes only got the one fresh one relatively speaking then it was very pure stuff and theres no doubt that was the cause of death no he was bouncing the grenade again thinking there was some trace alcohol and if we ran down to the cscan level odds are wed find other drugs but this was heroin and higher quality than whats on the street strout lifted his shoulders i dont know it might be whats on the street now although with each passin hour that becomes less likely why is that because if stuff this pure is out there wed have seen at least a few more overdose deaths you may member late last summer one weekend one of the dealers brought up a new load of brown tar that hadnt been cut no well it killed seven kids in four days strout clucked in dismay but now we got mr alsop so far and thats all and that means what by itself nothing definite but it could mean a few things one he let the grenade fall to the blotter and held up a finger the boy was dealing himself checking out the product guessed wrong on its potency two another finger he knew what it was and decided it would be a painless way to kill himself and three somebody else knew what it was and gave it to him which would have made it a murder a shrug out of my domain diz absent any sign of struggle or motive or anything else im listin cause of death as accidentsuicide have you talked to banks ridley hardy shook his head not since wednesday night and not for lack of trying he hasnt returned my calls but even wednesday he added exaggerating slightly i know he didnt like the timing of cullens death the day he gets out hes dead he cant testify so whats the deal do you think somebody set cullen up to sink cole then somebody killed him before he could it doesnt make any sense yeah but so little does anymore diz strout picked up the grenade again hefted it casually maybe banksll come in with something he said im sure hes looking hardy sat with it a minute then got to his feet well thanks john youve been a help glitsky eventually persuaded his sons that he could probably take a shower get dressed in his jeans and a light sweater and make it to his favorite chair in the living room without stressing out too much about it they didnt have to watch him continually he gave his word he wouldnt go outside or do the long version of his tapdancing routine around the duplex but both of them wanted to stay near him and abe couldnt say it bothered him more their obvious concern for him touched him deeply it was good to have his family back together who could say when it might happen again they gave rita the afternoon off then called nat and asked him what he was doing he came over with chinese food chicken chow mein and happy garden and after lunch the three generations played hearts at the kitchen table for three hours for the first time in years the small kitchen echoed with actual laughter everybody caught up with each other their lives in the last couple of years swearing genially at bad play or bad luck reconnecting when orel got home from school nat left for the synagogue and the boys decided theyd get outside and shoot some hoops at the park down the street until it got dark glitsky had taken out his book and sat in his barcalounger in the living room in five minutes he had transported himself to the mediterranean where he prowled the shipping lanes off the costa brava looking for prize ships and booty the duplex had a westfacing front and on clear days there was a short window of time just before dusk when the sun sprayed the room with light before it sank into the buildings across the street the sudden glare made abe look up from his book he closed it motes of dust hung in the rooms air elaine was walking with someone she knew it was very late nearly one oclock in the morning shed left treya that sunday at rand and jackman in the late afternoon and if jonas was to be believed hadnt come home to tiburon so she had stayed in the city the two of them had probably met for dinner downtown six hours a very long dinner much to discuss or one topic that consumed them perhaps cocktails afterwards she was leaving jonas it may not have been a dinner after all but a romantic tryst at a hotel or even the new mans place that would at least account for the hours but at some point they left together why they could have stayed the night either at a hotel or the mans place he assumed that some other nights she would stay in the city after a late meeting jonas would not need to suspect anything but she was going home this night which again seemed to make a restaurant more likely her car was parked under the building in the rand and jackman lot so she had walked to wherever it was meeting him there she must have thought they had settled whatever it was he was accompanying her as she walked back to get her car had any policeman looked in her car probably not there would have been no reason to from the first minutes theyd had a suspect no one was looking for a killer glitsky had a city map out on the coffee table and was hunched over it the sun was down behind the buildings now he had switched on a couple of floor lamps and drawn a circle with rand and jackman in its center there was a finite number of restaurants and perhaps bars afterwards in the circle from which to choose the fact that it had been a sunday night would eliminate those few that closed on that day more importantly the others would have been far less crowded than on the other weekend nights ten days had passed since the shooting it was true but a waiter a maltre d someone would remember this was police work it was way past time for him to get proactive here if cole hadnt killed elaine then someone else had and there would be some positive trace of it he would supply hardys three musketeers with a photograph of elaine and between them they should have no trouble covering every restaurant within the circle over the weekend it would be a start folding up his map he walked into the kitchen to call ridley banks when the young inspector had called abe in the hospital on wednesday hed sounded as though hed begun to suspect that hed made some kind of mistake with cole burgess he still hadnt admitted any wrongdoing in his interrogation but the door was open clearly banks understood that cullen was tied to cole in some way evidence at the scene of cullens death might bear upon elaines and if that were the case banks would be a critical source it was no surprise that he wasnt in but abe was sure hed check his messages and get back to him in a matter of hours they stopped where the dark alley met the dark street did elaine think she was about to be kissed certainly the killer was close beside her one hand at the nape of her neck he checked the street in either direction the alley off to his left the shot rang into union square on the cold night someone a bellman at one of the hotels would have heard it then hed caught her brutally coldbloodedly taken her life knowing he was going to do it at least since theyd left dinner but walking along with her perhaps chatting easily ostensibly satisfied with whatever conclusion theyd reached and then gently broken her fall suddenly another terrible conjecture but so compelling it immediately felt like fact he d apologized as he let her down glitsky could hear it could hear the son of a bitch im sorry elaine but you made me do this outside it was now dark glitsky was standing leaning over resting his weight on his hands on either side of the kitchen sink his face reflected in the window in front of him had broken a light sheen of sweat his jaw trembled and the scar between his lips stood out fresh as a new wound dad dad he hadnt heard them come up the steps or open the door turning on the water quickly he filled his hands and threw it into his face when they got to the kitchen he was drying himself with a dish towel hey guys he said easily howd it go all right all right he said ill see if i can get the number hardy and rita both showed up independently in the half hour after the boys arrived and now the two men sat at the kitchen table while rita put together a tuna fish casserole on the counter behind them the boys were down in their wing taking showers and watching television and abe finally conceded that he ought to try ridley banks at his home sergeant paul thieu was manning the homicide detail and gave glitsky the number he needed off the top of his head scary glitsky said to hardy the guy knows everything he was punching at the phone listening leaving another message rid its abe again still trying to reach you sorry to nag but whenever you get any of these he left his own number hung up looked at hardy hes a bachelor its friday night swell hardy said im married its friday night speaking of which did you ever talk to treya hows that connected to you being married and it being friday night but yeah she called this morning wanted to make sure i was avoiding the near occasion of stress which i notice youre not close enough end of subject so what did you have her doing directing the kids mostly but i also wanted to see if she had run into any files elaine might have kept on dash logan to glitsky this was clearly an unexpected direction dash logan what about him hardy ran it down for him including suitable disclaimers about how farfetched it all was how coincidental but he ended hopefully as saul westbrook told me just this morning coincidences do happen its not whether they happen glitsky said its whether they mean anything whos saul westbrook cullen alsops public defender who knew nothing about cullens deal glitsky was still trying to find some thread and hes somehow with logan too no hardy admitted then im officially confused abe touched his head must be the drugs hardy tried to explain it again when he finished glitsky was nodding as though it made sense and you spent your whole day billing some client for this most of it yeah abes voice was filled with admiration im in the wrong field he said rita interrupted things shooing them away so she could set the table for dinner but as the two men went to the living room glitsky kept talking so youre working on one case against logan who is after all a lawyer like yourself and another lawyer your friend david freeman completely apart from you has got another one right so far they sat on either end of the couch glitsky threw his map and notepad onto the coffee table and continued and elaine another lawyer went to logans office on a completely different group of cases and finally the clincher cullen alsop had a matchbox from jupiter a bar where logan hangs out right hardy agreed what does it clinch though glitsky fixed him with an amused look remember last night when i said i was a horses ass i was wrong that wasnt me it was you hardy took the criticism in his stride he lifted his shoulders still i felt like i had to follow it up shake his tree a little but nothing fell out not today anyway no surprise there glitsky was thinking but hed gone galloping off after wisps of nothing himself there was no point in tormenting his friend over it any further well listen tomorrow maybe we go a different direction we might get luckier he picked up the map and his notes and went over some of his reasoning about elaines last evening he was in the middle of it when isaac came in and sat down glitsky stopped and looked up at him this is not strenuous he said im allowed to think and talk stressful isaac wasnt budging the doctor said stressful not strenuous hes right hardy said standing up sorry ike we just get to talking glitsky looked from one to the other two more minutes im timing it isaac said checking his watch glitsky shook his head then id better hurry so diz we get our three helpers out canvassing the area checking out the restaurants and bars then if ridley ever calls back we have him check the lab reports again for whatever they found on maiden lane that we didnt look for last time also rid can follow up on cullens scene he said he had something on this didnt he you were assuming he meant elaine and cole right thats the impression i got one minute isaac said all right then somebody ought to look at her car and her house we already did that today curtis went up there abe nodded in satisfaction already good and walsh let him in treya called him first greased the wheels shes good did he find anything interesting hardy shook his head not at first sight he brought a box back but i only got a glance at it ill give it a closer look over the weekend and while were on it amy found that guy at hastings too not an elaine fan anymore though once upon a time he was a big one according to her definitely a possible did she ask him where he was that night i dont know all right then maybe rid can go talk to him time isaac called out standing up thats it gentlemen time is called dinner rita yelled from the kitchen ok hardy was on his feet he had the map and notebook in his hands never let it be said i cant take a subtle hint he started moving to the doorway glitsky sidled along with him one more time he said for the record as far as youve been able to find out logan isnt any part of this hey isaac said times been called were just saying goodbye ike glitsky yelled back hardy had gotten to the door in code he added so no logan i guess not unless something turns up on him in elaines files which wont happen because she didnt have any hardy spoke with finality and disappointment hed put in a lot of hours on some logan connection and it was starting to look as though theyd all been wasted he was at the door on his way out closing it behind him glitsky stood a moment frowning suddenly he pulled at the door and stepped out onto his landing hardy was almost to the sidewalk and he called down after him what do you mean elaine didnt have any you mean files on logan hardy turned on the bottom step yeah but she must have i dont think so nothing labeled that way anyhow then what did she give treya when she came back to the office on sunday shed just been to logans office and gave her some files hardy considered for a long beat then broke a grin he just wont go away will he the weight of the world settled on him as soon as he opened the door to his home had it only been last night he thought that it had all worked so well here tonight like an animal in the moments before an earthquake he felt the tension before he could have been consciously aware of it he walked back through the dark and silent house turning on lights as he went anybody home a distracted voice answered vincents before the remodel their old bedroom had been directly behind the kitchen they had turned it into a family room with their entertainment center a couch some reading chairs vincent sat in one of them the room dark around him playing with a handheld gameboy hey hardy flicked on that light too hows my guy vincent barely looked up hey whats the matter nothing he stood looking at his son debating whether he should try to break through but he decided not vincent was all right into his game which hardy thought probably wouldnt harm him for life he knew from long experience the probable reason why vincent was here doing what he was doing it was a refuge where are the girls he asked although he was sure he knew the door to rebeccas room was closed and a light showed under it frannie was sitting on the becks bed a stricken exhausted look on her face his daughter was lying across the comforter her head on her mothers lap frannie was stroking her hair they both looked up and he saw exactly what he expected that the beck had been crying again he felt his own shoulders sag another crisis my god he thought would it never end without a word he crossed over and sat with them on the bed his eyes met his wifes he put a hand on the becks shoulder hows my sweetie he asked she shook her head not too good i guessed that he rubbed her shoulder looked a question at frannie they had a suicide workshop today he would have laughed if it hadnt made him so furious he couldnt keep the comment in well theres something every seventhgrader sure needs to know all about what did they do give tips on the top ten favorite ways frannie gave him a signal to hold his temper but he couldnt do it this was at least the fifth such workshop in the past couple of months and each one had traumatized his already fragile daughter since thanksgiving in the name of god knew what the becks school had subjected her and apparently the rest of its students to perhaps forty hours of awareness training and it was playing havoc with her life she was hardy hoped still a good five or six years away from sexual activity but her school had given a fiveday course on every possible malady and consequence that could ever be associated with sex a few weeks later all the girls had been enlightened on the growing incidence of anorexia and bulimia in the age group rebecca tended to pick at certain foods and the fact sheet that the school had sent home with her listed this as a possible indicator of trouble although the beck weighed ninetyodd pounds and ate with a healthy appetite the eating disorder bug had even infected frannie over the holidays and that had been a lot of fun then in january came the drills in case a group of terrorists or some of their fellow students broke into the school and started shooting or throwing bombs how they should pile their desks a certain way strategies for exiting the campus hardy rubbed his daughters back and now suicide prevention for the life of him he couldnt imagine how any amount of precounseling was going to have any appreciable impact on the rate of teen suicides the beck sniffed and sat up why would somebody my age want to kill themself i didnt even know they did that not very often beck really but why maybe hardy thought because all these awareness courses made kids so fearful that they no longer had the guts to live or even wanted to in such a treacherous and unstable world but of course he couldnt say that its really not very common beck its not like its something that happens to you youve got to decide thats what you want to do and very very few people feel that way especially kids no doubt frannie had been mouthing the same truths for the past hour and gradually getting them from her dad as well they were beginning to sink in she was perking up slightly i dont think im going to want to commit suicide do you no of course not but they made it seem like if you have a boyfriend and he breaks up with you then thats one of the things to do she brought a little fist down on her thigh but that would be so stupid i mean i never would have thought of that even if i ever did have a boyfriend to begin with youre right frannie said that would be stupid but how great that they teach this and give everybody the idea hardy couldnt keep the disgust out of his voice he pulled his daughter closer she wrapped her arms around him bad things happen sometimes beck but not as often as you think not even close you dont have to worry about all of them or even any of them i know she said worrying doesnt do any good ever you always say that i do youre right your fathers right beck it really doesnt do much good maybe they hoped if she heard it enough from people she trusted shed start to believe it suddenly hardy remembered the talk hed had with jeff elliot yesterday do you know anybody whos ever been hit by lightning the beck didnt know where this was coming from but she was curious no that almost never happens how about you fran no me neither now you know all these things youre learning about in school well guess what vincent was standing at the door bored beyond words with all of this are you guys done are we having dinner tonight im so starving hardy wanted to check his messages before he turned in for the night he hadnt been at his desk since before he went down to jupiter to see dash logan and there was enough hanging fire that he knew he wouldnt get to sleep if he didnt his answering machine gave him the time and date of his messages the first two calls came in within five minutes after hed left his office for the day and he clenched his teeth at the perversity of fate he might even still have been downstairs sharing a few endoftheweek bon mots with the lovely phyllis the first call was from jon ingalls wanting hardy to know that hed remained unlucky with witnesses jon left his number telling hardy to call anytime what was on tap for tomorrow hed be waiting by the phone the next message was from jeff elliot i wanted you to be among the first to know that i just resigned if they want me back and they will theyll have to beg and then pay me more for all the trouble they put me through also anent our other recent discussion something did finally occur to me that connection you were talking about between torrey and dash logan i might have one theres a private investigator named gene visser you might know him he used to be a cop hardy felt a small surge of electricity at sams the other day vissers name had come up as the heavy whod tried to blackmail rich mcneil jeff was going on when torrey started at the das visser worked for him almost as his own personal investigator they were pretty tight i dont know if they still are but i have seen visser and logan together a lot so if torrey and visser still talk anyway for whatever its worth hardy thought it might be worth a lot but he didnt get any time to celebrate the last call from torrey himself was made at four fortyone about ten minutes after hardy had left logan at jupiter torreys message was that since he and hardy were getting to prelim on cole burgess next week they were both going to be swamped so he was just looking through some other prosecutions that were coming up through the office in the next few weeks and happened to notice hardys name on one of them as the attorney of record it seemed to torrey that this case people v mcneil was one where a judge was likely to try to get the parties to settle so it wouldnt clog up the docket and certainly neither torrey nor hardy needed the extra hours when their plates were so full if hardy wanted to settle the case he could probably save his client both time and aggravation and torrey would be happy to consider alternatives at least the two of them should discuss it see what they could work out the small surge of electricity had turned to an insistent hum frannie came into the room as he was hanging up she came up behind him put her hands on his shoulders and dug her thumbs into the muscles along his backbone his head fell forward as though hed been clubbed dont ever stop he said she kissed the top of his head massaging around his neck you know why the camper got a migraine she asked no and i dont care his eyes were closed he was in heaven too tense then relief and fatigue in equal parts theyre both down and out hardy straightened up did you doublecheck for molesters lurking outside the becks window maybe we should do nightly drills the best ways out of the house just in case she brought a palm up against his head stop she strikes him he intoned a clear case of domestic violence spousal abuse he turned back to her took the hand that rested on his shoulder sorry i know enough ill be down in a sec two phone calls short promise im pouring wine and will start without you youve been warned fair enough he called jon ingalls back he appeared in fact to have been waiting by the phone hardy told him about glitskys idea to canvass the restaurants and bars in the area around maiden lane ingalls was in whatever it was hed be there what time should they start he didnt expect anything when he called ridley again but you never knew cops worked strange hours friday night bachelor or not he might be in catching up on paperwork but no such luck the machine answered again ridleys machine was the kind that beeped before the tone every beep was a call and since hed started trying to reach him hardy had been subliminally aware of the increase in the number of calls now he sat at his desk and waited counting through ten fifteen twenty when the tone finally came hardy left his message and hung up he scratched at his stubble his face a brown study in the two days since hardy had last talked to him twentyeight people had left messages for ridley banks and apparently he hadnt even checked them to clear his machine it was almost eleven oclock and bitterly cold treya climbed the steps up to glitskys door then stood for an eternity on his doorstep in the dark unable to knock earlier treya had been to raneys basketball game after that she and her daughter went out for a pizza then they went back home where raney got ready for bed and treya told her she had to go out shed be back in a little while no light showed from within it was still as death finally finally she tapped on the glass three times with her fingernail a sound infinitesimally small tentative gone no one could have heard it but that was all she would do shed wait here another little while and something was moving inside the flat the landing light came on the door opened abe was barefoot still wore his jeans the black sweater does your doctor want you awake this late im bad with authority you might as well get used to it its a little cold he backed up to let her enter where is everybody your boys she asked then whats that noise glitsky listened intently for a minute i dont hear there that oh his face softened thats rita she snores sometimes im so used to it i dont even hear it anymore shes behind that screen she sleeps in the living room glitsky gestured simply it was a small place homey crowded with furniture only until we finish the guest wing she grimaced im sorry abe i didnt mean he touched her arm softly its ok anyway the boys are out someplace they made me swear on my mothers honor that i wouldnt budge i was to sit and read my book then go to bed preferably early which you havent done i know he said its bad of me that authority thing again its lucky im a boss when i have a job i mean a long moment so hows your book the high seas good as hornblower i think so its amazing how deeply he makes you feel it all he was staring at her she looked back at him the silence settled glitsky cleared his throat hardy says i should just ask what i should just say something like i never did with elaine he hesitated i cant have anything like that happen with you she waited if you dont want to hear he took a breath nearly choked out the words i dont know what to do with this but i need to have you in my life closing her eyes she nodded a sigh of what might have been relief then she looked at him again and a smile played at the corners of her mouth i was hoping that was it she said then they were in each others arms under his sweater beneath the burns where they had shocked him back alive his ribs ached with the pressure part three at am on wednesday february dismas hardy stood at the head of the huge oval table in the solarium and looked with satisfaction at his assembled team of investigators and associates three weeks ago no one could have predicted this assemblage certainly on the day of coles arraignment only two weeks ago several people in the room would have counted themselves among hardys opponents at that time only he and david freeman had been in coles corner and even they were reluctant at best now he still had freeman who would continue on as keenan counsel if the death penalty case did in fact get to full trial which hardy desperately hoped it would not but there was also treya and abe the three musketeers jeff elliot in his wheelchair the team had also acquired another defense attorney who simply wanted to be part of it this was davids friend gina roake who seemed to have her own slightly inarticulated bone to pick with torrey and perhaps dash logan the case had touched a lot of nerves in this room and around the city and now they were within hours of the opening gavel the hearing was beginning with a high enough profile and would have kept it because of elaines notoriety alone pratts political posturing which had led to elliots muchcriticized reprimand and highlyapplauded resignation had raised the stakes but the events of the last two days had brought things to a fever pitch on monday morning inspector sergeant ridley banks the primary officer in the case the man whose interrogation of cole burgess had led to his confession was declared a missing person the authorities suspected foul play but no body had turned up ridley was still missing as the last person known to have spoken to banks hardy came forward with the information that the inspector had told him he was going on an interview related to both cole burgess and cullen alsop at this news gabe torrey effectively withdrew the olive branch hed extended to hardy on the mcneil matter by calling a press conference covered by every print and television journalist in the city and publicly accusing him of lying there was no proof of this alleged phone call this was one of the sleaziest defense tricks hed ever seen hardy was stooping to new depths obviously trying to use a missing perhaps dead mans voice to infer that the police had doubts about the man whod confessed to the crime there were no such doubts at the same time torrey chose to ratchet things up significantly by floating his own reason why the former chief of homicide had prematurely delivered prosecution evidence to the defense and lost his job for his efforts it wasnt really because he had any doubts about the guilt of cole burgess no glitskys defection and the subsequent betrayal of his fellow officers was merely a selfserving effort to avoid prosecution for police brutality himself torrey had several witnesses who would testify that the lieutenant had illegally manhandled the defendant on the night of his arrest in the meanwhile the sidebars and other human interest stories kept up the heat as promised john strout declared the death of cullen alsop an accidentsuicide an overdose on the day of an inmates release was nowhere near unknown in the city the police crime scene investigation unit found no evidence that supported any other finding and all the while the seriousness of the crime itself lent a gravity to the case this was murder in the commission of a robbery a capital case the headlines had screamed it anew just yesterday morning the anchors chimed it throughout the day the da as shed promised was going to ask for death now surveying the scene in front of him hardy felt that they had worked like galley slaves for the past week and done all that they could they were not unprepared but he remained a long way from confident the probable cause standard of proof in a preliminary hearing after all was nowhere near the reasonable doubt standard of a jury trial all the prosecution had to do was demonstrate enough to bring a strong suspicion to a reasonable mind that a crime had been committed and that the defendant had committed it during all the time in the past week that hed spent organizing the efforts of the rest of the people in this room hed been unable to completely shake the fear that his strategy bringing out all his guns at the prelim rather than saving them for the trial was misguided what he kept asking himself was the hurry and indeed one of the cliches lawyers spouted to their clients about why it was always better to delay look if we put this off long enough you never know the cop who arrested you might die and wont be able to testify against you had already come to pass if hardy waited longer maybe torrey would die pratt would be voted out of office someone else with a guilty conscience or a slight case of schizophrenia could come forward and admit to the crime anything could happen but he was committed now and finally satisfied that his decision was the right one jury trials brought with them their own insecurities and they were of a subtly different nature with a panel of citizens in front of you the proceeding inevitably became slightly less intellectually rigorous this was not to say that both sides didnt need to cover their factual bases but a human element always came into play and thus there was an opportunity to play to emotion to feelings a jury of twelve was going to hear an horrific litany of coles uncontested actions that night ripping off the earrings breaking elaines finger to get the ring and so on they would know that hed fled from the police hed fired the gun perhaps once possibly twice they would likely witness the videotape of the confession despite hardys motion after all that try as he might and no matter how brilliant a defense he was able to mount hardy could not believe that any jury would acquit it could simply never happen in the real world so in a true sense the prelim was hardys best chance judge hill was a crotchety old fart sure enough but he was careful and conservative perhaps the judges brain was not one that ascended to the exalted heights of decent legal mind as hardys own apparently did but the cadaver had a reputation for intelligence nevertheless he was also an experienced jurist he would be fairminded although after hardys intemperate outburst at the arraignment there might be a hump to get over at the outset ironically though hardy thought it even possible that the judge would cut him more slack in the courtroom precisely because he was angry with him he wouldnt want it to seem that his personal pique affected his judgments in fact he would have to give hardy tremendous latitude a preliminary judge would admit evidence that a trial judge would exclude as confusing or irrelevant or too timeconsuming in the name of making a complete record hardy could ask judge hill for almost anything and the court would at least hear it before inevitably holding his client over for trial indeed hardy was virtually compelled to advance every single fact and theory in support of his client no matter how tenuous he wasnt going to open himself up to an appeal based on incompetent counsel that the th circuit would uphold in ten years the burden of proof was on the prosecution to show affirmatively that cole burgess had probably committed the murder hardys team had uncovered some alternatives with motives and perhaps means and opportunity that he might be able to argue with a straight face the police hadnt investigated thoroughly enough too many questions remained unanswered there were too many other possible suspects the waters were too muddied by politics and selfinterest yet hardy knew that even so the judge was going to hold cole to answer using the reasonable man standard even if hill might be persuaded that a trial jury might not in good conscience reach a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt he would still order cole to stand trial these charges would never be dismissed hardy more than halfway still believed that cole had killed elaine if he himself were the judge in this hearing and knew everything he now knew he would still have to say that cole had probably done it the conclusion was all but foregone but in a death penalty case hardy had nothing to lose and this was the moment for the battle to be joined one of the surprising and wonderful things about san francisco is that summer is not a real season in the normal meaning of the word in any given year there were perhaps sixty days that would classify as belonging to summer by virtue of general balminess but these would almost never occur consecutively four days doth not a season make but the necessary corollary to the lack of seasonal continuity was the fact that a random summer day or two could occur at almost any time willynilly during any month this morning as hardy mounted the steps outside the hall of justice it was such a day the smell of roasting coffee hung in the air and he stood a moment outside in the unnaturally warm sun a small shift in the soft breeze brought an overlay of sweet decay the citys wholesale flower mart around the corner he realized a news truck pulled up and doubleparked across the street the cars behind it honked their displeasure then pulled around in a nearunanimous flow of obscenities hardy lingered knowing that once he passed inside these doors all of this the vibrant life of the city would cease to exist he had given some lastminute instructions to david freeman then had driven on down alone before the rest of his team he wanted to have a few minutes with cole before the circus began to reassure him to settle himself then he was passing through the metal detectors and on his way across the lobby at this time of the morning there was no one else around here on the opposite wall were the names of policemen whod given their lives in the line of duty and he stopped a moment wondering if ridley banks was going to be there before long he ascended to the second floor by the internal stairs rather than the elevator it wasnt usual but hardy had asked for and been given permission to dress out his client for the hearing to that end jody burgess had gone shopping and bought cole several pairs of slacks some nice shirts a couple of sports coats in the holding cell behind department he was wearing one of the new outfits now and hardy was again continually surprised at how well the boy cleaned up from a tactical standpoint this was to the good of course although it would have meant even more if they were in front of a jury still hardy believed that there was value in a presentable appearance in the courtroom even at a hearing the orange inmate jumpsuits were all too familiar in the hall of justice and all too associated with guilt a bailiff admitted hardy behind the bars of the holding cell and lawyer and client got through the amenities coles eyes were clear now his skin didnt exactly glow but it looked healthy and though he would never be mistaken for demosthenes his speech had continued to improve as well the slur was all but gone the rambling quality to his earlier answers a thing of the past to all outward appearances cole was an earnest young man of adequate means and a decent education if anything hardy thought he projected an ingenuous naivety a sincere human innocence he was sorry for everything that had happened he was getting himself back on track hed do everything he could to help i dont really know if theres anything more you can do right now cole hardy told him just dont change your story from now on that would be the best thing beyond that try to react appropriately to what you hear in there and some of its going to be awful i warn you but dont overreact and dont act hardy put a hand on his shoulder how are the pushups coming along twentyfive a trace of pride four times a day thirty situps too four sets and the pills this wasnt as happy a topic but cole kept his head up getting there slow but steady though thats not exactly been my style styles come and go hardy said check out your clothes a couple of weeks ago they werent your style either now you look like you were born in them thats outside cole said insides another thing so whats inside hardy asked a look of quiet desperation the feeling that im not going to beat it its just got too good a grip and thats not just a style youre right hardy said thats not a style its a choice he flashed him the hard grin and squeezed coles shoulder you know what patton said dont you youre not beaten until you admit it hence dont hardy saw it in coles eyes the remark had hit home he indicated the courtroom through the adjoining door noises had begun to leak through as the time for the session drew nearer he gave the boy a last pat on the shoulder keep your chin up cole see you out there he had to walk around torrey at the prosecution table and this time there was no repartee the chief assistant was talking to one of his own acolytes a young woman and pointedly ignored hardy as he crossed the courtroom in front of him at the defense table freeman had arranged some folders and a couple of yellow legal pads in preparation for the first shots on the other side of the bar rail the gallery was filled to overflowing and the crowd buzzed expectantly missing though was the almost palpable sense of anger and polarity that had marked the arraignment hardy attributed this partly to the passage of time but mostly to david freeman and clarence jackman who between them had somehow gotten the word out to the various interested communities that this was not a racial crime nor necessarily as clear a case as it had first appeared hardy hadnt even made it over to freeman when a bailiff intercepted him mr hardy the judge would like a word with you right now yes sir this way please hardy was truly stunned this was a peremptory summons and couldnt possibly bode well in a capital case such as this one every meeting between the judge and any of the attorneys had to be on the record with a court reporter present hardy hesitated freeman from the defense table looked up with concern and started to come around but hardy held him back with a hand will mr torrey be joining us i dont know sir the judge asked for you there was nothing to do but follow him back behind the bench down the hallway in front of coles holding cell where his client sat dejectedly elbows on his knees head down the bailiff knocked once and did not wait for an answer but pushed open the door to judge hills chambers a firm hand on hardys back all but pushed him inside the cadaver sat in an upholstered armchair reading the chronicle there was another chair next to him but hill rather pointedly did not ask hardy to sit instead the bailiff informed his honor that mr hardy was here and the judge nodded finished his article in a leisurely fashion then finally closed the newspaper out of his judicial robes hill appeared far more formidable than he did on the bench any notion of caricature was displaced here in his tailored suit impeccably groomed he could have been an ancient titan of business the ascetic and angular face which when perched over his robes suggested a disembodied skull on the bench here was very much alive the pale blue eyes seemed to float in little pools of malice tiny capillaries coursed the parchment skin of his cheeks his mouth was a harsh line he took another minute before he spoke and when he did his voice had a rehearsed quality although the delivery itself was dry uninflected he did not address hardy by name but looking up with a challenging dismissiveness simply began ive called you in here before this proceeding begins because i want to tell you something personally outside of the context of this hearing hardy noticed that the court reporter was indeed taking this down yes your honor please dont say another word this is a oneway communication i wanted to make it explicitly clear to you that any outburst such as your display at the arraignment on this matter wont be tolerated in my courtroom any such outburst will get you fined and if its serious enough ill put you in jail for contempt if you think im kidding we can find out real quick i have not invited the prosecutor here since i did not think it necessary to admonish you in front of him this is the very last latitude i will give you yes sir hardy said hill nodded an expectation confirmed heres a word about precision mr hardy i told you not to speak to me again and you just did further i dont know how long youve been practicing law but a judge is your honor not sir ill see you in the courtroom hardy his blood running hot started to say yes your honor but caught himself in time the bailiff nudged him out of his shock and he turned and left the judges chambers you look like you just saw a ghost freeman said hardys legs would not hold him as he got to the defense table so he sank into his chair and reached for the beaded pitcher to pour himself a glass of water his hands were shaking in a palsy of rage freeman reached over and covered one of hardys hands with his own gnarled one diz with his other hand he poured a glassful and slid it over talk to me what happened still unable to speak hardys breath was ragged and came in deep through his nose a muscle worked in his jaw his eyes rested on a fixed point somewhere in front of him eventually he saw the glass of water and drew it nearer but did not pick it up hear ye hear ye the superior court state of california in and for the county of san francisco is now in session judge timothy hill presiding all rise pratt had come in and joined torrey and his young assistant at the prosecution table hardy glanced across at her an elegant statuesque carriage in a dark blue business suit and thought he detected an almost gloating confidence for an instant he wondered if shed fixed things with hill somehow put the bug in his ear to reprimand him so humiliatingly no more than ten minutes had passed since hed reentered the courtroom and he still felt physically sick with spent adrenaline and certainly he felt totally inadequate to muster any kind of rational argument in normal circumstances he might have called for an immediate recess citing the call of nature but here he knew he didnt dare his relationship with the judge was bad enough already if hardy did anything to antagonize hill any further he risked being charged with contempt and any hope of making headway would be dashed before hed begun watching the cadaver take the bench he wondered anew about his benighted misguided strategy marveling at how badly hed misjudged the situation reasoning that hills anger would be a little hump to get over in the first minutes of the trial now it loomed as an impenetrable unscalable escarpment and he had based all on this reasonable man this fairminded jurist now where would be all the judicial leeway hed expected on so many critical issues what were the odds of even getting past the videotape of the confession but there was nothing to be done at this point they were here committed at his side cole nudged him and whispered patton his client was obviously reading his thoughts which meant that he was telegraphing them a bad sign to go with his bad feeling but the advice was well taken he forced himself to summon some of the generals fortitude or control to direct his anger and despair into something constructive hill got himself settled rearranging his robes he greeted his clerk with a familiar if stilted geniality then asked him to call the case hardy listened with half an ear as the cadaver arranged some paper in front of him swept his eyes around his courtroom when they got to hardy there was not the slightest sign of animus no momentary squint or pursing of his lips it was as though their exchange had never taken place and then the clerk had finished and the judge was talking mr hardy mr freeman good morning ms pratt mr torrey are the people ready to proceed torrey stood up we are your honor but if it please the court sidebar hill frowned deeply shook his head in apparent disgust and sighed all right he said at last he motioned with one hand counsel will approach hardys legs held him as he stood a blessing he and torrey got to the bench at the same time and looked up at the judge who was still scowling what is it mr torrey your honor with all respect you just had a private meeting with mr hardy hills face held a terrible blandness he waited and waited a little more was that a question yes your honor im afraid i didnt hear one maybe you could try again torrey aware that hed already committed a tactical error cleared his throat well your honor as you know in a capital case such as this one all communication between the parties has to be on the record you dont say counselor hill was breathing fire a controlled burn as a matter of fact i was aware of that another wait im still waiting for a question hardy suddenly became aware of unrest in the gallery behind him hill looked out then back down to hardy and torrey as hed shown at the arraignment this judge seemed comfortable allowing some limited reaction among the spectators in hardys experience this was unique at very little volume the low whitenoise hum added a kind of subliminal tension to the tone in the room he wondered if hill had some reason for allowing it torrey finally found his question very well your honor the people would like to inquire what was the purpose of your meeting with defense counsel it was a personal issue mr torrey this case had not yet been called we did not discuss it in any manner hill shifted his eyes is that completely accurate mr hardy yes your honor the judge wanted unassailable clarity on this point mr hardy did you say even one word about this case in my chambers no your honor did i again hardy said that he did not does this satisfy you mr torrey the prosecutor swallowed clearly feeling that if he could get out of this without any further damage it would be a victory perfectly your honor hill nodded brusquely then if youd be so good as to call your first witness another of the many ways that a preliminary hearing differed from a trial was that there were no opening statements from either side the prosecution simply began by calling witnesses whom the defense could crossexamine and introducing evidence as they would at trial when the da was finished the defense could then present its own witnesses and evidence torrey took his chastised self back to the prosecution table hardy returned to his chair thinking that at least the judge was equally intolerant of both sides all things considered this was terrific news earlier in the week freeman had bet two hundred dollars that he could predict every witness in the order that torrey would call them throughout the day and perhaps foolishly given it was david hardy had taken the bet now the old man leaned across cole and whispered strout two seconds later torrey stood on the other side of the room the people call john strout the coroner rose from one of the wooden theatre seats on the prosecution side of the room and made his longboned way up the now frankly talkative center aisle through the bar rail to the witness chair strout appeared as a witness in a courtroom no less than once a fortnight and as he took the oath he projected his usual relaxed confidence as torrey stood to begin his questioning hill lifted his gavel and touched it down lightly the decibel level dropped a few points torrey greeted strout and the hearing had begun dr strout for the benefit of the court can you tell us briefly your occupation as well as the training and experience that qualify you for that position strout quickly qualified as an expert and gave the preliminary information about the case in about ten questions torrey got to the point doctor what killed elaine wager strout leaned back in the witness chair and crossed his legs she was shot once in the back of the head at point blank range with a twentyfive caliber bullet death was instantaneous and the manner of death death at the hands of another homicide as hardy listened to the uncontested testimony his spirits continued in their downward spiral the prosecution after all only had to prove two things and it was already halfway there in less than five minutes but he thought with relief thats over now homicide has been established the second half as yogi berra would say was ninety per cent of it but if he thought that things couldnt get more depressing from here he was mistaken torrey now you carefully examined the deceased body in your forensics laboratory did you not i did a complete autopsy yes sir and during this autopsy did you discover any other injuries to the body i did would you please describe them for the court strout in his element turned slightly and spoke directly to the judge describing in homespun terms the gash on elaines neck the broken ring finger the damage to her earlobes where the pierced earrings had been pulled out by the time hed finished the short recitation the susurrus in the gallery had ceased torrey introduced the eightbyten color photographs of elaine that documented all of this testimony and judge hill spent several minutes examining them minutely leaving strout on the stand while he did so when he finally got the pictures back and entered as peoples exhibits torrey told strout he had one more question these injuries doctor were they administered before or after the decedents death strout replied from a medical standpoint its impossible to say with certainty in the cases of the neck and ear injuries certainly near to the time of death say within an hour the finger however was broken after the decedents heart had stopped pumping blood in other words after she was dead in his laconic drawl strout granted that death usually went along with when the heart stopped and stayed that way a ripple of amusement tension breaking in the gallery greeted this reply torrey let it die out then passed the witness hardy stood up dr strout he began the injuries you described earlier including the gunshot wound the pictures weve seen was that the extent of damage to the decedents body the witness considered for several seconds yes sir he answered with finality were there any other broken bones physical marks bruises abrasions no did you examine her extremities doctor yes of course and were there any scratches or scrapes on her knees or elbows or on her hands no aside from the bullet wound was the same true of her head another wait while strout considered carefully yes doctor was there any abrasion no matter how slight that in your expert opinion would be consistent with her dropping dead instantaneously as you said and falling directly with gravity onto unyielding concrete or asphalt no there was none hardy thought hed nailed down his point succinctly enough the cadaver had listened intently even had taken a few notes hed have to let the information and inferences to be drawn from it hang fire for a while but when the time came it might be persuasive in the gallery the noise bubbled up again hardy didnt know if the cadaver used it for the same purpose but suddenly the waxing and waning of the background sound struck hardy as a kind of barometer while he was asking his questions of strout the room had been almost completely silent which told him he must have been getting somewhere making people think even if the majority of them like cole were ignorant of where he intended to go what his questions meant but he knew and the gallery would remember them waiting for an answer for closure so hardy believed would the judge he bowed his head slightly to strout thank you doctor no more questions by the time hardy was back at his table six steps hill had directed torrey to call his next witness as he sat down cole whispered what was that all about and torrey stood and asked steven petrie to come forward hardy looked around cole to freeman the old man pointed to the yellow legal pad on the desk in front of him in block letters hed written petrie he smiled helpfully what cole asked again hardy patted his arm whispered to him its like a movie cole you pick it up as it goes along petrie the officer whod been first on the scene was in uniform today blond and crew cut he had a runners body and a military air and seemed nearly as uncomfortable as strout had been composed he gave his name his rank his duties and time on the force torrey was up standing in front of him officer petrie would you please describe your actions on or about twelve thirty am on the morning of monday february first of this year hardy conceded that this was a good way to loosen up the stiff cop petrie seemed to sag in relief he wasnt going to be answering a barrage of questions at least not right away he glanced up at the judge then back to torrey and began his recital in a normal voice the details were familiar enough to hardy but he knew that a straightforward chronology of events would be helpful to the judge eventually also he hoped it would serve him but for now he sat forward listening for factual error taking notes petrie told it clearly he and his partner daniel medrano were cruising downtown on their regular beat when they saw some suspicious movement at the head of maiden lane at grant as they pulled closer they brought their squad cars spotlight to bear and saw a man squatting over a fallen figure he turned and began to run petries partner medrano got out and gave chase while petrie first called for backup then got out to see to the fallen figure a young africanamerican woman who appeared to be dead he took under a minute satisfying himself that he could do nothing to help the victim but he called the paramedics anyway by the time he finished medrano was returning with the suspect whom hed apprehended at the union square end of maiden lane medrano told him that in the dark the suspect had run into a fire hydrant and fallen down shot out of a cannon hardy was on his feet with an objection he heard freeman call his name hoarsely but he was already up committed hearsay your honor hills eyes narrowed with displeasure absolutely he replied and as such permitted in a preliminary hearing when offered through an experienced officer as you no doubt remember from your days in law school mr torrey please continue but another thought struck him oh and mr hardy try to refrain from frivolous objections like this as we go along here would you weve got a lot of ground to cover thank you all right mr torrey you may proceed hardy sat down heavily and freeman reached around cole to pat his arm i tried to tell you he said it wasnt any solace torrey brought petrie back to where hed been and he continued so dan officer medrano came back down maiden lane with the suspect he also had a gun that he said the suspect had dropped when he fell more hearsay though hardy didnt doubt its truth lets stop there for a moment officer petrie do you recognize the suspect that you and your partner arrested that night in the courtroom today yes would you point him out to the court please petrie raised a hand pointed a finger in the middle of the defense table over there torrey had the record reflect that petrie had identified the defendant cole burgess now this gun he introduced the murder weapon into evidence and evidently the size of it made an impression on the gallery it truly was a tiny weapon no more than two and a half inches long perhaps half an inch wide petrie identified it as the gun from the scene all right torrey said youve arrested the suspect and recovered a gun what did you do next i should say he was already handcuffed dan had handcuffed him after he caught him ok thank you then we brought him over to the squad car and patted him down his pockets his coat he was wearing an old jacket and did you find anything on his person yes sir several items would you describe them please petrie identified them the necklace diamond ring pair of earrings a wallet belonging to the deceased containing her identification as well as eightyfive dollars in bills and a dollar sixteen in coins prosaic as this was no one in the courtroom was unaware of the significance of this testimony this made it murder in the commission of a robbery its what made it a capital crime for which cole burgess could be put to death if there had been a jury present this would have been the opportunity for torrey to play to it to underscore the importance of this testimony but there was nothing for him to do in that regard now no theatrical business to attend to so he had to press on ahead officer petrie he said was the defendant intoxicated when you arrested him hardy stood objection your honor calls for a conclusion officer petrie is not an expert witness but torrey was ready with an argument your honor a layman can offer an opinion in this area and every policeman on the street is intimately familiar with apparent intoxication hill nodded in agreement objection is overruled hardy wanted to keep going but hed been warned the judge had made his ruling besides it was the correct one there was nothing to do but sit back down and listen to petries answer i smelled liquor on his breath but he was conversant and coordinated torrey smiled obviously pleased at how well his witness had taken to his coaching conversant and coordinated he repeated thank you officer no further questions if hardy had been prosecuting he would have had a lot more so he was surprised his rhythm off as he stood to begin his cross officer petrie he began you smelled liquor on cole burgesss breath is that correct yes it is was this a strong odor i could smell it yes did you give him a breathalyzer test no no hardy paced a few steps to his left deep in thought officer petrie in your years as a police officer have you ever pulled over a car for a driving violation petrie reacted with a bit of impatience yeah he said of course of course hardy repeated and on any of those occasions if you wanted to know if someone was drunk what was your procedure usually we ask the person to get out of the car and administer some field sobriety tests saying the alphabet backwards or standing on one foot with their eyes closed like that so basically walking and talking right and other basic tests of coordination yes now you saw my client staggering when he walked isnt that right when he came back with your partner well yeah but he had fallen down thats right officer he not only couldnt walk when you saw him but he was too uncoordinated to escape right he plain fell down when he tried to run isnt that correct well he ran into something and fell down didnt he a reluctant nod ok yes petrie tried to sneak a glance over hardys shoulder pick up a cue from torrey hardy took a step toward the witness box and to his right hopefully blocking the line of sight now how about his speech i dont know petrie said grudgingly it varied did he speak at all officer hardy asked or was he too incoherent to say much he was pretty incoherent and passed out in the back of the patrol car yeah petrie squirmed he did that hardy backed away a step took a beat then came back to the officer people who act as youve described here might be drunk correct yes another alternative would be if they were injured is that right yes and in fact mr burgess was bleeding slightly from a head injury correct yes sir well since youve testified that there were paramedics at the scene and your policy and procedure is to have injured prisoners evaluated by paramedics isnt it true that the reason you didnt show mr burgess to the paramedics was because you could tell that the only thing wrong with him was that he was drunk falling down incoherently drunk petrie was stuck he was hardy nodded satisfied no further questions during the recess freeman left for the bathroom cole pushed back from the defense table he was not cuffed in the courtroom and had crossed his arms over his chest rested an ankle on his knee i cant believe you didnt ask him anything about the shot he said hardy wasnt much in the mood for criticism at the moment like what hes not our witness why not hardy pretending to read from some notes in front of him finally gave that up and turned to face cole because i talked to him early in the week he says he didnt hear any shot and we need that shot as much as they dont need it why didnt torrey bring it up then hardy had wondered about this too certainly it was an important point if cole had only fired the gun once and not when he fell during the pursuit in the alley then the only handy explanation for the gunpowder residue on his hands was that hed fired the gun before the police arrived presumably to kill elaine petries report of the incident never mentioned a shot although medranos did so hardy had put medrano on his own witness list he assumed that when torrey had seen this he chose petrie for the prosecution version of the story then in the flush of having demonstrated his special circumstance robbery hed decided he had gotten enough out of him he didnt need what the officer didnt hear hardy hoped this would prove to be a critical omission but he downplayed it to his client i dont know cole he said my honest feeling is that he just plain forgot freeman guessed right again on the next witness the crime scene lab technician lennard faro was a small man in his early thirties with a thin mustache and thick pomaded black hair he wore a blue blazer over a tangerine shirt a tiny gold cross earring dangled from his left ear he verified that the slug ballistics confirmed that the bullet that had killed elaine wager had been fired from the weapon cole had had in his possession faro had tested the defendant for gunshot residue then analyzed the results now torrey had come to the nub of it and therefore based on the results of this test it was your conclusion that the defendant had on his hands residue that could only have come from a discharged firearm it was a nobrainer faro had no doubt at all yes sir and hardy got the witness mr faro he began did you find any fingerprints on the gun no sir is this unusual the lab tech shrugged its common enough sir the surface of the gun had been treated with armorall the car upholstery cleaner so it didnt hold fingerprints i see and when you say this is common enough roughly how frequently do you see it this was an unexpected direction and the young man paused to reflect before he answered every few months id say every few months so its not an everyday finding no not at all i didnt mean common like every day thats all right im just trying to get a sense of when you would see this armorall used on a weapon to avoid fingerprints it seems like an esoteric bit of knowledge faro had no reply hardy realized he hadnt asked a question torrey was objecting behind him relevance whats the point here your honor thats a good question counselor mr hardy it was not a pleasant moment the armorall was one of dozens of details that possibly meant something but it didnt prove a damn thing either way cole was more likely to be ignorant of its usefulness in avoiding fingerprints than say a member of law enforcement or a hardcore criminal but it certainly was possible that he knew all about it and had put it to good use hardy apologized took another tack mr faro how many bullets were in the gun when you examined it well its a fiveshot revolver there were three live rounds and two spent casings two casings thats right hardy looked at the judge turned in a half circle came back to the witness now mr faro did you take the gsr swabs from mr burgess yourself yes i did and youve testified you found gunpowder residue on the swabs is that so yes did you find a lot of it no very little very little hardy repeated if a person fires a gun more than once mr faro does he leave increasing amounts of residue with each shot yes of course of course and yet mr burgess had very little yes are you able to say that this residue came from one or more than one discharge no in fact you can get gsr on your hands from picking up a recently discharged firearm isnt that true yes hardy wasnt going to get any more out of that well so he decided to move on and when did you swab the defendants hands mr faro wasnt it in the middle of the night yes sir the defendant was handcuffed and brought to the homicide detail for questioning i was at the crime scene and came down when we were done there do you know what time you administered the test yes sir i noted the time when i started it was four thirtyseven in the morning and during all that time that you were at the crime scene was mr burgess handcuffed in an interrogation room in the hall of justice faro nodded thats what the officers told me yes sir they didnt want to let him wash his hands thats pretty standard he offered helpfully im just curious mr faro why didnt you administer the test in the field i guess they wanted to get him downtown fast i dont really know hardy paced a little in thought all right mr faro so you got here to the hall of justice after mr burgess had been in custody for at least three hours would you describe his condition at the time you took the swabs your honor objection calls for a conclusion but hardy was ready for this one not at all your honor ill let you draw the conclusions im only asking mr faro what he saw the cadaver gave him one very well overruled mr faro this wasnt the techs usual area of expertise or testimony and he shifted in the chair with a degree of discomfort let me be more specific hardy offered was mr burgess asleep no sir he was in a chair was he sitting up straight or slumped down torrey again your honor defendants posture can hardly be relevant but again hill overruled him adding harshly im allowing this line of questioning mr torrey the message was clear object again at your peril faro answered the question he was way down slumped as you say did you talk to mr burgess at all yes i did i told him what id be doing with his hands and how did he respond he considered a moment incoherently he was pretty out of it i finally just pinned his arms down and took the swabs was his speech clear or slurred slurred it was more like mumbling mr faro did you smell alcohol on his breath whew the witness finally showed some personality it was a brewery in there a brewery hardy repeated delighted with the phrase that would be yes wouldnt it you smelled alcohol is that right yes and was this a good three hours after hed been brought downtown yes sir at least one last question mr faro did you see any video equipment set up in the interrogation room when you were there administering your tests no sir and another sentence slipping out when i passed the monitor next door they hadnt turned the camera on yet thank you mr faro mr torrey your witness the prosecutor honed in on hardys most salient point on the matter of the gunpowder residue can it be wiped or washed off washed yes wiping eventually over time which is why we try to get to it pretty quickly but in this case as youve testified you didnt get to it very quickly in three hours might someone lose a great deal of residue if they wipe their hands enough on their clothing for example yes but not all of it no not necessarily so is it entirely possible that the defendant could have fired the gun more than once and still had only little or trace amounts of gunpowder residue yes completely as soon as the witness stepped down hardy asked for a sidebar and all the attorneys came forward to the bench your honor he began id like to make my motion to exclude my clients statement his socalled confession right now its clear he was drunk when he was arrested and equally clear that officer petrie was coached to say otherwise lets get this issue resolved right now this tactic didnt stand a chance and hardy knew it the prosecution could call their witnesses in any order and any coaching they were going to do was already done but it might serve to disrupt the orchestration of the prosecutions case at least making the motion would annoy torrey and pratt and if the judge made them change the witness order who knew as a bonus he might even win his bet with freeman give me a break pratt all scorn addressed hardy but was looking at the judge it was almost five oclock in the morning your honor he was punch drunk maybe with fatigue but david freeman wasnt only there for his good looks he took a halfstep toward the bench your honor he said three hours he took in the whole circle of them they come upon mr burgess on the scene apprehend him there with the victims jewelry and an apparent murder weapon and three hours later they havent even asked him a question on the face of it the confession is fatally flawed the police overstepped he was raising his voice they dont give him his phone call he called his mother torrey interrupted he waived an attorney weve got that on the videotape bullshit hill shocked at the language couldnt find any response other than to point his finger hey its on the tape david the prosecutor shot back deal with it freeman implored the judge where are we your honor in turkey in iraq jesus pratt did a little pirouette of disgust your honor no one has fought police misconduct more than i have this was a murderer they needed to interrogate he signed his miranda notice there was no overreaching here finally hill caught up with it all he slammed his gavel for order since by now the whole room behind him had degenerated into chaos when things had settled the cadaver turned a terrible face to both hardy and freeman ive said i will rule on these issues when the people seek to introduce the evidence ive heard nothing to change my opinion he said in clipped tones mr freeman he continued i dont allow profanity in my courtroom now im calling a fiveminute recess and i want everybody calmed down by the time we reconvene this is a court of law and not a goddamned circus act pratt herself took over for the next witness the people call anthony feeney hardy had known feeney a journeyman assistant district attorney for over twenty years and had always considered him a decent sort honest hardworking cooperative when hardy had first interviewed him because hed taken cullens information on behalf of the da hed gone home particularly depressed the details that had eluded both him and the public defender saul westbrook about the mechanism of cullens snitching were not a secret no one appeared to be trying to conceal anything hardy had hoped this would turn out to be a break in the case against torrey if nothing else but his hopes had been pretty much dashed feeney wasnt a liar hardy didnt think hed be lying now and this was not good news he was hardys age although sometime in the past decade hed gone from looking younger than him to much older his hair had turned snow white hed developed a middle and his clothes once flashy had become conservative dated the almost oddlyshaped triangular face had crumbled on itself somehow the oncedistinctive beauty marks on either cheek now lost in liver spots and mild eczema feeney had turned into a bureaucrat an office worker flat effect squashed personality perfectly competent and nonconfrontational he aimed to please after establishing his credentials pratt got down to her business demonstrating that cole burgess had the murder weapon at least a day in advance of the shooting and therefore that premeditation was possible if not likely mr feeney do you know a young man named cullen leon alsop i do or did hes dead now the familiar hum in the courtroom began again low and ominous pratt turned full around and waited until it had died out a bit then continued how did you know mr alsop i prosecuted him for several drugrelated offenses he was a dealer of crack cocaine and had been convicted on that offense several times i see when was the last time you saw him i had an interview with him in the afternoon of tuesday february ninth at the jail would you please explain to the court what this meeting was about sure feeney shifted in the witness chair i got a call from one of the guards at the jail that morning saying that mr alsop wanted to talk to me that he had information that the district attorney would like to have regarding the elaine wager case he wanted to trade that information for a reduced sentence or even to get out of jail so what did you do first maam per our guidelines i brought the information to the chief assistant da mr torrey he directed me to talk to the snitch to mr alsop get his demands and wed see where that led us so i went down and talked to him he hadnt yet been arraigned and didnt have a lawyer up to that point so i was free to talk to him directly pratt looked good there was no doubt about it she held her head high a tiny private smile playing with her features as she walked back to the prosecution table there she picked up a thin folder and turned gracefully walking back up to the judge handing it to him the gallery watching her was silent was your entire conversation with mr alsop taped yes if defense does not object here she turned again charmingly rather than put in the whole tape perhaps we can hear the essence of the discussion from this witness hardy was halfway to his feet to object in a big way this was the rankest kind of hearsay pure and simple the witness wasnt a police officer so it couldnt even come in at prelim and even if it could alsop was dead he couldnt be crossexamined at trial so his statement would never be admitted there no jury would ever hear about this tape in a million years pratt was just playing to the crowd the judge and not least the reporters reminding them that admissible or not they had a statement tying cole to the gun there was no doubt reasonable or otherwise as to who had killed elaine wager pratt must have expected the objection to be made and sustained she had all but invited hardy to step up so he wouldnt do it if he did the expected and put up a good even brilliant technical defense cole would go down his client would die in prison sooner in the death chamber or later of old age better to change the rules suspend the rules of evidence everything would come in maybe pratt and torrey sloppy lawyers both would do something so gross that it would actually damage the case or maybe this just a glimmer theyd let slip something hardy might have missed he stood for the purposes of this prelim only no objection your honor clearly puzzled the da hesitated then inclined her head graciously thank you mr feeney hardy had heard the whole thing almost word for word a couple of days before and there were no surprises hed read the transcript and listened to the tapes of cullens talks with both feeney and ridley banks the story was simple and consistent enough at the heart of it though lay cullen alsops credibility when pratt gave him the witness hardy rose and approached the box mr feeney when you went over to the jail to meet mr alsop was it the first time youd seen him in connection with this information he was offering to trade feeney thought for a minute then nodded yes and this was on tuesday february ninth was it not yes it was did mr alsop tell you how he had learned of elaine wagers murder behind him hardy heard pratts objection how was this relevant and hill asked him the same question obviously your honor if mr alsops story is true it strengthens the prosecutions case immeasurably on the other hand mr alsop was a desperate man facing a long prison term the mechanics of this negotiation who approached who who told who what is critical to mr alsops credibility if the district attorney approached him and fed him this story your honor pratt was up again behind him moving forward hardy half turned to face her im outraged by this accusation hes implying that we have suborned perjury to strengthen an already airtight case hardy sprung the trap if its so airtight without the gun your honor why did ms pratt bring it up this evidence is clearly and totally inadmissible at trial unless counsel is prepared to admit shes just pandering to the press it must have relevance and im entitled to explore mr alsops credibility your honor its completely absurd hill drew himself up in his chair his eyes had become slits he raised a bony finger at the da please return to your seat he stared her down until she obeyed and then he continued ms pratt you wanted it in you got it in now he can attack it he turned to hardy you may continue hardy inclined his head thank you your honor let me withdraw the question about how mr alsop learned of elaine wagers murder for the moment and ask another he went back to his table freeman was ready for him and handed him what he wanted the transcript of the ridley banks interrogation of cullen alsop hardy had it marked as an exhibit then returned to his witness mr feeney at the time of your visit to mr alsop had you read any part of defense exhibit a no and why was that feeney frowned hardy knew of course that the assistant da hadnt even received the transcript before his own interview took place but if hardy could somehow make him feel as though hed done something wrong he might get defensive and that would be to the good because inspector banks had only talked to mr alsop the night before it hadnt even been typed yet so you hadnt gotten around to reading it pratt objected as hardy knew she would asked and answered hill sustained her but feeney wore a cloud on his brow he was paying close attention now on his guard the gallery was producing a lowlevel hum had you heard about inspector bankss interrogation at all feeney threw a glance over at pratt then came back to hardy yes he answered im asking you mr feeney you said yes but it sounded like a question im sorry yes i had heard about it but you didnt hear the tape itself no or talk to inspector banks or read a transcript pratt slapped the table in anger how many times are we going to hear this question your honor hardy made an apologetic gesture to the judge i want it to be clear your honor that mr feeney didnt know anything about the talk between inspector banks and cullen alsop other than that it had occurred youve succeeded there mr hardy move along mr feeney didnt you testify that you hadnt spoken to mr alsop in connection with this case until your meeting with him on tuesday february ninth yes and you were the first and only da to your knowledge to have talked to him up to this time yes and wasnt it also your testimony that after talking with him you left him to discuss his information with mr torrey yes thats true during your discussion with mr alsop on february ninth did you offer him any deal in connection with the information he was providing no did you suggest any deal might be in the works no no hardy expressed surprise he raised his voice over the background din mr feeney didnt you in fact offer him release on his own recognizance in exchange for his testimony about this gun in the elaine wager case now hed riled feeney up good and proper as had been his intention absolutely not i offered him nothing we have procedures about this kind of thing and i followed them exactly i took his information thats all then we analyzed and discussed it upstairs and came to a decision we didnt offer him any deal of any kind until the next day february tenth the day he was released absolutely hardy lifted the exhibit and handed it to the witness mr feeney would you be so kind as to read aloud the first few lines of this transcript after inspector bankss introduction it didnt go very far feeney got to the words i got a deal going here with the da and hardy stopped him cold how do you explain that mr feeney on the night before you saw cullen alsop he told inspector banks that he already had a deal with the da a pause what was that deal who did mr alsop have it with the witness tried to figure it out then gave it up i cant explain it he must have been mistaken or bluffing hardy knew hed be rebuked for it but he had to get it on the boards or somebody else with the da had already cut him a deal pratt exploded up again and the gallery noise reached a level where hill for the first time slapped his gavel and called for order sternly he told hardy that he should know better he was to refrain from that type of editorial comment im sorry your honor he said but this does lead back to the question i asked earlier id like now to revisit that issue if the reporter would read back the question after only a small hesitation the judge so directed and the reporter found the spot did mr alsop tell you how he had learned of elaine wagers murder hardy added or my clients arrest pratts voice behind him was firm your honor i still object the question remains irrelevant but something had sparked hills curiosity overruled he said simply and directed the witness to answer feeney wrung out shook his head i have no idea he didnt say did you ask him another accusation of oversight feeney sighed at the burden of it mr hardy as you know san francisco has newspapers and the jails got a grapevine somebody like elaine wager dies it gets around perhaps it does but you didnt answer my question did you ask cullen how he knew that elaine wager had been killed by cole burgess using his gun no did you wonder how he could have put all that information together feeney shrugged maybe he read a newspaper saw it on television i dont know all right hardy conceded maybe he did he walked back to the defense table and stalling took a drink of water he needed a last connection and didnt know where he was going to get it the first rule of questioning witnesses is never ask a question for which you dont know the answer but hardy had feeney on the ropes now defensive and doubtful he might let something slip it might be a knife that would come back and stab hardy but he felt he had to take the risk mr feeney just a few more questions youve told the court that you knew cullen alsop from previous arrests and prosecutions isnt that true yes it is three to be precise but you had never spoken to him personally correct yes correct but youd seen him in court before many times perhaps a dozen or more weary wanting to get it over with feeney was bobbing his head with resignation the gallery was a tomb behind hardy yeah sure something like that and in those cases before last tuesday did mr alsop ever appear with a codefendant the bobbing stopped at the prosecution table torrey was leaning forward his elbows on his knees shoulders hunched and he raised his head in two or three of the narcotics offenses he had a codefendant feeney answered and who would that have been feeney didnt like it the defendant cole burgess so they were friends hardy said or at least knew each other well now mr feeney please try to remember this is important when you heard about the arrest of cole burgess did you recall his friendship with cullen alsop your honor please what is this about hill raised his glance and directed it behind hardy is that an objection ms pratt yes your honor relevance overruled but this time pratt wasnt going to let it go your honor if it please the court well it doesnt ms pratt ive ruled on your objection were not under the same strictures as a formal trial here and this is a capital case i see an argument that mr hardy is trying to complete here and im inclined to let him keep trying still pratt couldnt sit down its taking him a very long time your honor not as long as the appeals if i get it wrong counselor now please he turned to the court reporter again and had her read back the last question when feeney had heard about the arrest of cole burgess did he have occasion to recall the name in connection with cullen alsop the witness answered in a quiet voice actually no not until i heard of mr alsops arrest a couple of days later then i remembered you remembered that they were friends that there was a connection between the two young men yes did you mention this connection to anyone a look of chagrin im sure i did burgess was a hot case i remember i was in the coffee room and mr torrey was in talking about it just generally ms pratts new policy plans i made some wiseguy crack about all this interconnected drug culture that wed just arrested this other kid alsop again it just came up hardy glanced up at hill said he had no further questions it had been an exceptionally long morning and hill finally called the lunch recess and a bailiff came over immediately to get cole you guys arent having lunch with me he seemed pathetically sad and hardy understood why during trials hed usually try to eat lunch in one of the holding cells with his clients keep them informed of what was happening try to keep them from freaking out any number of ways hardy said he was sorry and promised cole that it wouldnt happen again cole gave his mother a quick wave over the railing and then he was marched out hardy spent a couple of minutes consoling jody then making lunch plans with jeff and the musketeers glitsky and treya had already gone gina roake was leaning over the bar rail discussing something with freeman hardy started gathering his papers and freeman pushed out his chair stood stretched and came around the front of the table howd you get that with feeney he asked it was a thing of beauty i had a vision you didnt know a rebuke i knew theyd been arrested together i just couldnt prove that torrey knew hardy shrugged nonchalant easy david it worked out sometimes you take a risk it seemed worth it he plopped his stuff into his briefcase over to his right he noticed a little conference continuing at the prosecution table he lowered his voice you know the other complaint we been talking about this was freemans letter to the state bar association complaining about torrey david hardy and gina had discussed it over the past weekend and decided that they really had nothing compelling coincidences but nothing resembling real evidence reluctantly theyd decided to table the issue until after the burgess hearing at least maybe we want to move on that after all freeman moved in closer move how we agreed we dont have anything not quite true david weve got the bare facts torreys screwing with at least two cases maybe but we cant prove it yet and we cant prove hes getting anything for it the bars going to need what hardy was shaking his head forget the bar weve got to have hill see it hes never going to believe the da suborned perjury to win this case as long as he thinks torrey plays by the rules its just too big a leap but if we can convince him that they fudged one piece of evidence then hes going to have to take a hard look at the rest weve got to get him to consider what we know or think we know close enough yeah we cant convince the bar but maybe we can use it here this appealed to david but he didnt see how it could happen so what are you saying were not going to get our two cases introduced here theres really no relation at all im not suggesting that and we dont need it anyway theres other ways hill might get the message he might read about it say in the papers he gestured toward jeff elliot still talking with gina in the row of seats behind them weve got a guy here whos been known to get the word out freeman being who he was hardy didnt have to draw him a more detailed diagram davids eyes took on a sparkle with the possibilities this was his kind of game playing all the angles in and out of the courtroom all weve got to do hardy continued is plant the seed hill doesnt have to believe it hes just got to acknowledge its something torreys capable of david still didnt think so even if he were convinced of it personally he said without some kind of proof hes never going to let it affect his ruling probably not hardy said but on the other hand how could it hurt its something and otherwise weve got nothing freeman considered for another moment you put it like that it kind of grows on you by the way he added i should be happier about it but im afraid you owe me the two hundred hardy looked up not till the end of the day no i bet not torreys not calling any more witnesses hardy studied his partner as though hed lost his mind of course he is hes got another twelve names on his list he hasnt even touched the crime scene hes got the crime hes got in his specials hes got cole at the scene with elaines jewelry and wallet and the murder weapon guess what hes done he doesnt even need the confession although hed be crazy not to use it and i think you rocked him a little with feeney he doesnt want to walk into any more walls hardy flatly couldnt buy it you want to go double or nothing freeman sadly shook his head diz i wouldnt take any pleasure in taking your money if this were the grand jury it would be over i still dont know why he didnt go to the grand jury in fact a shrug i didnt fight him on timing he figured it was a tossup either way we were going to trial the old man clucked in disapproval ah hubris glitsky chewed on an ice cube moving his glass of iced tea through the ring of condensation on the table he was in a booth in the far back at lou the greeks facing away from the entrance waiting for his appointment he couldnt shake the thought that it had been unwise to decide to meet here it was too close to the hall to the homicide detail people he knew would see him word would get out the window at his ear was half below the level of the street outside he could look up and see a line of blue sky between the buildings with the nice weather lou had opened the windows a crack to let the place air out get some fresh oxygen into the mix all glitsky could smell was dumpster though he lifted his glass sucked in another cube chewed some more treya had gone back to hardys building the big box from elaines condominium was there in the solarium and she wanted to catalogue everything in it on the chance that something might jump out the slim chance at this point glitsky felt they were all grasping at straws hardy and freeman doing their legal hocuspocus treya making lists jeff elliot wanting to take down the district attorney the kids remained enthusiastic fascinated by the whole procedure but they were after all lawyers hardy had them writing more motions about unconsciousness temporary insanity police misconduct they were more interested in the courtroom strategies that might save cole burgess than they were in discovering who might have killed elaine for glitsky this remained the focus someone had killed his daughter he owed it to her and to himself to discover who it was what had begun as simple remorse over his own excesses had ripened into a genuine concern that a combination of malice and stupidity might possibly have ensnared the wrong man and if it had it was up to him he was the only trained investigator on hardys dream team to run down the right one try as he might he couldnt develop any warmth for the idea that it had been jonas walsh the doctor had no alibi true hed fibbed about the state of his relationship with elaine he was abrupt distracted uncooperative in short glitsky had come to believe he was in a state of grief something with which he himself had a visceral connection he recognized it intuitively and while he would change his mind in an instant if any evidence came to light linking jonas walsh with sunday night in san francisco he really didnt expect that to happen likewise with muhammed adek glitsky had fifteen years experience interviewing killers and he came away from his monday interview with the law student convinced that he wasnt involved if hed been less angry if the sense of betrayal he obviously felt about elaine had been less acute maybe he would have felt differently but even after he identified himself as a cop administrative leave or not thats what he was muhammed hadnt attempted to downplay any of his feelings as killers tended to do the boy had been in love with her and shed chosen another man and while this could be a motive for murder it didnt comport well with what abe thought he knew about the last night of elaines life plus and this was key from everything treya had told him elaine would have been far more specific with her on sunday afternoon if she had been going out to meet with muhammed but she would never have met with him in the first place abe and if shed somehow gotten talked into it she wouldnt have just said she was going to a meeting believe me she would have mentioned him by name and not flatteringly there was no way glitsky agreed with her his theory was simple elaines killer was at least a cordial business acquaintance maybe a good deal more than that theyd had dinner or perhaps done something more intimate but abe believed in his guts that the crime wasnt one of passion it wasnt about jilted love or domestic upheaval it was a coldblooded contingency that had become a necessity then been acted on decisively he crunched another cube drummed his fingers on the table checked his watch come on paul he said aloud im here inspector paul thieu with another man in tow slid into the booth across from him sorry im late lieutenant this is jan falk narcotics abe glitsky said he reached across the table shook hands nice to meet you i assume paul told you im on leave at the moment maybe forever falk badly needed a shave and the dumpster smell seemed suddenly stronger he wore a roguish grin sometimes i wish i was no always i wish i was except now maybe so whats goin down glitsky turned to check the room another time it had filled up nicely for lunch there was camouflage in the numbers and the noise still he leaned in across the table so he wouldnt have to speak too loudly paul says you know something about ridley banks falk shrugged i dont know what i know tell you the truth monday i heard hed gone missing and i remembered him from last week some od case in the mish long story how we got together but he was on to something and i thought you guys homicide might be interested but maybe not i couldnt even get a callback thieu piped in the place is a disaster lieutenant you wouldnt believe it i bet i would thieu felt he had to give glitsky some feel for it they havent put anybody in your chair even temporarily nobodys fielding calls everybodys out all the time the cars driving full speed and nobodys at the wheel youre breaking my heart abe said then back to falk so what happened but he couldnt get right to it lou came by for their orders recommending the special which today was a dish called yeanling clay bowl thieu looked up at him yeanling whats a yeanling i dont know lou admitted its got rice noodles with lamb and some kind of sauce really good though ill put you down for three of them ok glitsky saw they had consensus ok three bowls he said it doesnt come in a bowl lou explained thats just the name of it yeanling clay bowl from back where they originally made it someplace my wife could tell you all about it but shes busy right now i got an idea lou glitsky said what a tight smile go make her busier ok lou got the message and disappeared abe looked at falk you were trying to talk to somebody in homicide right so after a day nobodys called me back and i ask around and banks is still missing so i decide ill go down the hall in person and see whats the problem the problem thieu interjected is that nobodys in charge sorry go ahead so i go in and theres paul and i start to talk to him a little about this and i take it upstairs the chiefs office himself and what do they tell me thieus voice had thickened in outrage that banks is a missing person hes not a homicide go back downstairs and do my job if it turns out hes dead then i can worry about it can you believe these guys so anyway abe this is about when i remember youd called me about rid wanting to reach him at home i figured maybe youd know something falk picked up then theyre talking about ridley on the news what hes working on about him being the main witness in this elaine wager case and this od is part of that too thats true glitsky said so what was he on to you think falk finally had a clear field to run on and he took off the operation that narcotics had been running out of jupiter cullen alsops appearance at the bar falk and banks bopping damien together gene visser the excop possibly being a source of heroin thats what banks really sparked to if visser had been there in the flophouse with the kid then what glitsky asked i dont know falk replied but if this kid was a snitch the thing about being dead is its a lot harder to change your story a lot harder thieu agreed but you cant testify either so what goods the snitch to begin with glitsky was chomping more ice now thinking when he swallowed it he spoke i got a question jan you hear on tv that this is part of the wager thing you know the hearings going on right now how come you dont go to the da falk almost spat his tea across the table you know how many times me and my guys are putting something together for like a year wrapped up nice and tight righteous busts dealers in the slammer good shit then two weeks later its all over the case has mysteriously fallen apart or its not charged or some fucking thing my dealers are sprung and im made on the street and gotta start over someplace else arid half the time my snitches have been exposed and im on the line for that he drank iced tea calmed down slightly its got so you know what i do now i go direct to the ag the state attorney general if they dont want it ive even been known to turn cases over to our generous brothers at the fbone even though theyll find some way i get no credit for the goddamn bust but no way do i go to the da no way thats who got the lieutenant busted thieu offered falk broke a conspiratorial smile i think i heard something about that i think i even heard you might be working on the other side thats a vicious and ugly rumor glitsky said but if its true i got a friend you might want to talk to get on the same bus and run over pratt and torrey where do i sign up glitsky nodded i think you just did here you are gentlemen three yeanling clay bowls falk took thieus plate and passed it across then grabbed his own i hope its rare he said to lou if theres one thing i cant stand its welldone yeanling this glitsky thought was police work finally this was how it was going to get done astoundingly no one had issued him a subpoena for the hearing torrey because he would be at best a hostile witness and had nothing to add that might help the prosecution case hardy because he simply figured glitsky would be there anyway he could call him as a witness at his pleasure when glitsky left falk and thieu and got back into department the hearing had already resumed for the afternoon from the little he heard he gathered that the lawyers were yakking about how much of the videotape they were going to have to watch as usual it didnt appear they were going to get to an agreement anytime soon he tapped treya on the shoulder and motioned that she should accompany him she took his hand in the hallway and they walked through the lobby and all the way outside to the steps of the hall the day was still warm without any breeze god she inhaled with pleasure her face up to the sun you know what this reminds me of i had a teacher mrs barile in junior high in lovely daly city where wed get a day like this about every seventeen years and i remember one time we did for just one period english this time of day right after lunch mrs barile she took us all outside and we sat on the grass and she read out loud to us the shirt scene from gatsby you know that one where daisy cries anyway treya suddenly looked embarrassed sorry i just had that same feeling again thats not what you wanted actually its pretty close to exactly what i wanted glitsky felt he could have listened to her all day they could stand here on the steps of the hall of justice and she could tell him all the good feelings shed ever felt in her life for the first time in half a decade he was feeling them himself a wash of something other than duty persistence cold honor he still didnt trust them entirely couldnt talk about them but they were there warmth hope the future he wanted it too badly and this he believed would guarantee that it would never last so he returned to what he could live with his comfort zone but its not why i called you out from in there he told her he was going to go try and have a talk with somebody so he wouldnt be around if hardy decided he was going to call him as a witness this is from your meeting at lunch he nodded almost smiling im happy to report that the unit seems to be falling apart in my absence nobodys covering any bases except paul thieu and hes on my side hes getting me copies of the lab stuff and crime scene report on cullen alsop meanwhile theres this excop that ridley thinks might be involved somehow you saw ridley banks hes ok this erased any sort of animation from abes face no he told this to a guy in narcotics and thieu put us together so who is this person did ridley go see him no one knows trey but he might have been the appointment he told diz about thats what im hoping treya took a half step backwards crossed her arms over her chest she spoke with a slow precision that would have been the last time anybody heard from him thats right he knew what she was thinking it was one of the fundamental moments you got involved with a policeman you accepted an elevated level of risk some people couldnt do it some people found out too late but sooner or later it always had to be dealt with whats his name she asked gene visser another pause maybe your friend paul thieu could go with you then nobodys watching the shop at all besides i havent even located him yet he touched her arm lightly trey this is what i do its ok howd it go with your lunch a shine had risen in her eyes she spoke again with exaggerated care please dont change the subject abe what if this man killed ridley then hed be a complete fool to try anything with me wouldnt he the first thing ill do is tell him everybody knows where i went i even logged it in and that will protect you well he said you know protection the whole concept theres really no such he stopped his eyes suddenly filled with a kind of panic what nothing i think maybe my yeanling didnt agree with me he took a heavy breath abe are you all right yeah he said automatically just a little another breath his hand went to his chest i think id better sit down in the courtroom judge hill was about to rule on the admissibility of the confession hardy had been arguing that they should watch all six hours of interrogation on videotape he wanted to get to the coercion issue now before trial torrey objected your honor the movies are full of wonderful performances by people who are apparently drunk or high on drugs we can watch mr burgess on tape all day long and still never get to anything approaching proof that he was in fact under the influence of anything he was never tested for drunkenness perhaps as you say he was in the early stages of heroin withdrawal hardy chimed in and as such your honor would have said anything he would have done anything hill used his gavel dont interrupt the bench again counselor ive read your arguments in motion form just because defendant perhaps had motivation to lie does not demonstrate that he did in fact lie if you have nothing new to add im standing on my ruling you can take it up again if this hearing results in a trial the bad blood between hardy and hill was so thick that freeman felt compelled to intervene your honor if i may approach hill sighed in frustration this argument had already been going on for more than a halfhour hed made his ruling and suddenly now the old lion was coming out of his cave all right mr freeman david stood up slowly as protocol demanded all four attorneys made thek way to the front your honor freeman began as you know we have prepared a brief outlining internal inconsistencies within the alleged confession itself as you say counselor i know that i have read it then your honor with all respect wed like to object further to the confession on foundational grounds who can say if this is a complete unaltered copy of the tape unless inspector banks will testify your honor pratt and torrey in unison hill held up a peremptory hand and glared at them mr freeman the defense has just been arguing for the better part of an hour that the court should sit through six hours of the defendants videotaped testimony on the coercion issue now youre saying we shouldnt see any of it am i getting this right freemans calm was unnerving even if it werent so fatally flawed he said the officer who took the confession isnt available to swear to the tapes authenticity and completeness the prosecution fumed and sputtered other officers including several homicide inspectors had been around and even in and out of the interrogation room they could say the tape was accurate the tape looked full and complete it was selfauthenticating a technician could say the tape was unedited behind them bubbled a cauldron of static for a second it seemed that everyone in the courtroom was speaking at once then hills gavel bam bam cracked through it all like a gunshot and created an equally deafening silence hill had had enough he glowered at all the attorneys out over them to the crowd beyond the rail he spoke brusquely the court will take a halfhour recess to consider these and other matters without another word he stood and left the room diz jeff elliot was wheeling himself furiously up the hallway hardy had his hand on the door to the restroom and stopped what did you hear that siren before that last argument i didnt hear anything i did i went out and checked it was abe what was abe though of course he knew uttering an oath of despair he broke for the lobby at a run glitsky wasnt on anybodys witness list he wasnt part of the hearing he wasnt a member of hardys immediate family so hill would not excuse hardy for the afternoon aside from that the session picked up more or less where it left off after a series of suitable disclaimers most notably that he was not ruling on the claim of police coercion and that he most specifically was not ruling the tape inadmissible if the case went to trial hill announced that they would not in fact be viewing the videotape freemans argument had merit he said and he didnt want to get into an openended discussion on the form and content of the tape and if he didnt admit the tape for lack of foundation he wouldnt have to deal with the coercionintoxication issue either he had plenty of other evidence to hold burgess over for trial torrey and pratt kept at it for ten minutes and finally settled for the courts unspoken but unmistakably clear intention to hold the defendant to answer without the tape all in all hardy wasnt sure that freeman had done their client a service by getting the judge to leave out the tape now from the hearings point of view nothing in the record contradicted or even mitigated the force of the circumstantial evidence and they didnt have the tape issue for appeal hill had come to his decision to keep things moving along here up to now the evidence presented was plenty to send cole to trial but hardy was finding it difficult to keep his mind on the hearing and he had to trust freemans instincts he knew nothing about glitsky not even where theyd taken him he didnt know where hed gone for lunch whom hed met he didnt know where treya was although he assumed she had gone with him in the ambulance jeff elliot was going to find out about abe hed know soon enough he had to put it out of his mind there was no time the prosecution had rested hills latest mistreatment had him in high dudgeon a whiteout of a rage he didnt trust himself to speak but right now he had to begin the presentation of his affirmative defense right now he had to call his first witness he was looking at the notes in front of him and heard himself croak out the first name he read sergeant billie oh whod supervised the crime scene unit in maiden lane as she came up through the bar rail and took the oath hardy couldnt muster his thoughts to remember what hed intended to ask her he was still seated at his table everyone was waiting mr hardy the cadaver appeared all out of patience himself if hed had any to begin with sorry your honor he was on his feet moving toward the bench the witness words were coming out of his mouth sergeant oh can you describe for the court please the position of elaine wagers body when you came upon the scene of her death the prosecution immediately and vociferously objected the defense could only present evidence that went to an affirmative defense or contradicted the prosecution case this was not a deposition they argued how could this possibly show that the defendant was not guilty hill had cut hardy as deeply as he was going to however the confession was out the defendant was going to trial and hill wasnt inclined to risk any assignment of error hardy could do his damnedest within any reasonable or unreasonable limits it wouldnt matter hill overruled all the objections ms oh was a precise and careful witness and briefly recounted her facts and impressions without inflection or comment this was what she saw this was how it was when shed finished hardy had recovered enough of his bearings at least to be able to begin was ms wager wearing hosiery sergeant yes she was black nylons and what was the condition of these nylons oh thought for a moment they were in good condition damp where they touched the pavement as the body lay there and of course in the crotch where shed lost her urine was there any damage to the fabric itself no no runs in the nylon no threads coming loose no they were in very good condition yes sergeant oh hardy continued did it occur to you that the victim fell heavily after she was shot as opposed to what to being for example let down easily by her assailant objection calls for a conclusion sustained another line please mr hardy he was wracking his brain for anything else he certainly hadnt gotten any rhythm established with sergeant oh and now couldnt remember why in fact hed wanted to call her at all he believed that whoever had shot elaine had laid her down and that this once had seemed incompatible with the rough treatment shed received when cole had taken her jewelry but now that distinction seemed tenuous at best frivolous at worst he walked back to his table consulted his notes hoped david would come to his rescue with some suggestion anything but the old man simply shrugged win some lose some hardy turned around thank you sergeant to torreys table your witness the prosecutor stood up and walked to the witness box taking his time but hardy didnt have the sense he was stalling certainly as soon as he stopped walking he asked his question sergeant oh from the position of ms wagers body as well as the state of her hosiery would you rule out the possibility that her assailant had forced her to kneel down before he executed her in cold blood no sir i couldnt then she volunteered her first sentence that was the impression i had from the beginning he had to remain in court but he wasnt doing his client any good with inept questioning of his own witnesses with the myriad of details hed been trying to absorb over the past week to say nothing of his immediate concern over glitsky hed overlooked at least one other very much more obvious and ominous interpretation of the facts at the beginning of it all glitsky had put the bug in his ear about elaines killer breaking her fall and hed come to accept it as the truth and torrey had just killed him on it he had to be more careful but he wasnt sure that he had it in him again he stood again he called a witness daniel medrano this time he wondered if he should pass the questioning off to freeman but before hed made any conscious decision he was moving toward the witness box officer medrano you and your partner were the first unit on the scene were you not the policeman could have been stalins twin the square and swarthy face the heavy black mustache he appeared nervous on the stand possibly because of his inclusion as a defense witness hardy knew from his earlier interview with him that this was the most notorious crime he had worked in his years as a cop but there was no help for that yes we were can you tell the court exactly what you saw sure my partner officer petrie and i were cruising downtown and we came upon a figure hunched over another one in maiden lane we hit him with our searchlight and a man turned and began to run i was on the passenger side and got out identified myself as a police officer and took off in pursuit go on he had maybe ten yards on me but it was pretty dark and he ran into a fire hydrant and went sprawling and i was able to apprehend him and put on handcuffs and do you recognize the man you caught that night in this courtroom yes the defendant cole burgess over there all right now officer medrano in the course of this chase did you hear anything unusual yes sir would you please tell the court what that was well this was the part medrano hated it disagreed with his partners report although not his testimony since torrey had neglected to ask him about it but to his credit he delivered it straight there was a gunshot about when the suspect went down then i heard the gun clatter on the street and i eventually saw it and brought it back with me are you saying the defendant shot at you no i dont think so he didnt stop or turn he was just running and hit the hydrant and went sailing and the gun went off like when he hit the ground are you certain it was a gunshot and not a car backfiring or something like that it was a gunshot i saw the flash i even heard the ricochet it was a gunshot he repeated all right officer medrano thank you for some reason that hardy couldnt fathom pratt rose this time for the prosecutions crossexamination a couple of small clarifications officer she began gently with a welcoming smile you and your partner officer petrie discussed this gunshot didnt you he didnt hear it he was in the pratt held up a hand stopping him you discussed it yes and he said he didnt hear it yes thank you another smile now when you came upon the defendant hovering over the body in the alley did you see him reach to pick up anything in the street medrano was back visualizing the moment no you dont remember him reaching down into the gutter and picking up any object say the gun for example no so he must have been holding the gun already isnt that so he must have then he just stood up and started running hardy spoke up objection speculation calls for a conclusion the cadaver sustained him struck the answer pratt went sailing right along did the defendant run well a genial grunt medrano was back testifying for the right side and he was much more comfortable way better than me in fact officer medrano was the defendant pulling away from you when he ran into the fire hydrant yes he was fast he wasnt staggering or lurching or anything like that then no the guy was a bullet a bullet thank you officer no further questions jeff elliot had been working without any merit raise for the past three years and he decided this was as good a time as any to demand one he and his editor were already discussing things and he thought he might be back at work as early as next week in the meantime though the examiner had delighted and surprised him by making him an offer to bring city talk to them the democrat notwithstanding the examiner was the chronicles afternoon competitor and jeff thought a guest column or two in it would dramatically enhance his negotiations with the chronicle besides hardy and freeman had handed him the column at lunch now midafternoon on wednesday he was in the reporters lounge on the third floor of the hall of justice typing on a manual from the notes hed taken a couple of hours before the examiner was paying him a full weeks wages for the one column he was smiling as he wrote citytalk by jeffrey elliot in the interests of full disclosure i hereby reveal that lawyer dismas hardy is a personal acquaintance of mine even a friend currently he is defending my brotherinlaw cole burgess in a preliminary hearing in department of municipal court cole is charged with the murder of elaine wager the prosecution is being handled by the district attorney herself sharron pratt and by her chief assistant and majordomo gabriel torrey mr hardy is one of the sources of some of the information contained in this column when he is not personally trying murder cases mr torreys daytoday work involves overseeing the flow of civil and criminal cases brought through the district attorneys office before the courts in this role he is in a unique position to assign cases to the courts calendars to settle disputes without reference to the courts and to either dismiss criminal cases outright for any number of reasons including lack of evidence police misconduct inability to locate witnesses etc or to negotiate plea bargains his word is law to every da in the office except sharron pratt this reporter has learned of at least two cases where a criminal case has been brought by ms pratts office against an individual who was also being sued in a civil matter in both cases mr torrey offered to broker a deal whereby the district attorney would drop the criminal charges in exchange for a large dollar settlement in the civil matter the attorney handling the civil matters in both cases is dash logan one of the citys more colorful and controversial figures regular readers of this column in the chronicle might remember the story of mr logans brief arrest last year after a short car chase that ensued after his car ran a red light narrowly missing two pedestrians in front of the virgin records building on market the district attorney declined to press charges related to this incident for two reasons the brakes in mr logans car appeared to have been tampered with he apparently could not have stopped if he wanted to and the bloodalcohol report was mislaid todays column will describe the first of these cases tomorrows will deal with the second case and a set of circumstances startlingly similar to the first rich mcneil is a yearold vice president of terranew industries here in town he owns a sixstory apartment building on the the open hallway outside the courtroom hardy doubletiming to the phones he had to find out a young asian man vaguely familiar tapping him on the shoulder paul thieu he said extending a hand homicide it had been an excruciating fifteen minutes since hill had adjourned court for the day hardy had felt the heat in his face and knew that his blood pressure was off the charts the endless minutiae made unbearable by his haste to get away but he had had to stay around to give his client encouragement instruct his troops freeman jody jeff elliot hed finally closed his briefcase made excuses he really had to go now and now this he steeled himself to ask have you heard from glitsky a nod i know where he is they took him back to st marys even though it was farther away they wanted him to have the same doctor any word beyond that the hospital couldnt tell me anything i called the ambulance company i called all the ambulance companies till i got the right one he was alive when he hit the er thanks hardy was moving again mr hardy thieu closed the gap between them i had lunch with abe today he said quietly id be grateful if you could go with me out to my car in the back he read hardys reluctance his impatience abe thought it might be important and hes not going anywhere you know the simple truth of it hit him youre right this way they took the inside steps to the back door walked the long corridor that took them by the jail and dr strouts office got to a beatup old orange datsun in the lot thieu looked around they were the only people back here he went to the passenger door and opened it up hop in he said hardy did as he was told thieu was on the drivers side and started the engine if your cars around here ill take you to it in the stillwarm gathering dusk they pulled out of the lot thieu reached into his jacket and pulled out a few pages folded into thirds he handed them to hardy what are these glitsky asked for them its the lab and crime scene report on the cullen alsop overdose im afraid theres no smoking gun though at least not one that i see but he wanted to go through it with a comb glitsky wanted these turn left up here what for thieu hung the turn glanced across the seat im not sure maybe he thought visser would have left some trace maybe a print i dont know but no such luck hardy sat up the jolt felt almost like electricity visser gene visser yeah what about him another glance maybe to see if hardy was teasing him but paul recognized genuine intensity when he saw it and he thought maybe hardys look at the moment could penetrate steel you dont know any of this i know gene visser hardy said but i dont know what hes got to do with cullen alsop paul thieu put his foot on the brake weve got to pull over a minute he said have a little talk dresslers syndrome abe explained its like a heart attack only better in the sense that its not a heart attack a lot better treya agreed way way better it was now just after six thirty at night and they were gathered around the kitchen table back at glitskys place raney and orel were doing homework in front of the television set in the back room and the laugh track filtered up to the kitchen when hardy had finished with thieu his mind reeling with the possibilities and finally got back to his car he made it out to st marys in twenty minutes only to find that glitsky had been examined by dr campion given a few tests and then after a couple of hours released hardy had called frannie from the hospital and she told him that shed heard from abe and he was all right hed gone home even though it was date night hardy drove straight there and found glitsky sitting up dressed finishing dinner hardy wanted to punch his lights out for all the worry hed put him through i called glitsky said i left messages everywhere he was fine his doctor told him that there was probably some inflammation in the membrane near the area of his heart attack that was all dresslers syndrome which mimicked the symptoms of a heart attack was not uncommon in patients whod had a real one glitsky was taking some new medication for it now and the worrisome chest pain should be completely gone in a couple of days meanwhile the connections in this case had started to present themselves and a sense of urgency hung in the room hardy handed over thieus lab reports to glitsky saying you know those chemists who used to predict that an element should exist because it fitted the theory and then they find it thats what im feeling like around this with visser no with dash logan abe and treya exchanged looks i give up abe said tightly wound hardy had been standing all this time now he pulled a chair around and straddled it backwards in one way this ties up the whole package he said this puts visser with torrey with logan theyre all together glitsky was half reading excerpts of the lab stuff and now he abandoned them and sat back in his chair all together in what hardy eyes alight with his enthusiasm ran down the list of his suspicions torrey logan and visser constituted a triumvirate that were working together to settle cases by coercion certainly they had all figured overtly in hardys dealings with rich mcneil hardy wouldnt be at all surprised to learn and he intended to put one of the musketeers on it tomorrow that the private investigator whod dug up the alleged dirt on gina roakes client abby oberlin had been visser as well that case was logans too he was acting on behalf of abbys brother on the will contest and then torrey comes up with a settlement offer on that now finally we get visser with cullen alsop ok thats visser but im missing something treya said how is logan with cullen then a smile of triumph he was at jupiter drinking with visser when cullen picked up his payment the bag of heroin glitsky said exactly this all fits abe theyre together in this theyve got to be glitsky the cop clucked unconvinced that old got to be youd be surprised how often it doesnt are you saying you think one of these clowns killed cullen visser supplied him with uncut smack he used it he died id call that killing him but why would they do that treya asked because torrey had fed him a false story about elaines murder weapon my own belief is that cullen never even had possession of the gun much less gave it to cole but torrey needed that fact then cullen got greedy or stupid or they suddenly realized that as a witness the kid was going to suck hed crack under any kind of vigorous cross maybe hed sell them out as easily as he sold out cole or maybe torrey set up cullen as a witness without telling visser and visser vetoed the plan by helping cullen od so totally unreliable junkie completely expendable adios glitsky remained skeptical to say the least youre saying the chief assistant district attorney of the city and county of san francisco had him killed somebody did lord creativity thrives here in the new millennium glitskys arms were crossed the scar tight through his lips and the proof of any of this is hardy acknowledged the problem with a nod its out there somewhere we just havent found it abe flicked the lab report well its not here not that i see no sign that visser was even there except for what falk saw which was nothing i asked falk saw cole go to the bathroom at jupiter and then visser go into the same bathroom which last time i checked was legal but treya interjected then why were you going to see visser this afternoon abe you must have thought something similar glitsky answered gently i wanted to ask him about ridley thats all but hardy couldnt let it go this would be the same ridley who told me that wherever he was going on that last night it was on this those were his words on this on cullen and therefore on elaine and it might have been that last visit but we dont know that was visser either do we hardys face was set its got to be thats where we started here diz got to be got to be when the fact is it doesnt have to be at all listen he continued its not like i dont think its wellargued and provocative but i havent even caught a whiff of one piece of evidence a long silence settled everyone in their thoughts finally treya broke it ive got a question diz hardy looked into her face six one one eightythree a silly little grin coursing the features of his copperlined face glitsky added he covered her hand on the table with his own never tell this guy you got a question he always does that not always hardy argued sometimes i say ive got an answer and then you go what is it and i say babe ruth nineteen twentyseven or the circumference divided by the diameter something like that its really fun abe said in a monotone youd be surprised i bet i would treya replied that for example just now was more fun than ive had all day see what i mean glitsky asked its always like that it never ends ok hardy relented whats the real question treya hesitated but she had to ask are you saying you think maybe one of these three people killed elaine and for this finally the crux of it hardy had to stop and think i think while she was doing her special master work she found something incriminating at logans office logan drunk or coked up or both just turned her loose on his files both of you told me that remember anyway i think what she found was the kind of evidence weve been talking about here the proof that abe says we dont have about what these guys have been doing he paused i dont know what happened then maybe she threatened torrey with exposure or asked logan what was going on or they just realized she must have seen something and what then visser killed her abe had his arms crossed again he was at full length in the chrome and weave kitchen chair his legs outstretched a muscle in his jaw clenched and unclenched i dont know hardy said then added somberly maybe he killed ridley too we dont know that ridleys dead yet treya said hopefully hardy looked at her levelly yes we do he said softly abe glitsky nodded probably well then she looked from one to the other we should same problem glitsky said we need evidence and visser used to be a homicide inspector he knows the tricks he isnt going to leave much hardy stood went over to the refrigerator and opened it up then stopped and turned ive got one for you treya are any of the musketeers on the special master list she rubbed her eyes all of them i think we were talking about it why because the case elaine was working on in logans office is still open i checked with thomasino it might be worth taking a look do it glitsky came forward excitedly up on his feet hardy gave him a baleful look ive got to check for sure but i think ive got other commitments over the next day or two then to treya but im thinking one of the kids hardy was gone at last and rita kicked abe and treya out of the kitchen so she could do the dinner dishes together in the cramped living room with barely room to turn around without touching one another they cast about for the better part of five minutes looking for ways to ignore the sexual tension that hummed like a guywire between them since the first night they hadnt even kissed and in those first moments that is all they had done treya found her purse and pulled out the two sheets of folded paper shed torn from the yellow legal pad shed been using at lunch you were talking to diz about evidence abe and you really havent even looked at the box that curtis brought back from tiburon there might be something there i already looked in it he said defensively im not being defensive she gave him an expression hed already come to think of as the thousandyearold look as though shed known him that long i did go through it trey he insisted and got to lorettas picture and stopped didnt you in fact he had taken it entirely out of the box in hardys building and laid it face down on the solarium table he didnt want to see lorettas face to be reminded of elaines mother especially now that he was beginning to be involved with treya for the truth was loretta had been in his life more recently than a quarter century before only four years ago she had waltzed back in and from his perspective tried to restake her ancient claim to his heart and starving for contact after flos death hed almost let her have it it shamed him still he didnt need the reminder of how close hed come how weak hed been how for loretta it had all been a calculated lie treya was altogether different he told himself nothing about her was the same and she was right he was being foolishly defensive he held out his hand the corners of his mouth up fractionally ok let me see the darn list he opened the pages and stopped immediately whats this first thing empty drawer their legs happened to be close enough to touch when she sat on the couch i didnt want to forget that so i just wrote it first she told him about the discussion when curtis had first mentioned it but what does it mean abe asked we couldnt figure it out but all new theories are welcome giving it a minute he finally shrugged and went back to her list she got up then saying she was going in to check on the kids maybe help rita with the dishes treya wasnt comfortable with somebody else waiting on her so she was in the kitchen an apron around her speaking reasonable spanish to glitskys housekeeper and drying a serving platter when glitsky appeared back in the kitchen doorway at the bottom of the first page he said whats this unknown key he crossed the kitchen and showed her what shed written oh ive got that she said its in my purse with apologies to rita she put down her towel and reappeared a minute later it was in the glove compartment of elaines car which was parked down under r and j in the garage jon found it i think and threw it in the box do you know what it is yeah glitsky said i think i do we shouldnt be doing this anymore abe its almost eleven thirty you need to get some rest i doubt it im not going to get any rest anyway not until we find where this key goes are you sure its a locker a brisk nod yep then he looked over at her reached a hand across the seat to touch her thigh im sorry he said and added in a reasonable tone i can take you home and come back and do this myself she gave him the thousand year look again the long smile in your dreams lieutenant thats not what i dream he looked at her besides we can blame rita she kicked us out its her fault she only kicked us as far as the living room where you had me look at your list which brings us here but the kids the kids are fine if this turns out to be something trey we need it yesterday you know she nodded accepting it i know well then the bus station was closest to his home and had by far the largest bank of lockers downtown but glitsky thought a better first bet might be the union square garage a hundred yards from where elaine had been killed but the key fitted none of the lockers there then since they were so close they walked a block to the downtown center garage with the same lack of result glitsky knew this search was quite possibly futile and even stupid it was the kind of thing that as a lieutenant if it was important enough he would assign to three or four teams of officers and give them a week the city must have a couple of thousand rental lockers maybe more and it wasnt even certain that this key was from a san francisco locker but he felt he had to try they might get lucky at the bus station as they swung by on the way home close to midnight on a wednesday night and the area around the bus station he noted as he illegally parked was in its usual gala finery he hadnt had occasion to visit the place in five years but it looked smelled and felt now as it had back then he took treyas hand against the vagrants and the noise the pervasive loneliness and desperation the loudspeaker cut through the snoop doggy dog rap to announce the arrival of a bus from bakersfield and a baby started crying on one of the plastic chairs over to his left he and treya shared a look and decided that this was it they would try again tomorrow he could probably just go to paul thieu first thing who would take one look at the key and tell him it was obvious from the distinctive red plastic top upon which was printed the number which was there in front of them on the bottom row in the third bank back from the entrance and suddenly the rap music and the crying and the smell of loneliness were gone he put the key in and turned inside was a small black anonymous flight bag of the kind used by flight attendants on top of that was a sheaf of stuff bound by a thick rubber band glitsky reached in and took it out into the light stripping off the rubber band on top was a passport and under that a rather thick booklet of hundreddollar travelers checks then documents in an airline ticket pouch from alitalia airlines did she mention going to italy treya was counting the money but she looked up from that thought a moment shook her head no glitsky paused in his search you know what this is dont you this is the empty drawer he began to flip through the rest of the pile which seemed to consist mainly of envelopes bills mostly to the phone company pg e a couple of credit cards macy s and then at the bottom one last envelope stamped addressed in a firm hand to abraham glitsky at his home address dear lieutenant glitsky abe dad funny isnt it you know what im talking about although weve never talked about it isnt that funny or perhaps it isnt not really there is no return address on this letter because by the time you get it ill be gone and where it came from will have no meaning but now that i am gone i wanted you to know that i dont plan to return at least not soon maybe never why do i want to tell you any of this because you are my only blood relative does blood even mean anything anymore i dont know theres so much i dont know it makes me wonder what all the education was about if its left me so ignorant on the important things you didnt have any part in raising me the person i knew as my father dana was older and distracted but i think he must have suspected something and i cant say we were terribly close maybe this explains some of my problems with men mostly older men hoping to get the affection of the father i never had again i dont know ive reread this to here and realize that it sounds a little like im attaching some blame to you about all this but please its not that i know you had no idea about me until recently i believe if youd known youd have taken some role i just believe that it seems to be who you are after you found out and i knew that you knew at first i didnt really understand why you didnt come to me thats true and it hurt me as i suppose you might imagine but then eventually it came to feel right that it was ok wed see each other at work from time to time and got along pretty well i admired you and think you felt the same about me at least i hope you did you had your own family your boys see i know all about them my halfbrothers but i had my life busy and public and personally a mess you didnt need any part of it believe me i think you made a wise decision and with all the older men i was searching to connect with who id try to please at work and then need to go further make it personal chris locke then gabe aaron rand well i dont have to give you the litany but these and so many more half my clients and all of them went nowhere they couldnt go anywhere i was too needy and demanding and screwed up i think thats really why i never came to you either it was the one sacred thing a part of me wishes that we could have talked at least acknowledged what we were to each other although something else tells me that this would have been a bad decision too like so many of the rest of them i could somehow just keep you best by not saying anything i could watch how you kept your dignity and handled the losses over mom over your wife all the losses and maybe i could learn something from that i came to see it as though you were talking to me that way by example and as long as we had no acknowledged relationship i could keep you as mine and not make all my usual mistakes does this make any sense the truth is abe that i dont really fit in my life here and i never have oh i know it seems like i did my mother the senator and her connections it was all laid out for me who i was and what role id play the politics who id become so i finished law school and went right to work here for the da and chris locke and i well you knew about that i thought he loved me i know i did love him but after that after chris and mom were dead the bottom just fell out id done everything to please mom then to please chris and suddenly neither of them were there anymore and all the reasons i had for doing what i was doing just disappeared and then the awful truth began to emerge that i wasnt who they thought i was after all id never been that person inside but id also never taken any time for myself to figure things out that if i wasnt that then what was i the only thing i knew the only reference id ever lived with was moms and she was happy with it because it was who she was this political animal she got her identity and selfworth by her causes and issues by keeping busy and connected you volunteered you did good works you fought for the oppressed and that was the secret to a happy life but abe it wasnt my life it was lorettas and then suddenly she was gone and i was the heir apparent having to live it to be it to be the reincarnation of my mother fulltime fullbore everybody wanted me to step in fill her shoes continue her work its not the kind of thing you realize right away that youre living a lie that the whole thing isnt you but you get enough headaches and cramps and you stop sleeping because youre living two or three separate no contradictory lives and eventually even if youre not the most insightful person in the world a few years go by and you start to get a clue but what do you do all the tapes are running you cant just drop everything at once especially if your entire personality is that you aim to please you tell some school where you volunteer to teach or a neighborhood council youre organizing or even your boss that you need to cut back on your workload and get some time and perspective and its like youre speaking a foreign language give us just one more class elaine one more term on the board one more highprofile client and if youre me when it finally comes to it you agree to stay on because you need their approval all their approvals in your deepest heart you need them to like you youre nothing if youre not pleasing someone you need to be loved so you tell yourself no not you i so i kept telling myself it would be soon id stop for a while step off the treadmill nothing so drastic as a complete change of career but a long vacation to figure out a new plan a different approach and meanwhile every single day so miserably unhappy im cheating on my fiance hes cheating on me my boss is betraying me i find out that another one of my mentors who in the past i trusted confided in worked with depended on even of course slept with heres another betrayal more cheating now there was no integrity even in the system that id worked so hard on behalf of that i still wanted to believe in but no longer could the whole thing the career my private life the law itself abe none of it was working and suddenly i knew i couldnt take another hit i was in the wrong place doing the wrong things it was going to kill me i had to change it all i couldnt tell a soul not even my dear paralegal a woman named treya ghent shed be wise and tell me i could stay and change and work things out but i dont believe thats true not anymore ive lost all my faith in this life there was so much i couldnt even tell her cheating on jonas other things i couldnt have borne her disapproval most of all so im gone it is the right thing and i am happy a clean break no explanations to anyone with their agendas for me except this to you it isnt anything to do with you love your daughter elaine they both read it in the bus station then took the packet and the suitcase out to the car on the way home they started to dissect the startling revelations elaine had been leaving the country anyway the alitalia ticket was for a am flight the morning after shed been shot gabe torrey aaron rand clarence jackmans partner half her clients but eventually the weight of it all became too much and they both fell silent the duplex was still when they got in they discovered that raney had crashed on the sofa in front of the tube orel had gone into his room and now slept fully clothed and openmouthed on the top of his bed out in the dark living room rita snored lightly on her foldabed in the corner behind her pier one imports fauxjapanese screen they read it again this time together at glitskys kitchen table the one light on directly over their heads when they got to the last line treya put a hand over abes and squeezed it she read it aloud it isnt anything to do with you i know that he said my mind knows that he let out a long breath tell me its too late to call diz would you she looked behind him at the clock above the oven its too late to call diz she said do you think the other man the betrayal of the system she talks about was gabe torrey yep i think she found something at dash logans just as dismas said maybe parts of it she tapped the letter so what do you want to do with this glitsky shook his head it was a serious consideration i dont know well it was addressed to you i know if shed dropped it in a mailbox and it got delivered it would be my property and i could keep it he sighed but she didnt get to do that so its got to be evidence oh its evidence all right if i was working as a cop right now he paused pushed back his chair and turned toward her but forget the legalities trey this is personal id really like to know what you think she faced him and said if making it public would correct some of the problems she wrote about shed want you to show it the corners of his mouth lifted slightly i keep waiting for you to come up with a wrong answer raney does too her tired eyes sparked for an instant youll have to get in line so meanwhile what do we do glitsky knew the answer to that diz has got to get it in front of the judge if she was sleeping with half her clients if she was leaving the country the next day then it need not have been random no he said heavily it never was abe stared at the floor between his shoes a shiver went through him and he lifted his face inches now from hers you know my problem whats your problem a lot of times like with elaine i dont say things when i should she reached out and cupped his hands in hers met his eyes waited but ive got to ask you she brought her mouth to his her hands to his face when she pulled away ten seconds later she whispered to him that would be a yes in the minutes before department convened the cadavers chambers vibrated with anger and accusations torrey was on his feet pacing in front of hills desk the days issue of the examiner in his hand as a prop never in my time as a prosecutor have i ever seen this kind of irresponsible slander i thought id seen defense attorneys pull every outrageous stunt in the books but this with friends like dash logan i bet you have hardy interjected mildly he was standing by the door both david freeman and sharron pratt claimed pride of place and sat in the armchairs arranged on the rug in front of hill the court reporter since every word uttered in a capital case is on the record sat with her machine to the judges right tapping away torrey turned on his heel lashing out im not talking about dash logan im talking about this libelous so sue me hardy moved forward toward the judge your honor excuse me but so what a reporter wrote a factual story that doesnt bear on this case a factual story my ass theres nothing but mr torrey hill boomed as with hardy in chambers the day before the judge projected a much more powerful persona here in his room than he showed on the bench again he was not yet in his robes and the business suit added to the aura of power im goddamned tired of listening to profanity day in and day out so we wont have any more of it here all right im sorry your honor but hill held up a finger spoke sternly with the volume still up no buts im tired of it thats the end of it torrey no place to go threw a malevolent glance at hardy pulled himself to his full height and stiffly walked over to the one window sharron pratt watched him with sympathy then shifted in her chair and came back to the judge her voice all smooth reason what gabes saying has merit though your honor mr hardy is named as a source in this column surely he could have exercised a little restraint in his dealings with the press while this hearing was going on how many times do i have to say it hardy leaned against the bookshelves arms crossed and casual although it was far from how he felt the article doesnt have anything to do with this case your honor i had no idea exactly when mr elliot was going to run it and there isnt a word in it that isnt factual torrey pounced again thats a lie i never offered you a deal hardy was mild the article doesnt say you did well it damn well implies it realizing what hed done torrey faced the judge sorry your honor hill waved it off thats how you read it of course hardy replied if the shoe fits a shrug all right gentlemen thats enough hill arranged some pens on his blotter ms pratt ive given both you and mr torrey more than a reasonable opportunity to vent your displeasure at mr hardy but hes right this article has nothing to do with the case at hand and we are here in chambers at his request not yours do you mind if we proceed he turned to hardy and what you have does presumably bear here is that correct yes your honor it does he leaned over and undid the clasp of his briefcase then extracted several sheets of paper and held them tantalizingly last night lieutenant glitsky was reviewing some property of elaine wagers that had been brought to my office my lord your honor torrey exploded again marching forward what does mr hardy think hes doing now by what right does he gain possession of ms wagers property lieutenant glitsky has already been placed on disciplinary leave for interfering in this case and cannot serve any kind of search warrant on her or anybody else this is completely improper totally beyond the pale hardy calmly addressed the judge if mr torrey could keep his wellpressed shirt on your honor there was no search warrant we asked ms wagers fiance if we could take a look through her condominium he said yes simple as that torrey grunted with displeasure i dont think so freeman jumped in why not gabe why wouldnt he want to help us find some clue as to who might have killed her we know who killed her torrey snapped no i dont think we do freeman replied pratt ignored that exchange and leaned forward i have a question for mr hardy youre the one who brought up lieutenant glitsky is he working for you on this matter hardy shrugged as you say hes on leave he can do what he wants and it appears he wants to know who killed elaine wager naturally anything he finds will be made available to you we already have a police file on that mr hardy from lieutenant glitskys own department hardy shrugged lieutenant glitsky thinks the police may have made a mistake and that youve painted yourself into a political corner he borrowed one of freemans smiles so you contend that lieutenant glitskys involvement here is what somehow to protect the police department from its own ineptitudes im sure theres a little of that yes but mostly something else oh whats that next to pratt freeman clucked shed just asked another question to which she didnt know the answer and it was always always a bad idea hardy looked at pratt at torrey finally at the judge your honor lieutenant glitsky is was elaine wagers father after several seconds of absolutely dead air torrey found his voice my god he said incredulous is there no end to it it appears that messrs hardy and freeman will go to any lengths of fabrication to muddy the waters here this has got to be the most ridiculous words failing him he made some dismissive noise then turned to the judge for commiseration your honor please by now though hill was fully engaged whatever else was going on here this was as unusual a set of facts as hed ever dealt with if they were facts he turned to hardy ready to strike at the first sign of nonsense im very much hoping you have proof of this counsel of course your honor he approached the desk with his papers as i began to say so long ago now last night lieutenant glitsky was looking over some of elaines property that had been brought down to my office among the items was a key that he recognized as belonging to a public locker he kept talking loath to give anyone a chance to interrupt him again as it turned out this locker was located in the bus station and lieutenant glitsky opened it he held up a hand stopping torrey before he could start he is her next of kin your honor and not acting as a police officer there was no question of his needing a warrant he was perfectly within his rights in any event the locker contained many of elaines personal items but also a handwritten letter addressed to lieutenant glitsky torrey could restrain himself no longer oh please but hardy could see that hill was still with him and continued a copy of which i have with me the original is in a safe place and can be made available to the court at short notice several references in this letter bear strongly upon this case your honor and i wanted to bring them to the courts attention at the earliest possible moment to what end mr hardy if this is evidence present it at the hearing in your case in chief if its not i dont want to hear about it here or anywhere else your honor freeman came slowly up from his chair with respect ive seen the document and believe it raises issues that address whether or not the district attorneys office should recuse itself or you should recuse it entirely from this case pratt under her breath youve got to be joking not at all sharron freeman turned to her we believe the ag is much more objectively situated to prosecute this case your honor there is evidence of personal animus here that ive heard enough talking hill interrupted weve got a hearing in the real world out there and id like to get back to it someday mr hardy lets see what youve got you make a motion if youve got one and ill make a ruling of course i knew the judge wouldnt force them to recuse the fact that torrey used to have a personal relationship with her sometime in the past isnt enough even if we could prove it without hearsay as his honor astutely noted freeman was in high spirits trying to bring cole up to date at the defense table while they waited for judge hill to enter the courtroom again after the long adjournment to chambers besides we need a written motion notice to the ag and a whole lot more than weve got david displayed a slight edge of disappointment that cole had felt he had to ask why theyd requested the das dismissal from the case but it wasnt enough to dull his pleasure in the result and there was no way pratt was taking herself out of this ok and yet you asked them both to do it anyway because saddened by the thickness of his slow student freeman went into teacher mode because we needed the judge to see that letter cole we needed him to know as a fact that glitsky was elaines father thats why him helping your defense bucking his own police force is so significant we also needed him to know that our friend mr torrey slept with her but mostly it goes to his character which weve been trying to get out for reasons that mr hardy might be better able to explain because say what you will torrey outranked elaine and in our culture that smells enough like sexual harassment to make hill wonder also just between you and me it didnt hurt for pratt to hear about his little indiscretion either basically freemans smile was terrible to behold were just screwing with them cole screwing with them because they screwed with us were showing them this case isnt going to be a political victory lap ending with you on death row and indeed across the courtroom the two prosecutors were studiously not talking sitting as far apart as they could possibly get as they arranged their water glasses and other important items on their table but the most important reason by far really wasnt any of that since we really dont have a shred of evidence that somebody else in fact killed elaine the next best thing is to prove that elaines life was at least troubled and complicated she had man trouble work trouble law trouble personal issues she might have been killed by an unlucky random event like a mugger thats true but now its definitely in his mind and very strongly that she wasnt your average jane doe walking back to her office on a sunday night with so much going wrong in her life so much obvious angst that she was actually leaving the country on the next day what would you think id think its a pretty big coincidence that she got killed that night right it makes the odds a lot better that one of these people had a reason to kill her he shrugged to tell the truth though cole i dont want to bring you down but none of it proves anything really certainly it doesnt prove that you didnt do it and thats the whole point here but its got to give the judge some pause at least and that in turn will maybe give us a little more stage to dance on and that my friend thats the name of the game glitsky the cop had his own jobs this morning his vision had shifted since hed read his daughters letter and suddenly hardys theory of the previous night played to all the unrelated variables elaine had discovered something someone she trusted had recently made her lose all faith in the law she had once slept with gabe torrey she was in the middle of an investigation involving dash logan who hung with visser whod been with cullen alsop this was no longer a universe of possibilities they were no longer searching the city for an anonymous trigger man glitsky could concentrate his efforts on limited targets hardys theory might yet prove unfounded but before he would abandon it now abe was going to test its limits neither comfortable nor welcome at the hall of justice he set himself up in the solarium everyone on the team with the addition of jan falk had checked in by seven thirty hed passed around the letter told the story by eight amy wu was off with gina roake to interview the various witnesses whod come forward in the abby oberlin will contest if gene visser had threatened any of these people curtis rhodin had a good friend in the attorney generals office hardy and freeman thought that curtis could talk to his pal and bring him up to speed with the confluence of all these events elaine had been looking at logans files when shed been killed the ags office didnt have even a remotely good relationship with the da anyway based on torreys relationship to the murder victim it might be disposed to believe that logans files held evidence of a da coverup of some kind that had somehow resulted in a murder it was all nebulous and unfounded but it was also provocative and a capital murder and these traits tended to get a judges attention they were hoping for a search warrant on logans office and this time not a warrant directed at a few folks who happened to be logans clients but at logans whole practice at logan himself this was a long shot since they had no active case but at the very least it might shake up the principals and force one of them to do something rash jon ingalls was going to find both visser and logan and serve subpoenas on them so that they would be in the courtroom if hardy got to where he needed to call them then accompanied by treya and maybe glitsky after he finished some phone calls ingalls was going to check with more restaurants and hotels glitsky was convinced that somebody must have seen elaine that night he didnt believe shed been walking alone through a deserted downtown at am shed been walking with her killer but glitsky hardy and freeman were all in accord that their best shot not only of finding any evidence but of introducing this entire line of inquiry at the hearing lay in the cullen alsopridley banksgene visserjan falk connection whatever that might be falk was going over to court with hardy and freeman a critical link should they need him he hated torrey and the whole da apparatus and was on their side an invaluable police witness who was hostile to the prosecution but hating wasnt going to be enough and glitsky was on the phone to paul thieu now pitching his idea copies of the lab and crime scene reports on cullen alsop that thieu had managed to get were in front of him right he was saying i know that but the lab wasnt looking for any specific print were they abe thieu kept his tone reasonable he wanted to help because he liked and respected glitsky but he had to keep an extremely low profile or his own position would be threatened and going to the lab on a murder case to which he was not assigned and asking for a rush reanalysis of their data wasnt low profile it would get around the building what am i supposed to ask them it was a room in a flophouse i read the report too they didnt clean the place too often there were dozens of good prints the maids past tenants you name it theyre not going to run every print in the room but on the bag itself paul im reading it right in front of me there was another print that wasnt cullens one thieus frustration came through the wires it wasnt computer quality abe and it didnt match anybody who was around or lived nearby when the police arrived no match i know but if a print was clear enough it could be run against the database this was the state computer file of people with criminal records against which the lab compared crime scene fingerprints it was a useful database that could produce matches quickly and cheaply but you needed a nice clean print the print on the bag was partial and blurry enough for a skilled and trained human to compare but not for the computer youre telling me you want to do a hand search with this itll take a month and no a single comparison visser thats all this wasnt that difficult a request visser was a private investigator and a former policeman his fingerprints would be on file thieu was sure he could find a set of them somewhere possibly even in the homicide detail itself and run them to the lab for comparison within a half hour although how long theyd take to get to it dont ask glitsky commanded tell in the courtroom hardy was taking all the time he could with the death of cullen alsop on the stand was saul westbrook the young public defender so mr alsop was in jail for six days before he informed you that hed struck a deal with the district attorney with regard to this information about the murder weapon is that right yes and during those six days did you have an opportunity to meet with him westbrook looked into his lap and consulted some notes hed brought with him i met with him twice once here in the hall of justice and then again the next day in the afternoon at the jail and were these long discussions the first one here at court wasnt too long we talked about his plea his parole situation logistics and how about the second one at the jail was that longer again the young man consulted his notes yes we talked for a little under an hour and during that discussion did the name of the defendant in this case cole burgess come up yes it did the two men were acquaintances cullen heard hed been arrested for murder and wanted to know if i knew anything about it and what did you tell him only what id read that it didnt look too good for him did he mention a gun at all no and yet mr westbrook just four days later you met mr alsop again after his plea bargaining arrangement with the district attorneys office at that time did you mention this oversight to him that he hadnt mentioned the gun to you before yes i did and what was his response he said that he thought it might be incriminating if he told me hed ever had the gun he didnt want to get involved with a murder charge but obviously sometime in the intervening four days he decided that it would be all right to disclose this information after all is that true well apparently that was what he decided but he never discussed this legal matter with you his own attorney no he did not hardy walked back to his table and got himself a sip of water this wasnt going anywhere hed been hoping something would occur to westbrook on the stand that would shake things up a little but hed gotten to here and the well was dry hardy caught freemans eye and after only the slightest hesitation david nodded hardy turned back to the bench your honor my associate has a question or two for this witness if it please the court hill didnt like it but then again he didnt like anything mr hardy you know the rules one witness one lawyer and this is your witness yes your honor and if you wish ill have mr freeman write his questions out for me to ask mr westbrook but in the interests of time exasperation was hills middle name once mr hardy he said wearily just once only once as in never again once mr freeman you may proceed freeman stood at the defense table he spoke with an exaggerated calm mr westbrook youve just testified that mr alsop never discussed this rather significant legal matter with you is that right yes sir and suddenly freemans head came up and he exploded well why not he came around the table charging did you ever ask your client who he talked to about this urgent matter werent you concerned that he just decided on his own to subject himself to the possibility of being charged with murder objection the attack had come out of nowhere and caught torrey flatfooted so it took him a moment to respond and now he stammered out hearsay and speculation but freeman was on his horse galloping his voice still boomed everything about cullen alsops deal with the district attorney his release from jail and his death is supremely relevant the courtroom hung in silence freeman had his hands on his hips facing the judge he was completely out of line and totally confident and hill bought it objection overruled he said freeman bobbed his head curtly thanked the judge then turned and pointed to the naive sweet stunned westbrook you met your client after he made his deal did you not yes sir i did freeman moved up close to the witness box and pressed his attack why didnt you ask him about it i dont know you dont i think you do sir the words flew out staccato fashion you knew that this deal stunk didnt you that it would come back and bite him didnt you flustered unsure of exactly what the question meant westbrook stammered well torrey was up yelling objection as though hed proved an important point freeman spread his arms in triumph yes he said and now it has no further questions i dont know what you did just then david hardy said but it sure was fun to watch the court was in a recess after westbrook stepped down they hadnt left their table although cole had gone back with the bailiff to use the bathroom so they were alone freeman didnt show any sign of glee over his performance he lowered his voice we need a fact here pretty soon or were dead if i were hill capital case or not i would have called it already and our boys going to trial hardy turned around and surveyed the courtroom behind him no glitsky or treya no logan either he thought hed recognize visser if he saw him and didnt the musketeers were out on their errands he drew little circles on the legal pad in front of him he thought he knew so much about this case but for the life of him he couldnt figure a way to get his vital information in front of hill weve got to start talking about these tenuous connections and hope the judge stays interested freeman shook his head disagreeing nope we need facts he repeated now hardy stopped scribbling is ridley banks part of this yet his connection to cullen both of them either dead or missing those are facts unconvinced the old man clucked slim pickins he said but until glitsky or someone else hit some pay dirt it was all they had jan falk was obviously a surprise both to the prosecution and to the judge after hed been sworn in and had described his position as an undercover narcotics officer hill stopped hardy and beckoned him up before the bench mr hardy as far as i can tell your last witness brought nothing of any substance to this party now i have been granting you extraordinary latitude up until now and will continue to do so because of the gravity of this case but im not going to tolerate any more fishing expeditions if youve got something to get out of this witness it had better become damn clear what it is in a short period of time or ill dismiss him am i making myself clear hardy swallowed although his mouth was sand yes your honor treya opened the top lefthand drawer in her old cubicle at rand and jackman it seemed so long since shed worked there her face fell i know i know i know i didnt lose it im just so tired my brains not working glitsky put a hand on her shoulder didnt you get much sleep she turned in the chair and laid a gentle palm against his face stop he kissed her then straightened up and sat against the edge of her desk all right he said lets go back to where you were when she gave it to you i was in her office where weve been looking at files all this time yes elaine got up abruptly glitsky followed her across the hall into the now familiar room where she went and stood by a low file cabinet this was where i was she was carrying her leather shoulder briefcase and came in and she closed her eyes trying to bring it back glitsky content to watch the subtle changes in her face let her be i was holding thats it i had a stack of files i was holding and she threw the briefcase on the desk and took out a manila folder and handed it to me while we were talking her meeting she had to run so it was with your other files she nodded but i was going home too it was almost dinner time she took a breath closed her eyes and first thing next morning i heard about her and then everything else you never filed it they crossed back to her cubicle and she sat again thinking suddenly she spun the seat and slid the chair across the small space to a horizontal bank of metal file cabinets opening the bottom tray she sighed with relief here we go reaching down she pulled out a loose bundle of folders perhaps twenty of them she opened the top folder sighed again and handed it to abe this is the one after she got back from logans it looks like a business ledger a check register she said glitsky was flipping through the xeroxed pages twenty or thirty of them at one of the pages he stopped a puzzled look on his face its missing some entries here he said flipping to the following page a couple more here what do you think thats all about she took the pages and studied them im not sure voided checks maybe she said what do you think i think its funny abe said a little bit funny jan falks testimony had only the most tenuous relationship to cole burgess but by the time hardy was done with him after three oclock in the afternoon he felt certain that hed forged another link in the chain that bound all these disparate elements to the murder of elaine wager over a nearconstant clamor of relevance objections from both pratt and torrey judge hill let hardy make his case the cadaver spouted a constant flow of overruling rationalizations and all of them taken together assumed the force of a mantra mr torrey this is a capital case im going to let it all in and sort it out at the end mr torrey this will go a lot faster if you just let mr hardy do what he has to do yes i realize that defense counsel is arguing his evidence but youre the one asking for the death penalty and if you get it mr torrey every single layer of appellate court in this country is going to review it theyre going to want a complete record of all the issues and i intend to give it to them ms pratt if as you say this line of questioning is irrelevant how could it possibly hurt your case to hear it i know my job mr torrey i will throw out what doesnt belong here youll have to trust me on that but ive told you im allowing extreme latitude here especially after this mornings revelations in ms wagers letter to lieutenant glitsky hardy knew that no judge had ever been reversed for giving the defense what it wanted he couldnt say whether it was jeff elliots examiner article or the judges timetested views of the integrity of the das office or elaines letter but whatever had caused it suddenly the cadaver appeared compelled by the argument that events surrounding cullen alsops overdose were somehow key to coles guilt or innocence hardy had introduced no physical evidence the judge had simply allowed hearsay and argument falk had put gene visser with cullen alsop at the jupiter on the day of his release from jail and subsequent overdose hed disclosed information familiar to narcotics inspectors that substantial quantities of cocaine and heroin seized in arrests of dealers were finding their way back onto the street again he opined that perhaps the evidence lockup room under the hall of justice was not as secure as was generally imagined a recent internal narcotics department audit had revealed for example that in the past twelve months there was a discrepancy of nearly eighteen ounces between the amount of opiates and cocaine logged into evidence and stored downstairs and the amount actually onhand in the case lockers more specifically though falk had testified that banks was going to interview visser on the day of his own disappearance with the inspector still on the stand hardy argued that since two critical witnesses in this case had died or disappeared within the past week more investigation was called for the burden of proof always on the prosecution demanded some explanation for these unusual events in spite of all the objections the prosecution didnt even bother to crossexamine falk what were they going to ask if hed made up any of this stuff they knew he hadnt he was hardys witness and they were evidently happy to see the end of him hill stood up and announced that he would be leaving the bench for fifteen minutes the last recess of the day cole went for a pit stop with the bailiff and hardy and freeman started talking about whether they had enough to make a motion to bifurcate the hearing put it on hold until some of these outstanding issues had been investigated andor resolved but abe and treya had come into the courtroom during the last half hour and glitsky finally having pushed through the gallery and inside the bar rail listened for a minute caught their gist and interrupted i dont think we want to do that as hardy called lab technician nikki waller to the stand suddenly he had the sense that the momentum had truly shifted the lone fact that freeman had so desired had finally appeared the stocky pretty young woman came confidently forward out of the gallery and took the stand with a kind of bright effervescence enthusiasm was rare enough in the courtroom and hardy found himself smiling at her grateful for the attitude and also mostly for the information she possessed he walked her through her introduction and credentials then got directly to the point ms waller did you have occasion recently to examine for fingerprints some of the contents of the room where cullen alsop died yes i did just today hadnt you already done something like that yes she briefly explained the computer problem concluding i didnt have a print good enough to compare to prints already in the system by computer so not too surprisingly i didnt find anything to match although there were a lot of fingerprints in the room isnt that so oh yeah she almost giggled there was no shortage there they were everywhere and then what happened this morning to make you look again well inspector thieu from homicide came to the lab and asked that i check the fingerprints again against a specific individual whose prints were on file and did you do that yes i did ms waller what was the object on which you found the fingerprint she wrinkled her face fetchingly actually it was a piece of scotch tape the inside sticky part which was used to close the baggie that had held the heroin and was it usable it was blurry but usable and did you get a match this time yes sir i did hardy straightened up and inhaled deeply would you please tell the court the name of the person whose fingerprint was on the tape that enclosed the bag of heroin nikki waller looked helpfully up at the cadaver eugene visser on the stand visser was the picture of bluecollar cooperation of course i can explain it this was the junkie in the bathroom right hardy shrugged youre telling the court mr visser not me well visser sat back no sign of tension anywhere first you gotta understand that jupiter is a party place i mean i heard what your last witness was talking about falk and you know ive seen him in there too in the bathroom were not talking about inspector falk right now mr visser were talking about how your thumbprint came to be on a bag of pure heroin that was a vehicle for a young mans death ok sure visser said the short answer then is i picked it up you picked it up im in the bathroom im standing at the urinal its the middle of the afternoon im hearing some noise next to me in the stall but you know how that is you dont exactly go sticking your head over the top and asking how things are going a nervous titter rolled through the gallery anyway next thing i know i hear this person swear like he dropped something and a baggie of white powder shows up at my feet at your feet yeah i dont know he must have kicked it grabbing for it or something but like i was telling you this isnt the first time id seen something like that at jupiter i mean this is an adult place theres a lot of law enforcement types like myself so i figure the kid in the stall maybe hes undercover like your friend falk maybe huh and hes trying to entrap me the gallery found this amusing too so i leaned over picked up the baggie closed it back up with the tape by this time the kids out of the stall coming around frantic going all like wheres my stuff wheres my stuff so i hand it back to him you handed it to him visser smiled all taped up which now take my word for it i wish i hadnt another ripple of laughter and visser acknowledged it almost as though he was doing standup he began to rise out of the witness chair but hardy held up a hand and stopped him mr visser excuse me were not quite done here inspector falk has testified that you went into the bathroom after mr alsop and both of you stayed in there for quite a while perhaps as long as ten minutes would you care to explain that to the court shaking his head at all this silliness visser plopped back down and gave hardy a long and serious look you dont have to believe me but i talked to him you talked to him cullen alsop what about he threw a look to the judge then back to hardy no forget it never mind youd just laugh im not laughing mr visser i assure you please answer the question the private eye fussed with his jacket he took another moment then shrugged i told him he oughta go easy on that stuff that it could kill him behind hardy the gallery hummed again but this time there wasnt any laughter so we talked like a minute five minutes i dont know he seemed like a good kid he told me hed just got out of jail and the first thing he did was get hooked up he knew he should get straight but couldnt seem to do it so i told him just why didnt he take that bag and flush it right then start now and you know for a minute i thought he would i think he really thought about it but then he just said he couldnt do it not yet the big man let out a convincing sigh it was that close he said sadly to keep his temper in check hardy walked across the courtroom then to his table for a sip of water freeman got his attention mouthed let him go the old man sensed that hardy was going to go after him some more with no idea even of what questions he was going to ask much less the answers to them but hardy ignored freeman and by the time he came back to the witness he had himself under control mr visser did you talk with the police regarding this matter yes i did when was that visser made a show of remembering i dont know exactly last wednesday or thursday i think i told the inspector the same thing i told you you talked to an inspector yeah black guy right banks he had me at jupiter with the kid too he came by there the next day after the boy died asking questions then a nonchalant shrug he was just following up where did you see him he came by my office which is down on pier thirtyeight i was working late there and he caught me he asked me the same questions not so specific about the baggie maybe i didnt know i had a print on it but the same basic idea and then what happened hardy was so angry he couldnt stop himself what happened when next hardy snapped after youd finished visser lifted his shoulders let them down theatrically i dont know he left hardy raised his voice are you telling this court that you dont know that inspector banks has been missing from that night on the witness sat back in dismay missing behind him david freeman exploded into a coughing fit evidently hed choked on some water he was drinking and now was hacking with a devastating and awful severity he knocked his glass over on the table there wasnt a person in the courtroom that didnt believe he could be choking to death cole was up patting him on his back the bailiff was moving over hardy remembered the judge asked to be excused for a moment then hustled over freeman seemed to be recovering he looked up caught hardys eye put a finger on his legal pad upon which hed written and underlined a question the dog hardy thought the sneaky brilliant dog slowing him to a stop getting him back into focus he couldnt blow it now because he had been baited into losing his temper hardy stayed a moment longer to make sure that david was breathing again finally freeman stood and apologized and hardy returned to the witness mr visser hardy was speaking too loud now standing too close to the witness in desperation freeman had given him a question that probably broke his own cardinal rule but phrased in such a general way that there could be no wrong answer and maybe just maybe a very good one have you ever had occasion hardy asked to enter the evidence room in the basement of the hall of justice the change of direction wiped the complacency from vissers face yes hardy successfully kept the exultation out of his voice although he thought hed just hit the jackpot and when was the last time you did this visser tried to keep up the show of nonchalance but it wasnt as convincing as it had been i dont know exactly you dont know hardy pressed we can find out in five minutes by calling downstairs mr visser would you like us to do that or do you think you can remember you have to sign in upon entering down there dont you yeah i dont know he repeated a couple of weeks ago maybe maybe less a couple of weeks ago hardy repeated maybe less he caught a glimpse of hill out of one eye the judge had straightened up in his chair and was now leaning in toward the witness a keen intensity had galvanized him now mr visser it is my understanding that a private citizen cannot be admitted into the evidence locker unless they are accompanied by a lawyer or police officer isnt that correct i think so were you so accompanied the last time you were there in the last couple of weeks he couldnt help repeating yeah i usually go with some lawyer im working with something like that and two weeks ago who was that for the first time the facade weakened visser looked to the floor then drew a nervous hand over his jawline i think it probably must have been dash logan he said you think are you sure another pause yeah im sure it was dash logan mr logan hardy began when you went to the evidence locker within the past couple of weeks with mr visser what was your purpose logan spread his hands turned in the witness chair and faced the cadaver this is ridiculous your honor what is this all about just answer the question hill shot back hardy had a sense that he was on to something the current had finally begun to flow in his direction and he was going to ride it as far as it could take him mr logan he said would you like me to repeat the question no where visser had used confidence to blunt hardys attack logan thought hed go with arrogance his eyes were shining with illconcealed anger his jaw was set i was there in the locker to review evidence in one of my cases thats why you go there mr hardy to review evidence but hardy didnt rise to the bait a cool detachment had settled over him he even allowed himself a cragged grin thank you for that information mr logan ill keep it in mind now the specific case you were working on how would you classify it this was another question for which hardy didnt know the answer except that by now the answer had become all but a certainty i dont classify my cases i work for my clients i dont understand your question well for example was your client being charged with robbery murder rape no none of those how about traffic in narcotics thats privileged information logan said i dont have to discuss the nature of my cases with you or anybody else hardy turned to the judge your honor hovering almost over the edge of his podium hill had never looked more cadaverlike your cases are public record mr logan tell the court what this one was logan cast his eyes from side to side seeing no escape he sat back in the chair crossed one leg over the other adopted a wounded air yes it was a narcotics case and you were there with mr visser yes and afterwards did you both go together to jupiter all right so what pratt whod been little more than a bystander for the past hour and a half finally rose to her feet a simmering anger scalded her voice slightly but she managed to keep it under a lid your honor if the court please there can really be no relevance here between mr logans and mr vissers visit to the evidence locker less than two weeks ago and the death of elaine wager more than two weeks ago she was already dead when these events that mr hardy is so interested in transpired i understand the latitude that youve given defense in this case but none of this can possibly matter hes allowed to go there so is mr visser so what if hes got a drug dealer for a client almost every criminal defense attorney does the whole thing is just a smokescreen a desperate unethical smokescreen sharron pratt half turned now aware that she was also playing to the gallery which had come to life behind her perhaps she took the judges silence for forbearance whatever drove her she took another deep breath and forged ahead her voice becoming louder and more shrill as the volume behind her in the courtroom increased this hearing is about the actions of cole burgess your honor not dash logan and gene visser they are not the criminals here lets not lose sight of that fundamental truth in our zeal for fairness here and suddenly she was all but screaming turning to the defense table pointing her whole hand that boy there is a coldblooded killer he killed elaine wager there can be no doubt look at the facts your honor my god this is insanity look at the facts she stood at the prosecution table firm proud of herself for having spoken out for having put the judge on notice she not hill was controlling the agenda at this moment the judge might have the power of the bench but she had the power of righteousness the people had elected her to do what she was doing now driving the appeal to higher ground toward justice and away from these lawyers tricks enough was enough the cadaver sat back in what hardy took to be a state of disbelief even awe he held his gavel in his right hand inches from the top of the bench and did not lower it but instead let the noise in the room subside for what seemed an eternity although it probably wasnt more than forty seconds finally when the silence was complete hill placed the gavel carefully in front of him and spoke in a moderate whisper because of your elected position ms pratt im going to do you the courtesy of not throwing you into jail i do however find you in contempt of court for that outburst and order you to pay the sum of one thousand dollars to the clerk of the court before noon tomorrow in accordance with the business and professions code you will report this incident to the state bar the buzz began again and this time hill didnt hesitate a second but slammed his gavel three times rapidly in succession until once again he addressed a tomb let there be no mistake that this is a court of law its not a soapbox upon which to make election speeches now he continued to the courtroom at large mr hardy will proceed with this witness until he is finished or for the next twentyfive minutes whichever comes first after which well adjourn for the day he stopped speaking for an instant then raised his head and started again and for the record ms pratt and mr torrey i am quite persuaded to this point that the testimony elicited from the past few witnesses as well as the evidence presented to the court will pass any relevance standard youd like to propose so id prefer to let this direct examination continue with a minimum of objection for a while am i making myself understood ms pratt hardy had been facing her through all this now her eyes glistening with anger she stared at the judge mute was she daring hill to make her respond if so it wasnt her best idea but torrey sensing the same thing and hoping to avert further crisis put a hand on her arm and stood up of course the people reserve the right to object your honor an evil apparition the cadaver glared down at the prosecutors held his expression then at last nodded crisply of course he said left unsaid but clearly stated nonetheless were the words make my day the judge gave it a last beat then handed the witness back to hardy he turned back to logan if sharron pratt thought the last set of questions was irrelevant she would go ballistic over what he intended to do next but the judge had just given him free rein and if he was ever going to get it in now was the time mr logan last year were you yourself involved in a traffic incident at the corner of fifth and market the witness shifted in his seat nervously cleared his throat yeah somebody cut the brakes in my car i nearly got killed you also nearly hit two pedestrians running a red light did you not i couldnt stop what would you expect hardy didnt reply to that instead he asked when this incident occurred were you under the influence of drugs or alcohol logan sat up selfrighteously absolutely not and nobody charged me with anything but hardy had an answer for that isnt it true that after you were arrested and booked by the police all charges related to this accident were dismissed by the district attorney well yes thats and youre aware that mr torrey personally made that decision there werent any hardy raised his voice yes or no mr logan notching it up again yes or no ok but hardy jumped in again thats a yes for the record is that right logan hated it but was afraid of what hardy knew or might be able to prove yes he spat it out like a bitter seed thank you hardy said having now tied visser to logan to torrey on the record hardy was at last ready to bring it all back home he glanced at hill and thought he imagined an almost conspiratorial nod from the judge surely he thought he must be getting tired mr logan did you know the victim in the case elaine wager yes i did professionally not personally in other words you knew her as another lawyer here in town excuse me mr hardy the judge interrupting im gratified to see the beginning of a line of questioning that relates to one of the principals in this case and this might be a good time if the people dont object he added pointedly to call it a day and resume tomorrow its been a long session and im sure we could all use the time to reflect on the days events are there any objections there were not all right then courts adjourned glitsky didnt wait around for logans testimony as soon as gene visser was excused after he heard him say on the stand that ridley banks had been to his office on pier on the night of his disappearance he hightailed it out into the hallway and up to the homicide detail half of his troops were in the room and looked up they greeted him warmly as he entered it came to him with a sense of satisfaction that his people here werent really the most respectful of authority group in the known universe they were a lot like him in fact trying to do their very dangerous jobs the right way in spite of the barriers erected by the media the politicians the brass and suddenly he didnt care any longer if he was supposed to be there or not let them try to fire him just so long as right now nobody tried to get in his way there was police work to be done elaines murderer at last to be found it was a sacred and very private debt and he was going to pay it off what are we looking for paul thieu asked him as he filled out the search warrants on both vissers and logans offices hardy who had delivered elaines letter to judge thomasino that morning along with jeff elliots examiner article and an earful of what he surmised had told him that he thought the judge might sign off on the warrants they were trying to discover what had happened to ridley banks if a homicide inspector now needed to take a good look at any of these offices and connect the dots to three murders he was sure thomasino would want to cooperate and since logan was now a suspect not an innocent custodian of records no special master was required basically glitsky said everything guns drugs canceled checks evidence of struggle take the damn places apart visser may have shot ridley where he sat and if he did theres splatter thieu looked up in a state of high excitement from another desk in the detail marcel lanier came over to join them glitsky nodded at him here was jorge batavia too sarah evans listening in until now the unit hadnt been particularly aware of all the ramifications of glitskys clandestine investigation now it was beginning to dawn all around that this was a cop killing their colleague ridley was part of this were talking the full drill here then everybody you can round up glitsky said bringing them all in and as soon as you can the two of them will be moving as soon as courts out bet on it are you coming along abe jorge asked if vincent hardy had been there his father definitely would have had to let him shave his head im not here at all glitsky said this isnt happening what was happening was that glitsky was going to go on an errand of his own armed with the picture of elaine that hed kept in his desk the musketeers had already accumulated notes on sixtyseven eating or resting establishments around maiden lane and glitsky either had to assume that his theory was mistaken or that they had been asking the wrong questions he chose the latter elaine had left treya at rand and jackman at five thirty to meet someone she knew for an appointment she was walking back to her place of business when she got shot and she wasnt walking alone maiden lane was a walking street and she was far enough down it for glitsky even without the condition of the body to preclude the possibility that someone had dumped her out of a car he stood by the side of his desk and studied the city map that he had put up as wallpaper when he first made lieutenant the redtipped pin was still stuck in the wall at the site of elaines death he felt like an idiot as though hed wasted a lot of unnecessary time sending the kids out with his clever ideas about the area surrounding where shed been shot because now reading the map it was obvious that it hadnt been a circle at all she hadnt been out taking a leisurely stroll it was after midnight and she had been coming back by the most direct route from a specific location that probably he now realized was more or less in a straight line defined by two coordinates rand and jackmans offices on montgomery and bush and the corner of maiden lane and grant avenue further if he traced what he thought were the logical streets the ones he would have taken he thought he could eliminate any route north of his imaginary line and east of grant if elaine had begun walking on any of the streets in those areas it would have meant backtracking to get to maiden and grant and she knew the city well she wouldnt have done that it was by now well past six on a thursday night the lights were on dim out his door in the detail every inspector on duty had gone out with thieu for the two searches glitsky had studied his coordinates he knew generally where he was going now he turned out his own lights closed his door and sat hed said it before to treya about how weird it sounded but he was going to give elaine a few more minutes see if his daughter wanted to talk to him to tell him something sitting at his desk in the dark unaware of any conscious thought his mind went to a story hed heard or read somewhere about a woman whod been adopted at birth and had never known her mother over the course of her life if something made her so emotionally upset that she couldnt sleep shed developed the habit of getting up boiling water and cooking up a plate of plain pasta after she ate it she could go back to sleep when she was thirtyfive she decided to try and locate her birth mother and after a difficult search was eventually successful she wrote to the woman introducing herself and asking if they could meet her mother had agreed she could come to her house for a weekend and they could get to know one another the meeting went well but when it was time for bed the emotional upheaval of it all kept the daughter awake well into the night after tossing and turning for half the night in her mothers guest bedroom she finally gave up and went downstairs to the kitchen where her mother was fixing a bowl of plain spaghetti for herself she said she always did that to help her get back to sleep would her daughter like some too glitsky snapped back to where he was why had he thought of that his damn heart was beating a strong tattoo against his rib cage but there was no pain as he stood up and turned on the light in his room again he thought he knew exactly where he was going now but he wanted to check to make sure yes there it was dead smack in the middle of the parameters hed just established and probably half a block outside the circle hed drawn for the musketeers hardy ate at home but was back downtown by eight in his office at the solarium table all the attorneys freeman roake wu ingalls and rhodin had gathered and were sharing their information and opinions of the musketeers the most successful during the day had been amy wu shed been working on the abby oberlin matter and had discovered that gene visser had interviewed several staff members at the pacific gardens senior health center in visitation valley where abbys mother had been in residence though hed been more subtle than he had with rich mcneil he had still managed to intimidate two parttime nurses as well as the owner of the facility into believing that their license was in jeopardy if they did not disassociate themselves immediately from the first sign of this particular patient mistreatment lawsuit wu had done well hardy told her but he didnt think they needed what shed found anymore weve got enough tying visser to logan at this stage he said the cadaver has gotten the message im sure of that what we need now it seems to me is some strong connection to elaine that will bring torrey into the picture lieutenant glitsky and treya might have found a little something for us this morning but before we discuss that id be happy to entertain any other suggestions anyone might have wrapped in cigar smoke huddled down behind his glass of red wine david freeman was a contemplative gnome alone at the far end of the large table hed been uncharacteristically quiet during the initial discussions and now he cleared his throat and sat forward we ought not to forget that we are deep deep in the trees here people theyre pretty trees i admit they form nice patterns on the forest floor and their leaves are a wonder to behold the younger attorneys caught each others eyes glad that they didnt sully their evening minds with alcohol hardy and gina roake shared their own look but they knew david better and their expressions didnt convey the same message here came a profound and probably unwelcome insight his forestforthetrees metaphor subsumed by the legal issue was forgotten freeman took in the faces around the table focused on hardy and continued gravely you can tie your three boys into the neatest knot youve ever seen and drop the whole package at hills bench and you still dont have nearly enough ingalls and rhodin both started to respond but didnt get far as freeman shook his head summoning silence again to the table ask yourselves this simple question from the evidence presented in this hearing disregarding all the hoopla about torrey visser and logan did cole burgess happen upon a lone woman walking in an alley and kill her for her money and jewelry yes or no more silence lets take a straw vote gina she considered for a beat not liking her answer probably amy i dont want to admit this but yes i do think so it went around the table ending with hardy who made it unanimous but why then ingalls demanded is the judge letting all this in hes got to see it as connected to the crime right hardy converted took the answer maybe not even jon hes giving us rope thats all this is a death penalty case all the issues have to be on the record hills going to hold cole to answer and hes willing to let us thrash around for a while before he does it he might also enjoy watching pratt and torrey sweat its more than that im afraid diz freeman said hes letting you develop an alternative explanation of events so completely that there wont be any room left for appeal if you lose hes letting us lock ourselves in and throw away the key but these guys rhodin began i mean this whole thing with cullens death its got to mean something freeman nodded acknowledging the point sure it means something it means that these three guys are all slightlytovery dishonest allies and may have tried to cheat to win this case which in turn is politically important to torreys boss ok so they overstepped their bounds does that mean that they purposely gave cullen pure heroin so that he could inadvertently kill himself what happened to ridley banks i mean what are we trying to get at here and most importantly does any of it mean that cole didnt probably kill elaine i dont think so the judge is going to want to let a jury decide and a trial court wont allow hearsay which means weve got nothing at all and to this simple truth there was no rebuttal hardy rose to his feet and began pacing so what are you saying david are you suggesting we stop trying to make the connections no we still need those gina roake asked then what freeman removed his dead cigar long enough to take an appreciative sip of his wine we must be crystal clear in our minds that this is not some clever and ultimately empty legal strategy lets clearly acknowledge what were doing here and make no mistake about the gravity of it amy wu spoke up we had better be accusing somebody else of murdering elaine is that what youre saying freeman nodded otherwise its just what pratt called it a smokescreen hardy stopped walking and fixed his gaze on the old man gina was bobbing her head in agreement jon ingalls flashed a look around the table then said what he obviously believed they all were thinking visser we dont know that not yet freeman corrected him gently it might just as well have been logan or even torrey no offense mr freeman but i cant see that curtis rhodin offered either one of them would have used visser if they had wet work dont you think he shrugged if logan was coked up if torrey was cornered who knows and again it might have been none of them they were waiting to hear more the point is that even if dismas succeeds brilliantly in tying up our connections between these three men and i have no doubt hell do just that all it gives us at best is a possible motive it gives us means too david doesnt it gina put in any of them could have gotten their hands on the gun couldnt they after all theyre all in the criminal business one way or another theyre going to have access to guns ok freeman conceded maybe but if they were playing cards together or if they say they were until two oclock on that night we lose if they see where dismas is going with this and talk together tonight for example he let his voice trail off jon ingalls pushed his chair back from the table youre saying we need to know if they had alibis im saying freeman amplified that wed be damn negligent if we got this far and lost sight of what were really trying to do which is provide an alternative to our client as elaines killer not a theory a person nothing less is going to do it how are we going to do that curtis rhodin checked his watch in three or four hours i dont know freeman conceded i admit theres precious little time and its really police work that they probably havent done but if we dont have that information were looking at ugly surprises just about when we think weve won after a moment amy wu shook herself and sat up straight smiling ok she said how do we do this where do we go after the musketeers had broken off and left on their various assignments freeman gina roake and hardy had stayed on for over an hour to discuss the possible meaning of the blank entries in logans check register hardy thought it completely in keeping with logans character that his office still seemed to use a lowtech onewrite system approach to its checkwriting and bookkeeping before computers had come into his life hardy had used the same kind of system himself so he was familiar with it you wrote your check and tore it off under it a lightblue ncrpaper copy of the check was your receipt and finally under the copy the check was automatically entered in the ledger the blank lines could have been anything really voided checks a ditzy secretary inserting a piece of paper between the ledger and the checks a purposeful hiding of records the last was hardys favorite notion but there was simply no way to tell the musketeer assignments were desperate and dangerous but necessary the very cute amy wu was going with jon ingalls as her invisible chaperon to spend some time at jupiter where according to the bartender when theyd phoned dash logan was currently having a few drinks he looked to be in for the long haul tonight from the solarium curtis rhodin had called the home of his friend at the ags office theyd been unsuccessful getting a judge to issue any kind of warrant on logans office that morning and both had been frustrated aching for another chance this was it they would take an investigator three of them together would ensure their safety they hoped and call on visser first at his office and then at his home address when they found him they would ask him what he had to say about his movements on the night of elaines murder the same drill would not work on torrey not that freeman roake or hardy really considered that the chief ada could have pulled the trigger on elaine they all agreed that he would have used visser but why would torrey even see them certainly he would blow off curtis his friend and their investigator and even if they did get in and pushed him for his alibi hed tell them to get lost he wouldnt miss the message his guard would be raised even higher freeman though wanted to be thorough and he had an idea he believed hed be able to bait torrey into giving something away the next morning before court went into session it was closing in on ten thirty and hardy sat alone in the glass room the ledger sheets from dash logans office lay fanned in front of him they had been important enough for elaine wager to have copied them separately and carried them away with her illegally her special master mandate was specific about her duties in searching a lawyers office she had two and only two options on how to treat documents such as these that she reviewed in a search she determined whether they fell into the categories specifically described in the affidavit if they did she gave it to the cops or if the lawyer claimed a privilege she took it to a judge if they did not she left them alone and never ever discussed them with anyone not even a judge it was that simple and yet she had risked her license and quite possibly her life to copy and remove what hardy had in front of him why why freeman had left a few inches of wine in his bottle hardy got up thinking hed go see what tonights choice had been he went and sat in the chair david had been using but he didnt reach for the wine right away just to his right on the seat next to him was the cardboard box full of elaines personal items on the top of it face down was a framed something he lifted it up it was the picture of her mother loretta that treya had put up on the table when theyd first brought all the stuff down here the other morning abe had asked the gang at the table if anybody minded if he put it back in the box he didnt want to look at her face all day while he worked and hardy thought he understood pretty well why that was still holding the frame his fingers absently moving up and down the cardboard backing that held the photograph in place he stared at the familiar visage of the senator a wellknown public figure like her daughter a beauty and like her daughter dead hardy sighed wearily maybe his daughter was right after all to be frightened of everything maybe there was no security a snatch from matthew arnolds dover beach flitted across his mind neither joy nor love nor light nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain he placed the photograph carefully on the table and reached for the wine bottle groth reserve cabernet sauvignon he swirled and sniffed then tipped the bottle up to his lips and tasted it thinking it was no wonder david could keep up his good attitude most of the time abruptly he stood carrying the bottle out with him he crossed the lobby and walked down the hallway to the coffee room where he turned on the light and took a wine glass from the cabinet this stuff was too outrageously good to swill he poured put the bottle down and suddenly the wine had vanished from his mind driven away by a cascade of realizations he checked his watch it was too late now to call judge thomasino but he could stop by his chambers first thing in the morning the evidence locker on the other hand would be open all night if he busted his hump he could get down there verify what he realized he had to know and still maybe make it home to get the five hours sleep he needed to survive another day stopping back at the solarium to turn off the lights he saw that hed left lorettas picture on the table abe would see it first thing when he came by for the morning briefing but hardy didnt even have the energy to walk around the table and put it back into the box abe was a big boy hed be able to handle it mr torrey excuse me an hour before court would be called into session torrey sat in his office behind the desk reading the second part of jeff elliots article on abby oberlin in yesterday afternoons examiner david freeman had pulled his forty years of familiarity and rank on the clerk who controlled access to the das offices and so achieved the element of surprise which showed all over torreys face jerking the paper down when he saw who was interrupting him he made an effort at quick recovery but it wasnt fast enough he inclined his head his manner curt mr freeman a pause did we have an appointment no sir this is a courtesy call torrey coughed up a dry humorless chuckle i could use a little of that he indicated the newspaper have you read this latest scurrilous slander well who am i talking to of course you have if you didnt help write it freeman lifted his shoulders theatrically he moved a step further into the room and waited torrey set the newspaper down on the desk but i guess appealing to your sense of fair play is whistling in the wind isnt it then suddenly how did you get in here i had an appointment on another matter with one of your staff since i was here another noncommittal shrug and for the record i did not write a word of that article nor did i contribute to it although of course im aware of its contents mr hardy shares office space in my building after all freeman waved the topic away but thats not why im here mr hardys not my problem though our mutual client is he clarified it im talking about cole burgess what about him the old man closed the distance between him and the desk though he remained standing look its not rocket science to see the direction that mr hardy is going with this hearing the whole proceeding has become a personal and professional attack on you if im reading judge hill correctly and i am hes inclined to let it continue what happens to you isnt my concern either all right whats your point my point is this mr hardys going to continue in the same vein over the course of todays testimony hes going to be probing the relationships you have with mr visser and mr logan from which you are trying to protect me i suppose youll forgive me if im skeptical of your altruistic motives but freeman didnt rise to the barb instead he shook his head and spoke mildly theres nothing altruistic about it mr torrey i apologize if i gave you that impression as ive said my only concern is my client mr hardy and i have had a few words of disagreement as to strategy i believe hes become obsessed with this vendetta against you to the detriment of cole burgess its just more rope mr freeman hes hanging himself let me make myself clear freeman said the direction hes going now the way he gets burgess off is by accusing you three men of complicity in elaines killing and im thinking the judge is going to let him do it torrey pulled himself up to his full height in his chair thats the most ridiculous it may be but hills going to let it happen unless all of you have solid alibis for the time of the murder oh please you think im joking you think it wont get to there do you know what you were doing that night for example torrey shook his head with disgust as a matter of fact it so happens that because of elaines murder i remember that night specifically i had dinner with sharron pratt until very late he met freemans gaze challenging but even if i hadnt freeman interrupted if you hadnt theres still visser and logan or even some third party to say nothing of all this he pointed down at the newspaper all this hatchet work what im suggesting is that you can end it all this morning drop the charges at least the specials against my client and mr hardy pleads it out the whole thing goes away torrey stared across the desk in disbelief youre suggesting that i let a murderer go to save myself some personal aggravation do you really think thats what this office is all about lets not open that can of worms freeman snapped i said when i got here that this was a courtesy call ive extended the courtesy torreys tone was ice a blackmailers courtesy counselor there is no connection between me and the death of elaine wager none at all and this thinlyveiled threat about what you or your partner might accuse me of isnt going to fly around here because thats what it is torrey fumed blackmail im sorry you see it that way a modest disappointment its your funeral on the way out to the courtroom freeman enjoyed a private chuckle of course the offer hed made was stupid on the face of it no matter what at this point torrey couldnt risk lowering the charges on cole but freeman thought it was beautiful to wave the temptation in front of his face and torrey for his part probably was thinking that freemans senility was by now well advanced he possibly wasnt even aware that hed given the old man his alibi which had been the whole point of the exercise contrary to expectations hardy did not begin the day with dash logan but first asked the cadavers permission to call on elaine wagers paralegal for a couple of questions to establish the provenance of some documents labeled defense g which would prove critical in his examination of mr logan so when dash logan took the stand he looked quite a bit the worse for wear hed been out partying until late in the course of the night finally revealing to this knockout amy something that hed been in la on the night of elaines murder all that talking and spending pretty sure he was going to get over with her and then shed excused herself to go to the bathroom and never come back after that hed had to deal with this mornings news that the police had been and were still searching his office this time in overt connection to elaine they were going through everything file by file patsy god forbid was there he was sure that after last time after the long weekend he and visser had put in sterilizing the place they would find nothing but it was still nervewracking he hadnt slept worth a damn and the coffee hadnt done nearly enough so hed decided he needed a few lines to calm his nerves but it had been so early he didnt dare snort up in the hall of justice that now he was just about back to straight in the witness stand and here came that son of a bitch hardy again a pit bull with a mouthful of his leg mr logan yesterday you told the court that you were professionally acquainted with elaine wager isnt that so yes i was do you recall the last time you saw her yes i saw her in my office sometime in the middle or late january he went on answering questions that explained a bit about her special master duties his lack of cooperation with the police and his purported reason for it when hed finished hardy went to his table and retrieved a thin stack of paper bringing it forward to the witness box you have heard the previous witness ms ghent identify these pages defense exhibit g as being included in a folder given to her by elaine wager after shed come from your office a few hours before she was killed can you identify these pages for the court he stared at them for a long moment flipping through the pages the sight of which cramped up his stomach mr logan they look like photocopies of my business ledger they look like them mr logan take your time and go through them carefully surely you are familiar with the checks you write he stared at the pages for october and november but he didnt understand how he could be looking at what he was seeing there had only been that short period of time when ok hed made a few errors hed let the partying get a little out of hand and wasnt following the business details as closely as he should have patsy had made some checks out to gabe personally instead of writing them to the usual account and hed signed them and mailed them off patsy the idiot had remembered to block the carbon that went all the way through to the ledger on the bottom but shed filed the duplicate checks the ncr copies in the physical files under gironde he and visser eventually found them and removed these check receipts from the file then voided some bogus lines in the ledger he specifically remembered doing it now he answered the question its a copy of my business ledger all right but somebodys erased some of the entries its not right its not right no hardy nodded as though he expected this answer he moved back to the defense table and took another folder forward all right then how about these pages mr logan do these look any better rattled enough to begin with logan was so happy to see the pages hed doctored that he didnt think to ask where hardy had gotten them which was through glitsky after the police search of logans office last night the ledgers had been the first thing they had copied logan studied the pages for a while then said that yes this looked more like his ledger looks more like it is it or isnt it yes it is hardy had it entered as defense h then came back to him mr logan looking again at these business ledgers defense exhibit g and h youll notice that there are six entries in the latter that were originally made out to various business payees and then voided can you explain these entries my secretary screwed up i dont know in defense g these same entries are blank as you noticed how do you explain that a shrug i dont know that either somebody could have whited out the entry then copied it so it would look blank or the record of the original checks was purposely kept out of the ledger isnt that really why they were left blank mr logan isnt it true that the voided entries are fallacious intended to camouflage the real payee on these checks after the fact no what are you talking about give me a break would you pratt had been forbearing with her objections for quite a while and finally she decided she had to get back on the boards your honor if this line of questioning is even tangentially related to the death of elaine wager i fail to see it do you judge hill scowled im taking that as another relevance objection counsel mr hardy im inclined to sustain this one unless you can bring me some closure where is this going this is going to the original payee on these six checks your honor we have gone to great lengths in this hearing to draw the inescapable conclusion that mr logan and mr visser have colluded in illegal activities together possibly even the delivery of uncut heroin to cullen alsop which caused his death ms wagers discovery of these illegal activities your honor pratt interrupted not only is the conclusion far from inescapable its demonstrably false elaine wager couldnt have discovered anything about cullen alsops death he died a week after she did and she was killed hardy raised his voice because she discovered something mr logan was trying to keep covered up the gallery came to life behind hardy but he spoke loudly through it something she found in his office while she was working there in her courtappointed role as a special master your honor torrey was on his feet interrupting even more loudly this is inexcusable weve seen no evidence for any of these outrageous accusations now mr hardy is simply arguing creating some grand conspiracy out of whole cloth when he hasnt been able to produce one document or any other shred of evidence these are monstrous charges against mr logan and who knows who else we have to see some evidence some actual proof of all this illegal activity this conspiracy to cover up and commit murder if he doesnt have it its time to call this to a halt the gallerys volume swelled and hill gaveled it quiet then glowered down over the edge of the bench mr hardy mr torreys right if youve got some proof of any of these accusations the court needs to see it now hardy stood alone in the center of the courtroom in the now dead stillness of course your honor he said turning back to david and cole at his table he grabbed the folder david held out for him and walked back before the bench his footfalls echoed as expected glitsky had gone into the solarium first thing in the morning he had in fact noticed the picture of loretta wager that hardy had left out on the table and seeing it had jogged his memory it was the one item in the box that he hadnt had the heart to really look at which is what he did then taking the cardboard backing out of the frame discovering the ncr copies of checks that elaine had hidden there after shed removed them from logans office hardy was now presenting them to the court your honor i submit for the courts inspection xerox copies of mr logans supposedly voided checks numbers and all referenced to various subcontractors with gironde industries with which im sure the court is familiar and all of these checks are made out to the same payee he turned and faced the prosecutions table gabriel torrey after the uproar in the courtroom passed pratt especially wanted to retire to discuss this startling evidence in the judges chambers if she thought this was going to somehow play to her advantage judge hill his ire now truly aroused disabused her of that notion hardy was glad to see that he didnt have to draw a map for the judge just inside the door to his chambers the cadaver didnt even bother shucking himself out of his robes but spun on the assemblage with a hail of invective as the court reporter struggled to set up and record what he was saying the chief assistant district attorneys involvement in any scheme like this was unconscionable and probably criminal the judge opined that it might be a good idea for torrey to get himself a good attorney of his own your honor there is a simple explanation i hill cut him off im not interested whether or not you have done anything unethical or even criminal is beside the point and im predicting youre going to get all the chance you need to explain everything youve done he whirled now on the district attorney herself and in any case ms pratt the appearance of impropriety is so strong im surprised that you let your deputy proceed at all in this matter no im more than surprised im appalled can it be you had no knowledge of your chief assistants involvement in any of this pratts face had gone from crimson to pale from rage to a tightlipped controlled panic she seemed unable to respond at all but it didnt matter as the judge turned again now mr hardy reluctant to throw any water on the judges blaze the defense team had been doing a fair imitation of a couple of statues over by the window and now at the summons hardy came forward a step or two and assumed an atease position yes your honor it appears that youve produced your smoking gun linking mr torrey here to his friends outside in the gallery im willing to buy that there was something to hide at mr logans office and that ms wager found it for the sake of argument ill even concede the possibility of criminal collusion destroying the checks the copies cooking the ledger entries but here i must caution you we are engaged in a hearing on a charge of murder your honor excuse me hardy found it difficult to believe that torrey had the brass to speak up and interrupt at this juncture but the mans arrogance apparently knew no bounds he didnt wait for the judges acknowledgment either but went straight to his point the court ought to know that i talked to elaine about this problem several weeks ago just after her first time at logans when in fact she did run across the check receipts by mistake she knew she had no legal reason to have seen them she came to me because we used to be friends more than friends freeman corrected mildly torrey shrugged that away although pratt once again seemed to take it almost as a blow the point is ive got the notes of that meeting in my minute file youre welcome to send somebody up and check right now so there wasnt anything to cover up and just for the record your honor im aware of what it looks like but dash isnt the worlds best bookkeeper and his secretary in any event the money was payment for personal gambling debts hardy couldnt restrain himself oh for the love of god but hill held up a hand spoke up this is eighteen thousand dollars were talking about mr torrey yes your honor he hung his head briefly in a show of embarrassment or contrition ive spoken to ms pratt about it weve decided i ought to seek some counseling hills expression curdled in distaste but he wasnt going to pursue this line any further well as ive said mr torrey youll have ample opportunity to bare your soul and transgressions over the coming weeks but mr hardy this does bring me back to my topic he inhaled deeply the fact is that were here to determine if the evidence says that your client ought to go to trial for ms wagers murder the evidence he repeated solemnly and i must tell you that to this point the evidence remains overwhelming simply overwhelming against mr burgess i trust you havent lost sight of that no your honor so you wish to continue with your case in chief if you want to make a motion to relieve the da and substitute the ag ill hear it but i still havent heard anything casting doubt on mr burgesss guilt we have a few more witnesses your honor yes the cadaver wasnt even sure that hed heard right certainly he conveyed to everyone in the room his belief that no one hardy could call would make any difference to the evidence already arrayed against cole but it was still a capital case and the prosecution had proven itself inept and possibly hell probably venal if not pathetic if pratt lost a slam dunk of a case like this after making it a political barnburner it would serve her right maybe shed learn something although hill doubted that very strongly all right he said to hardy at last but theyd better be talking about evidence in the wager murder case keep them on point or ill dismiss them out of hand am i making myself clear yes your honor hardy said as he answered questions about his rank and professional duties paul thieu sat upright in the witness chair confident alert professional cooperative hardy knew that he had not slept a wink in more than twentyfour hours yet his eyes were clear his face shaved his coat and slacks crisply pressed the man was a marvel and now it was time to get to the meat of it sergeant thieu as a homicide inspector can you explain how you are involved in this case before the court today sure another inspector in the detail ridley banks has been missing now for over ten days the presumption is that he has met with foul play one of the witnesses in this case gene visser admitted on the stand here that hed talked to inspector banks apparently on the night he disappeared we believed that meeting concerned the murder of elaine wager but we didnt know exactly why inspector banks had asked for it based on that and since mr visser was the last person to see him i requested a search warrant on mr vissers place of business and what were you looking for i guess the best answer is anything we could find that might relate to this meeting including documentary evidence to verify whether it actually took place and how long it lasted inspector thieu when did you conduct this search well we began this morning at around seven oclock and i believe its still going on thank you hardy turned and walked back to the defense table under which hed placed the cardboard box from the solarium reaching down he pulled out a large ziploc bag which contained a gun and brought it forward the gallery seeing what it was began its buzzing again and kept it up as hardy got to the stand he raised his voice slightly now sergeant thieu do you recognize this gun thieu took it looked at the evidence tag checked inside and nodded yes sir i do would you please tell the court about it this is a glock automatic that we found in the course of our search of mr vissers office in the lower left hand drawer of his desk hardy was aware of an increase in the noise behind him but it abruptly ceased when pratts voice cut through it objecting the murder weapon in this case has already been entered in evidence whats the significance of introducing this new gun hill looked the question at hardy who responded your honor the provenance of the murder weapon in this case has been a critical issue from the beginning but this new gun is not the murder weapon no thats true but as your honor will see with my next witness it bears on it all right ill allow it go ahead hardy took a breath blew it out in a rush of relief and had the glock entered into evidence as defense j and excused the witness pratt chose not to crossexamine hardy stole a glance back out over the bar rail the tension in the gallery was he thought palpable logan and visser were sitting next to one another in the first row on the prosecution side there wasnt a soul in the courtroom who wasnt aware of their earlier testimonies yesterday and today glitsky had whispered to him at the break that he had had them both reminded by the door bailiff as they attempted to leave earlier today that they were still under subpoena if they needed so much as to go to the bathroom another bailiff would be happy to accompany them jonas walsh sulked in an aisle chair on the prosecution side three rows from the back and another four behind muhammed adek and some of his friends on hardys side clarence jackman and the three musketeers sat midway back along with treya and glitsky gina roake a few other r j associates as logan had left the stand at the beginning of the first recess hardy had seen that he obviously recognized amy wu from last night he had charged back with a clear notion at least to verbally abuse her until jackman stood up intimidating and unmoving and blocked his way similarly before court had been called into session torrey had all but attacked jeff elliot for his examiner article as his wife dorothy whod finally relented about supporting her brother had wheeled him up the aisle now a phalanx of jeffs fellow reporters surrounded both of them a deal of the background white noise originated in this area and finally up close front row center sat coles mother whod been in the same seat every day whod kept her sons spirits alive with her jail visits and her unfailing hope now hardy looked down at his client gave him a small confident nod and called his next witness the defense calls officer gary bellew like thieu bellew was a policeman but the similarity between the gungho brilliant vietnamese homicide inspector and the young surly custodian of the gun room of the evidence locker ended there bellews uniform hadnt been cleaned or pressed in days and he needed a haircut but then before this morning he had had no warning that he would be appearing as a witness more instructive was bellews obvious resentment at his presence in court today he seemed to project a defensive attitude that somehow whatever he was made to disclose would turn out to be his fault and hardy knew in this he wasnt all wrong officer bellew can you tell the court your assignment at the present time hardy kept the questions simple nonthreatening one following the other falling like dominoes is this assignment a rotating one how long have you been in charge of the gun room down there and what is its basic function whos allowed down there is all evidence assigned to a specific case are there other guns kept there how does that work hardy got bellew talking until the overt resentment began to settle out now the young officer was sitting back answering matteroffactly how does what work oh the other guns usually some uniform comes in with a piece a gun that he picked up off the street you know if its not registered he keeps it and brings it on down no case assigned so its not evidence really its just a gun nobody should have so what happens then then we log the registration number into this big book and throw the gun in a box you throw the gun in a box yeah we call it the piece box the piece box i see how many guns are typically in this piece box i dont know for sure when its full maybe a hundred something like that a hundred guns and this box is just sitting out where anyone can see it or get their hands on the guns yeah well yeah bellew sensed a criticism but couldnt draw a bead on it precisely but its not like anybody can get in there in the first place youve got to sign in and then somebodys with you every minute so a person couldnt come in for example and sneak an unregistered gun out in their pocket no shaking his head no way youd say that it would be difficult impossible all right then now these guns what happens to them eventually after theyve sat in this piece box for however long its usually a month maybe a little more then they come and empty the box we put the serial numbers into the computer and crush the guns and melt em down then we start over hardy had established a nice rhythm and kept it casual as he strolled back to freeman and cole lifted an ancient heavy book from the cardboard box and brought it to the stand officer bellew at my request this morning did you bring some documents with you to the courtroom sure first thats the login book i was talking about hardy wanted to get it completely straight the login book for firearms that are turned in by the police department and wind up in the piece box in the guarded evidence lockup downstairs here in the hall of justice is that correct yes and these entries are handwritten when the gun gets turned in do i have that right bellew turned a few more pages closed it back up yes sir thats right excellent hardy enthused he had the book entered into evidence as defense k and still at the evidence table in front of the bench he found an entry in the log and pointed to it what happened to that gun officer bellew leaned over the entry then back up to hardy it was entered into the piece book on no im sorry hardy interrupted i mean what happened to it after that eventually it was crushed and destroyed when that would have been the end of last month january january hardy repeated officer bellew would you please describe the weapon were talking about here and read the serial number to the court sure it was a clock serial wga thank you picking up the pace and just before this gun was crushed at the end of january you entered the serial number into the computer did you not yes did you at my request bring a printout of the computer log of all the guns crushed at the end of january yes sir i did all right then would you please find then on the list the clock bellew went down the list the courtroom hung in a thick silence it was obvious when he began looking for the second time his face had begun to flush its not here so this particular clock was not crushed is that right bellew was seeing his career flash before his eyes oh it was crushed all right theres no way this firearm was not crushed all right hardy said ambiguously lets leave that for the moment let me ask you this to your knowledge has mr visser been in the gun room in the past month bellews eyes went to the gallery yes to your personal knowledge did he handle any of the guns in the piece box yes but he put them back he didnt take a gun away with him that would have been impossible is that what youre saying did you personally see him replace every gun that he picked up no but he couldnt bellew stopped speaking hardy had crossed to the evidence table and now was back in front of the witness he had picked up the tiny north american arms caliber derringer i show you now peoples four officer bellew this gun has been identified as the murder weapon in this case would you be so good as to read the registration number of this gun under the barrel there to the court hardy handed it to the officer who turned the gun over squinting hardy moved back toward the evidence table and bellew read aloud na thank you hardy held out one hand and bellew passed him the gun hardy then gave him the handwritten login book again now officer bellew would you please read the entry from november fourteenth of last year line four the type of gun and its serial number bellow got to the page hesitated looked up hardy nodded north american arms twentyfive caliber derringer serial na the courtroom had been uncharacteristically silent as hardy had led bellew on this path and now that silence ended with a restrained explosion of sound and this time judge hill acted to quell it promptly gaveling the gallery down to a rumbling silence he also gave a signal to the bailiffs who moved out through the sides of the gallery to the back door at long last here was evidence that was both material and relevant the cadaver wanted to see where it was leading and hardy was ready to show him officer bellew while youve got that book in your hands would you please read the second line entry from january twentyninth three weeks ago bellew found it and was reading as hardy walked again back to the evidence table picked up yet another gun clock caliber automatic serial number wga hardy stood in front of the bench holding the glock in his hand your honor let the record show that officer bellew has read the serial number of the gun marked defense exhibit j this was the weapon retrieved this morning from eugene vissers office the gallery was buzzing again hill startled everyone with a sharp gavel bailiffs he called out no one is to leave the courtroom hardy turned to see visser on his feet stopped in his tracks a couple of steps up the center aisle he turned back toward the bench looked to torrey and pratt to hardy one of the bailiffs from the back door came forward but hadnt gone more than a couple of steps when visser took his seat and began whispering furiously to dash logan he didnt get to whisper long though because hardy called him back to the witness stand and things got louder in a hurry dash logan stood up next to him and announced that he was representing mr visser and seeing the way the defense was orchestrating this case his client was taking the fifth amendment visser told logan loudly enough for everyone to hear that he should shut up he wasnt pleading any fifth nevertheless logan accompanied visser to the stand it was a tricky moment leaving aside logans ethics and chemical problems the man was an experienced trial attorney who would at least be effective in blunting or flanking hardys attack on the other hand hardy thought he might be able to back them both into a corner he already had the murder weapon in vissers hands the clerk reminded visser that he was still under oath did he understand that he grunted something like an acknowledgment which hill made him repeat until it was a recognizable yes mr visser hardy began can you explain how defense exhibit j the glock automatic weapon got into your desk drawer i have no idea visser replied coolly i assume one of your cop friends planted it there really you did not remove it yourself from the evidence lockup downstairs no you never touched the gun no not once so you did not treat the barrel and the grip with armorall finally a slight reaction visser threw a quick glance at logan then came back front no pacing a few steps to one side hardy appeared to be deep in thought mr visser you used to be a homicide inspector did you not yeah so what so in that capacity were you familiar with the use of armorall as an agent to prevent fingerprints from adhering to surfaces such as the metal or grips of a gun yeah sure its everyday so you never touched the gun defense exhibit j your honor logan interrupted mr visser has already answered this question he never touched the gun hardy spoke up i just wanted to give mr visser a chance to consider that answer your honor so hed be absolutely sure logan gave visser an almost imperceptible nod and the witness answered im sure i wonder then hardy adopted an exaggerated calm he was about to take a calculated risk a pure bluff but it seemed necessary the two guys were slick enough not to give anything away he had to get one of them running startled into a false first step i wonder how you explain the presence of your fingerprints on the bullets in the weapon visser swallowed visibly answering too quickly grabbing at a police trick he did know im sure they transferred the print from the tape on the heroin bag its the easiest thing in the world really hardy smiled coldly and kept pushing how do they make a thumb turn into an index finger i dont know they a flush was creeping up vissers face his panicked eyes flicked again to logan who suddenly had nothing to say all right but i all right hardy almost jumped at him all right you took the gun from the evidence locker is that what youre saying now mr visser big deal visser snapped finally logan a step too late seemed to realize that visser had been tricked dont say any more gene then to the judge your honor my client will refuse to answer hardy stepped quickly up to the stand his voice urgent now mr visser lets go to the murder weapon in this case did you get it the same way the witness didnt answer hardy followed his desperate stare and turned to see torrey with his head lowered looking down at the prosecution table logan stood tonguetied next to him his allies were all abandoning him i never he began to blurt out gene logan warned him after you stole it mr visser did you treat that weapon with armorall as well so it wouldnt hold your prints is that your standard practice vissers jaw was working under his jowls it was far from warm in the courtroom and yet sweat had broken on his high forehead i didnt take that gun you cant prove that i did i cant i think i just did hardy replied evenly he really didnt care hed gotten what he wanted visser could deny until he was blue in the face but he knew that the cadaver was with him on the murder weapon now all that was left was to get that gun to maiden lane on february your honor i may need to recall this witness once again but for now im through with him hill gave hardy a surprised look then asked pratt if she had any questions in crossexamination she did not visser and logan hadnt even gotten to their seats when hardy turned back to the bench the defense would call estelle gold the sprightly mrs gold was pushing sixty she dyed her hair bright red to match her lipstick and nail polish she combed it back held by large clips to show off the gaudy costume jewelry earrings she favored wearing a simple cotton housecoat under a down overcoat and nononsense walking shoes she got up from her chair in glitskys row and marched in a slightly bowlegged fashion past the last witnesses and up into the bullpen while the gallery hummed with conjecture who the hell was she hardy wasnt going to keep them waiting long to find out mrs gold can you tell us your profession please im a waitress honey and proud of it been a waitress for forty years and hope to go another twenty if my legs hold up and i dont see why they wouldnt im sure they will mrs gold can you tell the court where you are working now davids deli on geary street thats right honey same location for about a hundred years davids on geary she nodded adding across from the act the american conservatory theater yes maam that pretty well nails it down and were you working there on sunday night january thirtyfirst of this year yes i was i always work sundays better tips than youd think she played a bit with the back of her hair shifted for comfort in the witness chair mrs gold did you personally know elaine wager the deceased in this case her face clouded over i certainly did how was that was she a regular customer yes sir never went more than a couple of weeks without shed stop by for something and always asked for me she added with pride and did she come to davids on sunday january thirtyfirst mrs gold nodded she was there most of the night in the very back booth most of the night hardy repeated was she eating alone no sir i dont think she even ate much at all just drank a lot of tea she was having some serious talk real serious it seemed to me she frowned at a memory she even told me to stop coming by shed come get me if she needed something she was never like that usually so youd say she acted upset yep impatient like frustrated but she stayed there most of the night is that right right until what time would you estimate well wed already closed up the rest of the back room so it was after midnight say twelve thirty twelve thirty on the night she was killed hardy repeated glancing up at hill and was she there with another person the whole time yes sir they met at the front door and came back together hardy stepped away to the side of the witness box now mrs gold id like to ask you to take your time and look carefully and tell me if you recognize that person the person who sat arguing with elaine wager on the last night of her life is that person in this courtroom yes sir mrs gold said with no hesitation raising a hand and pointing right there at that table the woman not the man mrs gold are you pointing to sharron pratt the district attorney of san francisco is that her name yeah whatever that was her stunned by estelle golds testimony the courtroom collectively seemed to suck in its breath pratt herself opened and closed her mouth several times until she finally got to her feet and managed to speak i did not kill her she whispered then repeated more strongly i did not kill her from his spot in the middle of the courtroom hardy spoke gently no i dont think you did ms pratt but then hill all but stammered up on the bench mr hardy the defense calls gabriel torrey in spite of everything the chief assistant gave no sign that he was beaten yet he sat straightbacked in the witness chair his face set but by no means fearful if anything he appeared ready for a fight hardy stood squared off five feet in front of him mr torrey did you meet with elaine wager on the night she was killed no of course not no was that because you were in fact out with ms pratt the entire evening no i wasnt out with ms pratt thats right you werent if you had been estelle gold would have seen you at davids deli isnt that right i guess she would have if she saw sharron as she said but just this morning didnt you tell my associate david freeman that you specifically remembered that you had spent the entire evening of elaine wagers murder with sharron pratt for the first time there was the slightest hesitation so what if i told him that so its not true no it was another lie you mean a sardonic snort when did i stop beating my wife is that it the answer is that i wanted to get rid of him hes a pest i told him whatever would serve that purpose all right hardy cast a glance at judge hill then came back to torrey will you then please tell the court and truthfully what you were doing on the night of elaine wagers murder i was at my apartment alone and what is the address of your apartment bush street hardy repeated the number and how many blocks is that from maiden lane torrey shrugged i dont know ive never counted them interesting hardy said id have thought you would have i did this morning its three blocks puffed up in his arrogance torrey turned to the bench queried the judge your honor was that a question this is ridiculous id like to be excused but hill wasnt buying that i dont think so mr torrey mr hardy continue thank you your honor he came back to his witness so you spent the entire night at your apartment three blocks from maiden lane is that correct yes you never left your apartment not even once no stymied fighting his frustration hardy took another tack isnt it true mr torrey that mr visser supplied you with a firearm this brought an actual laugh absolutely not i dont own any firearms never have you did not get any weapon from mr visser is that so thats right you realize that your friend mr visser is going to give you up for immunity dont you this wasnt any kind of reasonable question but no one objected and hardy had had enough he wanted to bring this all home to torrey and in fact the reality of hardys point did slow him down it showed on his face hardy didnt let up visser was in on the gironde scam too wasnt he and logan once theyre charged with conspiracy to kill ms wager get a grip they were both in la that night hardy turned and faced the da well that would only leave ms pratt then wouldnt it she was with ms wager torrey considered a beat then he shrugged i dont know about that i doubt it hardys eyes stayed on pratt as the truth hit her if he had to and it looked as though it had come to that her chief assistant lover and political mentor was prepared to give her up and this finally was more than she could bear she came to her feet you doubt it she all but screamed no you know about that gabe you know it wasnt me torrey looked straight ahead with all the expression of a dead man as hardy watched pratts face first broke then hardened as she finally came to accept what shed obviously feared and denied for all this time in ten seconds before hardys eyes she aged a decade he spoke to her you telephoned mr torrey sometime during the night didnt you ms pratt while you were arguing with elaine at davids deli after it became clear that things werent going well you werent going to be able to convince her to let it go were you it was gironde pratt hung her head and now she raised it the minority contracts that part was sacred to her thats what she couldnt forgive gabe for manipulating torrey snapped at her shut up sharron for gods sake he was coming up off the witness chair dont be a fool a brief bitter laugh before she reassembled her face now she faced her betrayer calmly were you going to let them pin it on me gabe do you think id sit here and let you do that she came back to hardy to the judge he lied it wasnt gambling debts with logan it was kickbacks from girondes competitors when elaine came to him the first time because shed once liked him and called him on it he told her hed call off the harassments which turned out to be another lie thats when she came to me sharron you cant she ignored him dead eyes on the judge nothing could stop her now he wasnt at his place when i got there that night he told me that when i called him hed gotten upset and gone out for a walk to clear his head sharron torrey not giving up stop dont you understand theres still no proof theres nothing tying me to the gun withering him with a long stare she finally spoke without any inflection visser gave you the gun gabe and everybody in this courtroom knows it theres nothing she cut him off you know how it works she shook her head miserably theyll find all the proof they need now theyll go through your clothes match fibers to something on elaine therell be blood on your shoes pratt looked to the bench stopped talking in the stillness hardy walked solemnly back to the defense table behind his client and rested his hands on the young mans shoulders your honor he intoned the defense rests he must have dreamed it but so often the left hand didnt know what the right was doing that it had the force of epiphany glitsky alone woke up completely alert in his bed on saturday morning before his eyes were really open he reached for the telephone sergeant ridley banks hadnt signed out on a cityissued vehicle on the night he drove out to see eugene visser in his office on one of the piers hed taken his own car glitskys dream or whatever it was had ridley pulling into an open spot a block off the embarcadero on his first call glitsky got the license plate number of ridleys personal vehicle then he called the city tow lot yep they told him they had the car cost him a hundred and twentyfive bucks if he wanted to get it out glitsky hardy thieu a crime scene investigation team the drag line dredge unit and half a dozen uniformed officers made it a substantial party but nobody was happy contributing to the gloom a cold storm had blown in overnight bringing with it a steady rain driven by winds gusting to twentyfive thieu was down by the dredge wanting to see how it all worked glitsky had satisfied himself on that score years before on a body theyd pulled out of lake merced now he stood silently by the railing along the walkway above the bay his hands in his pockets the collar of his raincoat up around his ears hardy the boy scout had thought to bring an umbrella but it had already blown itself inside out once and now wasnt working as its manufacturer had intended he too was watching the dredge line the water silently waiting to see what they might pull up the quiet was in itself unnerving but the increased noise by the dredge theyd hooked up with something didnt lighten up anyones mood glitsky threw a look at hardy it was the type of assignment where you mostly wished you would fail and they both started moving forward but slowly ridley banks had a favorite black leather jacket and thats what abe saw first as it came clear of the murky green water the scar tightened through his lips by the time they got to where thieu stood the body was hung up on the line at about the water level they stood a moment heads hung sick in their hearts how did you know hardy asked rain was dripping down glitskys face although he paid it no mind he motioned behind him he left the car he used parked back over there we knew hed been to vissers but nobody knew where hed gone from there when he left once i found where the car had been towed from i realized he hadnt gone anywhere a look down over the railing except there hardy had a hard time taking his eyes off the body i dont get it he said after a while visser didnt need to kill him thieu shrugged so he didnt need to kill cullen alsop either maybe he found out he liked it maybe ridley told him more than he had to and he felt threatened easy paul glitsky said the sight of his colleagues body had put the young sergeant on edge ive got a theory glitsky added anybody want to hear it he didnt wait these three guys torrey logan visser theyre splitting up some good money working together more or less as equals everybodys got their own part in the various scams torreys using his office logans scouting up the business vissers the muscle all right so far thieu said glitsky nodded when elaine came to torrey the first time he thought hed convinced her to forget about blowing the whistle on him on them all maybe even bragged about it to the other two id bet he did glitsky stopped his eyes following the activity at the water the crew down below were working to untangle the body from the drag line from this distance he couldnt make out what damage had been done by the sea and its creatures but the body was now recognizably undoubtedly ridleys he pulled his gaze back up tried to gather his thoughts torrey bragged to the other guys hardy said helping him out although he too was captured by the drama unfolding on the dredge yeah glitsky said ok so they all knew elaine was on to their scene but mostly she was a threat to torrey on all kinds of levels if he got exposed they were all screwed but he had the farthest to fall in any event when she turned up killed vissers no dummy he knew it was torrey how did he know that thieu asked glitsky blew rainwater away from his mouth at the very least because hed given him the gun but then they already had this perfect suspect id given him to them and torrey had a history of working the system to all of their advantages so visser decided hed wait and see what happened maybe it would all work out but the other thing that really changed everything was that visser knowing about elaine gave him heavy leverage on torrey thieu didnt know the players as well as his lieutenant did and wanted to get it straight wouldnt logan have it too glitsky shook his head i doubt if logan knew hardy added to that all he would have cared about was that elaine was out of their lives they could keep partying thats who he is anyway glitsky continued vissers got this leverage and torrey makes a mistake he brokers the deal with cullen alsop whys that a mistake thieu again because from vissers point of view torrey got an unreliable junkie involved whos got a better than good chance to screw up an already lockedup case maybe visser even knew cullen knew hed renege break on cross something so anyway now the new visser is thinking hes smarter than torrey who before has always been the brains he decides he knows the best way to save them all from torreys stupid mistake hardy picked it up is to make sure cullen doesnt testify so he gives him a bag of china white thieu nodded in appreciation i can see that i bet well know for sure soon enough visser and torrey had both been arrested just outside the courtroom yesterday now with the appearance of ridleys body and whatever forensic evidence it might still have on it both would be available for questioning for at least the near future these rats will fall over themselves trying to save their own sorry asses by giving the other one up you watch so ridley spooked him hardy asked total blindside is my opinion abe said caught him completely off guard heres visser he just supplied cullen with the pure smack and it kills him everything had worked perfectly and now suddenly ridleys at his door out of the blue working without a partner and he puts visser on the griddle vissers an excop he knows hes made ridley pretends things are cool but hes not going to go away theres nothing else to do so visser does him with the glock you think thieu asked glitsky looked down over the railing again he wiped his whole hand over his eyes with something epilogue in the aftermath of the cole burgess hearing it became apparent that the upheaval from the elaine wager case was going to play a critical role in rearranging the citys political landscape for some time to come when judge timothy hill ordered both gabe torrey and gene visser remanded into custody as they sat in department it signaled the beginning of a new era of judicial activism in san francisco as well as the end of sharron pratts career the district attorney humiliated in both the public sector and in her private life did herself even more damage proving that as malraux declared long ago character is fate she spent nearly two weeks formulating reasons that feebly tried to explain away her own unconscionable behavior on the night of elaines death even in san francisco these excuses did not play in early march abandoned even by her closest advisers and under assault from every imaginable quarter sharron pratt resigned her office and within another week had moved out of the city reportedly to albuquerque where she had family on the day she resigned the grand jury formally indicted gabe torrey for the murder of elaine wager the mayor appointed clarence jackman notorious workaholic hardass to fill the position of district attorney until the election in november which suddenly loomed wide open jackman was of course no ones idea of a liberal but as usual the mayor had his finger on the pulse of the city and the appointment was greeted with nearuniversal praise for his own part jackman was persuaded to take the job at least partially because he had a falling out with his partner aaron rand over the latters sexual involvement with elaine wager soon after his firm had hired her one of jackmans first acts as da was to initiate an investigation of his own offices prior handling of girondes subcontractors regarding their minority hiring practices although he found that most were not in strict compliance with the citys guidelines none were so egregiously noncompliant as to trigger the claims of fraud that his predecessor had so vigorously pursued he dismissed the pending cases then signed and sent out a couple of dozen warning notices within two months the longdelayed airport construction project was at last ready to go forward jackman had answered his critics in his usual nononsense style gironde may not be a charitable organization but it was the lowest bidder for the project and it won the job fair and square now lets let em go to work he hired treya ghent as his personal assistant fulltime city position with full benefits her new employment package gave her seven years seniority for the time shed previously worked at the hall her starting pay was nearly twice what shed been making as a paralegal with rand and jackman dear mom its four months today exactly a hundred and twenty days i know you wanted to come down over memorial day but i think its better if you dont visit at all in person im still not who i want to be in writing im closer but having you see me during the process trying to survive day to day it wasnt working im sorry but im more comfortable with this i hope you are anyway im letting myself believe that it isnt going to be too long mr hardy tells me that with the chronic overcrowding here the average yearlong only lasts a hundred and eightyfour days they need the cell space i shouldnt get my hopes up except they are if ive only got sixtyfour more days that will be august thanks for the offer but whenever it is when i get out ill be finding my own place there are programs here mr hardy laughs at the word but theyre not all bad that will help get me work someplace when i get out a lot of its physical but thats all right with me maybe a gym something like that the point is im clean now im going to stay that way start over maybe take a class in something its a day at a time just like they say but i dont think having you there to lean on is going to be any help jeff and dorothy sent me a birthday card the kids signed it too maybe you know that i owe them big time if it comes up tell them how sorry i am for how i treated them still am im at a hundred and seventyfour pounds today i broke pushups they just rang for lockdown got to go glitsky had gone through the whole administrative fandango and had finally been reinstated in his old job he worked one floor above treya in the same building but they hadnt seen each other in eleven days their last discussion about whether they should consider having a baby and starting a new family of their own together had been a little tense it ended with her walking out of his place well after midnight with no apparent plans to return now at just after seven on the first day of summer he stood in the alcove stoop of her apartment house and rang the outside bell and waited he pushed the button again waited some more no response perfect he said he turned and went back out onto the sidewalk looked up and then back down the street it was a glorious evening the sky clear blue overhead the sun casting long shadows glitsky was standing in the shade from the apartment buildings across the street on the warm breeze he picked up a scent of something delectable from one of the restaurants a few blocks down on clement garlic and ginger pork he turned all the way round once undecided he could come back call make an appointment for later but no he knew he had to stay here and wait it was too important he went back and sat on the edge of the stoop a half dozen physicalfitness types jogged or biked or powerwalked by him in various stages of comfort or pain a couple of guys in a serious discussion walked by with their dog four kids appeared from one of the doorways halfway down the block and shades of glitskys own childhood started a game of stickball in the middle of the street it wasnt the season but he caught a whiff of crab finally he stood up again and walked to the curb the evening sky had perceptibly darkened the high clouds shone in purples and pinks treyas building was completely in shadow now and over the rooftops across from him venus appeared he knew it was her before he could have truly recognized her still nearly two full blocks away she was walking with someone her daughter an arm around her shoulder drawing in a breath glitsky checked his resolve one last time all right he was going to do this he began to walk toward them when she saw him she stopped glitsky did too half a block still yawned between them she turned to raney and said something her daughter responded briefly reached out a hand and touched her shoulder then started to move toward glitsky when she came abreast of him she slowed met his gaze with a somber one of her own nodded please be sure she said and then had passed before he could think of anything appropriate to say they both came forward when theyd closed to a couple of yards they stopped he found himself incredibly taken with her physical presence her hair pulled back severely from the strong angular face she was wearing stonewashed jeans and a sleeveless tshirt with a new york yankees logo over the left breast the shirt seemed to shimmer with her breathing perhaps her heartbeat i used to hate the yankees he began until derek jeter her mouth was tight but she nodded me too but i like them now raney bought this for my last birthday i dont get to wear it too often no glitsky said i dont imagine so san francisco was a sweater town sleeveless wouldnt be in unless goosebumps became all the rage he stood impotently before her for another eternity finally he said orels moving out in two years hes the last one im done ive done this youve only done it with boys it might be a girl you havent done a girl if things had been different the reference to elaine hit him powerfully brought him up short im fiftytwo years old he said at last i know that ill be seventythree minimum by the time any child we have is twenty you realize that of course ill be fiftyfour so what so a lot of things she stared at him expectantly angrily weve already done this part abe i know i know so if its the same answer we dont need to do it again he nodded time had completely ceased to exist he forced his voice to work i didnt come here because i had the same answer she waited i came here to say yes if you still he stopped tripped up in the words in wanting to get them perfectly right yes was all he could come out with her eyes began to fill and they moved toward each other his arms closed around her it might be unbelievably hard he whispered i might not live that long we might she pulled back far enough to put a finger against the scar on his lips her eyes bored into his face and a smile tickled the corners of her mouth whats your point she asked and shut him up with a kiss john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of such novels as the mercy rule the th juror nothing but the
