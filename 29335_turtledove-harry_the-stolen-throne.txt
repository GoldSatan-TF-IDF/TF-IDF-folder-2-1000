harry turtledove the stolen throne time of troubles dedication to the redlines father and son the events chronicled in the books of the time of troubles begin about years before those described in the tale of krispos and thus about years before those of the videssos cycle from the battlements of the stronghold abivard looked north across the broad sweep of land his father godarz held in the name of the king of kings out beyond the village that surrounded the stronghold most of what he saw was sere and brown from high summer only near the vek rud river and in the gardens nourished by the underground channels called qanats did green defy the blazing sun off to the east the videssians makurans longtime foes gave reverence to the sun as a symbol of their god to abivard the sun was too unreliable for worship roasting the highland plateau of makuran in summertime and then all but disappearing during the short cold days of winter he raised his left hand in a gesture of benediction familiar to his folk in any case the videssian god was false he was as certain of that as of his own name the god had spoken to the makuraners through the prophets four narseh gimillu the lady shivini and fraortish eldest of all whom are you blessing there son a gruff raspy voice asked from behind him abivard whirled i greet you father im sorry i didnt hear you come up no harm no harm godarz let loose a few syllables of laughter as if he held only so much and didnt want to use it all up at once abivard sometimes thought his father was a mold into which he himself had been pressed not quite hard enough they had the same long rectangular faces the same proud noses the same dark hooded eyes under thick brows the same swarthy skin and black hair even these past five years or so the same full beards but abivards face still lacked the lines of character the years had etched across godarzs features the creases in his cheeks told of laughter and sorrow the furrows in his forehead of thought by comparison abivard seemed to himself a house not yet lived in to the fullest there was one furrow the years had not put in godarzs face the scar that seamed his left cheek came from the shamshir of a khamorth raider that mark vanished under his beard but like a qanat traced by the greenery above it a line of white hair showed its track abivard envied him that mark too whom were you blessing godarz asked again no one in particular father abivard said i thought of the four so of course i made their sign good lad good lad godarz was in the habit of repeating himself abivards mother burzoe and the dihqans other wives teased him about it all the time he always took it goodnaturedly once he had cracked the lot of you would be less happy if i hadnt cared to repeat my vows abivard said if i asked the four to ask the god to bless any part of this domain in particular i suppose i should ask his favor for the flocks you couldnt do better godarz thumped abivard fondly on the shoulder wed be poorthieving nomads take poor son wed be deadwithout em i know away from the river away from the qanats the land was too dry to support crops most years that was true of most of the highland plateau after the spring rains though grass and low shrubs carpeted the hills and valleys enough of the hardy plants lived on through the rest of the year to give fodder for sheep and cattle horses and camels from those the dihqansthe lesser nobilityand all who depended on them made their livelihoods godarz scratched at the puckered scar though it was years old it still sometimes itched he said while youre about your prayers you might do as ive done and beg the four to give us another year of peace along the northern frontier maybe theyll harken to the two of us together maybe they will his expression grew harsh or maybe they wont abivard clicked his tongue between his teeth its as bad as that aye it is godarz said i was out riding this morning giving the new gelding some work and i met a rider homeward bound toward mashiz from the degird river the khamorth are stirring again he says a messenger from the king of kings abivard said why didnt you invite him to refresh himself at the stronghold then id have had a chance to talk with him too instead of getting my news secondhand he thought i did son i did but he said me nay godarz answered said he grudged the time hed stop to rest only at night the news for peroz king of kings was that urgent he said and when he gave it me i could but bob my head up and down and wish him the gods protection on his road well abivard practically hopped with impatience and excitement concern rode his voice as well not too many farsangs east of godarzs domain the little vek rud bent north and flowed into the degird the frontier and the steppe nomads who dwelt beyond it were close close he learned why the tribes are stirring godarz said portentously after another pause that almost drove abivard mad the dihqan went on the tribes are stirring because by the four videssos is stirring them here abivard exclaimed how could that be godarzs face went harsh his scar normally darker than the rest of his skin turned pale rage but he held his voice under tight control the pardrayan plain runs east almost forever videssos could send an embassy across itnot quickly but it could and by all the signs it has the god for reasons best known to himself has made videssos rich in gold abivard nodded his fathers treasure horde had more than a few fine videssian goldpieces in it every nation in the world took those goldpieces and was glad to have them the corruption and deviousness of the empire of videssos were bywords in makuran but the imperials kept their coinage honest no matter which avtokrators face graced a coins obverse it would be pure gold minted at seventytwo to the pound makuran coined mostly in silver its arkets were good money but money changers always took a premium above their face value when exchanging them for videssian gold i see ive no need to draw you a picture in the sand no need at all godarz went on the cowardly men of the east not having the kidneys to fight us as warriors against warriors bribe the nomads to do their work for them they are no fit warriors thentheyre no better than assassins abivard said hotly surely the god will open a pit beneath their feet and drop them into the void to be nothing forevermore may it be so godarzs left hand twisted in a gesture different from the one abivard had used one that condemned the wicked the dihqan added vicious dogs that they are they know no caste abivard copied the sign his father had used to his way of thinking godarz could have pronounced no curse more deadly life in makuran pivoted on its five castes the king of kings and the royal household the priests and the seven clans of the high nobility the lesser nobles like godarzmakurans backbone they called themselves the merchants and the peasants and herders who made up the bulk of the populace the seven clans and the dihqans fought for the king of kings sometimes under his own banner sometimes under one of the high nobles abivard could no more imagine paying someone so he could evade that duty than he could think of taking a knife and cutting off his manhood he would lose it no more one way than the other well if the videssians were hucksters even at war the nobles of the plateau would surely teach the nomads they had bought where true honor lay abivard said as much loudly that brought back his fathers smile godarz thumped him on the back and said when the red banner of war returns from mashiz blood of my blood i think it likely you will ride with me against those who would despoil us yes abivard said and then again in a great shout yes he had trained for war since he was a boy who barely reached godarzs chest he had learned to ride to thrust with the lance to bear the weight of armor to wield a scimitar to wield the bow but makuran had been unwontedly peaceful of late his lessons remained lessons only now at last he would have the chance to apply them against a real foe and one who needed beating if the nomads swarmed south over the degird as they had a way of doing every generation or two they would kill they would steal and worst of all they would wreck qanats so people would go hungry until the underground channels were laboriously repaired godarzs laugh was the small happy one of a man well pleased with his son i can see you want to get into your mail shirt and clap on your helmet this very moment its a long way to mashiz and backwe shant be riding out tomorrow or next week either even after the red banner warns of war it will be a while yet before the army reaches us and we join its ranks abivard shifted restively from foot to foot why doesnt the king of kings have his palace in makuran proper not on the far side of the dilbat mountains overlooking the thousand cities three reasons godarz said sounding like a pedagogue though abivard had only been venting spleen first we of makuran are most likely to be loyal to our lord being of his blood and hence require less oversight second the land between the tutub and the tib above which mashiz sits is full of riches not just the famous thousand cities but also farmlands more fertile than any the plateau boasts and third mashiz is a hundred farsangs closer to videssos than the plateau and videssos is more important to us most times than our northwestern frontier most times aye but not today abivard said no today the khamorth tribes are stirring or so its said godarz agreed but who set them in motion not their own chieftains videssos abivard said aye videssos we are her great rival as she is ours one day i think only one of us will be left standing godarz said and that one will rule the world abivard said in his minds eye he saw the king of kings lion banner floating above the videssian avtokrators palace in videssos the city saw priests of the prophets four praising the god in the high temple to false phos the setting for the capital of videssos remained blurry to him though he knew the sea surrounded it on three sides and he had never seen a sea not even the inland mylasa sea into which the degird river flowed he pictured a sea as something like one of the salt lakes that dotted the makuraner plateau but bigger still his imagination could not quite grasp a body of water too vast to see across godarz smiled youre thinking we shall be the one arent you as do i son as do i the god grant it be so yes abivard said i was also thinkingif we conquer father ill see the sea the sea around videssos the city i mean i understood you godarz said that would be a sight wouldnt it ive not seen it either you know but dont expect the day to come in your time though their border has marched with ours for eight hundred years now since the tharpiya hillmen ruled makuran theyve not smashed us yet nor we them one day though the dihqan nodded as if very sure that day would come then with a last grin at his son he went on down the walkway his striped caftan flapping around his ankles every so often bending down to make sure a piece of golden sandstone was securely in place abivard stayed up on the walk a few minutes more then went down the stairs that led to the strongholds inner courtyard the stairs were only a couple of paces wide and had no railing had a brick shifted under his feet he could have dashed out his brains on the rockhard dirt below the bricks did not shift godarz was as careful and thoroughgoing in inspecting as he was with everything else down in the courtyard the sun beat at abivard with redoubled force for it reflected from the walls as well as descending directly his sandals scuffed up dust as he hurried toward the shaded living quarters the stronghold was a rough triangle taking advantage of the shape of the rocky knob on which it sat the short wall on the eastern side ran north and south the other two which ran toward each other from its bottom and top were longer and went northwest and southwest respectively the living quarters were tucked into the corner of the eastern wall and the one that went northwest that gave them more shadow than they would have had anywhere else abivard took a long happy breath as he passed through the ironfaced wooden doorthe living quarters of course doubled as citadel the thick stone walls made the quarters much cooler than the blazing oven of the courtyard they were also much gloomier the windows being designed for defense as well asand ahead ofvision were mere slits with heavy shutters that could be slammed together at a moments notice abivard needed a small stretch of time for his eyes to adjust to dimness he stepped carefully until they did the living quarters were a busy place along with servants of the stronghold bustling back and forth he had to be alert for merchants and peasants who failing to find his father would press their troubles on him hearing those troubles was one of his duties but not one he felt like facing right now he also had to keep an eye out for children on the floor his two full brothers varaz and frada were men grown and his sister denak had long since retreated to the womens chambers but his half brothers ranged in age from jahiz who was older than frada down to a couple of brats who still sucked at their wet nurses breasts half brothersand half sisters under the age of twelvebrawled through the place together with servants children shepherd boys and whomever else they could drag into their games when they werent in hot pursuit of dragons or evil enchanters or khamorth bandits they played makuraners and videssians if videssos had fallen as easily in reality as in their games the domains of the king of kings would have stretched east to the legendary northern sea centuries ago one of his half brothers an eightyearold named parsuash dodged around abivard thwarting another lad who pursued him cant catch me cant catch me parsuash jeered see im in my fortress and you cant catch me your fortress is going to the kitchens abivard said and walked off that gave rodak his other half brother the chance to swoop down for the kill parsuash screeched in dismay in the kitchens some flatbread just out of the oven lay cooling on its baking pan abivard tore off a chunk of it then stuck slightly scorched fingers into his mouth he walked over to a bubbling pot used the piece of flatbread to scoop out some of the contents and popped it into his mouth ground lamb balls and pomegranate seeds he said happily after he swallowed i thought that was what i smelled father will be pleasedits one of his favorites and what would you have done had it been something else son of the dihqan one of the cooks asked eaten it anyhow i expect abivard answered the cook laughed abivard went on since it is what it is though he tore off another piece of flatbread then raided the pot again the cook laughed louder still chewing abivard left the kitchens and went down the hall that led to his own room since he was eldest son of godarzs principal wife he had finally got one to himself which led to envious sighs from his brothers and half brothers to him privacy seemed a mixed blessing he enjoyed having a small place to himself but had been so long without one that sometimes he felt achingly alone and longed for the warm squabbling companionship he had known before halfway down the hall his left sandal started flapping against his foot he peered down and discovered he had lost the bronze buckle that held a strap around his ankle he looked around and even got down on his hands and knees but didnt find it it probably fell into the void he muttered under his breath moving with an awkward halfskating motion he made it to his doorway went into his room and put on a new pair of sandals then he went out again damaged sandal in hand one of godarzs ruleswhich to his credit he scrupulously followed himselfwas that anything that broke had to be set right at once let one thing slide and soon twoll be gone two lead to four and fourwell there had better not be four there had better not he would say had just a bit of leather fallen off the sandal abivard could have gotten some from the stables and made his own rough repair but to replace a buckle he had to visit the cobbler in the village that surrounded the stronghold out into the heat again then the sun smote him like a club sweat sprang out on his face rolled down his back under his baggy garment he wished hed had farther to go he wouldnt have felt foolish about getting on his horse but if his father had seen him he would have made sarcastic noises about abivards riding in a sedan chair next time as if he were a high noble not just a dihqans son abivard walked the gate guards pounded the butts of their spears against the hard ground as he went by he dipped his head to return the salute then he left the stronghold and went into the village an altogether different world homes and shops straggled down to the base of the hill the stronghold topped and even for a little distance out onto the flat land below some were of stone some of mud brick with widely overhanging thatched roofs to protect the walls from winter storms set beside the stronghold they all seemed like toys the hill was steep the streets winding and full of stones if you tumbled you were liable to end up at the bottom with a broken leg abivard had been navigating through town since he learned to toddle he was as surefooted as a mountain sheep merchants cried their wares in the market square chickpeas dates mutton buzzing with flies utterances of the prophets four on parchment amuletssaid to be sovereign against disease both as prevention and cure abivard whose education had included letters but not logic failed to wonder why the second would be necessary if the first was efficacious the calls rose from all around knives copper pots and clay ones jewelry of glass beads and copper wirethose with finer stuff came to sell at the strongholdand a hundred other things besides the smells were as loud as the shouts a fellow was keeping a pot of baked quinces hot over a dung fire abivard haggled him down from five coppers to three godarz was not a man who let his sons grow up improvident the quince was hot abivard quickly found a stick on the ground poked it through the spicy fruit and ate happily on his way down to the cobblers shop the cobbler bowed low when abivard came in he was not near enough in rank to the dihqans son to present his cheek for a ceremonial kiss as a couple of the richer merchants might have done abivard returned a precise nod and explained what he required yes yes the cobbler said let me see the good sandal pray that i may match the buckle as close as may be im afraid i didnt bring it abivard felt foolish and annoyed with himself though godarz was back in the stronghold he felt his fathers eye on him ill have to go back and get it oh never mind that your excellency just come here and pick out the one that nearest suits it theyre no two of em just alike anyhow the cobbler showed him a bowl half full of brass buckles they jingled as abivard sorted through them till he found the one he wanted the cobblers fingers deftly fixed it to the sandal deft as they were though they bore the scars of awl and knife and needle and nail no trade is simple godarz would say though some seem so to simple men abivard wondered how much pain the cobbler had gone through to learn his business he didnt dicker so hard with the cobbler as he had with the fruit seller the mans family had been in the village for generations serving villagers and dihqans alike he deserved his superiors support sandal repaired abivard could have gone straight back to the stronghold to escape the worst of the heat in the living quarters instead he returned to the bazaar in the marketplace and bought himself another quince he stood there taking little bites of it and doing his best to seem as if he were thinking about the goods offered for sale what he was really doing was watching the young women who went from this stall to that dealer in search of what they needed women of the merchant and peasant castes lived under fewer restrictions than those of the nobility oh a few wealthy merchants locked their wives and daughters away in emulation of their betters but most lowercaste women had to go out and about in the world to help feed their families abivard was betrothed to roshnani a daughter of papak the dihqan whose stronghold lay a few farsangs south and west of godarzs their parents having judged the match advantageous they were bound to each other before either of them reached puberty abivard had never seen his fiancee he wouldnt not till the day they were wed when he got the chance then he watched girlsthe serving women in the stronghold the girls in the village square here when one caught his eye he imagined roshnani looked like her when he spotted one he did not find fair he hoped his betrothed did not resemble her he finished nibbling the quince and licked his fingers he thought about buying yet another one that would give him an excuse to hang around in the square awhile longer but he was sensitive to his own dignity and whenever he forgot to be godarz made sure his memory didnt slip for long all the same he still didnt feel like going back to the stronghold he snapped his slightly sticky fingers in inspiration godarz had given him all kinds of interesting news why not find out what old tanshar the fortuneteller made of his future an additional inducement to this course was that tanshars house lay alongside the market square abivard could see that the old mans shutters were thrown wide open he could go in have his fortune read and keep right on eying the women hereabouts all without doing anything in the least undignified the door to tanshars house was on the side opposite the square like the shutters it gaped wide both to show the fortuneteller was open for business and to give him the benefit of whatever breeze the god chose to send one thing tanshar certainly had not done he had not used the prophetic gift to get rich his home was astringently neat and clean but furnished only with a muchbattered low table and a couple of wickerwork chairs abivard had the idea that he wouldnt have bothered with those had he not needed to keep his clients comfortable only scattered hairs in tanshars beard were still black giving it the look of snow lightly streaked with soot a cataract clouded the fortunetellers left eye the right one though still saw clearly tanshar bowed low your presence honors my house son of the dihqan he waved abivard to the less disreputable chair pressed upon him a cup of wine and date cakes sweet with honey and topped by pistachios not until abivard had eaten and drunk did tanshar ask how may i serve you abivard explained what he had heard from godarz then asked how shall this news affect my life here let us learn if the god will vouchsafe an answer tanshar pulled his own chair close to abivards he pulled up the left sleeve of his caftan drew off a silver armlet probably worth as much as his house and everything in it put together he held it out to abivard take hold of one side whilst i keep a grasp on the other we shall see whether the prophets four grant me a momentary portion of their power busts of the four prophets adorned the armlet young narseh his beard barely sprouted gimillu the warrior a strong face seamed with scars shivini who looked like everyones mother and fraortish eldest of all his eyes inset with gleaming jet though the silver band had just come from tanshars arm it was cool almost cold to the touch the fortuneteller looked up at the thatched roof of his little cottage abivards gaze followed tanshars all he saw was straw but he got the odd impression that tanshar peered straight through the roof and up to the gods home on the far side of the sky let me see tanshar murmured may it please you let me see his eyes went wide and staring his body stiffened abivards left hand the one that held the armlet tingled as if it had suddenly fallen asleep he looked down a little golden light jumped back and forth from one prophets image to the next at last it settled on fraortish eldest of all making his unblinking jet eyes seem for an instant alive as they stared back at abivard in a rich powerful voice nothing like his own tanshar said son of the dihqan i see a broad field that is not a field a tower on a hill where honor shall be won and lost and a silver shield shining across a narrow sea the light in the silver fraortishs eyes faded tanshar slumped as he seemed to come back to himself when abivard judged the fortuneteller had fully returned to the world of rickety wicker chairs and the astounding range of smells from the bazaar he asked what did that mean what you just told me maybe tanshar wasnt all the way back to the real world his good eye looked as blank as the one that cataract clouded i have delivered the prophecy he asked his voice small and uncertain yes yes abivard said impatiently repeating himself like his father he gave tanshar back the words he had uttered doing his best to say them just as he had heard them the fortuneteller started to lean back in his chair then thought better as it creaked and rustled under his weight he took the armlet from abivard and put it back on his parchmentskinned arm that seemed to give him strength slowly he said son of the dihqan i remember nothing of this nor did i speak to you someonesomethingused me as an instrument despite the bakeoven heat he shivered you will see i am no youth in all my years of telling what might lay ahead this has befallen me but twice before the little hairs prickled up on abivards arms and at the back of his neck he felt caught up in something vastly bigger than he was cautiously he asked what happened those two times one was a skinny caravaneer back around the time you were born tanshar said he was skinny because he was hungry he told me i foresaw for him piles of silver and gems and today he is rich in mashiz and the other abivard asked for a moment he didnt think tanshar would answer the fortunetellers expression was directed inward and he looked old old then he said once i was a lad myself you know a lad with a bride about to bear him his firstborn she too asked me to look ahead so far as abivard knew tanshar had always lived alone what did you see he asked almost whispering nothing tanshar said i saw nothing again abivard wondered if he would go on at last he did she died in childbed four days later the god give her peace the words tasted empty in abivards mouth he set a hand on tanshars bony knee once for great good once for great ill and now me what does your foretelling mean son of the dihqan i do not know tanshar answered i can say only that these things lie across your future when and where and to what effect i cannot guess and shall not lie to claim i can you will discover them or they you as the god chooses to unwind the substance of the world abivard took out three silver arkets and pressed them into the fortunetellers hand tanshar rang them against one another then shook his head and gave them back offer these to the god if that please you but not to me i did not speak these words whether they came through me or not i cannot accept your coin for them keep them please abivard said looking around the clean but barren little house to my mind you stand more in need of them than the god but tanshar again shook his head and refused to take the money they are not for me i tell you had i read your future in the ordinary way gauging what was to come by the motions of the prophets armlet between your hand and mine i should be glad of the fee for then i had earned it for thisno one of the things godarz had taught abivard was to recognize a mans stubbornness and to know when to yield to it let it be as you say then abivard flung the arkets out the window where they go now and with whom is in the gods hands tanshar nodded that was well done may the foretelling you heard through me mean only good for you may it be so abivard said when he rose from the chair he bowed low to tanshar as he might have to one of the upper nobility that seemed to distress the fortuneteller even more than the prophecy that had escaped its usual bounds accept the salute at least for the god abivard told him and reluctantly he did abivard left the fortunetellers house he had thought to linger in the bazaar awhile longer buying more small things he didnt really need so he could look at maybe even talk with the young women there not now though he peered out over the sunscorched land that ran out toward the vek rud river nothing much grew on it now not at this season did that make it a broad field that was not a field prophecy had one problem how to interpret it he turned and looked up the slope of the hill on which the stronghold perched was it the tower where honor would be won and lost it didnt look like a tower to him but who could judge how the god perceived things and what of the sea did tanshars words mean he would see it one day as he hoped which sea had the fortuneteller meant who would shine a silver shield across it all questionsno answers he wondered if he would have been happier with an ordinary foretelling no he decided if nothing else this surely meant he would be bound up in great events i dont want to watch my life slide by while i do nothing but count the days he said aloud for all his fathers teaching he was still young in the days and weeks that followed abivard took to looking south and west from the walls he knew what he was waiting to see so did godarz who teased him about it every so often but the dihqan spent a good deal of time at the corner where the eastern and the southfacing walls met too abivard felt justified in haunting that corner when he spied the rider approaching the stronghold the horseman carried something out of the ordinary in his right hand at first abivard saw only the wriggling motion then he recognized that a banner was making it and then he saw the banner was red he let out a whoop that made heads turn his way all around the stronghold the war banner he cried the war banner comes forth from mashiz he didnt know where godarz had been but his father stood on the wall beside him in less than a minute the dihqan also peered south aye that is the war banner and no mistake he said lets go down and greet the messenger shall we lets go the horseman who carried the token of war was worn and dusty godarz greeted him with all the proper courtesies pressing wine and honey cakes on him before inquiring of his business that question though was but a formality the crimson banner limp now that the messenger no longer rode at a fast trot spoke for itself still makuran was built on formality and just as godarz had to ask the question the messenger had to answer it he raised the banner so the red silk fluttered again for a moment on its staff then said peroz king of kings having declared it the duty of every man of makuran entitled to bear arms to band together to punish the khamorth savages of the steppe for the depredations they have inflicted on his realm and for the connivance with videssos the great enemy now commands each high noble and dihqan to gather a suitable force to be joined to peroz king of kings own armament which shall progress toward and across the river degird for the purpose of administering the aforesaid punishment getting all that out in one breath was hard thirsty work when the messenger had finished he took a long pull at the wine then let out an even longerand happiersigh then he drank again ever courteous godarz waited till he was comfortable before asking when will the armament of the king of kingsmay his years be many and his realm increasereach the river degird pray in effect he was asking when it would reach the stronghold which lay only a couple of days journey south of the frontier he was also askingwith perfect discretionhow serious the king of kings was about going on campaign the slower he and his army traveled the less they were likely to accomplish the messenger answered peroz king of kings began mustering his forces the day news of the plainsmens insolence reached him the red banner began its journey through the land that same day the army should reach this neighborhood inside the month abivard blinked to hear that godarz didnt but he might as well have he is serious the dihqan murmured serious the word ran through the courtyard mens headsswarthy longfaced bearded basically cut from the same cloth as godarz and abivardsolemnly bobbed up and down the king of kings of makuran had great power and most often wielded it with ponderousness to match peroz king of kings does want to punish the steppe nomads abivard said he got more nods for that from his father among others excitement blazed in him hed been a boy the last time the king of kingsit had been valash then perozs fathercampaigned against the khamorth he still remembered the glorious look of the army as it had fared north bright with banners godarz had gone with it and come back with a bloody flux recalling that took some shine off the remembered glory but still this time he thought ill ride with them godarz asked the messenger will you lay over with us tonight well feast you as best we can for your own sake and for the news you bring we on the frontier know the danger from the plainsmen we know it well one hand went to the scar he bore a forefinger tracked the white streak in his beard the dihqan is gracious the messenger replied but he shook his head i fear i cannot take advantage of your generosity i have far to travel yet today all the domains must hear the proclamation of the king of kings and time you will have gathered is short so it is godarz said so it is he turned to one of the cooks who stood in the courtyard with everyone else go back to the kitchens sakkiz fetch pocket bread stuffed with smoked mutton and onions aye and a skin of good wine as well let no man say we sent the mouth of the king of kings away hungry the dihqan is gracious the messenger said now sincerely rather than out of formal politeness he had meant what he had said about his journeys being urgent no sooner had sakkiz brought him the food and wine than he was on his way again urging his horse up into a trot he held the war banner high so it fluttered with the breeze of his motion abivard had eyes only for the crimson banner until a bend in the road took it behind some of the village houses and out of sight then as if awakening from a dream he glanced toward his father godarz had been looking at him too abivard had trouble reading the expression on his face the dihqan gestured to him here step aside with me we have things to talk about you and i abivard stepped aside with godarz the folk of the stronghold stood back and gave them room to talk privately makuraners were a polite folk had they been videssians they probably would have crowded forward to hear better so tales from the east said at any rate abivard had never set eyes on a videssian in his life i suppose you expect to come with me on this campaign godarz said i suppose you do yes father you said i would abivard gave godarz an appalled stare could his father have been thinking of leaving him behind how could he hope to hold his head up in the stronghold in the village if he was judged not enough of a man to fight to defend the domain i can ill spare you here son godarz said heavily the god only knows what would befall this place if one of us at least did not have his eyes on it hearing that abivard felt his heart drop into his sandals if his father didnt let him go he would he didnt know what he would do he needed a gesture full of grand despair but couldnt think of one what he felt like doing was bursting into tears but that would only humiliate him further godarz chuckled at his expression no need to look like that i am taking you along never fearwhat i say i will do i do you should get a taste of war while youre still young thank you father now abivard wanted to caper like a colt his heart returned to its proper place in his chest and began pounding loudly to remind him it was there of itself his hand made slashing motions through the air as if he were hacking a steppe nomad out of the saddle the god grant you thank me after we come home once more godarz said aye the god grant that one reason i want you to go to war lad is so youll see its not all the glory of which the pandoura players sing its a needful business at times that it is needful but maiming and killing are never to be taken lightly no matter how much theyre needed thats what i want you to see theres nothing glorious about a man with his guts spilled out on the ground trying to slit his own throat because he hurts too bad to want to go on living the image was vivid enough to give abivard a moments pause he knew you could die in battle when he thought of that though he thought of an arrow in the chest a moments pain and then eternity in the loving company of the god a long tormented end had never crossed his mind even now he could not make himself believe it not below the very surface of his mind you think it cant happen godarz said as if reading his thoughts abivard didnt answer his father went on i see you think it cant happen that is one of the reasons i want to take you to war to show you it can youll be a better man for knowing that better how abivard asked what could an intimate acquaintance with war and brutality give him that he didnt already have better because you wont take war lightly godarz answered men who dont know it have a way of getting into it too easily before they think carefully on whether it answers their need they kill themselves off that way of course but they also kill off too many excellent retainers bound to them by kinship and loyalty when your day here comes son id not have you be that kind of dihqan as you say abivards voice was sober godarzs seriousness impressed him he was a few years past the age when he would think anything his father said wrong merely because his father said it his brother frada and some of his older half brothers were still caught up in that foolishness having come through it abivard had concluded that his father generally had a good idea of what he was talking about even if he did repeat himself godarz said i dont forget its your first time either i just want you to go into it with your wits about you remember your first girl all these years ago you werent the same afterward you wont be the same after this either but its not as much fun as your first woman not unless you have a taste for butchery i dont see that in you no i dont abivard didnt see it in himself either nor did he look very hard he remembered how exalted he had felt after he left a bit of silver at a certain widows house down in the village if he felt that way after a battle godarzs last few sentences undermined the lesson he had tried to get across godarz ceremoniously inserted a long bronze key into the lock that held the door to the womens quarters of the stronghold sealed he turned the key nothing happened he scowled pulled out the key glowered at it and inserted it once more this time abivard heard a satisfying click when the dihqan turned it he raised the bar and pushed open the door a sigh ran through the men who gathered together at a respectful distance down the hallway abivard tried to remember the last time his female relatives and godarzs secondary wives came forth from their seclusion it had been years he knew that as was her right burzoe led them abivards mother had to be close to godarz in age but did not show her years her wavy hair remained black with none of the suspicious sheen that would have pointed to the dyepot her face was a little broader than the makuraner norm and fairer through being secluded and seldom getting the chance to go out into the sun kept wellbred women paler than their toiling sisters burzoe walked out into the courtyard with a queens pride behind her another coin stamped from the same die came abivards sister denak she grinned when she saw him and stuck out her tongue they had been born hardly more than a year apart and stayed almost as close as twins until she became a woman and had to withdraw from the eyes of the world after denak came the parade of godarzs secondary wives and those of their daughters old enough to have gone into seclusion the last couple of wives were no older than some of the daughters had it not been for the set order in which they came forth abivard would not have known into which group they fell the sun flashed from gold bracelets and rings from rubies and topazes as burzoe raised her right hand to show she was about to speak silence at once fell over the courtyard the dihqans principal wife rarely appeared in public she was after all a respectable makuraner matron but she was also a person of great consequence in the stronghold her body might be confined to the womens quarters but through godarz her influence extended to every corner of the domain my husband my sons their brothers go off now to war she said the army of the king of kings is nigh they shall add their strength to his host so he can cross into the plainsmens country and punish them for the harm they have done us and the greater harm they plan also abivard thought the sooner we join the king of kings army and the sooner that host moves on toward the frontier the sooner they stop eating our domain out of house and home his mother had a glint in her eye that said she was thinking the same thing but it was not something she could say out loud burzoe went on our clan has won distinction on the field times beyond counting i know the coming campaign will be yet another such time i pray to the god that she grant all the sons of this house come home safe may it be so the women intoned together to them the god was a woman to abivard and those of his sex a man come home safe from the broad field beyond the river burzoe said safe the women chorused for a moment abivard listened to his mother going on then his head whipped around to stare at her was it coincidence that she used that phrase to describe the steppe country north of the degird tanshar had seen a broad field in abivards future too though he had not known where it lay go swiftly return with victory burzoe said her voice rising to a shout everyone in the courtyard men and women together cheered loudly godarz walked over embraced his principal wife and kissed her on the lips then he hugged denak and moved down the line of women hugging and kissing his wives hugging his daughters abivard and his younger brother varaz both of whom would accompany the dihqan to the camp of the king of kings embraced burzoe and denak so did frada though he was sickjealous of his brothers because godarz would not let him go fight a couple of abivards half brothers were also joining the king of kings host they hugged their mothers and sisters too as did their siblings who would stay behind in the stronghold when the dihqans women showed themselves in public such greetings were permitted as the wife of your father the dihqan i tell the two of you to fight bravely to make every warrior in the host admire your courage burzoe said to abivard and varaz her expression lost its sternness as your mother i tell you both that every moment will seem like a year till you come back to me well be back with victory as you told us abivard answered beside him varaz nodded vigorously his younger brother had something of the look of burzoe though his burgeoning beard helped hide that he was wider through the shoulders than abivard a formidable wrestler and archer denak said im wed to no dihqan so i have no special pride to uphold that means i can tell both of you to make sure you come back and make sure father does too she spoke to both her brothers but her eyes were chiefly on abivard he nodded solemnly though she had stayed behind the doors of the womens quarters since her courses began some of the closeness she and abivard had known as children still remained he knew she chiefly relied on him to do what she had asked and resolved not to fail her varaz said they work gold well out on the plains well bring back something new for the two of you to wear i have gold burzoe said even if i wanted more i could get it easily enough sons though sons are few and precious i would not exchange a one of them for all the gold in the world let alone on the steppe abivard hugged his mother again so tightly that she let out a faint squeak he said have no fear mother when the khamorth see the armament we have brought against them they will flee away in terror more likely than not our victory will be bloodless may it be so my son may it be so burzoe said are you repeating yourself now abivard asked her she smiled looking almost as young as denak beside her but then she grew serious again and times mark showed in her concern war is seldom bloodless i think you men would esteem its prizes less if they were more easily got so i say again take care she raised her voice to speak to everyone not just her sons take care as if that had been a signaland so it may have beengodarzs youngest and most recently married wife turned and walked slowly into the living quarters of the stronghold on her way back to the womens chambers behind her went the next most junior wife then the next and her oldest daughter denak squeezed abivards hands in hers itll be my turn in a moment mine and mothers come back safe and soon i love you and i you eldest sister everything will be all right youll see everyone was making such a fuss about coming home safe and avoiding disaster that he wanted to avert any possible bad omen as denak had said her turn to withdraw soon came she and burzoe walked with great dignity back toward the entrance to the living quarters godarz waited for them there the key to the womens chambers in his right hand burzoe said something to him then laughing stood on tiptoe to brush his lips with hers the dihqan laughed too and made as if to pat her on the backside he stopped well before he completed the motion had he gone through with it the stronghold would have buzzed with scandal for weeks that he even mimed it showed how close to the frontier his holding lay closer to mashiz manners were said to be more refined denak went into the living quarters a moment later smiling still so did burzoe godarz followed them inside after a couple of steps they seemed to disappear into shadow the doorway looked very dark and empty abivard felt he had put on a bake oven not his armor sweat ran down his face under the chainmail veil that hid his features from the eyes down a similar mail hood attached to the rear of his tall conical helmet protected the back of his neck and his shoulders and yet compared to the rest of him his head was well ventilated the breeze could blow through the mail there and cool him a little under the leather backing for the rest of his armor he wore cotton batting to keep a sword blow that iron might block from nonetheless breaking his bones mail covered his rib cage too below it two vertical rows of iron splints protected his belly and lower back from the bottom of the lower splints depended a short mail skirt his leather sleeves and trousers bore horizontal rings of laminated iron armor so did his boots semicircular iron guards projected from the ends of his armored sleeves toward the backs of his hands only his palms and fingers were free of armor his horse was armored too with a long scalemail trapper open at the front and rear to let its legs move freely a wroughtiron chamfron protected the animals face a ring at the top of the chamfron held several bright red streamers a similar ring at the crown of his own helmet held others of the same shade he carried a stout lance in a boss on the right side of his saddle a long straight sword hung from his belt the strength of makuran lay in its heavy horse armored to take punishment until they closed with the foe and gave it in return videssians fought mounted too but were more often archers than lancers as for the steppe nomads half the plainsmens way of fighting lies in running away he said thats so but its from necessity as well as fear godarz answered the dihqan was armored much like his son save that over his mail shirt he wore an iron plate bound to his breast with crisscross leather straps he went on they ride ponies on the far side of the degird they havent fodder enough to raise big horses like ours he set an affectionate hand on the side of his geldings neck just behind the last strap that held the chamfron in place well smash them then when we come together abivard said aye if we can make them stand and fight thats why they generally come to grief when they raid south of the degird we concentrate on them and force them to fight on our terms out on the steppe its not so easyour army is like one dot of ink on a vast sheet of parchment the horses clattered out of the stronghold godarz first then abivard and varaz then their eldest half brother jahiz and then two other half brothers of different maternal lineages arshak and uzav godarzs domain did not yield enough to support more than half a dozen fully armored riders that made it a mediumsized fish in the pond that was makuran the king of kings encampment had sprung up between the stronghold and the vek rud pointing to the sudden vast city of canvas and heavy silk abivard said that will be one dot of ink father i cannot believe it among the tents men boiled like ants on spilled food some maybe most were warriors the sun kept glinting off iron down there although many soldiers like abivard and his kin wore baggy caftans over their mail to keep themselves cooler but along with the fighting men would be wagon drivers cooks merchants body servants and likely women as well to keep peroz king of kings and his more prominent warriors happy of nights more people milled in the camp than abivard had imagined in mashiz but godarz laughed and said its different on the far side of the degird youll see soon enough abivard shook his head disbelieving godarz laughed again varaz said im with you brother mine thats not an army thats a country on the march jahiz said where are the villagers i expected theyd cheer us on our way abivard had expected the same thing but the narrow lanes were almost deserted getting a wave from a toothless old woman with a water jug balanced on her head was not the sendoff hed looked for they have more important things to do than wave goodbye to us godarz said everyone whos missing here is sure to be down at the camp trying to squeeze arkets from the soldiers as if they were taking the seeds from a pomegranate they wont have another chance at such riches for years to come and they know it he sounded amused and pleased his subjects were making the most of their opportunity some dihqans would have turned a handsome profit themselves by squeezing as much of their peoples sudden wealth from them as they could the motto godarz had repeated until abivard grew sick of hearing it was take the fleece from the flock not the hide down off the strongholds knob rode godarz and his five sons abivards heart pounded nervously all his life he had been something special first son of the domains dihqan the nearer he got to the camp the less that seemed to matter banners marked the pavilions of the marzbans of the seven clans who served as division commanders under peroz king of kings abivards head went this way and that searching for the woadblue flags of chishpish in whose division he and his family were mustered there he exclaimed pointing good for you lad godarz said you spotted them before any of us well i suppose wed best go pay our respects to his high and mightiness eh he urged his horse forward with the pressure of his heels against its barrel behind abivard jahiz let out a halfstrangled cough abivard was a little scandalized himself although he had heard his father speak slightingly of the high nobility before as far as godarz was concerned the dihqans were the most important caste of makuran the camp sprawled across a vast stretch of ground with no order abivard could see spotting chishpishs banner from afar didnt mean he and his relatives could easily get to it they had to pick their way around tents pitched at random and through groups of warriors and hangerson intent on their own destinations at last though they stood before the entrance of the big silk pavilion a pair of guards in armor fancier than godarzs barred their way who comes one of them asked as godarz dismounted and tied his horse to a stake pounded into the rockhard ground the fellow spoke with a mincing southern accent but abivard would not have cared to have to fight him he looked tougher than he sounded godarz answered with flowery formality i am godarz son of abivard dihqan of vek rud domain he pointed back toward the stronghold i bring my five sons to kiss the feet of the marzban chishpish as we shall have the ineffable honor of fighting under his banner if you fight as well as you speak the marzban will be well served the guard answered abivard sat up straight with pride godarz waved his hand to acknowledge the compliment then turned to his sons at his nod they also got down from their horses and tethered them the guard pulled up the tent flap stuck his head in and declared godarz dihqan of vek rud and his sons let them enter a voice from within said enter the guard and his companion held the flaps apart so godarz abivard and the rest could easily pass within abivards first dazed thought was that chishpish lived with more luxury in the field than godarz did in his own stronghold light folding tables of fragrant sandalwood inlaid with ivory silver bowls decorated in low relief and piled high with sweetmeats a richly brocaded carpet that was to abivards mind far too fine to set on bare dirt a small videssian enamelwork icon of some phosworshiping holy man it was as if the high noble had simply packed up his home and brought it with him on campaign he should have used the elephant for something more than its ivory abivard thought impolitely as he caught sight of his leader riding for instance chishpish was heavy enough to strain any horse that was certain his flesh bulged against the fabric of his caftan which sparkled with silver threads his pilos the bucketshaped makuraner headgear had rings of bright colors broidered round it he smelled of patchouli the strong scent made abivard want to sneeze for all his bulk though he had manners he heaved himself to his feet and offered a cheek for godarz and his sons to kiss not all high nobles would have conceded that a dihqan and his scions were but a little lower in rank than his own exalted self abivard had expected literally to have to kiss the marzbans feet i am sure you will fight bravely for the king of kings godarz of the vek rud domain chishpish said your sons are abivard varaz jahiz arshak and uzav godarz answered the marzban repeated the names without a bobble which impressed abivard the fat man did not look like a warriorhe looked more like two warriorsbut he did not sound like a fool being godarzs son abivard feared fools above all else outside the tent a trumpet blew a harsh fanfare a herald bawled eat dirt before the divine the good the pacific the ancient peroz king of kings fortunate pious beneficent to whom the god has given great fortune and great empire giant of giants formed in the image of the god eat dirt for peroz comes the fanfare blared out again louder than before chishpishs guards flung the tent flap wide abivard went down on his belly on chishpishs fine carpet his forehead pressed against the wool his armor rattled and clanked as he prostrated himself around him his siblings and father also went down into the posture of adoration so did chishpish though his fat face reddened with the effort the sudden exertion cost him rise peroz said abivards heart beat fast as he returned to his feet not from having to stand while burdened with iron and leather but rather because he had never expected to encounter the king of kings face to face despite the heralds formal announcement peroz was not ancient was not in fact much older than godarz his beard was mostly black his mustaches waxed stiff stuck out like the horns of a bull he wore his hair long and bound with a fillet in back his cheeks seemed unnaturally ruddy after a moment abivard realized they were rouged chishpish of the seven clans present to me these warriors whom i find in your tent the king of kings said as your majesty commands so shall it be chishpish answered here first we have the dihqan godarz of vek rud domain our present home with him he brings the army his sons again the high noble rattled off abivards name and the rest his memory swallowed as much as his mouthwhich given his girth was no mean feat you are well equipped and your sons also peroz told godarz those are your horses outside the pavilion at godarzs nod peroz went on fine animals as well makuran would be stronger if all domains contributed as yours does your majesty is generous beyond my deserts godarz murmured abivard marveled that his father could speak at all had the king of kings addressed him he was sure his tongue would have cloven to the roof of his mouth peroz shook his head you are the generous one offering yourself and your five stalwart sons that the kingdom may flourish which is your heir abivard here godarz said setting a hand on his eldests armored shoulder abivard son of godarz look to your father as a symbol of loyalty peroz said aye your majesty i do abivard said he could talk after all good peroz told him the god grant that you never need to put forth a like sacrifice should this campaign progress as i plan that may come true i aim to go straight at the nomads force them to battle and crush them like this the king of kings ground one fist against the palm of his other hand may it be so your majesty abivard saidthere he had spoken twice now all the same he remembered what his father had said about the difficulties of fighting the plainsmen on their own ground the wisdom of the king of kings was an article of faith among makuraners the wisdom of godarz abivard had seen with his own eyes and heard with his own ears peroz turned back to chishpish whom he had truly come to see chishpish of the seven clans on you will fall much of the responsibility for bringing the khatrishers to bay is all in readiness in that regard it is your majesty we shall burn great swaths of steppeland compelling the nomads either to face us or to lose their pasturage thousands of torches await in the wagons a torch a bright one flared inside abivards head north of the degird the khamorth lived by their flocks and herds if those animals could not graze the plainsmen would starve they would have to fight to prevent that he glanced over at godarz his father was slowly nodding abivard nodded too his faith in the wisdom of the king of kings restored the broad muddy degird separated the farms and strongholds and towns of makuran from the barbarians who lived on the far bank no permanent bridges spanned the stream any king of kings who proposed erecting one would have had every dihqan in the northwestern part of the realm rise in revolt against him the khamorth managed to slip across the degird too often as things wereno point in giving them a highway but the grand army of peroz king of kings could not go over the river by dribs and drabs nor could they wait for it to freeze solid as the nomads often did with the barrier of the degird stretched out ahead of him abivard wondered how peroz proposed to solve the problem though he had yet to put his knowledge to much use abivard knew how to fight he had some idea how to go about besieging a bandits lair or other stronghold past that his military knowledge stopped over the next few days it advanced several paces the baggage train the army carried with it seemed preposterously large to himuntil the engineers who had made the journey from mashiz started driving two parallel rows of piles about forty feet apart into the bed of the degird toward the northern bank the upstream piles tilted in the direction of the current the downstream ones leaned against it the engineers linked each upstreamdownstream pair with a crossbeam whose fit the force of the current only improved as time went by then the engineers ran trestles along each row of piles from the south side of the degird to the north across the trestles went planks and over the planks poles and bundles of sticks the army advanced from makuran onto the plains of pardraya less than a week after it reached the degird it did not cross the river unobserved abivard had watched the khamorth tiny as horseflies on the far shore watching the bridge march toward them when the engineers got close enough the plainsmen shot at them soldiers advanced down the growing bridge to shoot back and keep the nomads at a distance the engineers took to carrying big wicker shields arrows pierced a few men anyhow but the bridge and the army advanced regardless the hooves of abivards horse drummed over the bridge when his turn came to cross the horse didnt care for that or for the vibration of the timbers that came up through its feet from the motion of other animals and wagons on the bridge the beast laid back its ears and tried to rear abivard fought it back down so this is pardraya he said when he was back on solid ground it doesnt look much different from the land by the stronghold no qanats varaz said beside him no cropland at all come to that his younger brother was right grass and bushes yellowbrown from summer heat stretched ahead as far as the eye could see that sereness was what had reminded abivard of home but he had always thought of the pardrayan plain as being flat as a griddle that wasnt so it had rises and dips just like any other land the undulations reminded him of the waves of the sea that in turn reminded him of the prophecy tanshar had given but no one could call this sea narrow peroz king of kings left behind a goodsize garrison to protect the bridge the armys lifeline back to makuran as he watched the chosen warriors begin to set up their encampment abivard spared them a moments pity poor fellows they had come all this way only to be denied the chance to help crush the khamorth the main body of the army moved north across the plains when abivard turned around for another look at the bridge guards he found they had disappeared in the great cloud of dust kicked up by thousands of horses and hundreds of wagons the dust made his eyes water and gritted in every fold of skin he had when he spat he spat brown he looked up into the sky the sun at least was still visible the only clouds were the ones the army made all the same he said i wish it would rain godarzs hand twisted in a gesture of aversion you dont know what youre saying boy he exclaimed a good downpour and all this turns to porridge same as it does down by the stronghold with one rider its a bloody nuisance you try and get an army through it and youll be weeks on a journey that should take days simple rule dust is bad mud is worse abashed abivard said little after that till the army halted for the evening he also realized that if it rained perozs plan to fire the plain would come to naught since he couldnt make himself be happy with the weather as it was but knew a change would be worse he passed a discontented night breakfast was hard rolls dates preserved in honey lamb sausage so salty and smoky it made abivards tongue want to shrivel up and bad wine after varaz choked down his length of sausage he made a dreadful face and said to godarz youd flog the cooks if they fed us like this back at the stronghold i just might godarz said aye i just might he finished his own sausage then took a long swig of wine to wash away the taste but if we were going on a long journey id flog them if they didnt pack us food like this all of it will keep almost forever the vermin cant stomach it either abivard said he meant it for a joke and his siblings smiled but godarz nodded seriously spoiling his fun the dihqan and his sons knocked down the tent they had shared tied its wool panels and poles and their bedding aboard a packhorse then armed themselveseach helping the others with clumsy catchesand rode north one long slow farsang followed another abivards heart leapt once when he spied a couple of bowcarrying men wearing only leather and mounted on unarmored horses but they proved to be scouts riding in to report to their commanders we cant all go rattling around in mail or the khamorth would ride rings around us and wed never even know they were there godarz said abivard chewed on that and decided it made sense the business of soldiering got more complicated every time he turned around the wind what there was of it came from the west a little past noon smoke and flames sprang up from the steppe about half a farsang east of the armys line of travel that was far enough to keep embers and smoke from spooking the warriors horses which moved on unconcerned trot canter walk trot canter walk the slowly changing rhythm filled abivards body as the armament of peroz king of kings moved north over the pardrayan plain his men set more fires or rather extended the length of the first one every sudden gust gladdened abivard for it meant the flames were spreading over more of the nomads pasturage he pointed east they cant let us do that for long or theyll soon start to starve thats the idea jahiz said his handsome facehis mother was famous for her beautycreased in a leer of anticipation he reached for his upthrust lance then they have to come to us for the rest of that day though and most of the following one the advancing warriors saw no sign of the khamorth through whose territory they rode but for the fire that burned alongside them they might have been alone on the steppe late the next afternoon the scouts brought in sheep and cattle they had captured north of the main body of the king of kings force abivard cheered as loud as anyone when he saw the animals we wont have to eat that beastly sausage tonight he said so we wont so we wont godarz said but thats not all these captures tell me they say were getting very close very close i tell you to the nomads themselves their herds are their lives if we come across the beasts the men who follow them across the plains must be close by abivard looked this way and that he saw his relatives his comrades the steppe the fires the men from makuran had set of the nomads there was no sign yet they were out there somewhereprobably not far his father was bound to be right about that the idea made abivard uneasy as if someone were peeking at him through a crack in his door back at the stronghold he looked around again this time concentrating on the thousands of armored men who had come north with him from makuran their equally well protected mounts the clever engineers who had bridged the degird and all the other appurtenances of a great and civilized host against such might how could the plainsmen prevail when he said that aloud godarz let out a wry chuckle thats why we come here sonto find out abivard must have looked stricken for the dihqan continued dont take it like that for thats not how i meant it ive seen a few armies in my day aye just a few and this ones stronger than all the rest i dont know how we can lose once the khamorth decide they have to face us that eased abivards mind if his father couldnt see any way for the plainsmen to win he was willing to believe no such way existed he said the king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase strikes me as a man who will deal a hard blow when the time comes he strikes me the same way godarz said if the lion banner isnt at the fore when at last we clash with the khamorth ill be greatly surprised although i know of him only by repute ive heard his son sharbaraz is another of the same sort hed be your age more or less ive not seen his banner here abivard said nor will you godarz answered peroz may his years be long left him back in mashiz as i left frada back at the stronghold our reasons were different though i just didnt think frada quite ready not quite sharbaraz is a man grown and i expect the king of kings wants him to keep the eunuchs and nobles in line while peroz goes off on campaign surely theyd not take advantage when the king of kings was away abivard faltered very much aware of godarzs cynical eye on him he felt himself flush all right maybe they would no maybe to it son no maybe at all godarz said i just thank the god thats not something i have to worry about i may be master of only a domain not a realm but i can rely on the people around me when my back is turned in more ways than a few i have the better half of that bargain i think you do too abivard could not imagine his fathers servitors going against the dihqans wishes he had heard tales of corruption emanating from mashiz but hadnt believed them to learn they had some substance was a jolt he said it must be that theyre too close to the videssian border father aye that may have somewhat to do with it godarz allowed i suspect theyre too close to too much silver as well having the coin you need to do what you must and a bit of what you like is pleasant as wine can be but a man who gets a rage for silver is as bad as one with a rage for wine maybe worse aye maybe worse abivard chewed on that he decided his father probably had a point and admitted as much by nodding before he asked when do you think the plainsmen will stand at bay godarz scratched at his scar while he thought it over they wont wait more than another couple of days he said at last they cant else well have burned too much of the plain their herds need broad fields on which to graze that phrase again abivard had heard it twice now since tanshar gave him his strange prophecy what it meant though he still could not say he wondered when he would find out when two days had passed abivard was ready to reckon his father a better fortuneteller than tanshar the first khamorth fighters appeared in front of the makuraner host the morning after the two of them had spoken they shot a few arrows that did nothing in particular then galloped away faster than their armored foes could pursue such archers as the makuraners had rode out in front of the main force to protect it from the plainsmens hitandrun raids the rest of the warriors shook themselves out into real battle lines rather than the loose order in which they had been traveling before under his veil of iron abivards teeth skinned back in a fierce grin of excitementat any moment he might find himself in action he glanced over at varaz he couldnt see much of his brothers face but varazs flashing eyes said he too was eager to get in there and fight godarz on the other hand just kept riding along at an easy canter for all the ferocity and passion he displayed the nearest khamorth might have been a thousand farsangs away abivard decided his father was an old man after all a couple of hours later more plainsmen appeared off the left flank of the army and plied it with arrows makuraner horsemen thundered out against them raising even more dust than the host normally kicked up they drove the nomads away then returned to their comrades once more the whole army raised a cheer for them by the god i wish the left were our station abivard exclaimed they have the first glory of the campaign where godarz asked in chasing after the khamorth i didnt see them kill any before long the nomads will come back and prick at us some more thats how warfare works out here on the steppe before long godarzs foretelling was again fulfilled not only did the khamorth return to shadow the armys flanks they began showing themselves in greater numbers both on the left and at the front a couple of men were fetched back to the healers wagons one limp the other writhing and shrieking abivard shivered the last time i heard a noise like that was when the old cookwhat was his name father spilled the great kettle of soup and scalded himself to death i was still small denak told me she had nightmares about that for years his name was pishinah and youre right he cried most piteously godarz lifted his helm off his head to wipe away sweat with a kerchief he looked worried more nomads dogging us than id have guessed but thats what we want isnt it to make them fight abivard said puzzled oh aye his father laughed sheepishly i get suspicious when the plainsmen give us what we want even if we are forcing it from them you predicted this though just the other day abivard protested why are you unhappy now that what you foretold has come true its not coming true the way i thought it would godarz answered i expected wed force the khamorth to battle that theyd be desperate and afraid their archers out there dont have the manner of desperate men theyre moving to a plan of their own he shrugged his chain mail rattled about him or of course maybe im just seeing evil spirits behind every bush and under every flat stone jahiz said couldnt the scriers scent out what the nomads intend godarz spat on the ground that for what the scriers can do if youve lost a ring back at the stronghold lad a scrier will help you find it but when it has to do with fighting no for one thing mens passions make magic unreliablethats why love philtres work so seldom by the byeand war is a hotblooded business for another the plainsmens shamans are using magic of their own to try to blind us and for a third we have to be busy to make sure the demon worshipers dont spy out what were about war is for iron son iron not magic a good thing too abivard said if war were a matter for sorcerers no one else would have the chance to join in it is that a good thing godarz said i wonder i do wonder why did you join the king of kings host then abivard asked him for dutys sake and because peroz king of kingsmay his years be many and his realm increaseso bade me godarz answered would you have me cast aside my honor and that of our clan by the god no abivard exclaimed though he let it drop there he wished his father sounded more as if his heart were in the campaign peroz had undertaken at the head of the king of kings force horns screamed the call abivard had awaited since the crossing of the degird the foes army in sight the makuraners had been advancing in battle array since the plainsmen began to harass them but a hum of excitement ran through them all the same soon now they would have the chance to punish the khamorth for the pinpricks they had dared inflict on the king of kings men abivard rode to the top of a low swell of ground sure enough there were the nomads perhaps half a farsang to the north they had mustered in two groups a relatively small one in front and a larger one some little distance farther away i think i see their scheme godarz said theyll try to keep us in play with their advance party while the rest of them spread out and flank us wont workwell smash the little band before the big one can deploy he sounded more cheerful than he had before shouldnt we be at them father abivard demanded finally seeing the khamorth there waiting to be assailed made him want to set spurs to his horse and charge on the instant but godarz shook his head too far as yet wed meet them with our animals blown from going so far at the gallop well close to not far out of bowshot and pound home from there as if to echo godarz chishpish who rode not far away bellowed to the horsemen under his command anyone who goes after the plainsmen before the horns signal shall answer to me personally varaz chuckled thats no great threat hed never catch up with anyone who disobeyed and indeed chishpishs horse was as heavyset as the marzban himself as it had to be to bear his weight but chishpishs threat as every warrior who heard it knew full well had nothing to do with physical chastisement with the influence the high noble wielded he could drop a mans reputation and hope for the future straight into the void abivard took his lance from its rest and hefted it in his hand all through the ranks of the makuraners those irontipped lengths of wood were quivering as if a great wind swept through a forest abivard kept the lance upright to avoid fouling his comrades he would couch it only at the command closer and closer the king of kings host drew to the foe perozs banner fluttered ahead of abivard by makuraner custom he commanded from the right wing the harsh war cries of the khamorth floated faintly to abivards ears he heard them without understanding though the steppe tongue was cousin to his own the plainsmens shouts were so commingled that no separate words emerged from the din a horn cried high and thin as if with one voice thousands of makuraners hurled a battle cry back at the khamorth peroz abivard yelled his throat raw the better to terrify the enemy when the makuraners closed nearly to within the range godarz had specified the small lead group of plainsmen spurred forward to meet them screeching like wild things and shooting arrows into the massed armored ranks a couple of lucky shots emptied saddles a few more wrung cries of pain from men and horses most as is the way of such things either missed or were turned by the makuraners mail and plate and shields just when abivard wondered if the khamorth would be mad enough to rush to close quarters with perozs vastly superior army the nomads wheeled their little steppe ponies in a pretty piece of horsemanship and almost in single file galloped back toward their more distant comrades cowards abivard screamed along with half the makuraner host whitelivered wretches come back and fight beside him godarz said what are they doing no one answered for at that moment the horns rang out again a call for which the whole host had waited the charge lowerlances chishpish roared the iron points glittered in the sun as they swung down to the horizontal even louder than before chishpish cried forward already the banner of the king of kings stood straight out from its staff as peroz and his guards thundered toward the khamorth abivard booted his own horse in the sides with ironshod heels because the gelding was armored itself it needed such strong signals to grasp what he required of it the ground flew by beneath him slowly at first and then faster fast enough for the wind of his passage to whip water from his eyes fast enough for it to seem as if one more stride one more bound would propel him into the air in flight the rumble of thousands tens of thousands of hooves was like being caught in the middle of a thunderstorm and thousands tens of thousands of men charged with abivard he knew the great exaltation of being one small part of an enterprise vast and glorious the god might have set a hand on his shoulder then his horse stepped into a hole maybe a rabbit had made it maybe a badger that didnt matter what came of it did abivard felt the gelding stumble at the same instant he heardamazingly distinct through the din around himthe bone break even as the horse screamed and fell he kicked his feet out of the stirrups and threw himself clear he hit the ground with a crash and thud that made him glad for his mail even with it he knew he would be a mass of bruises his comrades thundered by one horse sprang clean over him as he lay on the ground how no one trampled him he never knew he didnt care either tears of mingled pain and frustration rolled down his cheeks here was what should have been the great moment of his life ruined unhorsed how could he close with the enemy and show his mettle the answer was simple he couldnt his father and siblings would have the triumph all to themselves and what about him he would be the butt of jokes foreverabivard late for the fight the last makuraners rode by crying the name of the king of kings abivards horse cried too in anguish he forced himself to his feet staggered over to the thrashing animal and cut its throat that done he turned and started walking northmaybe just maybe the battle wouldnt be over when he got to it perhaps he could take the mount of someone who had fallen or even ride a khamorth steppe pony for a while though it would not be pleased at supporting the weight of him and his armor through swirling dust he watched the proud banners that marked the front ranks of the makuraner host for a moment he refused to believe his eyes when almost all of them went down at once the screams and shrieks of injured men and horses rose to the deaf unfeeling sky the men and horses themselves tumbled into the trench the khamorth had dug across the plain and then cunningly concealed with sticks and dirt and grass only at the very center where the nomads advance party had withdrawn to their main force could the makuraners follow and then in small numbers their foes set on them savagely wolves tearing at a bear abivards shout of horror was drowned in the cries that went up from the overthrown makuraner host the king of kings banner was down he could not see it anywhere he moaned deep in his throat nor were the frontmost ranks the only ones to fall in ruin the warriors behind could not check their mounts in time and crashed into the ditch on top of its first victims father abivard cried godarz was up there somewhere in the middle of that catastrophe so were abivards brother and half brothers clumsily heavily he began to run in armor designed for fighting from horseback even the makuraners not caught by the plainsmens ditch had to halt as best they could any semblance of order lost the khamorth chose that moment to storm round both ends of the trench and begin to surround their foes not a broad field abivard groaned a trap too late the meaning of tanshars first vision came clear a trap it was the makuraners the momentum of their charge killed their ranks thrown into confusion were easy meat for the nomads at short range hornreinforced bows could punch their shafts through mail two plainsmen could set on a single armored warrior assail him from so many directions at once that sooner or latermost often soonerhe had to fall abivard found himself outside the killing zone one of a handful of makuraners who were at first his only thought was to keep on clumping ahead and die with his family and countrymen then he saw that riderless horses mostly makuraner stock but the occasional steppe pony as well were getting out through the nomads cordon theyll round them up later he thought for now they reckon the men more important had he been a nomad chieftain he would have made the same choice seeing the horses made him start to think again not run blindly toward his doom like a moth flying into a torch flame he could all but hear godarz inside his head dont be foolish boy dont be foolish save what you can a mounted demigod would have had a battle on his hands smashing through the plainsmen to rescue the trapped warriors of makuran the chance of one horseless young man in his first fight managing it wasnt worth thinking about abivard tried again to guessno to work out godarz didnt approve of guessingwhat the khamorth chiefs would do once their riders had finished slaughtering the makuraners the answer came back quick and clear they would plunder the baggage train not till then would they start scouring the steppe for survivors which means id best get out of here while i can he said aloud a riderless horse a steppe pony had paused to graze less than a furlong from where he stood he walked slowly toward it it looked up wary as he approached but then lowered its head and went back to cropping dry yellow grass in a pouch on his belt he had some dried apricots treats he had intended to give his gelding after the battle was won now the battle was lost and the gelding too he dug out three or four apricots put them in the palm of his hand and walked up to the steppe pony here you are boy he said coaxingly the pony was entire with stones big for the size of the rest of it it made a snuffling noise half suspicion half interest abivard held out his hand the horse sniffed the apricots delicately tasted one it snuffled again this time sounding pleased and ate the rest of the fruit after that it let abivard come around alongside it and did no more than lay back its ears when he mounted it at his urging it trotted off toward the south he found the ride uncomfortable like a lot of nomads the khamorth who had owned it kept his stirrup leathers very short so he could rise in the saddle to use his bow bowless abivard perforce rode with his legs bent up evidently he wasnt the first or only makuraner to escape the disaster to the north when he came up to it the baggage train was boiling like a stomped anthill he kept on riding he had intended to give the alarm he couldnt have faced himself had he simply fled but he did not aim to be caught in the new catastrophe sure to come soon he could feel by the steppe ponys gait that carrying his armored self was more than it could easily handle he knew he would have to shed the iron as soon as he could if the pony foundered before he got back to the degird he was a dead man perhaps half an hour later he looked over his shoulder a new column of smoke was rising into the sky the men of makuran hadnt set this one the khamorth were having their revenge the one good thing abivard saw there was that it meant the plainsmen would be too occupied with their looting to comb the plain for fugitives for a while he wasnt the only makuraner to have escaped from the overthrow of the king of kings host scattered over the steppe in front behind and off to the sides were riders traveling singly or in small groups some would be men fleeing from the baggage train others warriors like abivard who met with mischance before the trap closed on them others perhaps men who had broken out of the ring of death the nomads had cast around the makuraners abivard thought hard about joining one of those small groups of retreating men from makuran in the end he decided to keep clear and go his own way for one thing even all the fugitives he saw banded together lacked the numbers to stand up to the swarm of khamorth who would soon be following for another bands traveling together were limited to the speed of their slowest member he wanted to get as far away from the disastrous field that was not a field as he could shock still dazed him he had lost his father and four siblings makuran had lost peroz king of kings and the flower of its manhood the twin misfortunes echoed and reechoed inside his head now one louder now the other what shall i do he moaned what will the kingdom do since he had no idea what the kingdom would do he ended up concentrating on the first question the first thing he had to do was get back over the bridge the king of kings engineers had thrown across the degird if he couldnt do that he would be too dead to worry about anything thereafter if he did get back to the stronghold he would be dihqan he had known that would happen one day but had thought one day lay years ahead now it was on top of him a weight heavier on his shoulders than that of his armor on the steppe pony he rode speaking of which he muttered and reined in he swung down off the horse gave it a chance to graze and blow a little he couldnt think just of the mad dash for escape not when he was several days ride north of the degird he had to keep the pony sound for the whole journey even though every heartbeat he waited made him fidget as if taken by the flux he stopped again when he came to a small stream he let the steppe pony drink but not too much it snapped at him when he pulled it away from the water stupid thing he said and cuffed it on the muzzle horses would drink themselves sick or dead if you let them they would eat too much too but that wasnt going to be a problem not now how best to escape pursuit at length abivard rode southwest still toward the degird but not as directlyand out of the line of march by which the host of peroz king of kings had approached disaster sure as sure the khamorth would ride down that line sweeping away the warriors who had not the wit to avoid it by the time evening neared abivard no longer saw any of his fellow fugitives that he took for a good omen the nomads would not be likely now to spot him while chasing someone else when he came to another stream he decided to stop for the night and let the steppe pony rest till morning he dismounted rubbed down the animal with a clump of dry grass for lack of anything better then tied its reins to the biggest bushalmost a saplinghe could find after that time came to shed his armor he undid the catches at the side of his coat of mail and splints and got out of it after unhooking the mail skirt that depended from it he took off his ironfaced boots then peeled down his ironandleather breeches the cuirass the mail shirt and the armored trousers he flung into the stream no point in leaving them on dry land for some plainsman to take back to his tent as spoils he stripped off the veil and hood from his helmet and threw them away too the helmet he kept and the boots they were heavy but he feared he would hurt his feet if he did without them you can stand that much weight cant you boy he said to the steppe pony its ears twitched to show it had heard but of course it could not understand wanting to keep the animal happy with him he fed it another apricot from his dwindling supply he ate one himself he had had nothing but water since early that morning had a lizard skittered by he would cheerfully have sliced it in two with his sword and eaten both pieces raw but no lizard came then he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand and cursed his own foolishness the steppe ponys saddle had saddlebags hanging from it in them might be anything he felt like shouting when he found strips of dried mutton they were just about as hard as his own teeth and not much tastier but they would keep him from starving for a while all he had on were thin linen drawers he wished for his surcoat then laughed might as well wish for the army back while im at it he said with all that passion that was in him he did wish for the army back but he was too much godarzs son not to know what such wishes were worth he passed a chilly miserable night curled up on the ground like an animal sword at his side so he could grab it in a hurry he lost track of how many times he woke up to some tiny noise or a shift in the breeze or for no reason at all renewed sleep came harder and harder at last between dawn and sunrise it stayed away for good he gnawed more dried mutton and began to ride that day after the battle he caught himself weeping again and again sometimes he mourned for his family sometimes for his overthrown monarch and for makuran at large sometimes for himself he felt guilty for living on when all he held dearest had perished thats nonsense son you have to go on to set things right as best you can so vividly did he seem to hear his fathers voice that his head whipped around in sudden wild hope that the dihqan had somehow survived but the steppe was empty as far as the eye could see save for a crow that cawed harshly as it hopped into the air stupid bird what are you doing here abivard pointed over his shoulder the rich pickings are back that way every so often he saw rabbits lolloping across the plain just looking at them made him hungry but hunting rabbits with a sword was like trying to knock flies out of the air with a switch and he had no time to set a snare and linger once he spied a fox on a rabbits heels he wished the beast more luck than he had had himself though he ate sparingly he ran out of dried meat halfway through the third day after that his belly gnawed at him along with worry he caught a couple of frogs by the side of a stream gutted them with his dagger and ate them raw his only regret after he finished them was that he had thrown the offal into the water he looked for more frogs or maybe a turtle or an incautious minnow the next time he stopped to water the steppe pony but caught nothing toward evening on the fourth day after the battle he reached the degird he wanted to strip off his drawers dive in and swim across but knew that weak and worn as he was he would probably drown before he reached the southern bank nor could he let the horse swim the stream and tow him with it for it was in no finer fettle than he have to be the bridge then he said he had talked to himself a lot lately for lack of any other company and if the bridge was down or the khamorth already across it he tried not to think about such things before night descended he rode about half a farsang away from the river khamorth searching for fugitives still at large in their country were most likely to ride along the northern bank of the degird he reasoned no point in making things easy for them if they were already searching along the riverbank the bridge was sure to be down too or in their hands but he made himself not think about that either hunger woke him before the sun rose he mounted the steppe pony marveling at its stamina a makuraner horse could carry more weight yes and gallop faster for a little ways but probably would have broken down on the long grueling ride south he had done his best to keep the pony rested but knew his best hadnt been good enough he rode into the morning sun keeping the degird in sight but not actually riding up to it unless he needed to water his horse or himself he didnt know how far east he would have to ride to come on the bridge only one way to learn he said and booted the pony up into a trot the sun climbed higher burned off the earlymorning chill and grew hot abivard started to sweat but he wasnt as uncomfortable as he might have been a couple of weeks earlier he had fared north in like weather armored from head to toe he still had helm and ironcovered boots but the drawers in between were far easier on his hide than mail and padding was that the bridge up ahead he thought he had seen it a couple of times already only to find himself deceived by mudbanks in the river but no not this timethat was the bridge with riders in unmistakable makuraner armor still in place on the pardrayan plain a gateway to a murdered dream of conquest but even if the dream was dead the bridge might keep makuraner warriorsor at least one abivard told himselfalive he wrung the best pace he could from the tired steppe pony and waved like a man possessed to the garrison still loyally holding open the way back to freedom a couple of the makuraners broke away from their main body and came toward him at the trot their lances couched and pointing at a spot about a hands span above his navel with a shock of fear he realized they were ready to skewer him he was after all riding a khamorth horse by the god no he screamed hoarsely getting slaughtered by his own countrymen after escaping the nomads seemed a fate too bitterly ironic to bear the lances wavered when the riders heard him cry out in their own language who are you then one of them called his face invisible and so all the more menacing behind his veil of mail abivard son of godarz dihqan of vek rud domain abivard answered doing his best to sound like the real makuraner he was rather than a plainsman trying to get across the degird in disguise the two warriors looked at each other the one who had spoken before asked dyou mean hes the dihqan or are you he is abivard said automatically and then had to correct himself he was hes dead along with my brother and three half brothers that leaves me so it does and on a steppe pony too the lancer said suspicious still howd you stay alive through the fight if all your family perished what sort of coward are you lurked under the words my horse stepped in a hole and broke a leg as the charge was beginning abivard answered so i didnt go into the trench and i didnt get trapped when the cursed nomads sallied forth i managed to get hold of this horse when it came out of the press and ive ridden it ever since the makuraners looked at each other again the one who had been quiet till now said it could happen aye it could the other agreed he turned back to abivard pass on then makuran will need every man it can lay hands on and wed about given up on having any more get herewe were going to burn the bridge to make sure the nomads couldnt use it to swarm over the river im surprised you havent seen them yet abivard said why the talkier lancer asked when they wrecked the army they ate the whole leg of mutton and it filled em too full to bother with pan scraps like you the homely comparison made sense to abivard he nodded and rode on toward the bridge the other warrior called after him make your horse take it slow and easy as you cross weve already doused it with rock oil so itll be slick as a melon rind well torch it once weve all crossed abivard nodded and waved to show hed heard the steppe ponys nostrils flared when it caught the stink of the rock oil it snorted and shook its head abivard urged it on regardless it stepped carefully through the black smelly stuff poured onto the northern part of the bridge in some parts of makuran they used rock oil in their lamps instead of butter or tallow abivard wondered how they put up with the smell about half a furlong in the center of the bridge was bare of the disgusting coating the southern end though the part that touched the blessed soil of makuran also had rock oil poured over it abivard halted his mount a few steps into makuran he turned around to watch the last of the garrison that had held the bridge come back over it one final horseman remained on the planks he carried a flickering torch after pausing for a moment at the northern edge of the stretch that had no rock oil the warrior tossed the torch into the stuff yellowred flames and thick black smoke rose from a rapidly spreading fire the makuraner wheeled his horse and hurried across the bare patch and then through the oil that coated the southern end of the bridge that was cleverly done abivard said the parts with the rock oil will burn quickly once flame reaches them and the stretch in the middle without any made sure the fire wouldnt spread too fast and catch you still on the bridge just so the fellow who had thrown the torch answered have you worked with rock oil then to see this so quickly abivard shook his head no never yet though i thank you for the courteous words then his belly overrode everything else sir might a hungry man beg of you a bit of bread we havent much ourself for weve been feeding hungry men for a couple of days now and our supply wagons left yesterday afternoon but still he opened a saddle bag drew out a chunk of flatbread wrapped around cracked bulgur wheat and handed it to abivard the food was stale but abivard didnt care only the memory of his father kept him from gulping it down like a starving wolf he made himself eat slowly deliberately as a dihqan should then bowed in the saddle to his benefactor i am in your debt generous sir if ever you have need come to the domain of the vek rud and it shall be met the god keep you and your domain safe the warrior answered the wind shifted and blew acrid stinking smoke into his face and abivards he coughed and rubbed his eyes with his knuckles then glancing back toward the burning bridge and the degird river he added the god keep all makuran safe for if the nomads come in force i dont know if we have the men left to save ourselves abivard wanted to argue with him but could not the bridge across the vek rud remained intact when abivard rode over it he had food in his belly and a caftan over his dirty ragged drawers thanks to the kindness of folk he had met on the road there ahead crowning the hillock on which it stood was the stronghold in which he had grown to manhood his stronghold now the steppe pony snorted nervously as it picked its way through the villages winding streets it wasnt used to buildings crowding so close on either side but it kept going abivard by now figured it might keep going forever he had never known a horse with such stamina a few people in the village recognized him and called his name others asked after his father in a way that said word of the full magnitude of the disaster on the steppe hadnt yet got here he pretended not to hear those questions people other than the villagers needed to hear their answers first the gates to the stronghold were closed someone knewor fearedsomething then the sentry on the wall above let out a glad cry when he saw abivard the gates swung open he rode in frada stood waiting for him panting a littlehe must have come to the gateway at a dead run also panting was a black and tan dog at the heel of abivards younger brother fradas hands were greasy maybe he had been feeding the dog scraps when the sentrys cry rang out what became of your armor he asked abivard for that matter what became of your horse is the campaign ended so soon where are father and our sibs will they come soon all we have here is fourthhand tales and i know how father says they always grow in the telling not this time abivard answered all youve heard is true i daresay and worse besides peroz king of kings is dead slain and most of the army with him he had meant to plow straight ahead but he couldnt a low moan went up from the gathering crowd at that first grim sentence frada took a step backward as if he had been slapped in the face he was young enough to find disaster unimaginable whether he had imagined it or not though it was here he did his best to rally at least enough to ask the next question that had to be asked and father and varaz and jahiz abivard cut him off before he named them all they charged bravely with the host the god grant they took some plainsmen into the void before they died had i charged with them i would have perished too he told again what had happened to his horse and how the accident kept him from falling into the khamorth trap with the rest of the makuraner army he had told the story several times now often enough to make it feel almost as if he were talking about something that had happened to someone else then you are dihqan of this domain frada said slowly he bowed low to abivard he had never done that before save to godarz the salute reminded abivard of how much had changed in bare days time aye i am the dihqan he said weariness tugging at him like an insistent child whatever is piled up on the platter while ive been away will have to wait another day or two before im ready to look at it though whats the name of the new king of kings someone called from the middle of the crowd sharbaraz abivard answered peroz king of kings left him behind in mashiz to look after affairs while he himself fared forth against the plainsmen father said he was reckoned a likely young man the god bless sharbaraz king of kings that phrase rose to the sky too raggedly to be a chorus but in the space of a few seconds everyone in the courtyard repeated it frada said youll have to tell mother and the rest of godarzs wives i know abivard said heavily he had thought about that more than once on the long ride south telling burzoe and the other women would be only the barest beginning of his complications there along with the domain the dihqans wives passed under his control they were his wives now save only burzoe who had borne him his thoughts had not been of sensual delights for one thing he had been afraid and half starved a state anything but conducive to lickerish imaginings for another he had serious doubts about how well he would manage the womens quarters godarz had done pretty well but godarz had been older and added his women one at a time instead of inheriting them all at once he would worry about such things later for now he stuck to small practical details the first thing ill need to do is find a way into the quarters father certainly took the key and he stopped in confusion no im a ninny there must be a way in through the kitchens not so so much for practicality aye there is one of the cooks said a serving girl can show you we dont speak of it much though makuraner formality dictated that noble women be separated from the world common sense dictated that the world needed to get to them common sense prevailed but formality tried to pretend it didnt abivard scanned the crowd for one of the women who served his mother and godarzs other wivesno godarzs other widows he pointed to the first one he spied yasna do you know this way yes lord yasna answered abivard shook his head like a man bedeviled by gnats the title was his fathers or rather had been now he would have to get used to wearing it he followed her into the living quarters through the kitchens and into the larder he had seen the plain door there a hundred times and always assumed it led into another storage chamber it didnt it opened onto a long narrow dark hall at the far end was another door without a latch on this side but with a grillwork opening so those on the other side could see who came yasna rapped on the door she stood close by the grille with abivard behind her after a moment she rapped again a womans head obscured the light that came through the opening ah yasna the woman said who is with you i bring the dihqan lady ardini yasna answered ardini was one of godarzs most junior wives younger than abivard she let out a squeak then cried the dihqan returns oh the god be praised for bringing him home safe she unbarred the door and opened it wide as the door swung open abivard wondered if a man ever came this way and sneaked into the womens quarters some nobles kept eunuchs in the quarters to guard against such mishaps godarz had never bothered saying if you cant trust a woman a guard will only make her sneaky not honest at ardinis cry women came running up the hall they were crying out too but when they recognized abivard they gave back in confusion one of his half sisters said to ardini you said the dihqan was here not his son thats what yasna told me ardini answered sulkily is it a crime that i believed her she told the truth abivard said though by the god i wish shed lied i am dihqan of this domain some of the women stared at him not understanding what he meant others quicker gasped and then began to shriek the wails spread quickly as the rest realized their loss abivard wished he could cover his ears but would not insult their grief so even as they cried out some of them eyed him with frank speculation he could guess what was in their minds if i can but intoxicate him with my body he may make me principal wife that meant riches influence and the chance to bear a son who would one day command the stronghold and rule vek rud domain he knew he would have to think of such things but not now godarz had often gone to burzoe for advice that from the wily dihqan was recommendation enough for abivard he saw burzoe at the back of the group of women denak beside her and said i would have speech with my mother and sister first of all if godarz had trusted his principal wifes wits abivard respected those of his own sister burzoe said wait before you speak with us two everyone who dwells in the womens quarters needs to hear what passed of our husband and sons who went off to war and whowho returned not her voice almost broke at the end not only had she lost godarz but varaz as well abivard realized she was right as quickly as he could he went over the doomed campaign yet another time taking it a further step from memory into tale spako and mirud mothers to jahiz and uzav burst into fresh lamentation arshaks mother a woman named sarduri was dead and so i and a few others had the good fortune to escape the ambush though i thought my fortune anything but good at the time abivard finished but the flower of the army fell and times will be hard henceforward thank you son or should i say rather thank you lord burzoe said when he was done she bowed deeply to him as frada had out in the heat of the courtyard holding her voice steady by what had to be force of will alone she went on and now if it is your pleasure to take counsel with denak and me follow and i shall lead you to a suitable chamber godarzs widows and those of his daughters who had come into womanhood stepped back to make room for abivard as he strode through their ranks some of the old dihqans wives contrived not to step back quite far enough so that he brushed against them walking by he noted that without being stirred by it grief and weariness smothered desire in him he looked curiously this way and that as burzoe and denak took him to the room they had in mind he had not been in the womens quarters since he was little more than a babe they struck him as lighter and airier than most of the living area in the stronghold with splendid carpets underfoot and tapestries covering the bare stone of the walls all products of the patient labor of generations of women who had made their homes here since the stronghold rose in the unremembered past itspleasant here he said you neednt sound so surprised burzoe answered with quiet pride we are not mewed up here because we are guilty of some crime but for our honors sake should we live as if this were a prison sometimes it has the feel of one denak said only if you let it burzoe said abivard got the feeling this was a running argument between mother and daughter burzoe went on no matter where your body stays your mind can roam the whole domainwider if you let it if you are a principal wife if your husband deigns to listen to you if you have learnedhave been allowed to learnyour letters then yes perhaps denak said otherwise you sit and gossip and ply your needle and work the loom one thing you do not do if you are wise is air petty troubles before the dihqan burzoe said pointedly she paused waving abivard into a sitting room spread with carpets and strewn with embroidered cushions here we may speak without fear of disturbance no one in makuran can do anything without fear of disturbance not today not for months maybe not for years abivard said nevertheless he went in and folded himself into the tailors seat on a carpet in the style of the steppes it showed a great cat springing onto the back of a fleeing stag burzoe and denak also made themselves comfortable reclining against big pillows after a moment the serving girl yasna came in with a tray of wine and pistachios which she set on a low table in front of abivard he poured for his mother and sister offered them the bowl of nuts we should serve you burzoe said you are the dihqan if i am then let me use my power by doing as i please here abivard said in spite of the dreadful news he had brought that made burzoe smile for a moment she said you are very like your father do you know that he could always talk his way around anything he pleased not anything not at the end abivard said remembering horses crashing down into the trench the khamorth had dug and others tumbling over one another as their riders tried desperately to bring them to a halt no not anything the smile had already left burzoes face for the kingdomis it as bad as that truly truly mother abivard said only the river stands between us and the plainsmen we have lost so many that if they do cross we will be hardpressed to throw them back to their proper side once more i have to remind myself to think in wider terms than this domain alone burzoe said with a shaky laugh we have lost so many i find it hard to take in that the realm at large has suffered equally believe it abivard said it is true so his mother stretched the word into a long hiss her eyes were bright with tears but they remained unshed for the sake of the domain then i can tell you two things that must be done abivard leaned forward this was what he had hoped to hear they are first burzoe said you must send to papaks domain and ask that your wedding with roshnani be celebrated as soon as is possible what why advice on making a marriage he had not expected two reasons his mother said do you know if papak or any of those who fared forth with him survived the battle on the steppe i dont know i would doubt it few came forth alive but i know nothing for a fact if the dihqan and all his likeliest heirs fell fighting those who find themselves in charge of the domain will be weak and will be looking round for any props they can find to bolster their hold on it a strong brotherinlaw is not the least of assets and you will also have a claim on them if vek rud domain needs aid against the nomads do you see mother i do abivard inclined his head to burzoe he could admire such subtlety but knew he was not yet capable of it himself he said thats one reason whats your other one that will benefit you more than the domain when you bring roshnani here you can establish her as your principal wife with far less jealousy and hatred than if you were to choose one of godarzs widows the women here will understand why for the sake of the domain you have chosen someone not of their number were you to pick one of them though all but that one will think you have made a dreadful blunder and torment you and the lucky one without cease believe me you do not want that no dihqan can hope to accomplish anything with the womens quarters in turmoil if roshnani seems able to bear the burden i shall do as you say abivard answered she will bear the burden because she must burzoe said abivard let that go his mother he suspected assumed all other women had her own strength of will he said youve given me one thing i must do then whats the other what you would expect burzoe said abivard didnt know what he should expect but did his best not to let his face show that maybe it did and maybe it didnt he couldnt tell burzoe went on it involves denak of course ah now abivard couldnt disguise that he was lost burzoe sniffed in exasperation denak grinned she knew what her mother was talking about youre not the only one in the family who was betrothed you know no i didnt know abivard said though on reflection he should have a dihqans eldest daughter by his principal wife was a valuable piece in the game of shifting power the nobles of makuran played among themselves he plucked at his beard to whom now that he was dihqan he would have to keep track of such things for all of godarzs daughters to pradtak eldest son of urashtu denak answered ah abivard said father made a fine match for you then urashtus domain lay southeast of the one abivard unexpectedly found himself holding not only did it have good grazing land and hot springs that drew the wealthy infirm from all over makuran its stronghold perched on nalgis crag an eminence so imposing that it made vek ruds castle seem to lie on flatlands by comparison burzoe said as much as your match with roshnani we should pursue denaks with pradtak if he survived the battle on the steppe he will be eager to bring it to accomplishment for the same reasons we are the god grant it be so but if not we can begin discussion with whoever now holds that domain abivard looked over at denak marriages were always chancy family considerations counted for far more than passion but at least in pradtak denak had the hope of a husband about her own age if he had died in the khamorth trap she might find herself pledged to some wizened uncle who now held nalgis crag domain only because he had been too old to go out and fight that seemed a dreadful fate to inflict on his sister denak smiled back at him but in a way that said she too was worried about such things she said no less than you i will do whats best for the domain of course you will child burzoe said with her there was no room for doubt now we need solid allies and marriage is the best way to come by them it will be well enough have i not prospered here though i never set eyes on godarz till the day my hands were set in his prospered abivard noted his mother had said nothing about being happy if the idea entered her mind at all it was less important to her than the other she went on in similar vein this domain shall prosper too you have your fathers wits abivard i know the god will help you use them as he did for she loves the folk of makuran more than those of any other land as you say mother abivard answered not a word had burzoe said of her outlining the course he was to follow she had been the ideal dihqans wife always ready with ideas but content to let her husband the public part of the pairing take credit for them now she was doing the same for abivard maybe she thought to rule the domain as well as advise with someone other than godarz her husband she might already have been doing that for years abivard was uncomfortably aware that for the moment she had more and better ideas than he did if vek rud domain was to be his in fact as well as name he would have to acquire wisdom and experience in a hurry a corner of his mouth quirked upward given the straits in which makuran found itself he would have plenty of chances a rider approaches a sentry bawled from the wall of the stronghold down in the courtyard everyone stopped what he was doing and looked up to see whence that cry had come the southfacing wall abivard thought the tension that knotted his stomach at every warning shout eased a little khamorth raiders would not come out of the south the sentry said he bears a red banner a messenger from the king of kings abivard said to no one in particular he walked over to the gate making a royal messenger wait would have been as great an insult as delaying the king of kings himself as he walked abivard called for wine and fruit and meats to show the horseman that everything in the domain was for his sovereign to command the lookout had spotted the rider well away from the stronghold so the servitors had time to take their position behind abivard with refreshments ready to hand when the fellow came through the gateway he swung off his horse with a sigh of relief swigged wine and ran a wet towel over his face and head to cool down and wash away some of the dust of travel ahh he said a slow sigh of pleasure you are gracious to a man long in the saddle in the name of the god i thank you the god enjoins us to meet the strangers needs abivard replied were not the four wanderers themselves seeking righteousness and truth among men you speak well obviously you are as full of sound doctrine as you are of courtesy to your guests the messenger said bowing to abivard he pulled a sheet of parchment from the pouch on his belt and glanced at it you would begodarz dihqan of vek rud domain he spoke as if he doubted his own correctness he had reason to doubt after the catastrophe in pardraya gently abivard answered no i am abivard son of godarz now dihqan of this domain the meaning of that was unmistakable the god grant your father peace and his companionship the royal messenger replied if i may be permitted an opinion his domain finds itself in good hands it was abivards turn to bow thank you for your kindness not at all the messenger took another sip of wine because of the sudden changes we have undergone i and others like me fare forth from one domain to the next seeking oaths of allegiance to the new king of kings the god bless him and keep him from nobles old and new alike i would gladly swear allegiance to sharbaraz son of peroz king of kings of makuran abivard said my father always spoke highly of him and i am sure the kingdom will soon recover its glory under his rule flattery was always more effective with truth stirred into the mix or so godarz had taught abivard waited for the royal messenger to give forth with more flowery phrases about his kindness or magnanimity or something else the fellow was equally unqualified to judge instead though the messenger coughed delicately as if to show he was willing to pretend he hadnt heard what abivard said after a moment he murmured well vek rud domain does lie hard by the frontier i suppose i should not be surprised i am first to bring here news of the accession of smerdis king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase abivard felt that instead of standing on solid ground he found himself above the void into which the god would cast all those who transgressed against his teaching he said truly sir i had not heard of smerdis king of kings perhaps you would be good enough to tell me more of him i trust he is of the true royal line he is indeed the messenger replied he is sisters son to the late perozs grandfather of the same name after a bit of thinking abivard realized that made smerdis perozs second cousin and sharbarazs third a member of the royal family yes but of the royal line that however was not the issue abivard knew what the issue was sir before i speak further on this i would have you tell me how it passed that sharbaraz failed to succeed peroz king of kings naturally i respect your caution in this matter the messenger said the truth however is not difficult to set forth sharbaraz feeling himself inadequate to hold the throne because of his youth ignorance and inexperience stepped aside in favor of a man to whom years have given the wisdom makuran needs in this time of trouble that sounded well enough but if any greataunts son had presumed to tell abivard how to run his domain he would have sent the fellow packing or maybe thrown him off the stronghold wall depending on how importunate he got and abivard remembered the praise his father had given to sharbaraz if perozs son was anywhere near the man godarz reckoned him to be he would not tamely yield the throne to anyone let alone some blueblood who had managed to remain invisible his whole life till now and yet smerdis by this messengers account ruled in mashiz and reckoned himself entitled to the lion banner of makuraner royalty abivard carefully studied the messengers regalia as far as he could tell the man was genuine he also knew he did not know and had no way of learning the reasons for everything that happened in mashiz his answer then had to be submissive if cautiously so sir do you swear by the god that what you have told me of the accession of smerdis king of kings is true by the god i swear it the messenger answered his voice deep and solemn his face open and sincerebut if he lied he would had smerdis a barleycorn of sense have been chosen to lie well well then so long as your oath shall be shown to be true i pledge myself the loyal subject of smerdis king of kings and pray the god to grant him the wisdom he will need to rescue makuran from the troubles ahead abivard said as you remarked sir we are close to the frontier here we hear news from mashiz but slowly but from over the degird we hear only too clear with so many of our warriors fallen the borderlands are going to be ravaged smerdis king of kings shall do everything in his power to prevent it the messenger said that abivard was willing to believe the question was how much lay in his power not as much as had belonged to the king of kings until peroz threw away his army that was certain abivard glanced at the lengthening shadows pass the night here he told the messenger youll reach no other stronghold before dusk overtakes you thats certain the messenger gauged the shadows too he nodded your hospitality leaves me in your debt i am always pleased to serve the servants of the king of kings abivard turned to his retainers and said see to the horse of he looked at the messenger your name sir i am called ishkuza see to the horse of ishkuza the messenger of smerdis king of kings that still seemed strange in abivards mouth he wondered if his father had been wrong about sharbaraz vek rud domain was a long way from mashiz let us also see to his comfort i know theres a leg of mutton cooking well unstopper one of our finer jars of wine as well hospitality and upholding the reputation of his domain came first with abivard not far behind them though ran the desire to ply ishkuza with as much wine as he could drink in the hopes that it would loosen the messengers tongue and let him learn more about the man who now controlled makurans destiny ishkuza filled himself full of mutton and bulgur and flatbread and yogurt sweetened with honey he drank horn after horn of wine and praised it with the knowing air of a man who had tasted many vintages in his day his face flushed he grew merry and tried to pull a serving woman down onto his lap when she evaded him he laughed boisterously not a bit out of temper but for all abivards questionsand he asked them freely for who could blame a man for wanting to find out all he could about his new suzerain ishkuza said remarkably little he answered what he could on matters of fact of opinions or gossip he seemed entirely bereft so abivard learned smerdis was about sixty which struck him as elderly but not necessarily doddering of course he had servedwith distinction ishkuza added though when speaking of a king of kings it could have gone without sayingat the courts of peroz and his predecessor valash how did he serve there abivard asked wondering whether his duties had been purely ceremonial or if he had done some real work for many years he has overseen the operation of the mint ishkuza answered abivard nodded not a post in which a man was liable to win great glory or repute but not a sinecure either that made him feel a bit better about smerdis he had accomplished something in those sixty years anyhow about the character and temperament of the new king of kings his messenger said nothing abivard accepted that they were not likely to become a matter of intimate concern to a frontier dihqan at any rate he was heartily glad ishkuza had accepted his provisional oath of allegiance to this smerdis king of kings perhaps if makurans new ruler had been dealing with the mint for many years he had developed a calm and judicious temperament one not like that of the usual noble or on the other hand maybe smerdis had enough troubles of his own to be content with any sort of allegiance he could get until perozs charger crashed down into the trench abivard hadnt imagined a king of kings could have troubles like any other man he knew better now the longer he thought about it the likelier the second explanation felt a few days after ishkuza rode out of the stronghold another messenger rode in this one brought more unambiguously welcome news abivards request for an early wedding with roshnani was accepted yet even the sweet came stirred with bitter these days for the dihqan acceding to the request was not papak but his third son okhos no the messenger said sadly he never came back from the steppe country neither he nor his two eldest who rode with him it was much the same with us abivard answered i lost my father my full brother and three half brothers and only through what i thought to be misfortune did i escape the trap myself he told how his horses fall had led to his own survival truly the god watched over you okhos messenger said as i told you none of those from our stronghold returned my new master carries but fifteen years in times like these youth must needs learn young abivard said to which the rider himself a stolid middleage fellow nodded solemnly abivard wondered how much advice papaks principal wife was putting into okhos ear and how willing to listen to her a fifteenyearold would be some evidently or perhaps okhos had wit enough to see the sense in this offer on his own the messenger said by your leave lord the lady roshnani and her wedding party will make for your domain the moment i get home she and they might even have come in my placegossip i hear says she wanted it sobut it was less than polite to show up at your gate without fair warning tell okhos she and hers shall be most welcome and the sooner the better abivard said he already had preparations in train he raised a forefinger tell your master also to be certain her escort includes a good many fullarmed men these days they may find worse than brigands on the road ill give him your words just as youve spoken them to me the messenger promised and repeated them back to show he could excellent abivard said may i put one more question to you at the fellows nod abivard lowered his voice is she pretty lord if i could tell you one way or the other i would the man answered but i cant i never chanced to be in the courtyard when she came out of the womens quarters so i just dont know and i cant say i paid much attention back when she was a brat underfoot very well abivard sighed reached into a pouch he wore on his belt and pulled out two silver arkets this for your honesty at any rate the messenger sketched a salute youre generous to a man youve never seen for your sake i hope shes lovely her father and brothers they arentor werent his mouth twisted the worstlooking men the god ever made with that limited reassurance he rode back toward papaksno okhos nowstronghold the very next day another rider came into the stronghold this one sent out by pradtak son of urashtu after the usual courtesies the man said my master is now dihqan of nalgis crag domain and is pleased to accept your proposal to link our two holdings through his prompt marriage to your sister denak in that you bring me good news abivard said though i grieve to learn his father has gone into the void did he fare north into pardraya he did pradtaks man replied he said no more after the disastrous end of perozs campaign no more needed to be said and your lord was lucky enough to come home safe abivard asked he was eager to learn of others who had survived the fight their numbers were not large and now pradtaks messenger shook his head no lord for he did not go much to his chagrin he broke an arm and an ankle in a fall from his horse during a game of mallet and ball not a week before he was to set out on campaign and so had to remain at the stronghold now we say the god took a hand in preserving him i understand what you mean abivard answered a fall from a horse kept me from disaster too he told his tale again finishing i thought at the time the god had forsaken me but i learned better all too soon i wish he had watched over the whole army as he did over me aye lord you speak nothing but truth there the messenger added it would greatly please pradtak if you were to send your sister to his stronghold as quickly as you might provided she be escorted well enough to see to her safety on the journey only one matter shall delay me abivard said without moving a muscle pradtaks man contrived to look unhappy obviously as far as he was concerned no delay could be acceptable then abivard explained my own bride will soon be traveling hither after i am wed to her i can accompany denak to nalgis crag ah the messenger had a mobile face abivard watched him concede the exception the god grant you and your wife great happiness as he shall surely do with your sister and my master may it be so abivard said and speaking of my sisters happiness i trust the dihqan pradtak is healing well no matter what had been agreed when denak was a little girl abivard did not intend to yoke her to a brooding cripple who might take out on her the resentment for his injuries but the messenger made a sign to turn aside evil suggestions lord by my head by the god in half a year no one shall know he was hurt we have skilled bonesetters in our domain and they have done their best for pradtak oh he may end up with the slightest limp but he shall assuredly be a full and manly man for the ornament he receives from your womens quarters well enough then i shall hold you and him responsible for the truth of what you say abivard would have bet the fellows expressive features would give him away if he lied but they radiated candor that reassured him pradtaks man let out a couple of polite coughs then spoke from behind the palm of his hand may i bring word to my lord of the beauty of your sister i do not wish to see heri ask nothing improper he added hastily but you understand your word will help ease my masters mind abivard almost burst out laughing he had asked okhos man nearly the identical question he thought before he answered a mans word was as precious a gift as he could give was denak beautiful she was his sister he did not look on her as he did on other women but when he had gone into the womens quarters she had not seemed out of place alongside godarzs younger widows who were quite lovely indeed you may tell pradtak that in my humble opinion he will not be disappointed in her appearance he said at length the messenger beamed i shall do just as you say lord a last question and i depart when shall we look for your presence to honor us at nalgis crag i expect my bride to reach this stronghold in a weeks time more or less add in another week for the wedding and the festivities that go with it and the better part of another for traveling to your domain with an armed party and a woman say three weeks in all i shall send out a messenger on a fast horse two days before our wedding party departs so that we do not take your master by surprise you are thoughtfulness itself pradtaks man bowed deeply then remounted his horse and rode back toward his own domain abivard nodded to himself the position of the domain among its neighbors stood to be strengthened whether that would save it against the khamorth remained to be seen abivards heart thumped as it had just before chishpish ordered his warriors to couch their lances he shook his head and twisted his fingers in a sign to turn aside the evil omen disaster had followed close on chishpishs order he prayed to the god and the four to keep the same from happening in his marriage soon now he thought peering out into the courtyard from a window close by the fortified door to the living quarters there stood okhos shifting nervously from foot to foot catching himself at it and stopping then forgetting and starting to jiggle again and i reckoned taking over this domain hard abivard thought as he watched okhos squirm not only had he been a man grown when vek rud domain landed on his shoulders he had also been godarzs chosen heir but okhos beard was only dark down on his cheeks he had been just another of papaks sons until papak and everyone ahead of okhos in the succession went off to pardraya and did not come back now for better or worse okhos had to cope with a dihqans duties despite his own nervousness abivard spared him a moments sympathy next to okhos stood the servant of the god in the yellow robe that proclaimed his calling his hair and beard were uncut and unkempt to symbolize his devotion to things of the next world rather than this abivard spared the gods servant only a passing glance his gaze returned as it had all morning long to the gateway to the stronghold there in the shade waited roshnani when she came out into the courtyard it would also be his own time to advance i wish hed let me see her abivard muttered okhos and the wedding party had arrived the evening before but the young dihqan perhaps because he lacked the experience to know which customary practices he could safely omit adhered rigidly to them all and so while abivard had been able to greet his bridetobeand to learn her voice was pleasant enoughhe still had not looked on her face she wore a veil that must have left her nearly blind and one that defeated all abivards efforts to learn what lay beneath it out in the courtyard one of abivards half brothers began to beat on a drum on the fourth slow deep reverberation roshnani stepped out from the shadows and began to walk slowly toward her brother and the holy man in yellow a younger half brother parsuash gave abivard a shove go on he squeaked its time roshnanis gown was bright as a beacon orangered silk twill decorated with a pattern of ornate stylized baskets of fruit beneath its hem the upturned toes of her red shoes peeked out her veil this time was of the same fabric as the gown though not quite so opaque parsuash shoved abivard again he took a deep breath and walked out into the courtyard as when he had charged into battle fear and exultation mingled when he came up to the people waiting for him okhos gave him a formal bow which he returned he bowed also to the servant of the godwho having a higher master than smerdis king of kings did not bow backand last to roshnani okhos returned that salute for his sister the servant of the god said in the names of narseh gimillu the lady shivini and fraortish eldest of all we are met here today to complete and accomplish what was set in motion years ago the marriage of the dihqan abivard to roshnani daughter of papak the late dihqan and sister to the dihqan okhos okhos face twisted he looked as if he would have given anything to have papak standing in his place abivard understood that he longed to have godarz standing strong behind him but he was on his own and so was okhos his glance went over to the filigreed screens that covered the windows of the womens quarters his mother would be behind one of those screens his sister behind another all the rest of godarzs womennow his womenwould be watching too watching as this stranger from another domain came into their world and likely eclipsed them all in status the god grants his blessings even in adversity the holy man went on from him as well as from men and women springs each new generation each new life is it your will abivard son of godarz that your betrothal be made into a true marriage this day it is my will abivard said as he had been coached not far away frada nodded slowly as if making note of what to expect when his turn before the servant of the god came is it your will okhos son of papak that the betrothal of your sister agreed to by your father be made into a true marriage this day it is my will okhos voice broke as he answered he scowled and flushed abivard wanted to tell him not to worry that it didnt matter but the man in the yellow robe was already turning to roshnani who also had a say in this affair is it your will roshnani daughter of papak that your betrothal be made into a true marriage this day it is my will she answered so low abivard could hardly hear her no wonder she was nervous he thought he was but adding a new wife to several already in the womens quarters if she turned out not to suit him he had but to ignore her but her whole life changed forever with her leaving the stronghold where she had been born and it was so easy for the change to be catastrophically for the worse in token of your wills then the servant of the god handed abivard and roshnani each a date she then gave hers to abivard he his to her as he ate the one she had given him he wondered if he would see her face as she put hers into her mouth but no she reached under the concealing veil and then again to take out the seed she handed that seed back to the holy man as abivard did with his the servant of the god said i shall plant these seeds side by side that they may grow together as do the two of you then he took roshnanis hands and set them between abivards that action completed and formalized the wedding ceremony cheers rang out in the courtyard and from some though not all the windows in the womens quarters frada pelted the new couple with wheat to remind the god to make them fertile now that her hands rested in his abivard gained the right to lift roshnanis veil he had proved his own word and his faith in her father and brother by marrying her first with that done she passed from them to him the silk of the veil was slick against his fingers as he raised it roshnani tried to smile as he saw her for the first time she was roundfaced pleasantlooking beneath her tension with pretty eyes accented by kohl she had painted a beauty mark on one side of her chin her cheeks were rougedbut not as heavily as perozs had been that day in camp she was less than he had dreamed of more than he had feared as godarzs son he was plenty practical enough to make the best of that welcome to vek rud domain wife of mine he said smiling back at her the god grant you long years of happiness here thank you husband of mine she answered her voice steadiermaybe she knew how to make the best of things too may she be generous enough to grant you what you have wished me frada threw another handful of wheat over them abivard took roshnanis hand in his once more and led her through the crowd toward the living quarters of the stronghold retainers and kin all bowed low as they passed abivard paused for a moment as he went inside to let his eyes adjust to the gloom roshnani looked around curiously at people wall hangings and furniture this was after all the first stronghold she had seen other than her own youve done well for yourselves here she observed so we have abivard said and now the domain has a fine new ornament in it he smiled at her to show what he meant she had been properly brought up she cast down her eyes with becoming modesty you are kind she whispered her tone made abivard wonder if she was saying what she meant or what she hoped we go this way now he said and led her down the corridor that ended at the dihqans bedchamber he knew some trepidation in going that way himself since he had come home as lord of vek rud domain he had kept on sleeping in the little room that had been his before the army plunged onto the steppe he had slept alone every night too reasoning that he wanted to establish no favorites before roshnani arrived now though everything changed he would have to occupy the chamber that had been his fathers not only was its bed longer than the little pallet in his old room but it had a door that connected to the womens quarters after much searching he had found a spare key to the lock on that door glued to the back of a frame that mounted a tapestry the outer door to the dihqans bedchamber had a bar to it when he shut the door his siblings and retainers in the hallway behind him cheered and called out ribald advice the cheers doubled when they heard the bar fall abivard glanced over at roshnani who was looking at the bed on which a serving woman had spread a square of white cotton cloth she flushed when she noticed him watching her then said by the god i swear i have known no man before but she stopped in confusion one of the things my father told me one of the many useful things my father told me abivard thought was that women dont always bleed the first time if that proves so theres a little pot of fowls blood hidden in the chest of drawers to make appearances proper i think i may be luckier than i dared dream roshnani said quietly i hope you go on thinking so abivard answered meanwhile though whether you end up needing that pot of blood or not we are here for a reason a reason yes roshnani turned her back on him the gown had carved bone toggles all the way down to undo some of them herself she would have had to be a contortionist he opened them one by one his own hands grew less steady the farther he went in a land where women concealed themselves removing one from that concealment was intoxicatingly exciting under the gown roshnani wore drawers of shimmering silk she let abivard slide those to the floor too then laughed nervously i feel i should cover myself from you but i know that is not the way of what we do now no he said a little hoarsely like her face her body was if not surpassingly beautiful then plenty inviting enough he pulled his caftan over his head then hastily took off his own drawers he was a little surprised to find roshnani looking at him with even more curiosity than he had shown her after a moment the surprise vanished she after all knew less of how men were made than he did of women he took her hand it was cold in his he led her over to the bed saying i will do my best not to hurt you this being your first time thank you she answered all of papaksokhos nowwomen have told me what to expect but since no two of them say the same thing my thought is that i shall have to find out for myself even as he was about to draw her down onto the square of cloth he paused in admiration of her words rather than her body do you know he told her seriously my father would have said the very same thing and he was the wisest man i ever knew with that he began to think she might have the makings of a principal wife after all then they did lie down on the bed which creaked and rustled under their weight abivard knew a certain nervousness himself till this moment the only virginity he had disposed of had been his own taking his brides was another matter altogether he wondered if she even knew how to kiss on making the experiment he discovered she did she let out a small giggle when their lips separated your beard and mustache tickle she said he had never thought of the act of love as a way to make the acquaintance of someone but that was what it proved to be he learned every time he touched her every time his lips moved from here to there and merely taking part in the act together joined them in a way nothing else could some little while later came the time when he at last went into her her face twisted beneath him as he made his way through the gate no one had opened before he did his best not to hurt her but his urgency had its demands too he spent in a long groaning rush of pleasure she wriggled a little after he gasped himself to completion it wasnt a motion associated with arousal it seemed more like get off meyoure heavy he took his weight on his elbows then slipped out of her he glanced down at himself and at roshnani we wont have any need for the fowls blood he said she sat up looking at the little driblet of blood from between her legs that stained the cloth so we wont are you all right he asked yes i think so she answered it hurt some but i expected it to so that wasnt so bad im sure it will be easier next time easier still the time after that did youlike it he asked hesitantly she gave the question serious consideration before she answered he was getting the idea she generally thought before she spoke that to him was a point in her favor after a moment she said when it doesnt hurt any more i think it will be pleasant enough though i still may find your lips and tongue sweeter as they can touch just the right spot she looked at him anxiously does that make you angry why should a truthful answer make me angry abivard said i knew i shouldnt believe everything i heard in the womens quarters his new bride answered they said a man was apt to be so proud of his prong is that what they call it abivard broke in amused well yes anyhow they said he was apt to be so proud of it that hed forget anything else im glad to find they were wrong men arent all the same any more than women are i suppose he said roshnani nodded abivard wondered if she already knew the touch of lips and tongue stories said the inhabitants of the womens quarters especially if their husband was old or infirm or had a great many wives and made love to each only rarely sometimes sated one anothers lust he couldnt find any way to ask her he didnt suppose it was properly his concern anyway roshnani said what you say stands to reason but of men i must say i know little i hope you will end up satisfied with this man at least being young abivard was ready for a second round almost at once but didnt take it from her not when he had just made her bleed tomorrow would be another day if she was to become his principal wife he wanted her pleased with him in bed they were more likely to be in accord thus on the proper running of the domain hurting her again wouldnt help that he got out of bed pulled on his caftan and picked up the bloodstained square of cloth roshnani started to put on her silk drawers then shook her head i dont care to soil them she said and stepped back into her gown fasten enough of the toggles to make me decent for the showing will you please abivard did as she asked then threw wide the door to the dihqans chamber the hallway outside was packed with eagerlyand curiouslywaiting people he held up the cloth with roshnanis virgin blood on it everyone broke into loud cheers as the proper sealingor in this case unsealingof a bargain roshnani faced the folk of vek rud domain with her head held high after the ritual showing abivard shut the door once more from the hallway came ribald howls but he had already decided against that second round instead of undoing the silk gown once more he made sure all its toggles were closed in their proper loops well have you just as you should be before you go into the womens quarters he said i thank you for the care you show me roshnani looked and sounded as anxious now in a different way as she had when he had brought her to bed and no wondershe would live with these women for the rest of her days and a newcomer find her place among them abivard took the key and used it to unlatch the door that led into the secluded part of the stronghold burzoe and denak waited not far down that hall he had expected them to be there leading roshnani up to them he said my mother my sister i present to you my wife the three women embraced one another burzoe said may you serve this domain as you did your fathers may you give us many fine heirs may you be happy here as usual that came last with her the god grant your wishes mother of the dihqan roshnani said softly denak said you must tell me everything of your journey here and of the ceremony and she too lowered her voice after a glance at abivard other matters i too am to be wed this season roshnani turned her eyes toward abivard i shall speak of whatever you wishsoon he could take a hint bowing to his wife his mother and his sister in turn he said with your gracious permission ladies i shall take my leave no doubt you will wish to discuss matters with which my merely male ears should not be profaned roshnani burzoe and denak all laughed in a way that made him retreat even faster than he had planned no doubt you will wish to discuss matters with which my merely male ears would be scorched he thought if roshnani was going to tell denak about his performance he didnt want to be anywhere within fifty farsangs when she did it fleeing that far was impractical but he could take himself out of earshot and he did frada let out a low whistle and pointed ahead to nalgis crag and the stronghold that sat atop it will you look there he said any army could sit at the bottom of that pile of rock forever but if it tried to go up itd go back down again and a lot faster too abivard finished for his younger brother only one narrow winding track led up to the stronghold of nalgis crag domain even from a quarter of a farsang away abivard could see a dozen places where a handful of determined men could hold up the army frada had mentioned they have to have a way to get water too else the stronghold wouldnt have got the reputation it owns frada added speaking with the tones of an aspiring general ill be pleased to get inside strong walls again abivard said ive felt half naked on the road he gestured at himself like all the warriors in denaks wedding party he wore a helmet and carried sword and lance as a proper makuraner fighting man should but the rest of his gear and theirs was leather hardened with melted wax the same sort of light protection some of the khamorth nomads used the stronghold smiths were beginning to recreate the iron suits lost in the pardrayan debacle but even one of them would be awhile in the making frada turned to denak and said how fare you sister i revel in being out of the womens quarters she answered but i wish i did not have to travel veiled i could see so much more of the countryside without this covering for my face till we got into the territory of nalgis crag domain this morning there wasnt much to see abivard said only desert and rocks between our lands and pradtaks save for patches of oasis makuran is less than fertile when youve done nothing but look out windows these past ten years even desert seems interesting denak said as she usually did she tried to look on the bright side of things nalgis crag stronghold is so high above the rest of the domain i should have a broad view from the womens quarters abivard had never worried much about the propriety of shutting highborn women away from the world as soon as they became women it was the custom of his land and he went along with it he had not even worried about his sister being closed up in the womens quarters of the stronghold of vek rud domain that had happened when he was scarcely more than a boy himself and he had grown used to it but to have her closed up in a womens quarters far away that sent a pang through the core of him ill miss you sister of mine he said seriously and i you denak answered we can perhaps write back and forth i hope pradtak wont mind if pradtak did mind that would be the end of the idea as they both knew denak went on what point to learning my letters though if im not allowed to use them abivard wondered why godarz had decided to let denak learn to read and write few makuraner women could he didnt think burzoe knew how for all her cleverness his best guess was that godarz seeing ability couldnt bear to let it lie fallow no matter how unusual the field one thing his father had never been was wasteful high and thin in the distance a horn call rang out from nalgis crag stronghold the wedding party had been seen come on abivard shouted lets give them all the swank we can for the sake of our pride and the name of our domain he wished the band could have ridden up nalgis crag and into the stronghold with armor jingling sweetly around them but that could not be at least pradtak would understand and sympathize few domains these days faced no such predicament the track that led up to the stronghold had been hacked into the side of the crag as he rode up it abivard saw his earlier estimates had been wrong at fifteen places on the narrow twisting road maybe even a score a few determined men could have held up a host stones were heaped every furlong or less to rain down on the heads of attackers and tumble them to their doom at the end of the track nalgis crag stronghold was no mean piece of fortcraft in and of itself if any army somehow fought its way to the top of the crag those frowning granite walls cunningly made to hug every bit of high ground would hold it at bay for a long time who comes a guard standing in the open gateway demanded fiercely spear ready to bar the new arrivals path abivard son of godarz dihqan of vek rud domain abivard answered formally with me comes my full sister denak intended bride of pradtak son of urashtu the great and powerful dihqan of nalgis crag domain he had no idea how great and powerful pradtak was in person but any dihqan who controlled this domain had access to power that would make some marzbans jealous the guard performed a fancy flourish with the spear the god watch over you and your party as you enter nalgis crag stronghold abivard son of godarz and may your sisters union with our dihqan prove joyous and fruitful he stepped aside so the wedding party could go ahead now abivard had to take the role young okhos had played at vek rud stronghold he helped denak dismount they stood in the shade of the gate while the rest of the wedding party had their horses seen to and took their places among the spectators from pradtaks domain the servant of the god came out and stood waiting in the center of the courtyard his yellow robe shining bright as the sun that beat down on him abivard turned to denak helping her off with the mantle that had kept her gown clean are you ready he murmured the veil hid her face but she nodded he took her handsthe only part of her visibleand led her toward the holy man the sun shimmered from the gown too it was a rich blue silk patterned with backtoback peacocks that shared a golden jeweldecked nimbus above each pair floated a lily leaf between pairs stood fancy columns with floral capitals may the god and the four bless you and keep you the holy man said as they took their places by him abivards eyes turned to the doorway to the strongholds living quarters it opened out came pradtak one arm in a sling the other hand clutching a stick to help hold him upright he took almost all his weight on his right leg pain cut through the grim determination on his face every time his left foot touched the ground abivard studied himwas this man worthy of his sister pradtak was somewhere close to thirty of a good height with regular features and a beard trimmed more closely than most he had courage to walk on an ankle that so obviously had yet to heal at first glance he seemed suitable though in his heart abivard reckoned none but the king of kings a suitable groom for denakand even that would not do not now not when a graybeard like smerdis held the throne of makuran the wedding ceremony began pradtak agreed it was his will that he marry denak the servant of the god turned to abivard and said is it your will abivard son of godarz that the betrothal of your sister agreed to by your father be made into a true marriage this day it is my will abivard declared as firmly as he could the servant of the god asked denak if she also consented to the marriage she put more voice into her answer than roshnani had but not much the holy man gave her and pradtak the ritual dates they ate together in token of union and fertility denak handed hers to her new husband he gave his to her as roshnani had she contrived to eat the fruit without showing pradtak her face let him wait abivard thought i had to the servant of the god took the pits from the dates and put them in a pouch on his belt for later replanting then he set denaks hands between pradtaks the folk of nalgis crag cheered and threw grain at the newlywed couple and then as he now could with propriety pradtak lifted his brides veil to see what manner of woman his fathers bargain with godarz all those years before had got him abivard needed an effort of will not to curl his hands into anxious fists if pradtak humiliated his sister he didnt know what he would do but it would be ugly for denaks sake it would have to be but pradtak smiled he nodded to abivard i find i am a fortunate man this day my brotherinlaw may you and my sister be fortunate together for many years to come abivard answered returning courtesy for courtesy then he said now that we have been joined my clan and yours may i take the liberty of asking you one question that has nothing to do with this wedding a quick one pradtak said his eyes full of denak quick indeed i would not delay you just this then have you yet sworn loyalty to smerdis king of kings that made pradtak think of something other than the nuptial bed cautiously he answered aye i have i found no compelling reason to do otherwise as sharbaraz has renounced the throne and you the same abivard said and for the same reasons thank you my brotherinlaw as you said the question was quick pradtak said now though with my bride and my ankle i have two good reasons to want to be off my feet you may lean on me if it eases you denak said am i not to be your support in years to come you are pradtak admitted but not in public this journey i shall make unaided to feed my own pride walk beside me if you will denaks eyes flicked to abivardmaybe for the last time he thought with another stab of painasking him what she should do very slightly he nodded robbing a man of his pride would not do not on a wedding day and if pradtak had managed to walk out here he would probably make it back to the living quarters by himself so he did albeit slowly denak at his side but not touching him the crowd in the courtyard that would have surged after the newlyweds perforce came slowly instead and jammed up at the entrance once inside most of them turned to the left toward the delicious smells coming from the kitchens others followed pradtak and denak rightward toward the dihqans bedchamber baying the same sort of advice abivard had heard not long before he went right himself not out of lubricity but to show he had confidence in denak and to deal with any difficulties that might arise should that square of cloth come out unbloodied pradtak could if it suited him declare the marriage void abivard did not expect that but duty demanded that he be there in case of problems the door to the bedchamber closed he heard the bar thud into place after that all was silent within some of the men speculated lewdly on what was going on abivard wanted to draw sword on them but restrained himself at a wedding such jokes had their place as minutes stretched people got tired of waiting and drifted off toward the food thump in the bedchamber someone removed the bar the door opened to cheers from the people still in the hallway abivards not softest among them pradtak showed off a bloodstained square of cotton my brotherinlaw indeed he called to abivard removing any possible doubts abivard bowed in return then made his way to the kitchens too denak would be going into the womens quarters to emerge but seldom thereafter it seemed imperfectly fair is all well frada asked with his mouth full he had pocket bread stuffed with mutton and pine nuts in one hand a mug of wine in the other all is well abivard said did you expect otherwise he waited for frada to shake his head then went on let me get some food too what you have there looks good but after weve stayed long enough for politeness sake i want to leave for home as soon as we may why concern etched fradas face did pradtak offer offense to you or to our sister his hand slipped to the hilt of his sword if he did no no abivard said quickly nothing of the sort all the same this stronghold puts me out of spirit the sooner i see vek rud domain once more the gladder i shall be here and there makuran was a spectacularly fertile land between here and there it was desert not even lizards skittered across the gravelstrewn path from pradtaks domain back to abivards he and his party set out at earliest dawn to make as much distance as they could before the worst heat of the day as the sun rose it painted the hills north and west of nalgis crag in shadows of rose and coral so that several men pointed to them and exclaimed over their loveliness but when the sun rose higher and its own rays lost the ruddiness of early morning the hills revealed their true huesdun brown and ashen gray they might as well be women frada said take away their paint and they are beautiful no longer most of the horsemen laughed heartily at that sally under other circumstances abivard would have joined them but he was lost in thoughtful silence wondering how denak fared not only in pradtaks arms but also in the womens quarters of the stronghold for that matter he wondered how roshnani was faring back at vek rud domain all had seemed well when he set out with denak but who could say what might have happened in the days since frada asked him do you think the smiths will have finished an armor by the time we get back to our stronghold i know that first suit will be yoursyoure dihqan after all but ill wear the second dont be too eager to wear it even once its made abivard answered had the domain boasted a seventh suit you likely would have fared with us out onto the steppe which meant youd have been unlikely to come home safe again frada only snorted he didnt believe anything bad could ever happen to him abivard hadnt believed that either not until he saw the banner of peroz king of kings fall into the khamorth trench after that he could not doubt misfortune fell on all base and royal alike out in the middle of the rocky waterless plain in stretches bare even of thorn bushes a blue shimmering miragea ghost lake godarz had always called itgave the illusion of water in plenty to make itself even more tantalizing it kept pace with the travelers as they rode along never letting them gain a foot on it a thirsty man who did not know the lake for illusion would surely have perished pursuing it by the god abivard said if the khamorth do invade our land may they seek to drink deep from a ghost lake and follow it to their ruin frada said perhaps they will remain on their own side of the degird if they were going to push into makuran would they not have done it already who can say whats in a nomads mind abivard answered we and the steppe have warred since the days when heroes walked the earth now one side wins now the other seldom though he thought had victory been so absolute as day dwindled the riders looked for a halting point after unspoken consultation with men older and more experienced than himself abivard chose the tip of a low hillock that even boasted a few bushes and shrubs to fuel watch fires he did not need advice in ordering sentries out in a triangle around the camp anyone bandit or nomad who wanted to surprise him in the darkness would have to work for it he never knew whether his precautions had anything to do with the peaceful night that followed but he had no intention of neglecting them when evening twilight came again after pancakes fried on a flat griddle and sour wine the wedding party set out for vek rud domain once more several days passed thus and the stronghold grew ever nearer then about an hour before noon when abivard was thinking of laying up for a while until the weather cooled he spotted a group of men on horseback coming toward him and his followers not a caravan frada said curiosity in his voice theyre riding all the horses they have i wonder what theyre doing here he shaded his eyes with the palm of his hand in hope of seeing better no doubt theyre wondering the same of us abivard made sure his sword was loose in its scabbard and his lance in its rest on the saddle the men who approached might have been celebrants like the group he led or they might have been bandits in which case they would sheer off soon the numbers of the two parties were close to even and bandits seldom relished odds like those frada peered through heat haze again miserable little horses theyre on he said theyre no better than that steppe pony you brought back from he stopped his mouth and eyes both opening wide abivard knew what he was thinking the same idea blazed in his own mind khamorth he shouted loud enough to startle himself form line of battle by the god lets see if we can get ourselves a small measure of revenge his companions peeled off to either side of the road they hadnt been trained to fight as a unit but they knew what they had to do when abivard waved them forward they booted their horses into a trot no point to an allout gallop till they drew closer to the foe stay in line abivard urged eyes on the nomads ahead they milled about in confusion for a moment as if surprised at being recognized for what they were but then they too shook themselves out into a fighting line more ragged than that of their makuraner foes they came on with as little hesitation as abivards men makuraaan frada shouted in an instant the whole wedding party was screaming the war cry no one abivard noted yelled the name of smerdis king of kings he remained too new on the throne to make much of a symbol for the land he ruled the khamorth shouted too harshly to abivard their unintelligible yells seemed like the bellows of wild beasts then almost at the same instant the nomads reached over their left shoulders for arrows rose from their short stirrup leathers until they were all but standing and let fly abivard flung up his shield buzzing like an angry wasp an arrow flew past his head one of his men let out a cry of pain but no saddles emptied gallop abivard cried and spurred his horse forward the khamorth broke off their own advance and fled back the way they had come shooting arrows over their shoulders but their aim was poorer that way and the men pursuing them though not armored in iron still had some protection against glancing hits and because the makuraners were without their usual heavy mail and horse trappings their big steeds ran faster than they would have otherwise they quickly gained ground on the plainsmen the nomads realized that too they broke into several small groups and raced across the barren plain in different directions abivard and frada pounded side by side after a couple of khamorth one of the nomads yanked out his curved shamshir but too late abivards lance took him in the back just below the left shoulder he had never before felt the soft resistance flesh and bone gave to sharppointed iron the khamorth threw his arms wide the sword flew from his hand he let out a bubbling shriek and crumpled blood gushed from the hole in the nomads back when abivard yanked the lance free the point which had gone in bright and shiny came out dripping red as did the last foot of the shaft abivard gulped talking about slaughtering khamorth was all very well but the harsh reality almost made him lose his breakfast no time to be sick he told himself aloud and wheeled his horse to see how frada was doing against his foe his younger brothers lance thrust had missed now he was using the long spear to hold at bay the plainsman he faced abivard spurred toward the battling pair when the khamorth turned his head to gauge the new threat frada punched the lancehead through his throat more blood spurted its iron stink filled abivards nostrils as at the butchering of a sheep he looked around to learn how the rest of the makuraner wedding party fared two big horses were down and another galloped across the plain with an empty saddle but the khamorth had lost six or seven men and the rest fled wildly from the makuraners the little battle hadnt lasted long but such as it was it brought victory to abivard and his followers he expected them to burst into wild cheers the cheers denied them when they had invaded the steppes that didnt happen he didnt feel like cheering himself not now just savoring being alive sufficed he rode toward a shaggybearded man in the sueded leather of pardraya who lay writhing on the ground one of the khamorths legs twisted at an unnatural angle both his hands were pressed to hold in his belly trying without hope of success to keep the red tide of his life from ebbing away abivard speared him again this time in the neck the nomad thrashed a few times then quit moving why did you do that frada asked he wasnt going to live not with wounds like those abivard said shrugging i dont have the stomach to torment him for the sport of it what else would you have me do but put him out of his pain then i pray to the god someone would do the same for me were i in such straits put that way what you say makes sense frada sounded surprised even so especially at the idea of having anything dreadful happen to him in battle abivard understood that up until a few weeks before he had felt the same way not any more he knew better now the makuraners reassembled some of them dismounted to strip their fallen foes of bows and arrows curved swords and ornaments look here someone called holding a gold brooch this is makuraner work surely plunder from the lost battle on the plains good and fitting that it return to its proper home then abivard said he looked around seeing how his own men had come through the fight someone had just broken off an arrow and pulled it through vidarnags arm the rag tied around the wound was turning red but not too fast farnbag had a cut on his cheek through which abivard could see several of his teeth have to sew that up now he thought or it may be a hole for the rest of his days a couple of others had lesser hurts and kambujiya and dostan were missing half a furlong away lay a body with a lance beside it the makuraners helm had fallen off revealing a shiny bald pate that was dostan then and there sprawled kambujiya over in the other direction the god grant them peace abivard said he made some quick mental calculations the wedding party was at most two days from vek rud domain the very last part of the ride would be unpleasant but well tie them onto a couple of packhorses let them rest in the soil with their fathers and let the jackals and ravens and buzzards squabble over the remains of the khamorth frada added aye abivard said and may they find them sweet he plucked at his bearded chin in a gesture he had picked up from his father now what we have to find out is whether these plainsmen were on their own or if theyre part of a bigger band if they are he made a sour face if they were his assumption that the nomads would stay on their own side of the degird had to go after the corpses of the two slain men had been picked up the makuraners started north and west again now they rode as if expecting battle at any time and from any direction with one man a couple of furlongs ahead at point and another the same distance behind the main group to serve as rear guard they saw no more plainsmen for the rest of the day when evening drew near abivard looked for a defensible campsite with even more care than he had before then he had worried about what might happen now he knew it could he finally found a steep hillock that might have been crowned with a stronghold had the land around it boasted any water as he had before he set out pickets in a triangle around it he took his own turn at watch too replacing frada for the middleofthenight stint all quiet here his brother reported yawning lowering his voice frada added i would not say so in front of the men but i mislike the omen were bringing home aye i had the same thought myself abivard answered also quietly a wedding partys supposed to fetch back joy and hope instead well hear women wailing when we get home to the stronghold he spread his hands but what choice have we none i see frada said but all makuran has heard too much of women wailing this season which does not mean we shall not hear more abivard slapped his brother on the back you fought well now go back up by the fire and get some rest frada took a couple of steps then stopped and turned back its an uglier business than i thoughtfighting i mean the blood the stinks the fear he hesitated before that last as if afraid of being thought unmanly oh yes abivard said he couldnt see his brothers face it was dark and frada stood between him and the embers of the fire with his back to their glow but he did see godarzs younger son let his shoulders slump in relief abivard paced back and forth on watch not to be more vigilant but because he knew he was liable to fall back to sleep if he sat down in one place but for the faint scrapescrape of his boots on dirt and gravel the night was eerily quiet once a long way away a fox yipped after so much silence the sound made abivard start and grab for his sword he laughed at his own nerves as he began to pace again even to himself though the laughter seemed hollow with the khamorth loose in makuran every traveler who went beyond sight of his own stronghold would run risk of ambush some of those who failed to start at imaginary dangers would also fail to start at real ones the moon was down the night was very black stars glittering like tiny jewels set on velvet the faint glimmer of what the makuraners called the gods robe stretched from horizon to horizon abivard never remembered seeing it clearer a shooting star flashed across the sky then another he whispered a prayer for the souls of dostan and kambujiya carried through the void on those stars a third star fell he couldnt believe it ferried the spirit of a khamorth to the god on the other hand all too likely more makuraners than his own two companions had fallen to the nomads today the rider took from his belt a tube of leather boiled in wax to make it impregnable to rain and river water with a flourish he undid the stopper and handed abivard the rolledup parchment inside here you are lord thank you abivard gave the fellow half a silver arket people often cut coins to make change the horseman bowed in the saddle dug heels into his mounts sides and rode away from vek rud stronghold abivard unrolled the parchment he had been sure the letter was from denak not only had he recognized the courier from his own trip to nalgis crag domain but no one save his sister was likely to write him in any case still seeing her carefully formed script always made him smile to the dihqan abivard his loving sister denak sends greetings he read murmuring the words aloud as if to call up her voice i am gladder than i can say that you came home safe from the fight with the khamorth we have not seen any of the barbarians in this domain and hope we do not and as you can see pradtak my husband has no objection to your writing to me or to my replying i think he was surprised to learn i have my letters i may be the only one in the womens quarters here who does abivard frowned when he read that being singled out as different wouldnt make life in the womens quarters any easier for denak he read on while caring greatly that his domain should prosper pradtak also enjoys the pleasures of the hunt he still cannot ride and pines for the day when he will again be able to pursue the wild ass and the gazelle when he can stop worrying about the domain and go off and have fun abivard read between the lines his father had occasionally had some pointed things to say about dihqans who put their own pleasures first denak would have heard them too abivard wondered if she was trying to make her new husband see sense he looked down at the letter again because i read and write he entrusts me day by day with more of the administration of the domain everything here is new to me and i have more responsibilities than i am used to shouldering but i try to decide what our father would have done in any given case so far this seems to work well the god grant it continue so i pray to her to keep you well and eagerly await next word from you so father now runs two domains even if not in the flesh the thought made abivard smile he suspected it would have made godarz smile too from denaks letter she was well on the way to becoming pradtaks right hand and probably three fingers of the left as well he rolled up the letter again and put it back in its tube later he would read it to burzoe who no doubt would be proud of what her daughter was accomplishing he wondered if he should read it to roshnani maybe she would think it obligated her to try to run vek rud domain as denak was taking over at nalgis crag but abivard was no pradtak he had his own ideas about how things should go for now he would put guards out with his herdsmen to protect them and their flocks from small khamorth raiding parties if a whole clan decided to try to settle on his grazing lands guard detachments wouldnt be enough to hold them at bay but he kept hoping that wouldnt happen of course none of his hopes had come to much since he crossed into pardraya well he said to no one in particular everything that possibly could go wrong has already gone and done it things have to get better from here on out the cry from the battlements brought abivard up the stairs at a dead run soldiers soldiers under the lion banner of the king of kings following a sentrys pointing finger abivard saw for himself the approaching detachment it was bigger than he had expected a couple of hundred men in bright surcoats over iron armor if they hit the khamorth they could hit them hard abivards heart leaped to see the sign of returning makuraner might open the gates he shouted let us make these heroes welcome while the gates swung slowly open abivard descended to greet the newcomers in person all the doubts he had had about smerdis king of kings vanished like a brief rain shower into the soil of the desert the new ruler was stretching forth his hand to protect his distant provinces not all the riders could enter the courtyard together abivard ordered bread and wine sent to those who had to wait outside the walls you are blessed by the god for coming to the frontier in our hour of need he told the commander of smerdis force a toughlooking veteran with gray mustachios waxed into stiff spikes even from a man who was nothing more than a soldier he had expected a courteous reply the folk of makuran could swap compliments from morning till night but the commander instead of praising abivards hospitality or the site of his stronghold suffered an untimely coughing fit when at last he could speak again he said you would be better advised magnificent dihqan to address your remarks to my colleague here the famous murghab abivard had taken the famous murghab to be the commanders scribe he was a desiccated little man in a plain graybrown caftan who looked uncomfortable on his horse but if the soldier said he was a person of consequence abivard would greet him properly bowing low he said how may i serve the splendid servant of smerdis king of kings may his years be many and his lands increase your attitude does you credit murghab said in a voice like rustling leaves i shall speak frankly smerdis king of kings finds himself in need of silver and is levying a special assessment on each domain we require from you payment of he pulled out a sheet of parchment and ran his finger down till he found the line he needed eight thousand five hundred silver arkets or their equivalent in kind the assessment is due and payable forthwith now abivard coughed or rather choked he also felt like an idiot he could not possibly say no not now not after he had let so many of the king of kings warriors into vek rud stronghold a dozen of them sat their horses between him and the doorway to the living quarters they watched him with polite but careful attention toothey were readier for trouble than he had been he gathered himself he had that much silver in his treasury if smerdis was going to use it to defend the kingdom it might even prove money well spent however much he regretted parting with it he said i hope smerdis king of kings is using my silver and what he gets from other dihqans to enroll new soldiers in his lists and to hire smiths to make armor and weapons for them the famous murghab said not a word puzzled abivard looked to the military commander the officer fidgeted in the saddle waiting for murghab to reply but when he remained mute the fellow said smerdis king of kings orders this silver collected so as to pay an enormous sum of tribute to the khamorth that they may withdraw over the degird and stay on their side of the river henceforward what abivard howled forgetting the disadvantage at which smerdis soldiers had him thats crazy so smerdis king of kings has ordained so shall it be murghab intoned who are you to question the will of the king of kings put that way abivard was nobody and he knew it instead of answering murghab he turned to the commander but dont you see bold captain that paying tribute when were too weak to defend ourselves only invites the plainsmen back to collect a new pile of silver next year and the year after that so smerdis king of kings has ordained so shall it be the officer said tonelessly though his words echoed murghabs his expression and manner argued he was less than delighted at the policy he had been ordered to uphold murghab said the sum heretofore cited is due and payable now do not waste time even to scratch your head surely you would not wish to be construed as resisting the king of kings had abivard not let the foxes into the henhouse he would have thought hard about resistingas well throw his silver down a qanat as convey it to the khamorth as things were tasting gall he said bide here o famous murghab he could not resist putting a sardonic twist on the mans honorific i shall bring you what you require and may smerdis king of kingsand the khamorthhave joy of it godarz had been a methodical man the silver in the strongholds treasure room was stored in leather sacks a thousand arkets to each abivard picked up two sacks one in each hand and grunting a little carried them through the halls and out of the living quarters to the courtyard where he set them in front of murghabs horse he made the same trip three more times bide here a moment more famous sir he said when he had brought out eight thousand arkets he went back into the treasury only three sacks of coins remained there as well as some empty ones neatly piled to await filling abivard took one of those and dumped jingling silver coins into it till it weighed about as much as the sack from which he was taking the money he sighed this wasnt how godarz had intended the sack to be used he had wanted silver coming in not going out but abivard could do nothing about that not now he carried out the halffilled sack and set it with the rest this may be twenty or thirty arkets too light or it may be so much too heavy will you be satisfied or must you have an exact count murghab pursed his lips the order of the king of kings may his years be long calls for eight thousand five hundred no more certainly no less therefore i am of the opinion that it suffices lord the officer who led the detachment of royal soldiers broke in you have cooperated most graciously with our request what am i supposed to do when youre already inside my stronghold abivard thought nonetheless the soldier at least adhered to the courtesies makuraners held dear abivard put the best face on extortion he could saying with a bow it is a privilege for any subject to serve the king of kings in any manner he requires may i have your name that i may commend you to him for the manner in which you perform your duties you honor me beyond my deserts the soldier replied abivard shook his head he wished he didnt know the famous murghabs name he couldnt say that aloud but had the feeling the officer knew it the fellow added since you ask lord i am zal zal abivard repeated locking the name in his memory he would not forget it nor would he forget murghab however much he tried he asked may i serve you in any other way i think we are quits here zal sketched a salute to abivard at his order a couple of men dismounted and loaded the silver from vek rud domain onto the patient back of a packhorse without apparent irony zal said may the god grant you continued prosperity why so you can come back and shear me again probably for that very reason abivard judged but he could not afford such an outrageous payment again and now he knew better than to open his gates to smerdis men the next time they wanted silver for tribute the would have to get it from him the hard way the dihqans bedchamber had a window that faced east giving its occupant the chance to look out over the domain that window also let in earlymorning sunbeams to ensure that its occupant did not sleep too far into the day had the chamber not belonged to dihqans long before godarzs time abivard would have guessed that was his fathers scheme whosever idea it had been back in the dim days when the stronghold was raised it still worked one of those sunbeams pried his eyelids open he sat up in bed and stretched roshnani was lying with her back to the sun and so remained asleep he smiled and set a gentle hand on the curve of her bare hip his skin toasted over years by the sun was several shades darker than hers a dihqans wife should be pale he thought it shows she doesnt have to leave the womens quarters and work like some village woman even after smerdis depredations the domain was not so far gone as that roshnani shifted on the down of the mattress abivard jerked his hand away he hadnt wanted to waken her but her squirming brought her face into the path of the sunbeam she tried to twist away but too late her eyes came open she smiled when she saw abivard good morning sun in my window she said maybe that last one started a boy in me she set a hand on her belly just above the midnight triangle between her legs maybe it did he answered and if it didnt we could always try again he made as if to leap at her then and there it was only play hed learned she wasnt in the mood for such things at daybreak he did let his lips brush across hers who would have thought a marriage where neither of us saw the other till after we were pledged could bring so much happiness with it i saw you she corrected him dimly and through the veil but i did and he prompted probing for a compliment i didnt flee she answered he poked her in the ribs she squeaked and poked him back he was ticklish a weakness his father and brothers had exploited without mercy he grabbed roshnani to keep her from doing anything so perfidious again one thing led to another and presently he discovered she could be in the mood for an earlymorning frolic after all afterward he said im greedy for you i want to call you here again tonight id like that too she said running a fingertip down the middle of his chest but you might be wiser to choose another why he suspected his frown was closer to a pout having a great many lovely women at his disposal was a young mans fantasy reality abivard had discovered was less than imagination had led him to believe oh variety every once in a while was enjoyable but he preferred roshnani over the wives he had inherited from godarz when he told her as much she glowed like a freshly lighted lamp all the same she said you still might be better advised to choose someone else tonight if you call only for me i will be hated in the womens quartersand so shall you has it come to that abivard asked alarmed i dont believe so not yet but ive heard mutters around corners and from behind closed doors that make me fear such a thing is not far away roshnani answered your lady mother might perhaps tell you more but this i say better to give up a little happiness now if in the giving you save a great deal later the words had the ring of sense abivard was used to hearing from burzoe which to his mind meant roshnani had the makings of as fine a principal wife as any dihqan could hope for do you know what you are he asked her she shook her head a woman in ten thousand he said no by the god in a hundred thousand that earned him a kiss but when he tried for more this time roshnani pulled away you must be able to give your best to whomever you call tonight she said he glowered in mock indignation now you presume to question my manhood but since he had a pretty good notion of what he could do in that regard he made no more than that mild protestroshnani was too likely to be right when evening came he summoned ardini instead of roshnani she came to his bedchamber in a silken gown so transparent he could see the two tiny moles she had just below her navel that excited him but she had drenched herself in rose water till she smelled stronger than a perfumers he almost sent her back to the womens quarters to scrub it off but desisted no point in embarrassing her he regretted that later for the bedchamber was redolent of roses for the next several days abivard conscientiously summoned each of his wives from the womens quarters in turn a couple of times he had to pretend to himself that he was really making love with roshnani though he took special pains to make sure those partners never noticed thinking of what he did as a duty helped him get through it he suspected that would have amused godarz the duty done though he went back to spending most of his nights with roshnani most of the times he summoned other women were at her urging some principal wives he knew would have grown arrogant if shown such favor roshnani did her best to act as if she were just one of many that only inclined abivard to favor her more one morning after sleeping alonehe had been drinking wine with frada and some of his older half brothers and came to bed too drunk to be much interested in female companionshiphe woke with a headache so splitting he didnt even feel like sitting up still flat on his belly he reached down and blindly groped for his sandals all he managed to do though was push them farther under the bed beyond the reach of his sweeping arm if i have to call a servant to bend down to get my shoes everyone will know how bad i feel he said aloud just hearing his own voice hurt too but even hung over abivard was dutiful he got out of bedactually he came close to falling out of bedand pulled out first one sandal then the other suffused in a warm glow of virtue that almost masked his crapulence he was about to don the captured footgear when his bloodshot gaze fell on something else under the bed something he didnt remember seeing there beforenot that he spent a lot of time looking under the bed a small darkgray rectangular tablet before he thought much about what he was doing his hand snaked out and seized the tablet his eyebrows rose as he pulled it out to where he could get a good look at it it was heavier than he had expected has to be lead he said the upper side of the tablet was blank and smooth but his fingers had felt marks on the thing so he turned it over sure enough the other side had words cut into the soft metal perhaps with an iron needle they were at the moment upside down abivard turned it over the words became clear as he read them his blood ran cold may this tablet and the image i make bind abivard to me in cords of love may he waste away from wanting me may desire cling to him like a leech from the swamps if he wants me not may he burn with such pain that he would wish for the void but if he should die of desire for me let him never look on the face of the god so may it be moving as if in a bad dream abivard broke the curse tablet in two and spat on the pieces now his heart pounded as hard as his head he had heard of women using magic to bind a man to them but he had never imagined such a thing happening in the womens quarters of vek rud stronghold who he whispered roshnani he couldnt believe thatbut if she had ensorceled him he wouldnt believe it would he did she make him so happy because she had magically compelled him to fall in love with her it was possible with cold rationality he recognized that he wondered how he would ever trust another woman if it proved to be so but he also knew it didnt have to be so not when he had had every one of his wives out of the womens quarters and into his bedchamber in the recent past he started to call for burzoe but then shook his head he did not want even his mother to know of the curse tablet if she let slip an unfortunate word as even the wisest person man or woman might do chaos would rule the womens quarters with everyone suspecting everyone else if he could find any way to prevent that he would whistling tunelessly between his teeth he tossed the broken pieces of the tablet onto the downfilled mattress when he had thrown on a caftan and buckled the sandals whose escape under the bed had led him to find the tablet he put on his belt and stuck the two chunks of lead in one of the pouches that hung from it he was out the door and walking down the hall before he realized he had stopped noticing his headache amazing what fear will do he thought it was not a hangover cure he hoped to use again any time soon the normally savory cooking smells wafting through the living quarters only made his stomach churn terror hadnt cured him after all he hurried out into the courtyard and then down into the village that lay below the stronghold on its knob he knocked at the door of tanshar the fortuneteller the old man was as close to being a proper wizard as anyone in the domainand that thought made abivard wonder if tanshar had prepared the curse tablet and whatever image went with it but he could more easily imagine the sky turning brown and the land blue than tanshar involving himself in something like this tanshar awkwardly held a crust of bread and a cup of wine in one hand to free the other so he could open the door his eyes one clouded the other clear widened in surprise when he saw who had disturbed his breakfast lord abivard he exclaimed come in of course you honor my home but what brings you to me so early in the day tanshar made it sound more like curiosity than reproach abivard waited till the old man had closed and barred the door behind him before he fished out the broken pieces of the tablet and held them in the palm of his hand so tanshar could see them i found this curse under my bed when i arose this morning he said in a flat voice the fortuneteller reached for them may i he asked at abivards nod he took the two flat pieces of lead put them together and held them out at arms length so he could read them when he was done muttering the words to himself he clicked his tongue between his teeth several times am i to infer one of your wives left it there lord i cant see anyone else wanting to can you it seems unlikely tanshar admitted what would you now of me lord have you felt yourself under the influence of this spell love magic like that of the battlefield is often chancy because passion reduces the effectiveness of sorcery i honestly dont know whether the magic has hold of me or not abivard said i wont be able to decide that until i learn who put the tablet there if it was roshnani he didnt know what he would do no he did know but didnt want to think about it he forced himself to steadiness i know youre a scryer can you see who did set that thing under my bed lord i believe i could but is that truly what youd have of me tanshar asked if i were to look into your bedchamber for the moment in which the tablet was placed there i would likely find you and the woman who left it in ah an intimate moment is that your desire no abivard said at once he was wary of his own privacy and even more wary of that of the denizens of the womens quarters he scowled as he thought then raised a finger the tablet speaks of an image can you scry out where that image is hidden that will help tell me who made it the domain is lucky to have a man of your wit at its head the fortuneteller said i shall do as you command he set the pieces of the curse tablet down on a stool then went off into the back room of the little house he returned a moment later with a water jug and a small glittering bowl of almost transparent black obsidian he put the bowl on top of the two pieces of lead and poured it half full of water we must wait until the water grows altogether still he told abivard then without roiling its surface with our breath we shall look into it together and unless the god should will otherwise we shall see what you seek to learn when the time comes remember to think on the image whose whereabouts youd find as you say abivard waited as patiently as he could he glanced down into the bowl the water there looked calm to him but scrying was not his business tanshar did not presume to tell him how to run the domain so he would not joggle the fortunetellers elbow when tanshar was satisfied he said quietly lay your hand on the edge of the bowlgently mind so as to stir the water as little as you mayand set your thoughts on the god and the four and what you would learn abivard wondered how he was supposed to keep two different sets of thoughts in his head he did his best the obsidian was glassy smooth under his fingertips but his touch disturbed the glassy smoothness of the water in the bowl he glanced over at tanshar the fortuneteller nodded back this evidently was expected when the water settled to stillness again it showed not the reflection of the ceiling or of abivard and tanshar peering down into it but a little doll of wool and clay almost hidden in shadows four strings were wrapped around it at head neck heart and loins each was made of four threads of different colors that is a perversion of the reverence due the four tanshars voice was still low but full of anger abivard hissed in frustration he could see the image yes but hardly anything else so he had no idea where in the strongholdif it was in the strongholdit rested but the thought itself was enough to give him a wider view he saw the image lay enshadowed because it rested behind a chest of drawers in a chamber he recognized as roshnanis he jerked his hand away from the bowl as if it burned his fingers instantly the scrying picture vanished from the water which now gave back the reflections it should have his own face he saw without surprise was twisted into a grimace of anguish the news is bad tanshar asked the news could not be worse abivard answered to think that what he had imagined to be joy was just sorcery he still could not believe roshnani capable of defiling him so but what else was he to think there lay the doll in her room of the womens quarters who else would have hidden it so when he said that aloud tanshar answered would you not sooner learn than guess the bowl and the water still await your view if that be your will almost abivard said no seeing roshnani conceal the magic image he thought would cost him more pain than he could bear but he had borne a great deal of pain lately so down deep he knew that was only cowardice talking that is my will he said harshly let the thing be certain wait once more for the water to settle tanshar said abivard waited in grim silence the fortuneteller nodded at last abivard brought his hand to the bowl again then had to wait for the water to grow calm after his touch this time he expected to have to wait before a picture formed when it did it showed roshnanis chamber once more and roshnani herself sitting on a stool close by the chest behind which hid the image intended to bind abivard in the ties of sorcerously induced love she was bent over some embroidery her pleasant face intent on the delicate needlework abivards glance flicked over to tanshar the fortunetellers eyes were closed he had the delicacy not to gaze upon his dihqans woman at the moment abivard did not care about that he peered down into the quiet water waiting for roshnani to get up from the stool and conceal the image she looked up from the needlework and rose abivard forced himself to absolute stillness lest he disturb the scrying medium he stared at the simulacrum of his wife wondering how far into the past tanshars magic reached whenever it was roshnani did not go over to the chest though it was but a couple of paces away instead she smilingly greeted another woman who walked into the chamber the newcomer pointed to the embroidery and said something to abivard of course her lips moved silently whatever her words were they pleased roshnani for her smile got wider the other woman spoke again roshnani picked up the embroidery from the stool and sat back down she started to work again perhaps demonstrating the stitch she had been using the other woman watched intently for a little whileabivard wasnt sure time ran at the same rate in the scrying bowl as in the real worldthen leaned back against the chest of drawers there her hand snaked to the rear edge of the chest opened for an instant and then was back at her side intent on the needlework roshnani never noticed by the god abivard said softly he took his hand away from the polished obsidian bowl the scrying picture vanished as if it had never been tanshar felt the motion of withdrawal and opened his eyes lord have you that which you require he asked i do abivard opened the pouch at his belt took out five silver arkets and pressed them into tanshars hand the fortuneteller tried to protest but abivard overrode him for some things i would not spend silver so not after the way the famous murghab robbed the domain in the name of the king of kings but for this i reckon the price small believe me are you then ensorceled lord tanshar asked if it be so i dont know if i am strong enough to free you from such a perverse enchantment but abivard laughed and said no i find i am not he wondered why maybe his naturally conceived passion had been too strong for the artificial one to overcome tanshar had said love magic was a chancy business im pleased to hear it the fortuneteller said im even more pleased to say it abivard bowed to tanshar then took the broken pieces of the lead tablet and headed up the dusty road to the stronghold he stopped and stooped every few paces until he had picked up three black pebbles roshnani looked up from her embroidery when abivard stepped into the doorway the smile she gave him reminded him of the one he had seen in the scrying bowl not long before what brings you here at this hour of the day she asked her smile grew mischievous as she thought of the obvious answer then faded when she got a better look at his face not that surely no not that abivard turned to the serving woman who hovered behind him fetch my lady mother and all my wives to this chamber at once i know the hour is yet early but i will have no excuses tell them as much just as you say lord the serving woman bobbed her head and hurried away she knew something was wrong but not what the same held for roshnani what is it husband of mine she asked now her voice held worry just wait abivard answered ill tell the tale once for everyone roshnanis chamber quickly grew crowded burzoe looked a question at her son as she came in but he said nothing to her either some of his wives grumbled at being so abruptly summoned from whatever they were doing others because they had had no chance to gown themselves and apply their cosmetics most though simply sounded curious a couple of abivards half sisters peered in from the corridor also wondering what was going on abivard brought the flat of his hand down onto the chest of drawers the bang cut through the womens chatter and brought all eyes to him he pulled out the two pieces of the curse tablet held them high so everyone could see them quietly he asked do you know what this is utter silence answered him but the womens eyes spoke for them yes they knew abivard dropped the pieces of lead onto the chest they did not ring sweetly when they hit as silver would have the sound was flat sullen he pushed a corner of the chest of drawers away from the wall and bent down to scoop up the image that went with the tablet it was no longer than the last two joints of his middle finger easy to conceal in the palm of a hand he held it up too someonehe didnt see whogasped abivard removed the four cords that bound the image then he let it fall to the top of the chest it broke in pieces he took out one of the black pebbles he dropped it not onto the chest but onto the floor the forms here had to be observed precisely in a voice with no expression whatever in it he said ardini i divorce you a sigh ran through the women like wind through the branches of an almond grove ardini jerked as if he had stuck a sword in her me she screeched i didnt do anything this is roshnanis room not mine if anyones been in your bedchamber enough to try bewitching you lord shes the one not me you never want the rest of us women whove been here for years its not right its not natural in a scrying bowl i saw you hide the image here he said and dropped the second pebble ardini i divorce you no it wasnt me it was somebody else by the god i swear it she dont make your troubles in the next world worse by swearing a false oath formal and emotionless as a soldier making his report abivard told exactly what he had seen in the still water the women sighed again all but ardini roshnani said yes i remember that day i was working on a bird with the bronzebrown thread no its a lie i didnt do it ardinis head twisted back and forth like so many people she had figured out what her schemes success would bring but she had never stopped to think what would happen if she failed her voice sank to a whisper i didnt mean any harm it might even have been true abivard dropped the third pebble ardini i divorce you it was done with the fall of the third pebble with the third repetition before witnesses of the formula of divorce his marriage to her was dissolved ardini began to wail abivard clenched his jaw tight casting loose even a wife who had betrayed him was wrenchingly hard so far as he knew godarz had never had to divorce one of his women and so had left him no good advice on how to do it he didnt think there could be any easy way please ardini cried she stood alone all the other women had invisibly contrived to take a step away from her i would be within my rights if i sent you forth from the womens quarters from this stronghold from this domain naked and barefoot abivard said i will not do that take what you wear take from your chamber whatever you can carry in your two hands and be gone from here the god grant we never see each other again burzoe said if you let her go back into her chamber son send someone with her to make sure she tries no more magic against you yes that would be wise wouldnt it abivard bowed to his mother would you please do that for me burzoe nodded ardini began screaming curses tears ran down her face cutting through paint like streams of rainwater over dusty ground you cast me out at your peril she cried i keep you here at my peril abivard answered go now and take what you would or i will send you away as law and custom allow he thought that would shut ardini up and it did she cared more for herself than anything else still weeping she left roshnanis room burzoe with her to keep her from working mischief roshnani waited until the other wives several of them loudly proclaiming undying loyalty to abivard had left her chamber while they abivards half sisters and the serving women exclaimed in the hallway over the scandal she told him husband i thank you for not thinking i set that image when you saw it i know something of scrying sometimes i can even make it work myself can you abivard said interested so much he still did not know about this young woman who had become his wife yes though far from always in any case i know you would first have looked to find the image when you saw it behind that chest it would have been easy for you to look no farther and cast me out with the three black pebbles abivard did not tell her how close he had come to doing just that she thought better of him because he hadnt and that was what he wanted he said tansharthe town fortuneteller and scryersaid love magic was never sure to work because it depended on passion and my passion seems to have turned long since away from ardini roshnani cast down her eyes at that but her face glowed im very glad it has she said quietly so am i abivard sighed and by now i think ardini has had enough time to gather whatever she would so i shall have the delightful task of escorting her out of the womens quarters and the stronghold and ordering her out of the domain by the god i wish she could have been content here beware lest she try to stab you or some such roshnani said she wouldnt abivard stopped he would never have done anything so foolish but ardini might indeed think that with her life ruined she had nothing to lose ill be careful he promised roshnani the women parted before him as he strode down the hall to ardinis chamber she looked up from the bulging knapsack she had filled she wasnt crying any more such hatred filled her face that abivard almost made a sign to avert the evil eye he covered his brief alarm with brusqueness jerking a thumb toward the doorway that led out of the womens quarters muttering under her breath ardini walked up the hall toward the bedchamber where she had left the lead tablet abivard thanked the god it was the last time she would ever go there he did his best not to listen to whatever she was saying for fear he would have to take formal notice of it all the same he watched her while he relocked the door letting his fingers do the work without help from his eyes he wanted to make sure she placed no other curses in the chamber she stood in the middle of the room for a moment then spat at the bed youre not a quarter the man your father was she hissed that stung he wanted to hit her only the thought that she was deliberately baiting him made him hold backhe didnt care to do anything she wanted him to as mildly as he could he answered praising my father will not gain you my forgiveness the deliberate misunderstanding made ardini snarl even so it didnt satisfy abivard when he flung open the outer door to the bedchamber he let it slam against the wall with a loud crash a servant in the hallway spun round in startlement lord you frightened me there he said smiling you he broke off when he saw ardini beside abivard that was a bigger surprise and one that could not be met with a few glib words is all well lord no abivard said i have pronounced divorcement against this woman for she used sorcery to try to bind me to her i cast her forth from the womens quarters from the stronghold from the domain the servant stared he nodded jerkily then retreated almost at a dead run hell have gossip to drink wine on for the next fortnight abivard thought he turned to ardini come along you out to the doorway of the living quarters they went and out through the courtyard people stopped and gaped then tried to pretend they had done no such thing at the gateway ardini fell to her knees and clasped abivard around the thighs let me stay she wailed by the god i swear to love you forever he shook his head and freed himself as gently as he could you are already forsworn thanks to your magic he said get up go may you find a life of peace somewhere far from here she hissed a filthy curse at him as she rose then stalked off down the steeply sloping road he made a mental note to send word to all the villages in the domain that she had been divorced and expelled he wondered where she would go back to her familys stronghold he supposed he realized he did not even know who her father was have to ask my mother he thought what burzoe did not know about the dihqans women wasnt worth knowing abivard sighed wondering how much trouble the lying tales ardini was sure to tell would cause him he resolved to save the tablet the fragments of the image and the multicolored cords that had been tied around it to prove he had indeed been sorcerously beset then he sighed again nothing ever seemed simple he wished for once it was to the dihqan abivard his loving sister denak sends greetings abivard smiled as he began the latest letter from denak though he read it with his own voice he could hear hers too and see the way her face would screw up in concentration as she dipped pen into jar of ink before committing words to parchment the letter went on i rejoice that you escaped the wicked magic aimed your way and grieve for the scandal to your womens quarters when you wrote of it to me i confess i guessed ardinis name before i saw it on the parchment i know she expected to be named your principal wifethough as far as i know she had no reason save her pride and ambition for that expectationand did not take well to the affection that flowered between you and roshnani even in the brief time i was there after your wedding abivard nodded slowly to himself ardini was young and lovely and as denak had said ambitious she had thought that was plenty of reason for him to make her his chief wife unfortunately for her he had had other things in mind i am well and entrusted with ever greater management of this domains affairs denak wrote pradtak says he reckons me as useful as a videssian steward and by the work he gives me i believe it yet our lady mother could do as much even without the advantage of her letters parni one of the women in the quarters is with child i hope i may soon be as well i hope you are too sister of mine abivard murmured indignation grew in himhow could pradtak prefer this parni whoever she was to denak abivard laughed at himself knowing he was being foolish starting a child was as much a matter of luck as anything else roshnani for instance was not pregnant either though not from lack of enthusiastic effort on his part all the same he worried if parni gave pradtak a son presumably his first since becoming dihqan she was liable to rise in his estimation and denak to fall that would not be good he read on my lord husband continues to recover from the bones he broke this summer he no longer wears his arm in a sling and can use it for most things though it still lacks the strength of the other he walks now with but a single stick and can make several paces at a time without any aid whatever he is also eager to return to horseback he is in the habit of complaining how much he misses his games of mallet and ball even if without them he would never have been hurt meanwhile denak wrote aside from the pleasures of the womens quarters he consoles himself with some scheme or other that he has not yet seen fit to impart to meor to anyone for if he had word of it would surely have reached me through the serving women or his other wives as i daresay you will have seen for yourself the womens quarters hear gossip sometimes even before it is spoken isnt that the truth abivard said aloud he wondered what pradtak was up to that even his principal wife couldnt know something foolish was his guess if it hadnt been pradtak would have let denak in on it abivard hid nothing from roshnani how could he if she was to give him all her aid in administering vek rud domain maybe pradtak didnt see things that way maybe pradtak really was a fool denak finished i look forward to your next letter the god grant it may hold better news than khamorth raiders and a wife who could not be trusted every time i see your familiar hand i return to the stronghold where i grew up i am well enough here but the place and its people are not those i knew so long and so well i rely on you to keep them green in my heart remember always your loving sister down in the village a carpenter was making abivard a frame of pigeonholes twenty by twenty so it would have in all four hundred openings after he had stored that many letters from denak he supposed he could have the man turn out another frame he rolled up the letter retied it with the ribbon that had held it closed and went off to set it in the drawer that served for such things until the pigeonhole frame was done no sooner had he taken care of that than a shout from the wall brought him out of the living quarters in a hurry a band of riders off in the distance making for the flocks northwest of us he sprinted for the stables so did every other warrior who had heard the lookouts cry he had taken to leaving his helmet and shield there no time for more armor not now he clapped the helm on his head snatched up his lance and hurried for the stall where stable boys were saddling his horse as soon as they had cinched the last strap tight he set a foot in the stirrup and swung up into the saddle in the next stall over frada mounted at almost the same instant abivard grinned at him and said we have it easy from what father used to say his grandsire remembered the days before we learned from the nomads to use stirrups howd greatgrandfather stay on his horse then frada asked not very well is my guess abivard looked round the stables more and more men were horsed enough to make bandits or nomads or whoever the riders proved to be think twice about running off his sheep and cattle he raised his voice to cut through the din lets go get back whats ours the shout will be godarz godarz the makuraners yelled loud enough to make his head ring he used the pressure of his knees and the reins to urge his gelding out of the stall out of the stable and out of the stronghold going down the knob atop which sat vek rud domain he had to keep the pace slow lest his horse stumble on the slope but when he got to the flatlands he urged the animal ahead at a trot he could kick up into a gallop whenever he found the need behind him someone shouted there they are the cursed carrion eaters there they were indeed not far from the vek rud river cutting out half a flock of sheep theyre khamorthware archery abivard called as he got close enough to recognize the robbers he wondered what had happened to the shepherd and the men guarding the flock with him nothing good he feared godaaarz the war cry rang out again this time the khamorth heard it all at once they stopped being thieves and turned back into warriors to abivard their moves had an eerie familiarity after a moment he realized they were fighting like the band that had attacked the wedding party on the way back from nalgis crag domain instead of making him afraid that sparked a sudden burst of confidence we beat the plainsmen once before he yelled we can beat them again only when the words had passed his lips did he remember that the nomads had beaten his countrymen too and far more disastrously than his retainers had hurt them the horsemen who galloped alongside him seemed to have forgotten that too they screamed like men possessed by demons he had a decent number of archers with him today too he wouldnt have to come to close quarters to hurt the khamorth the nomads started shooting at very long range abivard managed a scornfilled laugh when an arrow kicked up dust a few yards away from his horses hooves they think they can frighten us off with their bows he said will we let them no his men cried bowstrings thrummed to either side of him one nomads steppe pony slewed sideways and crashed to the ground the makuraners shouts redoubled then a shriek of pain cut through the war cries just to abivards left a man slid off his galloping horse he hit the ground limp as a sack of meal and did not move again now the plainsmen yelled in triumph with a deliberate effort of will abivard made himself not think about that the khamorth ahead grew from dots to dolls to men in what felt like a single heartbeat he picked out a nomad couched his lance and bored in for the kill the khamorth did not stick around to be stuck in a fine bit of horsemanship he made his animal wheel through a turn tighter than any abivard would have imagined possible as he galloped away he shot back over his shoulder abivard flung up his shield the arrow ticked off its bronzefaced rim and tumbled away harmlessly he knew a moments relief but only a moments the khamorth shot again and again he was not the finest archer the god had ever made and shooting from a pounding horse at a moving target was anything but easy anyhow on the other hand though abivards horse was faster than his which meant the range kept shortening aii fire kissed the edge of abivards right leg he looked down and saw he was bleeding the shaft wasnt stuck in his leg it had sliced his outer calf and flown on had he been wearing the lamellar armor the smiths were just now finishing he might have escaped unwounded no such luck though seeing he was about to be ridden down the khamorth drew his shamshir and slashed at abivards lance in the hope of chopping off its head that did the nomad no good the lancehead was joined to the shaft by a long iron ferrule abivard felt the blow in his shoulder but pressed on regardless at the last moment the plainsman hacked at the lancehead again he turned it enough to keep it from his own flesh but it drove deep into the barrel of his horse appalled abivard yanked it back the horse screamed louder and more piercinglyand with better reasonthan ardini ever had the khamorth snarled a curse his face twisted in a grimace of hate would stay in abivards memory forever unkempt beard with threads of gray running through it wide mouth shouting something perhaps a quarter comprehensibletwo front teeth missing a third blackbeaky nose with a scar on the bridge redtracked eyes lines on the forehead accented by groundin smoke the two men were close enough together that abivard found himself trapped in the reek of ancient stale sweat and sour milk that hovered round the plainsman like a stinking cloud the steppe pony galloped wildly for perhaps a hundred yards blood splashing the dry dusty ground from the wound abivard had made then like a waterlogged ship at last slipping beneath the waves it went down slowly and gently enough for its rider to slip off and try to run the plainsman was slow and clumsyhis boots were not made for hard use on the ground he had hung onto his bow he had just wheeled around and was reaching for an arrow when abivards lance took him in the middle of the chest the nomad grunted the cry his horse let out had been much worse a new stench joined the rest as the fellow folded up on himself abivard jerked the lance free he had to twist the head to clear it it grated against the khamorths ribs as it came out on the shaft the plainsmans blood mingled with that of his horse the new stains almost completely covered the older marks now browned where abivard had first blooded the lance a few weeks before as in that first clash he found that when he was engaged he could pay no attention to how the fight as a whole was going when he looked around to get his bearings he saw that most of the khamorth had broken away and were galloping north for all they were worth abivard and his men pounded after the nomads the steppe ponies hooves drummed on the timbers of the new bridge that spanned the vek rud three or four nomads reined in on the far side of the river and waited with nocked arrows for the makuraners to try to force a passage hold abivard flung up his hand shooting down the bridge at men and horses who had to come straight toward them the khamorth could have taken a fearful toll maybe even turned defeat into triumph but they were running away frada protested theyre not running now abivard said take a good look at them brother what do they want us to do if you were a khamorth chieftain on the other side of that river what would you hope those stupid makuraners on your tail would do frada was also godarzs son confront him with an idea and he would worry it like a dog shaking a rat i expect id hope they threw themselves at me he said i expect the same thing abivard answered thats why were going to stay right here until the plainsmen ride away then he scowled but saw no help for it then im going to burn that bridge frada stared at him but its stood since our greatgrandfathers day maybe longer i know losing it will cost us commerce too but with the khamorth loose in the realm if i leave it whole i might as well paint rob me in big letters on the outside of the stronghold wall abivards laugh rang bitter see how the great tribute smerdis king of kings paid to the khamorth is keeping them on their own side of the degird aye that thought had already crossed my mind how much did the famous murghab squeeze from us eightyfive hundred mortal arkets abivard answered years of patient saving gone in a day and for what for the nomads to fatten their coffers at the same time as they batten on our lands frada pointed back to the downed ponies and plainsmen dotting the plain to the south they paid a price too they should abivard said they were trying to take whats ours but we paid our heavy price at smerdis command and got nothing in return for it smerdis messenger said sharbaraz renounced the throne because he didnt have the experience he needed to rule if this is what experience bought us then i wouldnt mind a raw hand on the reins by the god the farther he went there the softer his voice got he realized he was speaking treason or at least lese majesty but frada nodded vigorously how could we do worse instead of cheering abivard that made him thoughtful the hurtful part is we likely could do worse every tribe on the steppe swarming down over the degird for instance to try to take this land out of the realm forever that was everyones worst nightmare after peroz king of kings fell the proud lion banner crashing into the trenchthat dreadful image would stay with abivard if he lived to be a hundred maybe we could at that frada said but the way things are is plenty bad enough these little fights will drain us of men too yes abivard said along with the plainsmen three of his own followers were down one lying still the other two thrashing and crying their pain to the unheeding sky maybe theyll heal he thought and then yes but maybe they wont he made a fist and brought it down on his thigh you know brother of mine i wonder how bad things are elsewhere in the realm what would okhos say for instance if i wrote him and asked does he have his letters frada said i dont know abivard admitted he brightened roshnani can tell me come to that shes been after me to teach her to read and write i think my getting letters from denak showed her i didnt mind women learning such things are you teaching her frada sounded as if abivard had been talking not about letters but of some exotic not quite reputable vice abivard nodded anyhow yes and she seems to have the head for it father would have done the same im certain he let denak learn after all so he did frada said thoughtfully he too nodded even more than was true for abivard he used what godarz would have done as a touchstone for right behavior seeing that their foes would not obligingly impale themselves the khamorth rode north the makuraners moved over the field finishing off wounded khamorth capturing steppe ponies and doing their best to round up the scattered flock that done and the wounded men hastily bandaged and splinted and tied onto horses they headed back toward the stronghold the skirmish with the plainsmen was by every conventional sense of the word a victory but it had cost abivard at least one man and maybe as many as three and he doubted it had done anything to keep the khamorth from raiding his lands again he let his men cheer but he didnt feel victorious aye my brother has his letters or he learned them at any rate roshnani said how much use he has given them since the tutor left the stronghold i could not say only one way to find out abivard said ill write him and see what sort of answer i get just to be on the safe side though ill have my rider memorize the message too to make sure its understood and ill write to pradtak as well i know he reads for denak remarked he was surprised to find out she could do likewise will you write the letters here in your bedchamber roshnani said i want to watch you shape each word and see if i can figure out what it says i know i have pen and ink here lets see if i can find a couple of scraps of parchment too abivard kept a pot of ink and a reed pen in a drawer in a little chest by the bed along with knives a few coins little strips of leather and other oddments he found himself rummaging through that drawer at least once a day you never could tell when some piece of what looked like junk would come in handy he grunted in satisfaction when he came across a sheet of parchment as big as his hand he used one of the knives to cut it neatly in half each of the two pieces he made was plenty big enough for the notes he wanted to send he pulled the stopper from the ink pot and set it on the bedside chest he put the first scrap of parchment on top of the chest too then inked his pen leaned forward and began to write roshnani sat beside him on the bed so close that her breast brushed against his side he ignored the pleasant distraction as best he could plenty of time for sport later he told himself sternly business now because he was not sure how well okhos read and because roshnani was just learning letters herself he took special pains to make his writing neater than the scrawl he usually turned out okhos roshnani exclaimed thats my brothers name you just wrote a moment later she added and theres yours she almost bounced with excitement youre right both times he said slipping his free arm around her waist she leaned even closer the scent of her hair filled his nostrils he needed all his will to keep his mind on the letter when he was done he waited for the ink to dry then handed it to her can you read it she did one word at a time more slowly than he had written it when at last she had finished she was sweating with effort but proud i understood it all she said you want to know how much smerdis took from okhos to pay off the khamorth and how badly theyve raided his domain since thats exactly right youre doing very well abivard said im proud of you to show how proud he was he put both arms around her and kissed her whether by chance or by designwhose he wondered latershe overbalanced and lay back on the bed the letter to pradtak got written rather later than he had planned roshnani read that one aloud too abivard paid less attention to her reading than he might have neither of them had bothered dressing again and this afternoon he was thinking about a second round roshnani though concentrated on what she was doing despite being bare she said except for the names you used just the same words in this letter as in the one to okhos why did you do that hmm he said roshnani let out an irritated sniff and repeated herself he thought about it for a moment then answered writings not the easiest thing in the world for me either if the same words would serve me twice i dont have to trouble myself thinking up new ones the second time around she considered that in her usual deliberate way fair enough i suppose she said at last okhos and pradtak arent likely to compare letters and discover you havent been perfectly original original abivard rolled his eyes if id known youd turn critic when i taught you your letters i might not have done it she snorted he said and i know something else thats just as good the second time as the first even if done just the same way roshnani still cast down her eyes as she had the day she first came to vek rud stronghold but now more in play than in earnest whatever might that be she asked as if they were not naked together on the big bed eventually the letters were sealed and dispatched okhos reply came back in a bit more than a week to the dihqan abivard the dihqan okhos his brotherinlaw sends greetings abivard read first with frada peering over his shoulder and then later in the bedchamber with roshnani to roshnani he added see he writes well enough after all okhos hand was square and careful perhaps not practiced but clear enough go on what does he say roshnani asked yes my brotherinlaw we have also been beset both by smerdis men and the nomads we lost five thousand arkets to the one and sheep and cattle horses and men to the other we have hurt the nomads too but what good does it do to bat away one grain of sand when the wind lifts up the whole desert we go on fighting as best we can the god give you victory in your war too is that all roshnani asked when he paused to take a breath no theres one thing more he said say to my sister who is your wife that her brother thinks of her often roshnani smiled i shall write him a letter in return dont you think that will surprise him im sure it will abivard said he wondered whether okhos would be merely surprised or scandalized to boot well if he was scandalized that would be his own hard luck it wasnt as if abivard let his women wander around out of their quarters like a videssian or allowed them something else that truly merited condemnation he had to wait longer for his reply from pradtak not only did his letter to denaks husband have a longer journey than the one to okhos but pradtak also took his time before replying most of a month went by before a rider from nalgis crag domain rode up to the stronghold abivard tipped the man half an arket for his travels he might not have done so before the battle on the steppes but any trip by a lone man was dangerous these days abivard knew that only too welltravel by large armed bands wasnt necessarily safe either he opened the leather message tube and unrolled the parchment on which pradtak had written his reply after the polite formula of greeting his brotherinlaws letter was but one sentence long i am loyal in all ways to smerdis king of kings well who ever said you werent abivard asked aloud as if pradtak were there to answer him lord the rider asked never mind abivard scratched his head wondering why on earth his brotherinlaw thought he suspected him now this is more like it abivard said to the tiredlooking man who swung down off his horse in the courtyard to vek rud stronghold no letter at all from nalgis crag domain for almost a month and now two in the space of a week glad youre pleased lord the messenger said instead of a caftan he wore leather trousers and a sheepskin jacket winter hadnt started but the air said it was coming the man went on this one is from the lady your sister thats what the serving woman who gave it to me said anyhow ive not read it myself for it was sealed before it ever went into my tube here was it abivard said denak hadnt bothered with such things before he gave the rider a silver arket you deserve special thanks for getting it here to me safe then for you couldnt have told me what it said had anything happened to it youre kind to me lord but if anything had happened to that letter likely something worse would have happened to me if you know what i mean the messenger from nalgis crag domain sketched a salute then rode out of the stronghold to start his journey home the seal denak had used was pradtaks a mounted lancer hunting a boar abivard broke it with his thumbnail curious to find out what his sister hadnt wanted anyone to see as usual he read her words aloud to the dihqan abivard his loving sister denak sends greetings her next sentence brought him up short it were wiser if you read what follows away from anyone who might overhear i wonder what thats in aid of he muttered but denak had always struck him as having good sense so he rolled up the parchment and carried it into the dihqans bedchamber no one to listen to me here he thought then he glanced through the grillwork opening in the door that led to the womens quarters he saw no one satisfied he unrolled the letter and began to read again denak wrote pradtak my husband recently walled off the chamber next to mine which is close by the entrance to the womens quarters here and had a separate doorway made for it alone i wondered what his purpose was but he spoke evasively when i asked him this i must confess irked me no little abivard did not blame his sister for her pique the likeliest explanation he could find for pradtaks behavior was installing another woman in the special room though why he wouldnt simply admit her to the womens quarters baffled abivard he read on my temper vanished but my curiosity grew when after i heard through the wall that the chamber was inhabited i also heard it was inhabited by a man pradtak i assure you is not inclined to seek his pleasures in that direction well what is he doing then putting a man into the womens quarters even if the fellow is walled away from his wives abivard asked as if the letter would up and tell him and save him the trouble of reading further it didnt of course his eyes dropped back down to the parchment with my door closed i called quietly out my window denak wrote not certain if the masons had sealed away the one in the adjacent room i found they had not the man in there was more than willing to give me his name i now give it to you and you will understand my caution with this letter he is sharbaraz son of peroz and he claims rightful king of kings of makuran abivard stared at that for most of a minute before he read on if sharbaraz had renounced the throne of his own free will as smerdis king of kings claimed why mure him up in a secret cell like a criminal awaiting the headsmans chopper the only answer that came to him was stark in its simplicity smerdis lies denaks next sentence might have been an echo of that thought the first meal sharbaraz ate after word of his fathers overthrow reached mashiz must have had a sleeping potion sprinkled over it for when he awoke he found himself in a dark little room somewhere in the palace with a knife to his throat and a written renunciation of the throne before him not wishing to perish on the spot he signed it someone let out a tuneless whistle after a moment abivard realized it was himself he had wondered that a young man of whom his father had expected so much should tamely yield the rule to an elder of no particular accomplishment now he learned sharbaraz had not yielded tamely the letter went on smerdis sent sharbaraz here for safekeeping nalgis crag stronghold is without a doubt the strongest fortress in all makuran the usurper pays pradtak well to keep his rival beyond hope of escape or rescue you may not be surprised to learn i read your latest letter to my husband i grieve to hear how the khamorth ravage my homeland in spite of the great tribute smerdis handed over to them to stay north of the degird this tells me he whose fundament now befouls the throne has no notion of what the kingdom requires it told me the same thing abivard said as if denak were there to hear him he had almost finished the letter his sister wrote i do not think any army has a hope of rescuing sharbaraz from the outside but he may perhaps be spirited out of the fortress i shall bend every effort toward finding out how that might be done since the area in front of sharbarazs cell remains formally within the womens quarters and since i am trusted with affairs here i may be able to see for myself exactly how he is guarded be careful abivard whispered again as if denak stood close by i shall take every precaution i can think of denak wroteshe might be answering me abivard thought be circumspect when you reply to this letter pradtak has not formed the habit of reading what you write to me but any mistake here would mean disasterfor me for sharbaraz king of kings and i think for makuran may the god bless you and hold you in her arms abivard started to put the letter with the others hed had from denak but changed his mind almost at once some of his servitors could read and this was a note they must not see he hid it behind the wall hanging to whose frame godarz had glued the spare key to the womens quarters that done abivard paced round the bedchamber as if he were a lion in a cage what to do echoed and reechoed in his mind like the beat of a distant drum what to do suddenly he stood still as of this moment i owe smerdis miscalled king of kings no allegiance he declared as the realization crystallized within him he had sworn loyalty to smerdis on condition that makurans overlord had spoken truth about how he had come to power now that his words were shown to be lies they held no more power over abivard that however did not answer the question of what to do next even if all the dihqans and marzbans renounced smerdis suzerainty and marched on nalgis crag stronghold they would be hardpressed to take itand would surely cause sharbaraz to be killed to keep them from uniting behind him then he thought of tanshars prophecy a tower on a hill where honor was to be won and lost nalgis crag stronghold was indeed a tower on a hill and with the rightful king of kings penned up there plenty of honor waited to be won but how would it be lost as well that worried abivard the trouble with prophecy he thought as he read through denaks letter again was that what it foretold while true had a way of going unrecognized till it was past and could be seen as it were from behind he wouldnt know if this was what tanshar had predicted until after the honor was won and lost if it was even then he might not be sure i have to talk with someone about this he said he sensed he needed another set of wits to look at the problem denak had posed from a different angle he started to call frada but hesitated his brother was young and too liable not to keep a secret word of sharbarazs imprisonment getting out could doom perozs son as readily as an army invading nalgis crag domain for the thousandth time abivard wished he could hash things out with godarz but if his father were alive peroz would probably still live too with sharbaraz his accepted heir and smerdis a functionary whose ambition if he had had any before peroz died would be well concealed abivard snapped his fingers i am a fool he said this is an affair of the womens quarters so who would know better what to do about it than the women here he hesitated again before he went to burzoe and roshnani wondering if they could keep so great a matter to themselves womensquarter gossip was notorious all through makuran if a maidservant heard of this she would surely spread word through the whole stronghold but burzoe had been godarzs right hand for many years something she couldnt have done without holding secrets close and roshnani did not seem one to talk out of turn abivard nodded his mind made up he took the key and let himself into the womens quarters he would have summoned his mother and principal wife to the bedchamber but that struck him as more likely to alert others to something out of the ordinary roshnani was embroidering in her chamber much as she had been when ardini hid the magical image behind her chest of drawers she looked up from the work when abivard tapped lightly on the open door my husband she said smiling what brings you here in the middle of the day the smile got wider suggesting that she had her suspicions no not that abivard said smiling too that will have to wait for another time meanwhile wheres my lady mother somethings come up on which i need your thoughts and hers as well do you want to talk here roshnani asked at his nod she set aside the cloth on which she had been working ill fetch her i wont be but a moment she hurried down the hall she was as good as her word when she came back with burzoe abivard shut the door to roshnanis chamber his mother raised an eyebrow at that what sort of secret has such earthshaking importance she asked her tone doubting that any could despite the closed door abivard answered in what was little more than a whisper he summarized denaks letter in three or four quick sentences then finished what i want to do is find some way to rescue the rightful king of kings not only is smerdis forsworn but his rule brings makuran only more troubles burzoes eyes flicked to the door i owe you an apology son she said speaking as quietly as abivard had you were rightthis is a secret that must not spread will sharbaraz truly be better for makuran than smerdis is roshnani asked he could scarcely be worse abivard said but that was not an answer not really he added my father thought he would make an able successor to peroz and his judgment in such things was usually good thats so burzoe said godarz spoke well of sharbaraz several times in my hearing and we paid smerdis eightyfive hundred arkets at as near swords point as makes no difference and for what he said he would spend them to keep the nomads from crossing the degird and we see how well he kept that promise if denak can rescue sharbaraz i think she shouldand we must help all we can but can she rescue him abivard asked the two of you know more of the workings of a womens quarters than i could ever learn thats why i brought this to you it will depend on how pradtak has rearranged things to make a cell there burzoe answered my guess is that he will have installed a guarda man whether his or smerdisin front of sharbarazs cell and walled off part of the corridor to keep the lustful fellow from sporting among the women if denak can get to the corridor in front of the cell she may indeed accomplish something if not i know not what advice to give you matters become more difficult perhaps she can offer to serve sharbarazcook for him or something of that sort roshnani said he may be a prisoner but he is still of royal blood and smerdis you said is old what if he dies tomorrow most likely sharbaraz gets his crown backand he will remember one way or the other how pradtak treated him at nalgis crag stronghold a thought abivard agreed if pradtaks principal wife were to wait upon him sharbaraz might see his captivity as honorable or so denak could present the matter to pradtak at any rate you are not without wit child burzoe said to roshnani at which the younger woman blushed bright red pretending not to notice burzoe turned to abivard the scheme has some merit much depends on how tightly pradtak is used to controlling his womens quarters if no man save he is ever allowed to see his wives faces he will not grant this to denak if on the other hand he learned an easier way from his father urashtu our chance for success looks better worth a try anyway abivard bowed to his mother and his principal wife thank you for your wisdom whatever we do we have to keep it secret no word of this can get out or we are ruined before we begin roshnani and burzoe looked at each other abivard watched amusement pass between them and something elsesomething hidden in the way women had of hiding things from men it made him feel perhaps seven years old again in spite of his inches his strength and his thick black beard in a voice dry as the desert beyond the stronghold burzoe said see to it that you keep the secret as well as we you may count on it that no one in the womens quarters will learn from us the reason you came here today roshnani nodded women love to spill secrets that do not truly matterbut then so do men and men i think are more likely to betray those that do abivard hadnt thought about that he shrugged unsure if it was true or not then he opened the door and headed down the corridor that led out of the womens quarters behind him burzoes voice rose to a screech wretch of a daughterinlaw you bring embarrassment on us all when my son the dihqan notices how uneven the stitches of your embroidery are they are no such thing roshnani retorted just as hotly if youd taught abivard to recognize good work hed know it when he saw it the two women shouted even louder both at once so abivard couldnt understand a word they said he almost ran back to roshnanis chamber to break up the fight then he realized his principal wife and his mother were staging a quarrel based on something that would have given him a plausible reason for visiting them the womens quarters might buzz with gossip for days but it would be the right kind of gossip he wanted to bow back toward the women in admiration but that might have given away the game no one in the womens quarters came running to watch the fight no one as abivard saw affected to give it any special notice but no one paid heed to what she was supposed to be doing either misdirection abivard thought not concealment something worth remembering on the battlefield too he went back to his bedchamber locked the door that led into the womens quarters and put the key into one of the pouches he wore on his belt he flopped down onto the bed and thought hard i cant even write back and tell denak what to do not in so many words he muttered if pradtakif anyonehappens to set eyes on the letter everything goes up in smoke circumspection was not his strength by makuraner standards he was blunt and straightforward but godarz had always said a man should be able to put his hand to anything like a lot of good advice it sounded easier than it was liable to prove he thought awhile longer then took out pen and parchment and began to write a few careful words at a time to denak her loving brother the dihqan abivard sends greetings the news of which you write is as always fascinating and gives me much to think about abivard snorted when he reread that by the god nothing but truth there he exclaimed he bent to his work again without his noticing the tip of his tongue stuck out of one corner of his mouth as it had in boyhood days when a scribe first taught him his letters he went on if you can help your neighbor the god will surely smile upon you for your kindness perhaps he will look gladly on you if you make the approach to someone who did not know what abivard was talking about that he would refer back to the god abivard hoped denak would understand it meant pradtak he glowered at the parchment writing in code was hard work i am sure that because of the bad temper your neighbor has shown to those placed over her someone needs to keep an eye on her every minute perhaps you will be able to make friends with that woman or eunuchhowever pradtak sees fit to order his womens quartersand so have a chance to improve your neighbors nature he read that over denak should have no trouble following it most people who read it probably would not catch on but if it fell into pradtaks hands the game was up abivard chewed on his lower lip denak had said her husband was not in the habit of reading the letters he sent them pradtak certainly didnt read her answers or she would not have been able to write as frankly as she did but he was liable to say something like the gate guards tell me a letter came from your brother today show it to me why dont you how could she say no to keep her from having to abivard got out another sheet of parchment and wrote a cheery letter about doings at vek rud stronghold that said never a word about imprisoned royalty if pradtak wanted to know what was in abivards mindand keeping sharbaraz prisoner in nalgis crag domain was liable to make him anxious even if he hadnt been beforedenak could show him the image of an emptyheaded fellow full of chatter and not much else abivard sighed as he put both sheets into a leather travel tube life would have been simplerand perhaps more pleasantif he could have lived the life he wore like a mask in that second letter he sighed again if the god had wanted life to be simple he wouldnt have put makuran next to the khamorthor to videssos he murmured and set the stopper in the tube tanshar opened the door then blinked in surprise and bowed low lord you do me great honor by visiting my humble home he said stepping aside so abivard could come in as always the fortunetellers dwelling was astringently neatand almost bare of furnishings abivard took a few pistachios from the bowl tanshar proffered but held the shells in his hand rather than tossing them onto the rammed earth on the floor in some houses they would have been invisible here they would have seemed a profanation tanshar solved his dilemma by fetching in another smaller bowl as abivard dropped the shells into it the fortuneteller asked and how may i serve my lord the dihqan today abivard hesitated before beginning spreading the secret denak had passed to him made him nervous but if denak was to get sharbaraz free of nalgis crag stronghold she would probably need magical aid it stood a better chance of helping than an army at any rate or so abivard judged cautiously he said what i tell you must spread to no oneno one do you understand aye lord in a wintry way tanshar looked amused and to whom would i be likely to retail it to my numerous retainers he waved a hand as if to conjure up servitors from empty air and bare walls to the townsfolk in the market square that you might more easily believe but if i gossiped like any old wife who would trust me with his affairs mock if you like abivard said the matter is important enough that i must remind you say on lord tanshar said youve made me curious if nothing else even that worried abivard as he knew tanshar had ways of learning things not available to ordinary men but he said hear me then and judge for yourself he told tanshar what hed learned from denak the fortunetellers eyes widened both the good one and the one clouded by cataract the rightful king of kings he murmured truly lord i crave your pardon for care here is indeed of the essence you intend to free this man if it happens denak will have more to do with it than i abivard answered the irony of that struck him like a blow the men of makuran shut away their women to keep power in their own hands and now the fate of the realm would rest in the hands of a woman he shook his headnothing he could do about it but help his sister any way he could tanshar nodded aye that makes sense so it does your sisters husbanddid you say his name was pradtak would hardly give you the chance to storm his womens quarters with warriors now would he its not likely abivard said which won him a slow smile from tanshar he went on seems to me magic might manage more than men thats why ive come to you to see how you can help suppose i were to take you along with me on a visit to nalgis crag domain one of these days when would that be lord tanshar asked right now the time lies in the hands of the god abivard said much will depend on whatif anythingdenak can do from within but if that proves possible will you ride with me gladly lordusurping the throne is surely an act of wickedness tanshar said how i can help though i do not yet clearly see nor i abivard said i came here now so we could look together for the best way they talked quietly for the next couple of hours by the time abivard headed up to the stronghold again he had the beginnings of a plan winter was another invader from the pardrayan steppe though more regular in its incursions into makuran than the nomads it was hardly less to be feared snowstorms spread white over fields and plains herdsmen went out to tend their flocks in thick sheepskin coats that reached to their ankles some would freeze to death on bad nights anyhow abivard knew thatit happened every winter smoke rose black from the stronghold as if it had fallen in war makuran was not a land rich in timber the woodchoppers had traveled far to lay in enough to get through the season abivard asked the god for mild days and got another blizzard he did his best to shrug it off prayers over weather were hardly ever answered what he could not shrug off was that winter also slowed travel to a crawl he had sent his letter off to denak hoping the weather would hold long enough for him to get a quick reply it didnt he wanted to gnash his teeth whenever one clear day followed another he hoped it meant a lull long enough for a horseman to race from nalgis crag stronghold to vek rud domain whenever snow flew again afterward he told himself he should have known better the horseman from pradtaks domain reached vek rud stronghold a few days after the winter solstice in the middle of the worst storm of the year children had been making snowmen in the stronghold courtyard and in the streets of the town below the walls when the rider reached the gate so much white clung to his coat and fur cap that he looked like a snowman himself a snowman astride a snow horse abivard ordered the halffrozen horse seen to then put the rider in front of a blazing fire with a mug of hot spiced wine in his hand and a steaming bowl of mutton stew on a little round table beside him you were daft to travel abivard said but im glad you did wasnt so bad lord dihqan the man answered between avid swigs from the mug no then why are your teeth still chattering didnt say it was warm out there mind you the fellow answered but the serving woman who gave me the letter from the lady your sister said she wanted it to reach you as soon as might be so i thought id try the journey here you are lord dihqan with a flourish he presented a leather letter tube i thank you abivard set the tube down on the stone floor beside him and reached into his belt pouch for a couple of silver arkets with which to reward the rider then he took a pull at his own wine though he hadnt been on a horse in the snow the inside of the stronghold was chilly too youre generous lord dihqan the man from nalgis crag domain stowed the silver in a pouch of his own when he saw abivard was making no move to unstopper the tube he asked arent you going to read the letter now that its here alas i should not not here abivard had expected that question and trotted out the answer he had prepared were i to read it in another mans hearing it would be as if i exposed pradtaks wife to another mans sight with him generous enough to allow denak my sister to correspond with me i would not violate the privacy of his womens quarters ah the messenger respectfully lowered his head you observe the usages with great care and watch over my lords honor as if it were your own i try my best abivard fought hard to hold his face stiff here he and denak were plotting how to spirit a man out of pradtaks womens quarters and pradtaks man reckoned them paragons of makuraner virtue that was what he had hoped the fellow would do but he hadnt expected to be praised for it the man yawned your pardon lord he said i fear i am not yet ready to head back to nalgis crag stronghold at once im not surprised abivard answered neither is your horse rest here as long as you like well give you a room and a brazier and thick wool blankets and maybe a wench to warm me under them the messenger said if you find one willing of course abivard said im not in the habit of making the serving women here sleep with men not of their choosing hmm the rider looked as if he would grumble if he dared then he got to his feet in that case lord i shall have to see what i can do the kitchens are that way at abivards nod he swaggered off whatever his luck might prove he didnt lack for confidence abivard went in the other direction toward his own bedchamber as soon as he had barred the door behind him he undid the stopper and took out denaks letter it was sealed as the last one had been he used his thumbnail to break the wax unrolled the parchment and began to read even in the bedchamber he kept his voice to a whisper he wondered if one day thanks to all this secrecy he would be able to read without making any sound that might prove useful after the usual greetings denak wrote in the matter of sharbaraz i have done as you suggested much the same thought came to me before your latest letter in fact pradtak has not objected i do not know whether he thinks he is hedging his bets by letting me serve the rightful king of kings but if he does he is mistaken sharbaraz seems to me a man who forgets neither friend nor foe good abivard exclaimed as if his sister were in the room with him feeling foolish he returned to the letter though pradtak was willing to permit me to pass into the new hall that now holds sharbarazs cellso long as i come and go when no one save he is in the bedchamberthe guards who came here with sharbaraz have proved harder to persuade they are smerdis men not pradtaks and what the dihqan thinks matters little to them they would be abivard thought he had hoped smerdis would not have solidly loyal men behind himhe was after all a usurper but if he did have any men who valued him above all others standing watch on his rivals was the sensible place to put them too badhe would have made matters much simpler if only he had been dumber denak went on i have however used every tool to persuade themthey are three in all and watch in turn one day one evening one dead of nightthat their lives in nalgis crag stronghold will be happier if they let me do as pradtak thinks best abivard nodded vigorously his sister was clever a stronghold where everyone hated you where your bread was moldy and your wine more nearly vinegar could quickly come to seem like prison even to a guard i pray to the god that my efforts here will be crowned with success denak wrote even if she grant that prayer though i do not see how i can hope to flee the stronghold with sharbaraz if you have thoughts on that score do let me know of them i add by the way that you were wise to enclose the harmless sheet with the earlier letter you senti was able to show it to pradtak without his being any the wiser that more important words came also in the tube may your wisdom find a like way around this present difficulty abivard went to the window clouds scudded across the sky gray and ragged as freshly sheared wool when the weather clearsif the weather clearsi think i shall have to pay my brotherinlaw a visit he said who comes to nalgis crag stronghold the cry arose as abivard was still a couple of furlongs before the stronghold itself he gave his name then added your lord should be expecting me i wrote to say i was coming aye youre a welcome guest here lord abivard and as you say looked for the sentry answered whos the old man with you and whats his station well guest him properly as his rank warrants my physicians name is tanshar hell stay with me however it pleases you lord the sentry said but did you think we have no healers here in nalgis crag domain were not khamorth here by the god he sounded indignant tanshar has looked after me since i was a babe abivard spoke the lie with the ease of endless rehearsal on the road from vek rud stronghold i dont care to trust myself to anyone else the sentry yielded repeating however it pleases you of course come ahead the gate is open abivard urged his horse forward tanshar rode behind him on the narrow track up to the gateway situated as it was nalgis crag stronghold could afford to leave the gate open almost all the timea threatening army could not approach unobserved in fact a threatening army could hardly approach at all not for the first time abivard wished his own stronghold were as secure pradtak came out of the living quarters to greet him in the courtyard the dihqan of nalgis crag domain still walked with the help of a stick and was liable to limp for the rest of his life but he moved far more easily than he had on the day of denaks wedding fine to see you again my brotherinlaw he said advancing with his hand outstretched he looked from abivard to tanshar to the pair of packhorses the latter led i would have expected you to come with more men especially with the barbarians loose in the land we managed abivard said with a shrug i didnt care to detach many men from keeping the nomads off our flocks and qanats let me present to you my physician tanshar lord pradtak tanshar said politely bowing in the saddle pradtak nodded back then returned his attention to his social equal asking abivard what ails you that you need to bring a physician with you as you travel i have biting pains here abivard ran his hand along the right side of his belly as well as a troublesome flux of the bowels tanshars potions and the hot fomentations he prepares while we camp give me enough relief to stay in the saddle however it pleases you pradtak said abivard wondered if the sentry had borrowed the phrase from his master the dihqan of nalgis crag domain went on come in refresh yourselves then abivard you can speak to me more of the reasons for your visit do not misunderstand me you are most welcome only your letter wasyou will forgive me rather vague i forgive you most willingly abivard said as he walked with pradtak toward the strongholds living quarters for i intended to be vague some things should not be set down on parchment in so many words lest the wrong eyes light on them i would not have said even as much as i did were i not sure of your loyalty to smerdis king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase pradtak looked sharply at him and more sharply at tanshar should you say even so much when we do not discuss this matter in privacy what do you mean abivard said then his eyes followed pradtaks to tanshar oh the physician he laughed loud long and a little foolishly he is a valued counselor and has been since my grandfathers day godarz my father even admitted him to the womens quarters to treat his wives and daughters denak among them id sooner distrust the moon than tanshar again i pray your forgiveness but my father urashtu sometimes wondered if godarz was not too liberal for his own good pradtak said i speak not to offend merely to inform and i must remind you i know this tanshar not at all only what you say of him this makes me hesitant to rest on him the same trust you do well it might since ive been filling your ears with lies abivard thought to pradtak however he presented the picture of affronted dignity setting a hand on tanshars shoulder he said let us return to vek rud domain my friend if pradtak cannot trust you i see i cannot trust him he took a couple of steps toward the stables as if to reclaim his horse tanshar had rehearsed too but what of the news you bear for denak lord he cried your lady mothers heart will surely break if you come home without delivering it i dont care not a fig abivard said drawing himself up to his full height i will not stand by and let you be impugned it reflects badly on me pradtak stared from one of them to the other hes hooked abivard thought though he kept his face cold and haughty perhaps i was hasty pradtak began perhaps you were abivard took another step or two stableward wait pradtak said if you rely on this man so he must deserve it i apologize for any insult i may have accidentally given the dihqan is gracious tanshar murmured abivard let himself be persuaded by his retainers acquiescence since tanshar feels no insult none could have been given he said but kept his tone grudging and the matter as i say is of some importance very well pradtak i overlook it it never happened pradtak still seemed pained i do not object to your seeing your sister so long as i remain in the chamber as well a womans close kin may view her without impropriety even after she has passed into the womens quarters of another man but the physician is a physician and old and blind in one eye abivard said firmly and he has seen denak before do you believe he intends to fall on her and ravish her too he would be the better choice to pass on some of what my lady mother said to me the shock to my sister will perhaps be less hearing it from someone outside the family however it pleases you pradtak sounded sullen but he yielded since you have come so far your words must be importantand from the dire hints you keep dropping i am about to perish of curiosity tell me at once what you can dont even pause to scratch your head my throat is dry abivard said even in winter much of the road between my domain and yours is but a dusty track pradtak twisted the head of his stick back and forth in his hand hospitality came first so decreed custom binding as iron and so however much he fidgeted he had to lead abivard and tanshar into the kitchens and do his best to make small talk while they drank wine and munched on pocket bread stuffed with grapes and onions and crumbly white cheese and chunks of mutton sprinkled with ground cardamom seeds whatever might be said against him he set an excellent table at last abivard said perhaps you would be gracious enough to have more of this fine red wine brought to your chamber lord dihqan so we can wet our lips further while we discuss the concerns that brought us here of course lord dihqan pradtak said with illconcealed eagerness if you and your distinguished retainer will be so kind as to follow me he used a hand to help push himself upright from the table but walked several steps before he remembered almost as an afterthought to let the tip of his stick touch the floor as denak had said he was mending you walk quite well abivard said can you also ride these days aye and you have no idea how glad i am of it pradtak said he on the other hand had no idea how glad abivard was of it pradtak went on these past few weeks ive been hunting a great deal to try to make up for all the time i lost while i was lamed no man may do that tanshars somber tones might have come from a servant of the god pradtak looked at him with more respect than he had shown before i fear you are right but i try nonetheless to abivard with the air of a man making a concession he added he has wisdom so he does abivard hoped he didnt sound surprised it wasnt that he reckoned tanshar foolish he wouldnt have brought him along if he had but he hadnt expected the village fortuneteller to act so convincingly a role far above his true station that made him wonder if tanshars station should perhaps be raised before he had time to do more than note the thought pradtak said lets take these discussions where we can pursue them more privately as you yourself suggested he tapped his stick impatiently on the stone floor i am your servant abivard got up and followed him tanshar close behind as usual abivard had been down the hall to pradtaks bedchamber on denaks wedding day but then of course he had stopped short of the door now pradtak unlocked it and held it open with his own hands waving for his guests to precede him go in go in he said as soon as abivard and tanshar were inside he barred the door behind them now but abivard wasnt quite ready to start talking yet he looked around in some curiosity this was the first dihqans bedchamber he had seen outside vek rud stronghold in most regards it was much like his owna bed a chest of drawers ornamented by some exceptionally fine cups a little table but as denak had said it now had two doorways side by side in the far wall one of them plainly of recent construction he pointed to them and pasted a leer on his face whats this do you put your pretty wives behind one door and the rest behind the other how dyou keep em from quarreling pradtak blushed like a maiden brought to her wedding bed no one of the doors leads to the apartment of a ah special guest the bar is on this side tanshar noted and what concern of yours is that pradtak asked oh none whatever lord the fortuneteller said cheerfully this is your domain and you hold it as you think best my mouth but said what my eyesmy good eye anyhowchanced to see pradtak opened his own mouth perhaps to warn tanshar to watch his words more closely but he shut it again without speaking and contented himself with a sharp short nod into the silence abivard said brotherinlaw could i trouble you for more wine what i have to say comes so hard that i fear i need the grape to force my tongue to shape the words however it pleases you pradtak said but with a look that warned the matter was not as it pleased him he limped back to the outer door and bawled for a servant the fellow quickly returned with a jar big enough to get half a dozen men drunk he dipped some up into the fine porcelain cups then bobbed his head and vanished pradtak tossed back his own wine then folded his arms across his chest enough suspense he growled tell me at once of what you have been hinting at since you arrived here abivard glanced at both inner doors he lowered his voice he did not want anyone behind either of them to hear i have word of a dangerous plot against smerdis king of kings may his years be long and his realm increase so many are involved in it that i fear the king of kings may find himself in desperate straits if those of us who remain loyal to him do not do everything in our power to uphold him i feared as much pradtak said heavily when you sent me that letter complaining of the payment his men had taken from you i also feared you were part of the plot seeking to draw me in that is why i replied as i did but denak persuaded me you could not be disloyal good abivard said from the bottom of his heart even before she had learned what pradtak was up to his sister had kept an eye out for the welfare of vek rud domain he went on we received many complaints from those who had trouble giving to the treasury officials what smerdis king of kings demanded of them id wager one of them was from your other new brotherinlaw pradtak said he was in his way shrewd hes but a lad isnt he not one to know the duties dihqans owe their sovereign many of the names would surprise you abivard answered much of the northwest may rise with the coming of spring because you so plainly told me you were loyal to smerdis king of kings i knew you would help me devise how best to stand against the rebels should they move you did right to come to me pradtak said i have some small connection with the court of the king of kings and i he broke off however much he wanted to brag he had wit enough to realize that would be unwise with hardly a pause he went on well never mind i am glad you came here so we he broke off again this time because someone rapped on the door that led from the womens quarters he stumped over to it peered through the grillwork to see who was on the other side then unbarred the door denak came through carrying a silver tray i crave your pardon husband of mine she began i did not know she brightened abivard and doctor tanshar with you pradtak chuckled you mean word they were here had not reached you i find that hard to believe be it as it may though i would have summoned you soon in any case for your brother and the physician have news from your mother they say you must hear from my mother what could it be denak said abivard was appalled at the way she looked she seemed to have aged five years maybe ten in the few months she had dwelt at nalgis crag stronghold harsh lines bracketed either side of her mouth dark circles lay under her eyes abivard wanted to shake pradtak to force from him what he had done to her to have worked such a harsh change pradtak said why dont you take supper there in to ourguest then you can return free of your burden and learn this portentous news however it pleases you denak answeredthe phrase seemed to run all through nalgis crag domain tanshar raised an eyebrow a guest splendid enough to be served by the dihqans wife surely he deserves wine then to go with his supper he picked up a cup from the chest of drawers carried it over to the wine jar and filled it i thank you good doctor but two men wait behind that portal denak said then let them both have wine tanshar said grandly and poured out another cupful he set it on the tray as if he were a dihqan himself tapping it once or twice with a forefinger as if to show how special it was denak looked to pradtak who shrugged he unbarred the newly built door denak passed through it pradtak shut it again behind her more wine for you as well generous lord tanshar plucked the cup from pradtaks hand now acting the conjurer instead of the noble he gave it back to the dihqan full to the brim pradtak sipped the wine abivard glanced to tanshar who nodded slightly abivard raised his cup in a toast the god grant that we put an end to all conspiracies against the king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase he drained the wine still in his cup tanshar also emptied his and pradtak followed his guests by drinking his cup dry too he smacked his lips frowning a little i hope that jars not going bad he said he swayed on his feet his mouth came open in an enormous yawn whats happening to me he asked in a blurry voice his eyes rolled up in his head he slid boneless to the floor the lovely cup slipped from his hand and shattered abivard felt bad about that he turned to tanshar and bowed with deep respect what was in that sleeping draft of yours anyhow he asked elixir of the poppy henbane some other things id rather not name tanshar answered it took but a few drops in a cup all i had to do was get between pradtak and the wine so he wouldnt see me drug his shareand the one for the guard in there he spoke in a near whisper as he pointed to the doorway through which denak had gone abivard slid his sword out of its sheath if denak had given the wrong cup to sharbarazs guard or if the fellow hadnt drunk it straight off he was going to have a fight on his hands fear ran through himif by some horrid mischance she had given the drugged wine to sharbaraz all the careful planning they had done would fall straight into the void he walked over to the door unbarred it and sprang into the hallway ready to cut down the guard before the fellow could draw his own blade to his vast relief the man slumped against the wall snoring another door at the end of the short hallway was barred on the outside abivard opened it out came denak and with her a broadshouldered man a few years older than abivard your majesty abivard said he started to go down on his belly no time for that not now sharbaraz snapped his eyes flashed with excitement at getting out of his prison unless i escape this stronghold im no ones majesty well deal with ceremony when we can he hurried past the drugged guard and out into pradtaks bedchamber denak paused for a moment in the hallway she kicked the guard in the belly as hard as she could he grunted and twisted but did not wake abivard stared at her she glared back id do it to all three of them if i couldid do worse she said and burst into tears come tanshar said urgently we havent time to waste as his majesty reminded us abivard went into the bedchamber denak followed him still sobbing when tanshar saw her tears he exclaimed my lady you must be brave now if they see you weeping we fail iknow denak bit her lip she wiped her eyes on the brocaded silk of her robe shuddered and at last nodded to tanshar do what you must i will not give away the illusion good tanshar said things were still moving too fast for abivard to follow all that was going on and they did not slow down tanshar beckoned to sharbaraz your majesty i need your aid now take pradtaks hands in yours as you say sharbaraz bent by the unconscious dihqan tanshar sprinkled both men with reddish powderground bloodstone he explainedand began to chant abivard knew the sorcery was possibleany hope of escape from nalgis crag stronghold would have been impossible without itbut seeing it performed still raised awe in him before his eyes sharbaraz took on pradtaks semblance clothes and all and the other way round when the change was complete abivard and sharbarazwhoseemedpradtak dragged the changed pradtak into the cell that had held sharbaraz then barred the door tanshar said to denak now my lady to give you the appearance of the guard here and then were away her eyes grew so wide white showed all around her pupils i knew it would come to that but how can i bear it she said will i also see myself in his guise lady you will not sharbaraz held out a hand looked at it to my own eyes i remain myself he sounded like pradtak though that is the way of it tanshar agreed your own essence remains undisturbed and to you the change will be invisible denak nodded jerkily i will do it then but must i touch him tanshar shook his head the ritual here is rather different for the two of you will not exchange appearances rather you will borrow his stand there close by him if you would even that seemed more than denak wanted but she obeyed tanshar set a crystal disk between her and the guard when he let go of it it hung in the air by itself he chanted again to a different rhythm this time and invoked the name of the prophet shivini the lady again and again the crystal glowed for perhaps half a minute when it faded there might have been two guards identical twins in the hallway let me get away from him denak said and her voice came out a mans harsh rasp abivard closed the outer door to the hallway on the unconscious guard and barred it again from the outside he was grinning from ear to ear things had gone better than he had dared hope wont they be confused he said happily not only will they be confused in fact theyll stay confused forhow long will the spells of seeming last tanshar a few days if no magic is brought to bear against them tanshar sounded exhausted if a sorcerer should challenge them though hell pierce them as an embroidery needle pierces silk all the more reason to get away as fast as we can oh i dont know sharbaraz said with pradtaks voice when the dihqan stops looking like me and becomes himself again they may still think him me and using sorcery to try to escape a lovely coil youve wound he laughed with the joy of a man who has not laughed in a long time but the wise tanshar is rightwe should not test the magic overmuch he trotted toward the outer door to the bedchamber your majesty uh husband of mine for the momentremember you limp denak said forget that and you may yet give the game away sharbaraz bowed lady you are right he said though denaks semblance was anything but ladylike i shall remember he snatched up pradtaks stick from where it lay on the floor and gave a convincing impression of a man with a bad ankle and nowaway sharbaraz made sure to close the newly installed bar outside pradtaks bedchamber abivard nodded approvingly now that the bedchamber was in effect the outer portion of the womens quarters no dihqan would leave it open lest the women somehow depart without his knowledge where now sharbaraz asked in a low voice as the bar thudded home the stables abivard answered just as quietly here walk beside me and make as if youre leading me and not the other way round tanshar denak you come behind youre our retainers after all pradtaks household accepted the escaping fugitives as what they seemed once reminded sharbaraz kept up his limp quite well he gave friendly greetings to pradtaks kinsfolk and retainers if he didnt address any of them by name that was no flaw in a brief conversationand he made sure all the conversations were brief at the stables though one of the grooms seeing to abivards horses looked up in surprise you seldom come here without bow and spear for the chase lord he said you are riding to hunt not so abivard froze cursing himself for a fool all that careful planning to be undone by a moments carelessness but sharbaraz said calmly no were for the village of gayy east of here lord abivard was asking about the qanat network there because it stretches so far from the hyuja river and he was hoping to do the same along the vek rud my thought was that showing him would be easier than talking at him what say you me the groom looked startled then grinned lord of making qanats i know nothing so i have little to say he looked to abivard youll want your animal and your councilors resaddled then yes and well take the packhorses as well abivard answered vastly relieved sharbarazs wits were quicker than his own and also vastly impressed at sharbarazs intimate knowledge of pradtaks domain he went on i may want to spend the night at uh gayy and look over the qanats some more in the morning the town has a sarai lord the groom said in mild reproof abivard folded his arms across his chest the groom looked an appeal to the man he thought to be pradtak however it pleases him sharbaraz said just as pradtak would have abivard had all he could do to keep from laughing the groom nodded in resignation and turned to denak youll be one of the gentlemen who rode in at night a ways back im sorry sir but ive not seen you much since and ive forgotten which of those horses was yours he pointed down to three stalls at the end of the stable before denak could answeror panic and not answersharbaraz came to the rescue again it was the bay gelding with the scar on his flank not so yes lord denak said in her sorcerously assumed mans voice the groom sent sharbaraz a glance full of admiration lord no one will ever say you havent an eye for horses sharbaraz made the image of pradtak preen the horse that had belonged to smerdis man snorted a little when denak mounted it so did pradtaks horse when sharbaraz climbed aboard the horses knew even if men were fooled sharbaraz easily calmed his animal denak had more trouble the only riding she had done since she became a woman was on her wedding journey to nalgis crag stronghold but she managed and the four riders started down the steep winding trail to the bottom of nalgis crag by the god i think weve done it abivard breathed as the flat ground drew near he called ahead to sharbaraz who as pradtak was leading the procession lord uh your majesty how did you come to know so much about the village of gayy and its qanats id not wager an arket that the real pradtak could say as much of them my father set me to studying the realm and its domains before my beard first sprouted so i would come to know makuran before i ruled it sharbaraz answered his chuckle had more than a little edge to it i got to know nalgis crag domain or its stronghold better than i cared to my father was right abivard said you will make a fine king of kings for makuran your fatherhe would be godarz of vek rud domain sharbaraz said and answered himself yes of course for you are denaks brother godarz perished on the steppe with the rest of the host he did your majesty with my brother and three half brothers sharbaraz shook his head a victory in pardraya would have been glorious a loss like the one we suffered better the campaign had never begun but with a choice of strike or wait my father always preferred to strike his horse reached the flat land then he kicked the animal up into a fast groundeating trot his companions imitated him the farther from nalgis crag stronghold they got the safer they would be abivard said the confusion should be lovely back at the stronghold when pradtak wakes up in your shape hell insist hes himself and the guards will just laugh at him theyll say hes gone off to gayy and even when he does get his own appearance back theyll think thats a trick as you said the only real problem will be that i wont return to the womens quarters denak said and the folk at the stronghold wont truly notice im missing for some time who pays any real attention to women anyhow her voice was deep and strange now but the same old bitterness rode it sharbaraz said lady a blind man would note your bravery on a battlefield where no man would ever be likely to find himself do not make yourself less than you are i pray you how can i make myself less than nothing she said when abivard protested that she turned her head away and would not speak further he did not press her but wondered what had passed at nalgis crag stronghold to make her hate herself so his left hand the one not holding the reins curled into a fist if he had thought pradtak was abusing her he would have served her husband as she had the guard who disgraced himself by helping to confine the rightful king of kings the pale winter sun scurried toward the horizon the weather though cold stayed clear when the riders came to an almond grove not far from the edge of pradtaks irrigated land abivard said lets camp here well have fuel for a fine fire when no one argued with him he reined in tethered his horse and began scouring the ground for fallen branches and twigs sharbaraz joined him saying the god grant we dont have to damage the trees themselves we should be able to glean enough to keep them intact behind the two young men denak said to tanshar take your seeming off me this instant my lady truly i would sooner wait tanshar answered hesitantly our safety might still ride on your keeping the guardsmans face i would rather die than keep it denak began to cry again tanshars magic transmuted her sobs into the deep moaning of a man in anguish abivard dumped a load of wood on the ground and dug in a pocket of his belt pouch for flint and steel tanshar sent him a look of appeal and asked lord what is your will shall i remove the enchantment if my sister hates it so perhaps you had better abivard answered why she should hate it she has reason i assure you sharbaraz dropped more twigs and branches on top of the load abivard had gathered his support instead of cheering denak only made her cry harder than ever abivard looked up from the slow business of getting a fire going and nodded to tanshar the fortuneteller took out the crystal disk he had used to give denak the appearance of sharbarazs guard again he suspended it in the air between them this time his chant was different from before where the disk had briefly glowed now it seemed to suck up darkness from the gathering night when that darkness left it denak was herself again abivard walked over to her and put his arms around her its gone he said youre you no one else just as you should be she shuddered under his touch then twisted away ill never be just as i should be dont you understand she cried i left what i should be behind forever at nalgis crag stronghold what being pradtaks wife abivard said scornfully the cursed traitor doesnt deserve you thats so sharbaraz agreed he started to say something more but denak cut him off with a sharp chopping motion of her right hand what you say of pradtak is true but not to the point i left more than marriage behind in that stronghold i lost my honor there as well aiding the king of kings against those who wrongfully imprisoned him is no dishonor abivard said you his voice trailed away as at last he found a reason why denak might have kicked sharbarazs guard while he was unconscious why donning his image was almost more than she could bear he stared at her did he did they he couldnt go on he did they all did she answered bleakly it was the price they took from me for letting me in to serve the rightful king of kings they cared nothing that i had pradtaks permission they were smerdis men they said and if i spoke a word of it to anyone sharbaraz would be dead in his cell one day i knew as you did that he was makurans only hope and soi yielded myself to them its done its over the words came flat and empty from abivards mouth it might be done but it would never be over he felt sick inside no matter why denak had done what she did how was he supposed to look at her after knowing of it she understood that too shaking her head she said all the way along the track down nalgis crag i kept wishing i had the courage to throw myself over a cliff without my honor what am i abivard found no answer nor did tanshar who sat by the fire slumped and numb with fatigue nor did sharbaraz not at first he got down on hands and knees and scratched in the dirt for several minutes at last with a grunt of triumph he rose once more and showed what he held in his hands three black pebbles as rightful king of kings i have certain powers beyond those of ordinary men he declared he threw one of the black pebbles down onto the ground from which hed grubbed it denak i divorce you from pradtak he repeated the formula twice more making the divorce complete denak remained disheartened i know you mean that kindly your majesty but it does nothing for me no doubt pradtak too will cast the pebbles against me when he eventually gets free of your shape and your cell but what good does it do me lady not even the king of kings has the powerthough some have claimed itto ask the hand of a woman wed to another man sharbaraz said thus i needed to free you from that union but your majesty denaks words stumbled out one and two at a time youof all peopleknow how i threw away my honor in the hall in front of your cell sharbaraz shook his head i know you won great honor there giving without concern for yourself that i that makuran might go on if you know nothing else of me know i always aid those who aid me and punish those who do me wrong when i sit on the throne in mashiz once more you shall sit beside me as my principal wife by the god and the four i swear it abivard was never sure whether he or denak first went down into a prostration before sharbaraz his sister was sobbing still but with a different note now as if against all expectation the sacrifice and humiliation she had endured might have been of some worth after all honor lost is honor won sharbaraz said rise denak and you abivard we have much to do before i return to my proper place in mashiz aye your majesty as abivard got back to his feet he glanced over at tanshar who was taking bread and dates from the saddlebag of a packhorse the fortunetellers second prophecy echoed within him honor won and honor lost in a tall tower he had seen that sure enough and more of each than abivard had imagined where he wondered would he find that flash of light across a narrow sea and what would it bring with it godarz had taught abivard many things how to ride how to rule a domain how to think of next year instead of tomorrow one thing he had not taught him was how to be a rebel abivard didnt think godarz had ever dreamedor had nightmaresof opposing vek rud domain to the power of the king of kings in mashiz whatever he did then he had to do on his own without his fathers advice and warnings echoing in the back of his mind he missed them he had grown used to the idea that godarz had an answer for everything and could he but find it all would be well in the game he played now that was not so nor could he simply sit idle and let sharbaraz bear the whole burden of the war against smerdis not only would that have been unseemly for the king of kings brotherinlawfor sharbaraz had kept his promise and wed denak as soon as he came into vek rud strongholdbut abivard knew most of the frontier dihqans better than his sovereign did old news sharbaraz complained one evening munching bulgur wheat with pine nuts and mutton drenched in a sauce of yogurt and crushed mint leaves i know the domains and i know of the lords they had before our army went into pardraya but how many of those lords still live one here one there mostly though its their sons and grandsons and nephews who carry on for them men whose ways i never studied whereas you aye ive hunted with some of them and played mallet and ball against others at festivals and the like but i cant claim to know them well most of my dealings with them have been after i made my way back from pardraya those are the important dealings now sharbaraz said if we cannot bring the northwest to my banner you might as well have left me mured up in nalgis crag stronghold for that would prove smerdis curse him through the void will be the sure winner in our struggle abivard rose from the bench in the kitchen and paced back and forth if we wrote out the lists of opposing forces on parchment ours would be much smaller and weaker than smerdis even if all the northwestern dihqans went over to you he said how do we go about overcoming that advantage if all the forces loyal to smerdis today stay loyal to him were doomed sharbaraz answered i dont believe they will i think most of them are with him because they believe i gave up the throne of my own free will when they learn that isnt so theyll flock to my banner they had better abivard thought otherwise well see how bitter a death smerdis can devise for us that however was not the sort of notion he could share with the man he reckoned his sovereign sharbaraz looked up at him nothing about his dress proclaimed him king of kings he wore one of abivards woolen caftans a good enough garment but hardly a royal robe a bit of yogurt was stuck in his beard just below one corner of his mouth but when he spoke confidence rang in his voice like a horn call when you rescued me from pradtaks stronghold you didnt stop to reckon up the cost or what would come afterwardyou simply did what was right well go on that way and the god will surely smile on us may it be so your majesty abivard answered it shall be so sharbaraz said fiercely slamming a fist down on the stone table in front of him as they had before his words set abivard afire inside made him want to leap onto his horse and charge down on mashiz sweeping everything before him by sheer force of will but however much he wanted to do that the part of him that was godarzs heritage warned him it would not be so easy peroz had charged down on the khamorthand look what it got him frada came in then one of the cooks handed him a pocket bread filled with the same muttonandbulgur mixture abivard and sharbaraz were eating your majesty he murmured as he sat down beside sharbaraz his tone lay somewhere between admiration and hero worship he had never expected to sit at meat with the king of kings when he glanced toward abivard though resentment congealed on his face abivard hadnt told him of the plan to rescue sharbaraz abivard hadnt told anyone who did not absolutely have to know he could see frada wishing he had been along too sharbaraz also saw that he said to frada secrets must be kept you shall yet have the chance to show off your courage before me frada preened like a peacock had he had tail feathers he would have fanned them out in dazzling display as things were he had to be content with puffing out his chest throwing back his head and in abivards opinion looking very foolish but perhaps frada wasnt so foolish after all no less than abivard he was now brotherinlaw to the rightful king of kings when sharbaraz regained his capital both godarzs sonsand their younger half brothers toowould be great men in makuran that hadnt fully occurred to abivard till then for the moment though frada was just his little brother get out of here he said before you stroll into the oven from not looking where youre going the gesture frada returned was emphatically not one of benediction but he departed chewing noisily sharbaraz chuckled the two of you get on well he said his voice was wistful i grew up distrusting all my brothers and they me that happens in a fair number of domains ive heard abivard said i can see how it would be worse in mashiz with the whole realm as a prize for the one who manages to inherit just so sharbaraz said when word came of my fathers fall i looked for one of my brothers to try to cast me down from the throne he laughed a laugh full of selfmockery and so i paid no heed to my doddering cousin the mintmasterand paid the price for that id be paying it yet without your sister and you abivard dipped his head songs said a monarchs gratitude was like lowlands snow on a warm spring day but he didnt think sharbaraz typical of the breed with luck the rightful king of kings would remain a man among men even after he gained the throne how do you and your brothers keep from quarreling sharbaraz asked oh we quarrellike pups in a litter abivard answered but father never let us turn it to feuds and knives in the back the domain is bigger than any one of you and big enough for all of you hed say and clout us now and again to make sure the lesson got through my father used to say much the same thing sharbaraz shook his head he couldnt quite make us believe it i wish he had what do you suppose smerdis will do when he learns of your escape abivard thought it a good time to change the subject what would you do were you in mashiz and he a rebel in the provinces were i on my throne i would attack any rebel with as strong a force as i could mount to make sure his men won no battles against forces too weak to do a proper job of rooting them out that would only give them courage the last thing id want rebel troops to have our thoughts travel the same track abivard said nodding the next question is does smerdis think the same way we do sharbaraz stopped with a bite halfway to his mouth by the god abivard i have more reason to bless the day i met you than that it was also the day i gained my freedom and claimed your sister as my bride do you know that notion never occurred to me i assumed smerdis would set out from mashiz with his whole host directly he heard id escaped because i would have done as much in his place but it may not be so you must have known him at your fathers court abivard thanked his father for drilling into him that there was commonly more than one way to look at a situation what feel do you have for the way hell act ive only met him so to speak when his men took my money to pay it to the khamorth from that he doesnt strike me as a worldbestriding hero i never reckoned him one thats certain sharbaraz said but then i hardly had him in my mind at all till he stole my throne from me he was just a gray man with a gray beard hardly worth noticing even when he spoke and he didnt speak much who would have guessed such ambition hid behind that blank mask maybe he didnt know it was there himself till he got the chance to let it out abivard said that could be so with the dainty manners of the royal court sharbaraz dabbed at his mouth with a square of clotha towel rather than a proper napkin but as close as vek rud domain could come when abivard wiped his mouth he used his sleeve setting the towel aside sharbaraz went on one thing is sure though hell soon learn im loose and then well find out what sort of man he is the rider from nalgis crag domain looked nervous as he waited for abivard to approach lord he said sooner than he should have i beg you to remember i am but a messenger here bearing the words and intentions of pradtak my dihqan they are not my words or intentions and i would not have you blame me for them however it pleases you abivard said the rider let out a long smoky breath of relief then gave abivard a sharp look abivard carefully kept his own face innocent he twisted his left hand in a gesture of benediction i pledge by the god that no harm will come to you because of the message you bring you are gracious lord pradtak bade me deliver these first of all the rider unsealed a message tube instead of a letter he let three black pebbles fall into the palm of his other hand these are the very pebbles he dropped before witnesses to pronounce divorcement from his former wife the lady denak your sister abivard burst out laughing pradtaks messenger went from apprehensive to shocked in the space of a heartbeat whatever reaction he had expectedfury most likely or perhaps dismaythat wasnt it abivard said you may return the pebbles to your lord with my compliments tell him hes too late that divorcements already been pronounced lord i do not understand the messenger said carefully by custom and law both you have not the power to end the marriage of your sister to my lord pradtak true abivard admitted but the king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase does have that power smerdis king of kings has not the rider began abivard broke in ah but sharbaraz king of kings son of peroz and true ruler of makuran has sharbaraz king of kings pradtaks rider stared like a sturgeon netted out of the vek rud river every man knows sharbaraz renounced the throne evidently not everyone knows the renunciation was forced from him at knifepoint and that he was locked away in nalgis crag stronghold for safekeeping abivard said the riders eyes got even wider with relish abivard went on and not everyone knows my sister and i rescued him out of nalgis crag stronghold and set your precious lord in the cell that had been his how long did pradtak take to get his own face back anyhow the messenger sputtered for close to a minute before he finally managed lord i know nothing of this i am but a small man and it is dangerous for such to meddle in the affairs of those stronger than they i have here also a letter from my lord pradtak for you he handed abivard another leather tube as abivard opened it he said you may not be powerful but you must know whether your lord looked like himself or someone else for a while eh i am not required to speak of this to you the man said so youre not abivard took out the scrap of parchment and unrolled it the message was if nothing else to the point war to the knife abivard showed it to the messenger you can tell pradtak for me that the knife cuts both ways if he chooses to support a usurper in place of the proper king of kings hell find himself on the wrong end of it i shall deliver your words just as you say them the rider answered do that think about them on the way back to nalgis crag stronghold too when you get there tell your friends whats happenedand why some of them id wager will know what befell pradtak when we rescued sharbaraz before you go though take bread and wine and sit by the fire whatever pradtak says im not at war with you but the messenger shook his head no lord that wouldnt be right im loyal to my own dihqan i am and i wouldnt make myself the guest of a man im liable to be fighting before long i do thank you though youre generous to offer he made small smacking noises as if chewing on what abivard had told him his face was thoughtful i wish your dihqan had shown the same loyalty to his rightful lord as you do to him abivard said go in peace if you feel you must maybe when you hear the whole story youll change your mind maybe some of your friends will too when they learn it all pradtaks rider did not answer but as he turned his horse to start the journey back to nalgis crag domain he sketched a salute abivard returned it he had hopes that pradtak had done his own cause more harm than good with those three pebbles and the accompanying letter of defiance let his men learn how he had betrayed perozs son and nalgis crag stronghold no matter how invulnerable to outside assault might yet quake beneath his fundament the smithy was dark and sooty lit mostly by the leaping redgold flames of the furnace it smelled of woodsmoke and hot iron and sweat ganzak the smith was the mightiest wrestler of vek rud domain he had a chest and shoulders like a bulls and his arms worked constantly with blows of the heavy hammer were thick as some mens legs lord majesty you honor my hearth by your visit he said when abivard and sharbaraz came in one wintry morning your fires as welcome as your company abivard answered with a grin to show he was joking yet as with many jests his held a grain of truth while snow lay in the strongholds courtyard ganzak labored barechested and heat as well as exertion left his skin wet and gleaming almost as if oiled in the firelight how fares my armor sharbaraz asked him the rightful king of kings was not one to waste time on anything when his vital interests were concerned he went on the sooner i have it the sooner i feel myself fully a man and a warrior againand i aim to take the field as soon as i may majesty ive told you before i do all i can but armor especially chain is slow work ganzak said splints are simplejust long thin plates hammered out and punched at each end for attachment but ring mail abivard had played through this discussion with the smith before but sharbaraz being a scion of the royal family had not learned much about how armor was made perhaps his study of the domains and their leaders had kept him from paying much attention to such seemingly smaller matters he said whats the trouble you make the rings you fit them together into mail you fasten the mail to the leather backing and theres your suit ganzak exhaled through his nose had someone of less than sharbarazs exalted status spoken to him so he might have given a more vehement reply probably capped by chasing the luckless fellow out of the smithy with hammer upraised as it was he used what abivard thought commendable restraint your majesty its not so simple what are the rings made of wire of course sharbaraz said iron wire if thats what you mean iron wire it is ganzak agreed the best iron i can make too but wire doesnt grow on trees like pistachio nuts by the god i wish it did but since it doesnt i have to make it too that means i have to cut thin strips from a plate of iron which is what i was doing when you and my lord the dihqan came in he pointed to several he had set aside here they are theyre still not wire yet you seetheyre just strips of iron to turn em into wire i have to hammer em out thin and round sharbaraz said i believe i may have spoken too soon but ganzak by then was in full spate and not to be headed off by mere apology then once i have the wire i have to turn it into rings theyre all supposed to be the same size right so what i do is i wrap the wire around this dowel here he showed sharbaraz the wooden cylinder and then cut em one at a time then i have to pound the ends of each one flat and rivet em together to make rings one at a time again course they have to be linked to each other before i put the rivets in on account of you cant put em together after theyre finished rings none of this stuff is quick begging your pardon majesty no i see it wouldnt be forgive me ganzak i spoke out of turn sharbaraz sounded humbler than a king of kings usually had occasion to be another lesson learned know what something involves before you criticize abivard said ive seen mail with every other row of rings punched from plate rather than turned out the way you describe wouldnt that be faster to make aye it is ganzak spat into the fire but thats what i give you for it you cant link those punched rings one to another only to the proper ones in the rows above and below em that means the mail isnt near as strong for the same weight of metal you want his majesty to go to war in cheap shoddy armor find yourself another smith he folded massive arms across even more massive chest defeated abivard said when do you think this next armor will be finished the smith considered three weeks lord give or take a little it will have to do sharbaraz said with a sigh in truth i dont expect to be attacked before then but i grudge every day without mail i feel naked as a newborn babe its not so bad as that your majesty abivard said hosts of warriors go and fight in leather the khamorth make a habit of it their horses being smaller and less able to bear weight than ours and i fought against them so while ganzak was still at work on my suit of iron no doubt sharbaraz said necessity knows few laws as you among others showed in freeing me from nalgis crag stronghold but did you not reckon yourself a hero once more not just a warrior when the ring mail jingled sweetly on your shoulders i dont know about that abivard said i did reckon myself less likely to get killed which is plenty to hearten a man in a fight lord when i hear you talk plain sense i can see your father standing there in your place ganzak said i wish he were abivard answered quietly even so he glowed with pride at the compliment sharbaraz said at my fathers court i learned as much of war from minstrels as from soldiers good to have close by me someone who has seen it and speaks plainly of what it requires doing ones duty and staying alive through it though not something to inspire songs also has its place another lesson he nodded as if to impress it on his memory abivard nodded too sharbaraz was always learning abivard thought well of that the very nature of his office was liable to make the king of kings sure he already knew everything for who dared tell him he did not something else occurred to abivard suppose one day sharbaraz went wrong as the king of kings had said he stood close by now but how was he to tell sharbaraz he was mistaken he had no idea in the stronghold sharbaraz took for his own the chamber abivard had used while godarz still lived frada relinquished it with good grace it lay down the hall from the dihqans bedchamber that convenience was a point in its favor denak had returned to the womens quarters of vek rud stronghold when she abivard sharbaraz and tanshar came back to the domain true to his vow sharbaraz had wed her as soon as a servant of the god could be brought to the stronghold but though she was his wife the womens quarters were not his had he gone in there to claim her whenever he sought her company he would have created great scandal even though he was king of kings the way round the seeming impasse created scandal too but not great scandal the outer door to the dihqans bedchamber became the effective boundary to the womens quartersjust as it had at nalgis crag stronghold abivard thought and kept the thought to himself sharbaraz did not go inside abivard brought denak to him there and he escorted her to the room he was using for her that room was also part of the womens quarters so far well and good the trouble lay in the stretch of hall between the dihqans bedchamber and sharbarazs room no one in the stronghold was willing to consider a hallway part of the womens quarters but nobody could see how denak was supposed to join her husband without traversing it either tongues wagged maybe tanshar could magic me from my room to sharbarazs denak said one evening as abivard walked her toward the controversial hall i dont think so he said doubtfully i just thank the god his strength sufficed for the uses to which we put it brother of mine i meant that for a joke denak poked him in the ribs which made him hop in the air it was the only answer i could think of that might stop the gossip about how we have to do things oh abivard tried it on for size he decided to laugh its good to have you back here its good to be back she answered turning serious again after what happened in pradtaks womens quarters her face twisted i wish i could have killed that guard i wish i could have killed all three of them a fingers breadth at a time escaping that place is not enough but it will have to do he started to put an arm around her but stopped with the gesture barely begun she didnt want anyone but sharbaraz touching her these days abivard wished she had killed the guardall the guardstoo as slowly as she liked he would have helped and smiled as he did it she said in truth its just as well tanshar cant sorcerously flick me about from chamber to chamber no matter what others may say walking down that stretch of hall makes me feel free as if i had the run of the whole stronghold the way i did when i was a girl funny what twenty or thirty feet of stone floor and blank walls can do isnt it i was thinking the same thing abivard said do you know roshnani and some of my other wives are jealous of you im not surprised denak said as abivard opened the inner door to the bedchamber for her to pass through to those with no freedom even a tiny bit must look like a lot hmm abivard closed the door that led into the womens quarters locked it and walked with denak to the outer door of the bedchamber sharbaraz stood waiting just outside abivard bowed to him your majesty i bring you your wife sharbaraz bowed in turn first to abivard and then to denak he held out his arm to her my lady if you will come with me she crossed the threshold abivard turned away so that formally speaking he had not seen her walking down that muchtoopublic hall then he laughed at himself and at the way he did his best to pretend custom hadnt been violated when he knew full well it had he wondered whether custom wasnt more nearly the ruler of makuran than the king of kings was that evening he brought roshnani to the bedchamber she looked wistfully toward the outer door i wish i could go through there too she said the womens quarters are bearable when you know everyone stays in them alike when one can go farther she paused perhaps swallowing some of what she had intended to say its hard she finished i am sorry it troubles you abivard said i dont know what to do about it though i cant throw away untold years of tradition on a whim tradition didnt count on a king of kings having to take refuge in a backcountry stronghold or on his marrying the dihqans sister i know that roshnani said and please understand i do not hold denaks luck against her we get on famously we might have been born sisters i just wish my stretch of the world were wider too all ive seen of the world since i became a woman is two womens quarters and the land between the stronghold where i grew up and this one its not enough you might have been born sisters with denak he agreed shes been saying much the same thing for as long as i can remember i hadnt heard it from you till now i didnt have any reason to think about it till now she said which made abivard remember what denak had said about a little freedom seeming a lot roshnani went on does it anger you that i speak so few men from what little i know give their wives even so much rein she looked anxiously at abivard its all right he said smerdis im sure would have locked up sharbarazs thoughts along withor ahead ofhis body if only he could i dont see the sense in that if you dont say what you think how am i supposed to find out i may not always think youre rightand even if i do i may not be able to do anything about itbut i want to know like the sun emerging and then going back behind the clouds roshnanis frown chased a quick smile off her face she said if you think im right why cant you do anything about it he spread his hands well have nobles aplenty coming here to vek rud stronghold sounding out sharbaraz to see whether they should side with him or with smerdis do you think hed do his cause much good if he said he wanted all their wives and daughters out of the womens quarters i dont think he does want that but even if he did saying so would cost him half his support likely more not among the women roshnani said stubbornly but the women arent lancers roshnani bit her lip dreadful when a question of whats right and wrong collides with a question of what works well in the world my father would have said that if it doesnt work well in the world whether its right or wrong doesnt matter when tanshar and i went to pradtaks i kept from having to talk too much too soon just by claiming hospitality pradtak had to serve me food and wine then whether he wanted to or not the womens quarters are the same way because theyre part of the way things have always been done they wont disappear tomorrow even if sharbaraz orders that they should abivard watched roshnani chew on that by her expression she didnt care for the flavor maybe not she admitted reluctantly but what about this then will you begin to ease the rules of the womens quarters after sharbaraz wins the war and the assembled nobles of makuran arent all peering straight at yourourstronghold he started to answer but stopped before any words crossed his lips he had expected his logic to convince roshnaniand so it had but instead of convincing her he was right it had just convinced her to accept delay in getting what she still wanted it was he thought uncomfortably a very womanly way of arguingshe had conceded his point and turned it against him in the same breath so how was he supposed to reply every heartbeat he hesitated gave her more hopeand made his dashing that hope harder at last he said i suppose we can try it that probably wont make the world come to an end if it doesnt work out you can always go back to the old ways she said encouragingly thats rubbish and you know it he said just as easy to put together the pieces of a butchered mutton carcass and say its a live sheep again yes i do know it roshnani admitted i was hoping you didnt devious wench of course she said caged away in the womens quarters as i am what can i be but devious she stuck out her tongue at him but quickly grew serious again even knowing that youll change the old way youd still let melet usout now and again abivard felt godarz looking over his shoulder he almost turned around to see what expression his father wore his best guess was sardonic amusement at the predicament in which his son had landed himself break custom or make roshnaniand his other wives when she was through with themfurious at him sighing he said yes i suppose we can see how it goes roshnani squeaked jumped in the air threw her arms around his neck and kissed him he would have called what happened next a molestation if he hadnt enjoyed it so much later the watchful thoughtful part of him wondered if he had been bribed one of the nice things about roshnani was that he could tease her with such without angering her no she answered you just made me very happy thats all he looked at her i should make you happy more often well why dont you she asked mischievously he flopped on the bed like a dead fish if i did it too often im not sure id live through it when she reached out to tickle him he quickly added on the other hand it might be interesting to find out royal soldiers a rider bawled as he drove his worn horse up the steep streets of the town toward vek rud stronghold royal soldiers riding this way ice that had nothing to do with winter ran up abivards back when he heard that cry in one way he had been expecting it since the moment he managed to get sharbaraz out of nalgis crag stronghold in another though as with battle or with women all the anticipation in the world wasnt worth a copper when set against reality as soon as the horseman rode into the courtyard abivard shouted shut the gates the men in charge of them hurried to obey the ironfronted timbers clanged as they closed a great bar thick as a mans leg thudded down behind them how many abivard asked the rider twenty or thirty maybe lord the fellow answered wasnt any huge host that much ill say do you think a huge host follows abivard persisted the rider gave him an exasperated glare lord begging your pardon but how should i know if id been fool enough to hang around to try and find out odds are the buggers would have spotted me abivard sighed youre right of course go into the kitchens and grab yourself some bread and wine then get your bow out of its case and take your place on the wall with the rest of us aye lord the horseman hurried away abivard went up the stairs two at a time as he climbed to the walkway atop the wall and peered south the day was cloudy and gloomy with enough snow pattering down to ruin visibility he muttered under his breath smerdis men werent coming quickly after the news his retainer had shouted he craved action sharbaraz came up on the wall beside him i heard the alarm raised the rightful king of kings said whats toward were about to have visitors abivard answered just when or how many i cant say but theyre not the welcome sort we knew this would happen sharbaraz said biting his lip but smerdis is moving faster than we thought curse him i hadnt looked to be penned in this stronghold before i had an army of my own strong enough to oppose the usurper yes abivards voice was distracted he pointed do you think thats them or is it only a flock sharbaraz squinted as he looked down along abivards outstretched arm your eyes must be better than mine no wait i see what youre pointing at those arent cattle or sheep i fear those are horsemen i think so too abivard would have been surer on a sunny day with light sparking off lanceheads and horse trappings and chainmail but the purposeful way the distant specks kept moving north told him all he needed to know there arent that many of them sharbaraz said after a bit no the rider who brought word said it was a small band abivard said seems he was right he looked toward the approaching troop i dont see any more behind them either nor i sharbaraz sounded indignant as if he thought smerdis wasnt playing the game by the rules what can he hope to do by sending a boyno an unweaned babein place of a man if i knew i would tell you abivard answered well find out within the half hour though i expect the royal soldier reined in at the base of the knob atop which vek rud stronghold perched some of the folk who lived in the town on the knob had fled up to the stronghold before abivard ordered the gates closed the rest did their best to pretend they were invisible one warrior rode up toward the stronghold with a whitewashed shield upraised as a sign of truce he called in a loud voice is it true sharbaraz son of peroz has taken up residence here abivard recognized the voice a moment before he recognized the face none of your affair zal he called back whether the answer is yea or nay dyou think id let you in here again after the way you used me the last time you saw the courtyard zals grin was wide and unashamed i just followed the orders i was given but i think i have a token that will buy my way in do you ill believe that when i see it good thing the weather is so cold zal remarked as he reached back to open a saddlebag otherwise this would stink a lot worse than it does the comment made no sense to abivard until the royal officer held up by the hair a severed head that as he had said was less than perfectly fresh but that had until recently without a doubt adorned the shoulders of the famous murghab gulping a little abivard said youre trying to convince me youre for sharbaraz not against him beside him sharbaraz whispered whose head is that it belonged to smerdis tax collector the one who extorted eightyfive hundred arkets from me as tribute for the khamorth abivard whispered back he raised his voice and called to zal how say you of course im for his majesty zal cried i served smerdis just as you did thinking sharbaraz had truly given up the throne then my men and i ran into a courier who had word from nalgis crag that his majestyhis genuine majesty i meanhad escaped from imprisonment that put a whole new light on things i got rid of the courier and then i got rid of this thing he held murghabs head a little higher but i saved enough to maybe convince you im no assassin in the night you ran into a courier you say abivard answered if thats so youve taken your own sweet time getting here zal shook his graying head not so youngster i was a long way south heading back toward mashiz myself when the fellow caught up with me my best guess is that smerdis pimp of pimps still hasnt heard the real king of kings is loose abivard and sharbaraz looked at each other if that was so it cant last forever abivard said no sharbaraz agreed but the god would turn his back on us in disgust if we didnt make the best use of it we could are you two going to spend the whole day blathering up there zal demanded impatiently or will you open up so i can come in and we can talk without lowing at one another like cattle on the plains open the gates abivard called to the men who served them to zal he said come aheadbut you alone for the time being i still remember what happened the last time you got men in my stronghold i wish i could give you back your silver but this thing zal raised murghabs head had already sent it on to the treasury only way for you to get repaid now is to fight and win that treasury for yourself he rode through the gates as they opened archers on the wall and in the courtyard covered him abivard shifted nervously from foot to foot the soldiers down at the bottom of the knob were all cased in iron and so were their horses the king of kingseven if he was now pimp of pimps as zal had called himcould afford to keep a great host of smiths busy turning iron strips into wire and wire into rings if they galloped up for all they were worth they might get in before the gates slammed and if they got in no telling how much damage they would do your majesty it were wiser for you to stay on the wall or on the stairs higher than a lance can reach abivard said wiser some ways maybe but not others without another word sharbaraz hurried down the stairway he had saidand abivard had seen to his and makurans dismaythat his father peroz had tended to strike first and ask questions later by that standard sharbaraz was very much his fathers son zal swung down from his horse though far from young he was still smooth and limber careless of the slush in the courtyard and of his coat and the armor under it he went down onto his belly before sharbaraz knocking his forehead against the cobblestones get up man sharbaraz told him youre zal son of sintrawk one of the senior guard captains out of mashiz aye thats me majesty zal sounded impressed and surprised that sharbaraz should know of him abivard was also impressed but less surprised he had already seen sharbarazs mastery of detail sharbaraz said when word i live does get out how many other officers will also rally to my call a good number majesty a good number zal went on the god willing enough so all youll have to do about smerdis is hunt him down and lop off his head as i did with the famous murghab only trouble is i dont know whether the god will be that willing always an interesting question isnt it sharbaraz turned to abivard this is your stronghold lord dihqan i would not presume to order you in its administration but do you judge that zals men may safely be admitted here the turn had offered sharbarazs back to zal at first that alarmed abivard it struck him as a foolish chance to take then he realized sharbaraz had done it on purpose that left him no less alarmed but he admired the nerve of the rightful king of kings zal made no move to snatch out the sword or dagger that hung from his belt seeing him pass that test abivard said very well majesty he asked zal would you sooner summon them yourself or shall i do it let me zal said theyre less likely to think its some kind of trap that way in fact given how far off they are why dont i just ride back to them and let them know alls well abivard felt a whole new set of qualms what was to keep zal and his heavily armored fighters from heading back to mashiz hunting them down would not be easy he shook his headif he had to reach that far for worries they werent worth the reach he nodded to zal the guard captain got back onto his horse and headed down the knob abivard glanced over to sharbaraz the rightful king of kings was not as calm as he looked he fidgeted most unregally that made abivard nervous again too he wanted to say something like this was your idea but he couldnt not to his sovereign zal was too far away for anyone in the stronghold to hear what he said to his men the cheer the squadron raised though rang sweet in abivards ears he felt himself grinning like a fool a broad relieved smile stretched over sharbarazs face too we got away with it he said looks that way abivard agreed doing his best to sound casual the horsemen rode up through the town singing loudly and discordantly abivard needed a little while to recognize the tune a song in praise of the king of kings sharbaraz pumped an excited fist in the air the truth brings men to my side he exclaimed and abivard nodded here comes someone else frada said pointing out toward the southwest i see him abivard answered if smerdis chose to hit us now hed bag most of the dihqans from the northwestern part of the realm if smerdis chose to hit us now his army would desert his younger brother said confidently how could it be otherwise now that everyone knows hes but a usurperand now that the rightful king of kings is freewho could want to fight for him hell be cowering in the palace at mashiz waiting for sharbaraz to come and put him out of his misery the god grant that youre right though he didnt want to detail them before frada abivard had his doubts the last time he had been sure something would work perfectly he had been riding north with peroz to settle the khamorth once and for all that had indeed worked but not the way peroz intended who comes one of the men at the gate called to the approaching noble and his retinue digor son of nadina dihqan of azarmidukht hills domain came the reply welcome to vek rud domain digor of the azarmidukht hills the guard replied know that sharbaraz king of kings has declared vek rud stronghold a truce ground no matter that you be at feud with your neighbor if you meet him here you meet him as a friend so sharbaraz has ordered so shall it be so shall it be digor echoed abivard couldnt tell whether the order angered him he kept his voice quiet and his face composed unlike a lot of the nobles gathering here he was neither unusually young nor unusually old either he hadnt gone onto the pardrayan steppe or he had come away safe again abivard took out a scrap of parchment a jar of ink and a reed pen he inked the pen lined through digors name and replaced the writing paraphernalia frada smiled our father would have approved he said what that im keeping a list abivard smiled too then pointed down to the mass of men who milled about in the courtyard id never manage to have all of them straight without it it took sharbarazs summons to bring them all here frada said and its taking sharbarazs truce call to keep em from yanking out swords and going at one another some of the feuds here go back to the days of the prophets four i know abivard said id hoped with so many new men heading domains some of them could have been forgotten but it doesnt look that way as long as they hate smerdis worse than their neighbors we should do well enough i hope youre right frada said how many more nobles do we expect to come three i think abivard consulted his parchment yes three thats right i dont think his majesty is in the mood to wait for them much longer frada pointed back to the living quarters where sharbaraz stared from a window he had been pacing restlessly for the past three days ever since the northwestern dihqans started flooding into vek rud domain in response to his summons just as well too abivard answered theyre eating us out of house and home and who knows how long theyll keep honoring the truce here one knife comes out and everyone will remember all the blood feudsand drag us into them our line has mostly stayed clear of such but a murder or two on the grounds of vek rud stronghold would be plenty to keep our greatgrandchildren watching their neighbors out of the corner of the eye youre right about that frada said getting into a feud is easy getting out of one again he shook his head sharbaraz evidently chose that moment to decide he would wait no more for the few remaining sluggards he came out of the living quarters and strode through the crowd in the courtyard toward the speaking platform abivards carpenters had built for him he had on no gorgeous robe like the one peroz had worn even on campaign just a plain caftan of heavy wool and a conical helm with a spray of feathers for a crest even so he drew mens notice as a lodestone draws chunks of iron the aimless milling in the courtyard became purposeful as the assembled nobles turned toward the platform to hear what he would say abivard and frada hurried down from their place atop the wall by the time they began jockeying for a place from which to listen to the rightful king of kings they would have had to commit an assault or rather several to get a good one abivard did not bother unlike the rest of the dihqans he had had the pleasure of sharbarazs company for some weeks so he already had a good notion of what the rightful king of kings was likely to say sharbaraz drew his sword and waved it overhead my friends he cried are we going to stay enslaved to the khamorth on the one hand and on the other to the bloodsucking worm in mashiz who drains us dry to make the nomads fat are we no the roar from the crowd echoed and reechoed off the strongholds stone walls filling the courtyard with tumult abivard felt his ears assailed from every direction are we going to let some wizened clerk defile with his stinking backside the seat that properly belongs to true men sharbaraz shouted or shall we take back whats ours and teach a lesson that will leave wouldbe traitors and usurpers shivering and sniveling a thousand years from now aye this time the roar was louder sharbaraz said by now youve no doubt heard how the usurper stole the thronedrugs in my supper and youve likely had him rob you saying hed pay the khamorth to stay on their own side of the degird tell me lords have the cursed plainsmen stayed on their side of the degird no now it wasnt a roar but a harsh cry of anger few along the border had not suffered from the nomads raids warming to his theme now that he had stirred his listeners sharbaraz went on so lords my friends will you leave on the throne this wretch who stole it by treachery and who lies with every breath he takes whose own officers began to desert him the moment his lies became clear no the crowd cried once more before sharbaraz could go on zal shouted to everybody and im not the only one wholl flee him as if he were the plague now that the truth comes out what honest man could wish to serve a liar none the assembled dihqans yelled again with that note of fury baying in their voices when a noble of makuran gave his word a man was supposed to be able to rely on it how much more did that apply to the king of kings so what say you lords sharbaraz asked do we ride south when the weather turns fine well sweep all before us ride into mashiz in triumph and set makuran back on its proper course ill not deny we shant be able to deal at once with the khamorth as they deserve but we can keep them out of our land and by the god once im on the throne we can settle scores with videssos if the easterners may the god pitch them into the void hadnt incited the nomads against us our brave warriors my bold father would yet live are you with me then in taking vengeance against the empire and its false god aye abivard yelled as loudly as he could settling videssos arrogance had ranked high with his father if sharbaraz chose to lead that way he would follow by the cries that rose around him most of the dihqans felt as he did the khamorth were close but to any man of makuran videssos was the enemy the nomads confederacies scattered like pomegranate seeds when the fruit was stamped underfoot now dangerous now harmless videssos endured sharbaraz plunged into the crowd men swarmed toward him to pound him on the back clasp his hand pledge loyalty forever and boast of the mincemeat they would make of any of smerdis men misguided enough to stand against them caught up in the moment abivard and frada pushed through the nobles toward the rightful king of kings along with everyone else working as a team they made good progress you know were foolish to be doing this frada said after an exchange of elbows with some noble from a hundred farsangs west of vek rud domain the king of kings has been here a long time and hell stay longer still true but what of afterward abivard said when the war is won hell go live in mashiz and never leave save to go on campaign and well likely end up back here that doesnt have to be so not when hes wed to our sister frada said we have his ear on account of that we could make our own place at the capital abivard grunted dubiously what would become of the domain then the kings favorany kings favor be he ever so goodwaxes and wanes like the moon land goes on forever and this land is ours frada laughed out loud i listen to you and its as if father were still here to sound like a sage ha abivard said pleased at the compliment and worried he couldnt live up to it whatever other reply he might have made turned into a hissed exclamation of pain when a dihqan with a beard braided into three strands stomped on his foot and shoved him aside frada caught the fellow with an elbow in the belly that folded him up like a fan the two brothers grinned at each other only a few nobles stood between them and sharbaraz around the rightful king of kings moving at all was hard for those who had already spoken with him were trying to get away while those who still wanted to gain his ear pushed in at them a couple of dihqans squeezed out between abivard and fradaand incidentally almost knocked over the fellow who had trampled abivards instepletting them gain another couple of steps toward their sovereign men came at sharbaraz from all directions just standing before him did not mean you could speak with him for dihqans also shouted at him from behind and both sides he kept turning his head and twisting about like a man playing mallet and ballwary lest an opponent clout him not the ball with his mallet when abivard caught his eye at last sharbaraz threw his arms wide as if to encompass the whole packed courtyard theyre mine he cried well sweep smerdis pimp of pimps he had zestfully stolen zals mocking title for his rival out of mashiz like a servant woman getting the dust from a storeroom once thats done well turn on videssos and duck your majesty abivard and frada cried together sharbaraz might not have seen battle but he had a warriors reflexes without gaping or asking questions he started to throw himself flat that saved his life the knife the man behind him wielded cut his robe and scored a bleeding line across his shoulder but did not slide between his ribs to find his heart the god curse you curse your house straight to the void the dihqan cried drawing back his arm for another stab the fellow beside him horror on his face seized it before he could bring it forward again abivard and frada both leapt on the wouldbe assassin and wrestled him to the ground he fought like a man possessed even after the nobles forced the knife from his hand only the weight of men on top of him finally made him quit by crushing the air from his lungs since most of those men were on top of abivard too he struggled for every breath he took haul him up sharbaraz said when the dihqan was subdued one at a time the nobles who had piled onto him got off abivard and frada clutched him and yanked him to his feet when he started to try to break free someone hit him in the pit of the stomach that made him double up and cost him the wind he had just regained sharbaraz had his right hand clapped to his left shoulder blood stained his robe and trickled out between his fingers but the wound was at the top of the shoulder and his left arm and hand worked he had that hand clenched into a tight fist against the pain abivard dared hope the wound less than serious the rightful king of kings stared at his attacker what did i do to you prypat to deserve your knife in my back even after narrowly escaping death he remembered his assailants name prypats face twisted why shouldnt i kill you he said in hitching gasps thanks to your cursed sire my own father my grandfather all my elder brothers are ravens fodder and wolves meat their gear plunder for the plainsmen every man here holds blood debt against you did he but have the wit to see it sharbaraz shook his head then grimaced the motion must have hurt not so he replied as if arguing in court rather than passing judgment on the man who had tried to murder him my father acted as he thought best for makuran no man is perfect the god holds that for himself but the campaign did not fail through malice nor did the king of kings murder your kin i grieve that they fell i grieve that so many from all the realm fell but my house incurred no blood debt on account of it lie all you likemy kin still lie dead prypat said and youll join them someone cried to him the dihqans snarled like angry dogs fear wasnt the least part of that abivard judged here they had come to vek rud stronghold to join sharbaraz against smerdis had prypat killed sharbaraz the revolt against mashiz would have died with him none of the northwestern men had the force of character to make a king of kings but when smerdis learned they had assembled here he would have taken vengeance just the same no wonder they were so ready to condemn prypat out of hand sharbaraz asked him have you any reason i shouldnt order your head stricken off that in itself was a mercy anyone who tried to slay the king of kings was liable to death with as much pain and ingenuity as his torturers could devise but here as everywhere else sharbaraz was straightforward direct averse to wasting time prypat tried to spit on him then knelt and bent his head i die proud for i sought to restore my clans pride knifing a man in the back is nothing to be proud of blood still welled between sharbarazs fingers he raised his voice to call to the nobles who carries a heavy sword abivard did but he hesitated not eager to speak up killing a man in battle was one thing killing him in cold bloodeven if he was passionately eager to dieanother while abivard tried to nerve himself zal beat him to it i do your majesty and practice using it for justice as well strike then sharbaraz said so did prypat at the same time that seemed to nonplus the rightful king of kings but he took his right hand off his wound for a moment to beckon zal forward prypat waited without moving as the officer came up drew the sword swung it up with both hands on the hilt and brought it down the stroke was clean prypats head sprang from his shoulders his body convulsed blood fountained over the cobbles for the few seconds his heart needed to realize he was dead dispose of the carrion if you please sharbaraz said to abivard he swayed where he stood abivard rushed to support him here come with me majesty he said guiding sharbaraz back toward the living quarters wed best learn how badly youre hurt servants exclaimed in dismay when they saw what had happened at abivards barked orders they arranged pillows in the hallway just inside the entrance lets lay you down majesty abivard said to sharbaraz who half squatted half toppled down onto the cushions without abivards asking for them a serving woman fetched him a bowl of water and some rags he made the tear in sharbarazs robe bigger so he could get a good look at the wound sharbaraz tried to twist his neck and look down the side of his face so he could see it too he succeeded only in making himself hurt worse how is it he asked abivard his voice shaky now that he didnt have to keep up a front for the assembled dihqans not as bad as i thought abivard answered its long aye but not deep and its bled freely so its less likely to fester he turned and as he had hoped found the serving woman hovering behind him he told her fetch me the wound paintyou know the one i mean she nodded and hurried away will it hurt sharbaraz asked anxious as a boy with a barked shin not too much majesty i hope abivard answered its wine and honey and fineground myrrh after i put it on ill cover the wound with grease and bandage you up you should be all right if you dont try to do too much with that arm for the next few days i hope he added to himself in spite of medicines you never could tell what would happen when a man got hurt the serving woman returned handing abivard a small pot as he worked the stopper free she said lord the lady your sisteryour majestys wife she added working up the nerve to speak to sharbaraz wants to know what befell and how the king of kings fares tell her im fine sharbaraz said at once word travels fast tell her he got cut but i think hell be fine abivard said a qualified endorsement he upended the pot above sharbarazs shoulder the medicine slowly poured out sharbaraz hissed when it touched the wound bring me some lard before you go speak with denak abivard told the serving woman again she rushed to obey when abivard had treated the cut to his satisfaction he put a bandage pad on top of it and tied the pad in place with a rag that went around sharbarazs shoulder and armpit the rightful king of kings sighed to have the ordeal done then said i find myself in your debt yet again nonsense your majesty abivard poured a cupful of red wine drink this the magicians say it builds blood being like blood itself ive heard that myself i dont know whether its true but ill gladly drink the wine any which way sharbaraz fit action to word by the god thats better going down my throat than splashed on my shoulder he thrust the cup back at abivard i think i may have lost enough to need more building as abivard poured again the serving woman returned once more and said your majesty lord may it please the both of you the lady denak says she wants to see you as soon as may beand if thats not soonest shell come out to do it sharbaraz looked at abivard they both knew denak was capable of doing just that and both knew the scandal it would create among the dihqans would not help the rightful king of kings cause sharbaraz said lady tell my wife i shall see her directly in my chamber the serving woman beamed at being treated as if of noble blood she trotted out of the kitchens yet again sharbaraz set his jaw and got to his feet here your majesty lean on me abivard said you dont want to start yourself bleeding hard again by trying to do too much i suppose not sharbaraz said although he didnt sound quite sure but he put his right arm on abivards shoulder and let the dihqan take a good deal of his weight as they made their way down the halls of the living quarters to the chamber he was using as his own wait here abivard said when they reached it ill be back with denak fast as i can sharbaraz nodded and sank onto the bed with a groan he did his best to stifle in spite of the fortifying wine he looked very pale denak stood impatiently tapping her foot at the door between abivards bedchamber and the womens quarters took you long enough she said when abivard opened that door no talking around it nowhow is he wounded abivard answered he can still use the arm if he heals properly he should be fine but for the scar denak searched his face you wouldnt lie to me no you wouldnt not when ill see for myself as fast as we can walk thereand would you walk a little faster please in spite of her brittle tone something eased in her step in the set of her shoulders with every step she took as much to herself as to abivard she went on life wouldnt be worth living without him abivard didnt answer again he wanted to take his sister in his arms and hold her to try to make her feel better but denak went hard as stone if anyone save sharbaraz man or woman tried to embrace her without sharbarazs quick thinking she would have reckoned her honor altogether lost and without her honor abivard didnt think she cared to live he thanked the god that she had been able to piece together as much of her life as she had when she saw sharbaraz flat on the bed his face the color of parchment she gasped and swayed before visibly gathering herself what happened she demanded of him ive already heard three different tales i dont doubt that sharbaraz managed a smile that was less than half grimace one of the dihqans decided i was to blame for what his clan suffered out on the steppe and reckoned to avenge himself on me he had courage ive never seen nor heard of a mans dying better after he failed his detached attitude won him no points from denak he might have murdered you and youre talking about how brave he was its a good thing hes dead if hed done what he set out to do her voice all but broke i dont know what i would have done sharbaraz sat up on the bed abivard would have pushed him back down but denak beat him to it the ease with which he flattened out again told of the wound he had suffered still his second attempt at a smile came closer to the genuine article than the first one had he said i can afford to be generous since im alive if i were dead and he still lived id be less forgiving denak stared at him then let out a strangled snort now i begin to believe youll get better no dying man could make such foolish jokes thank you my dear sharbaraz sounded a bit stronger but he didnt try to rise again he went on your brother here put me in his debt three more times by shouting a warning by helping to wrestle the knifeman to the ground and for his excellent doctoring if i do pull through it will be because of him your majesty is too kind abivard murmured no hes not denak said if you acted the proper hero the world should know of it the dihqans will take word back to their domains but we ought to put a minstrel to singing your praises too do you know what father would say if he heard you talking of such things abivard said flushing first hed laugh till he cried then hed paddle your backside for having the crust to even think of paying a minstrel to praise me for something it was my duty to do invoking godarz usually ended an argument as effectively as slamming a door this time though denak shook her head father was a fine dihqan abivard none better but he never involved himself in the affairs of the realm as a whole youve gone from being an ordinary dihqan like him to a man close to the throne you rescued sharbaraz and you became his brotherinlaw all in the space of a day when he takes back his throne you think some dihqans and most marzbans wont resent you for an upstart the more you show you deserve your place at his right hand the likelier you are to keep it nothing wrong with praising the courage you really did show to help you build your fame denak set hands on hips and looked defiance at abivard before he could reply sharbaraz said shes right the court works like the womens quarters though it may be worse what you are is not nearly so important as what people think you are and what people think the king of kings thinks you are godarz had said things like that most often with a sardonic gleam in his eye abivard had never expected to have to worry about them now he was hearing them from his sister and in a position where he had to pay attention to her even ifand partly becauseshe was a woman he remembered the talk hed had with frada not long before prypat tried to knife sharbaraz he might want to ignore the intrigues of mashiz but they would not ignore him sharbaraz said brotherinlaw of mine one thing has to happen before you start worrying about such things whats that abivard asked we have to win spring painted the fields around vek rud stronghold with a green that while it wouldnt last long was lovely to look at for the time being so abivard found it most years at any rate not now turning to frada he said by the god ill be glad when we ride south tomorrow another fortnight of feeding the fighters and their horses and our storehouses would be empty our own folk will need food too especially if the harvest isnt a good one aye frada took a couple of paces along the walkway kicking at the stone under his feet i wish i were coming with you when you ride all i ever do it seems is get left behind dont complain about that abivard said sharply if you hadnt been left behind last summer odds are you wouldnt be alive to whine about it now weve been over this ground a thousand times i have to ride with sharbaraz and that means you have to stay here and protect the domain from whatever comes against it be that smerdis men or pradtaks or the khamorth frada still looked mutinous at the start of winter you were saying land was most important because it lasted if thats so you ought to stay here to watch the land while i go out and fight i hadnt thought through the politics then abivard said reluctant to admit denak had played a big part in making him change his mind smerdis will know by now the part i played in freeing sharbaraz from nalgis crag stronghold for better or worse i rise and fall with the rightful king of kings if im not at his side people will say its because im afraid i cant have that how can anyone say youre afraid of anything when theyre probably singing that new song about you in videssos by now abivards ears got hot the songs about you too he said feebly no its not my names in it a time or three but its about you much to abivards relief frada didnt sound jealous such things would have torn apart some clans but godarz had made jealousy among his sons a sin to rank with blasphemy frada went on itll be your way of course how can i deny you know more about whats best than i do i just wish i could shove a lance into smerdis myself when we ride against videssos youll have your chance abivard said frada nodded everyone would ride against makurans great enemy looksharbaraz has come out frada said sticking an elbow into abivards ribs youd better go down into the courtyard with him you know as well as i do that mother will pitch a fit if the ceremony doesnt come off perfectly right you are abivard went down the stone stairs and took his place alongside the rightful king of kings the last time the women of vek rud stronghold had come forth from their quarters was the summer before when he had stood with his father and brother and half brothers of them all only he had got home alive and now his mother and sister and half sisters and wives had to wish him good fortune as he set out on another campaign a womans life was anything but easy the door to the living quarters opened denak and burzoe came out together as they had before this time though denak preceded her mother as they walked toward the waiting men as principal wife to the king of kings she held higher ceremonial rank than anyone merely of vek rud domain she nodded to abivard then passed him to take her place by sharbaraz burzoe stood in front of abivard her face which had seemed calm at first glance showed deep and abiding anger when he looked more closely he scratched his head could his mother be offended because denak took precedence over her it seemed out of character behind burzoe came roshnani like burzoes her face appeared calm until abivard got a good look at it where his mother hid anger though his principal wife was trying to concealmirth excitement he couldnt quite tell and wondered what new convulsion had shaken the womens quarters to set burzoe at odds with denakand with roshnani too he saw for his mothers fury plainly included both of them not wanting to borrow trouble he didnt ask he might find out or the trouble might blow over without his ever learning what had gone wrong he hoped it would whatever it was the rest of his wives and his young half sisters didnt look to know anything about it they stared and chattered quietly among themselves enjoying the chance to see something wider than the halls of the womens quarters for them this was a pleasant outing nothing more burzoe turned toward denak her lips tightened slightly as she did so maybe she was angry her daughter had usurped her place at the head of the ceremony abivard clicked his tongue between his teeth he hadnt thought her so petty denak said we are met here today to bid our men safety and good fortune as they travel off to war burzoe stirred but did not speak fury seemed to radiate from her in waves had it been heat ganzak might have set her in the smithy in place of his furnace denak went on we shall surely triumph for the god stretches forth her arms to protect those whose cause is just as ours is a stir of applause ran through the men and women who listened to her abivard joined it though he was not so convinced by what she said as he would have been before the previous summer how had the god protected those who followed peroz into pardraya the short answer was none too well denak took a step back beckoned to burzoe with exquisite grace her mother prostrated herself before sharbaraz the god keep you safe majesty she said and rose she embraced abivard the god watch over you as she did before words gesturesall unexceptionable what lay behind them abivard wished he could disrupt the ceremony to inquire of burzoe but custom inhibited him no less than it had pradtak back at nalgis crag stronghold in her turn burzoe stepped back and nodded to roshnani polite as usual roshnani nodded back but her gaze went to denak their eyes met suddenly scenting conspiracy abivard wondered what his sister and principal wife had cooked up between them whatever it was his mother didnt like it as burzoe had roshnani gave the king of kings his ceremonial due and wished him good fortune then she hugged abivard tighter than decorum called for he didnt mindon the contrary she said the god keep you safe from all danger what ill think about most is coming home to you he answered for some reason that seemed to startle his principal wife but she managed a smile in return abivard walked down the line of waiting women accepting the best wishes of his other wives and half sisters if the god listened to a tenth of their prayers he would live forever and be richer than three kings of kings rolled together his youngest half sister started back toward the living quarters the procession that had emerged withdrew in reverse order those who had come out first going in last soon burzoes turn came she let out a scornful sniff and her back stiff with pride stalked away toward the open door of the living quarters roshnani and denak still stood in the courtyard abivard needed perhaps longer than he should have to realize they didnt intend to go back to the womens quarters what are you doing his voice came out a foolish squeak roshnani and denak looked at each other again sure enough the two of them had come up with a plot together denak spoke for them both my brother my husband she turned to sharbaraz we are going to come with you what to fight are you mad sharbaraz said no not to fight majesty may it please you roshnani answered we would fight for you the god knows but we have not the skill and training to do it well we would be more liability than asset but every army has its baggage train the minstrels are not in the habit of singing of itit lacks glamour when set beside those whose only duty is to go into battlebut they say enough for us to know it exists and know an army would starve or run out of arrows without one and we know one more wagon a wagon bearing the two of us would not slow the host nor endanger your cause the rightful king of kings gaped he hadnt expected reasoning as careful as that of a courtier whod had a tutor from videssos but then he hadnt truly made roshnanis acquaintance till this moment he started to say something then stopped and sent abivard a look of appeal its against all custom abivard said the best argument he could come up with on the spur of the moment to himself he added its also getting ahead of the promise i made you of more freedom to move around after the war with smerdis was over he couldnt say that aloud because he didnt want to admit he had made the promise he did add no wonder mother is furious at the two of you if anyone embodied makuraner propriety burzoe was that woman roshnani bore up under the charge with equanimity burzoe was but her motherinlaw to be respected yes but not the guardian of proper behavior since childhood the accusation hit denak harder but she was the one who answered it was against propriety for smerdis to steal the throne from him to whom it rightfully belongs it was against custom for me a woman to set his rescue in motion she looked down at the ground of necessity she had done other things that went against custom too things that ate at her still despite the honor sharbaraz had shown her she did not speak of them in public but the people among whom the argument centered knew what they were sharbaraz said what possible good could the two of you bring that would outweigh not only setting custom aside but also setting men aside to protect you when the fighting starts when the king of kings retreated from absolute rejection abivard knew the war was lost but it still had to be played out you value our counsel when we are in a stronghold roshnani said do we suddenly lose our wits when were in the field abivard planned with both denak and meaye and with his mother toobefore he left to set your majesty free having the two of you along would scandalize the dihqans who back me sharbaraz said i already told roshnani as much abivard agreed enough to make them head back to their domains denak said enough to make them go over to smerdis do you really believe that her tone said she didnt not for a moment it also said she didnt think sharbaraz did either she might not have known him long but she had come to know him well what would you say if i forbid it he asked had he simply forbid it that would have been that making it a hypothetical question was to abivard another sign he would yield it probably was for denak too but she gave no hint of that saying in a meek voice most unlike the one she usually used i would obey your majesty of course a likely story sharbaraz said he had come to know denak too he turned to abivard well brotherinlaw of mine what shall we do with em youre asking me abivard said appalled as far as im concerned we can give them both gilded corselets and style em generals my guess is that theyd do a better job than three quarters of the men you might name my guess is that youre right sharbaraz shook his head my father would pitch a fit at thishe took only tarts on campaign and not many of thembut my father is dead im going to say aye to your sister abivard what will you say to your wife if you want to be stern and stodgy go ahead he seemed to mean abivard knew he couldnt get away with it not if he wanted peace in the womens quarters ever again he chose the most graceful surrender he could find where you lead majesty i shall follow roshnanis face lit up like the summer sun at noon thank you she said quietly a chance at seeing the world tempts me to do something most publicly indecorous to show how grateful i am you and denak have already been indecorous enough for any three dozen women i could think of abivard growled in his severest tones his principal wife and sister hung their heads and looked abashed why not they had won what they wanted abivard started to scold them some more but then got to wondering whether something publicly indecorous might not be privately enjoyable that distracted him enough that the scolding never got delivered in the saddle and southbound abivard rode joyfully toward civil war the rightful king of kings rode at his side on a horse from his stables a good copy of the lion banner of makuran floated at the fore of sharbarazs host warriors rode by clan each man most comfortable with comrades from the same domain abivard worried about how well they would fight as a unit but reflected that perozs army which had ridden forth against the khamorth was no more tightly organized which meant smerdis troops werent likely to be either when he remarked on that sharbaraz said no i dont expect them to be if we were riding against videssians id worry about how loosejointed our arrangements are but they wont hurt us against our own countrymen how are the videssians different abivard asked ive heard endless tales of them but no two the same my guess is that thats because of how different they are sharbaraz answered seriously they care nothing for clans when they fight but go here and there in big blocks to the sound of their officers horns and drums they might as well be so many cups on the rim of a water wheel or some other piece of machinery they take discipline better than our men thats certain why dont they sweep everything before them then abivard asked the picture sharbaraz had painted was an intimidating one two main reasons the rightful king of kings answered first they prefer the bow to the lance which means a strong charge into their midst will often scatter em and second and more important they may have discipline but they dont have our fire they fight as if to win points in a game not for the sake of it and often theyll yield or flee where we might go on and win abivard filed the lore away in his mind he was building himself a picture of the foes he had never seen against the day when makurans internal strife ended and sharbaraz would begin to settle scores much of the empire of videssos bordered the sea abivard wondered if he would meet the third part of tanshars prophecy there no way to know that but to await the day he glanced back toward the baggage train where tanshar rode with several other fortunetellers and wizards their lords had brought with the warriors abivard wondered if the men could ward the army against the more polished magicians smerdis might gather from mashiz he was glad to have tanshar along every familiar face was welcome also traveling with the baggage train was a wagon that carried not wheat or smoked mutton or hay for the horses or arrows neatly tied in sheaves of twenty to fit into quivers and bowcases but his sister his principal wife and a couple of serving women from vek rud stronghold he had nothing but misgivings about the venture but hoped it would turn out wellor not too disastrously for the time being the horses were not eating much of the fodder the army had brought along for them in spring even the dun land between oases and rivers took on a coat of green soon the sun would bake it dry again but the animals could graze and nibble while it lasted that was as well for sharbarazs host swelled with every new domain it approached horsemen flocked to his banner calling down curses on smerdis usurping gray head when yet another such contingent rode in abivard exclaimed to sharbaraz majesty this is no campaign just a triumphal procession good sharbaraz answered we threw away too many lives against the plainsmen last summer we cant afford to squander more in civil war lest winning prove near as costly as losing we still need to protect ourselves from our foes and take vengeance on them in fact ive even sent a rider on ahead to smerdis to tell him ill spare his worthless life if he gives up the throne without a fight abivard weighed that nodding i think you did well he never showed ambition till the once and youd watch him so close hed never get another chance wouldnt i sharbaraz said he couldnt sit his arse down in the backhouse without an eye on him but before sharbaraz formally heard from his rival for the throne he got his answer another way off to the east the snowcapped peaks of the dilbat mountains showed the way southward the army would have to skirt them and then come back up on the far side of the range to approach mashiz already the weather was noticeably hotter than abivard would have expected so early in the season a scout came galloping back toward the main body of sharbarazs host shouting theres troopers up ahead looking for a fight they shot enough arrows at me to make a goodsize tree the gods own mercy i wasnt pincushioned looking for a fight are they sharbaraz said grimly i think we shall oblige them horns blared drums thudded from what sharbaraz had said to abivard that would have been plenty to move units of a videssian army as if they were pieces going from square to square on a gameboard abivard wished his countrymen were as smooth zal and his squadron of ironclad professionals came forward front and center to form the spearhead of the force despite martial music and endless shouts both from their own dihqans and from the officers sharbaraz had appointed most of the rest of the warriors at least to abivards jaundiced eye did more milling about than forming but by the time he saw dust ahead the host had shaken itself out into a battle line of sorts zal shouted frantically at anyone who would listen the only trouble was next to nobody listened a raw army with raw officers wouldnt win battles by discipline and maneuver courage and fury and numbers would have to do instead okhos rode by his fuzzbearded face alight with excitement he drew his sword and flourished it to abivard he almost cut off the ear of the man next to him but never noticed roshnanis younger brother said well slaughter them all and wade in their blood minstrels sang such verses when they wandered from stronghold to stronghold hoping to cadge a nights supper on the strength of their songs grown men who knew war smiled at them and enjoyed the poetry without taking it seriously trouble was okhos wasnt a grown man he had fewer summers behind him than frada minstrels verses were all he knew of the battlefield or had been until the khamorth started raiding his domain then abivard stopped worrying about how his brotherinlaw would fare and started worrying about himself on across the flat ground came smerdis army growing closer faster than abivard would have thought possible at their fore flew the lion banner of makuran beside abivard sharbaraz murmured the curse of civil war both sides bearing the same emblem aye abivard said though that was more philosophical than he felt like being with battle fast approaching well if they dont see for themselves that they picked the wrong man to follow well have to show them the oncoming troops seemed resolute enough abivard filled his lungs and shouted defiance at them sharbaraaaz in an instant the whole host took up the cry it drowned in a cacophony of hatred whatever signals officers and musicians were trying to give at last the nobles of the northwest and their retainers had a chance to come to grips with the man who had not only stolen the throne but stolen their money and given it to the barbarians who had killed their kinwithout keeping those barbarians off their lands afterward as promised inevitably an answering cry came back smerdis as inevitably it sounded effete and puny to abivard who was less than an unbiased witness he wondered how men could still lay their lives on the line for a ruler who had proved himself both thief and liar however they managed it support smerdis they did arrows began to fly lanceheads came down in a glittering wave abivard picked a fellow in the opposite line as a target and spurred his horse into a full gallop sharbaraz he yelled again the two armies collided with a great metallic clangor abivards charge missed its man he had swerved aside to fight someone else a lance glanced off abivards shield he felt the impact all the way up to his shoulder had the hit been squarer it might have unhorsed him a lancers main weapon was the force he could put behind his blow from the weight and speed of his charging horse with that momentum spent after the first impact the battle turned into a melee with riders stabbing with lances slashing with swords and trying to use their horses to throw their foes mountsand their foesoff balance for easy destruction sharbaraz fought in the middle of the press laying about him with the broken stub of a lance he clouted an enemy in the side of the head the fellow was wearing a helm but the blow stunned him even so sharbaraz hit him again this time full in the face dripping blood he slid out of the saddle to be trampled if he still lived after those two blows sharbaraz shouted in triumph abivard tried to fight his way toward his sovereign if the rightful king of kings went down the battle even if a victory would still prove a final defeat he had tried to talk sharbaraz out of fighting in the front ranksas well tell the moon not to go from new to full and back again as to have him listen an armored warrior who shouted smerdis got between abivard and the king of kings the soldier must have lost his lance or had it break to pieces too small to be useful for he hacked at the shaft of abivards lance with his sword sparks flew as the blade belled against the strip of iron that armored the shaft against such misfortune abivard drew back the lance and thrust with it the enemy ducked and cut at it again by then they were almost breast to breast abivard tried to smash the fellow in the face with the spiked boss to his shield a moment later he counted himself lucky not to get similarly smashed he and smerdis follower cursed and strained and struggled until someoneabivard never knew whoslashed the other fellows horse when it screamed and reared abivard speared its rider he screamed too and went on screaming after abivard yanked out the lance his cry of agony was all but lost among many othersand cries of triumph and of hatredthat dinned over the battlefield i wonder how this fight is going abivard muttered he was too busy trying to stay alive to have much feel for the course of the action as a whole had he advanced since his charge ended or had he and sharbarazs men given ground he couldnt tell just getting back up with the rightful king of kings seemed hard enough at the moment when he finally made it to the king of kings side sharbaraz shouted at him how fare we i hoped you knew abivard answered in some dismay sharbaraz grimaced this isnt as easy as we hoped it would be they arent falling all over themselves to desert are they what did you say majesty abivard hadnt heard all of that he had been busy fending off one of smerdis lancers only when the fellow sullenly drew back could he pay attention once more never mind sharbaraz told him by now the king of kings lance was long gone his sword had blood on the blade for one of the rare times since abivard had known him he looked unsure what to do next the stubborn resistance smerdis men were putting up seemed to baffle him then just as he was starting to give orders for another push against the foe wild panicfilled shouts ripped through the left wing of smerdis army some men were crying treason but more yelled sharbaraz they turned on the warriors still loyal to smerdis and attacked them along with sharbarazs soldiers with its left in chaos smerdis army quickly unraveled men at the center and right seeing their position turned either threw down their weapons and surrendered or wheeled in flight here and there stubborn rearguard bands threw themselves away to help their comrades escape press them sharbaraz cried dont let them get away now that striking hard had been rewarded he was back in his element urging on his warriors to make their victory as complete as they could for all his urging though a good part of smerdis army broke free and fled south his own force had fought too hard through the morning to make the grinding pursuit that might have destroyed the enemy for good and all at last he seemed to realize that and broke off the chase if i order them to do something they cant next time they may not listen to me when i tell them to do something they can he explained to abivard we did have a solid victory there abivard answered its not what i wanted sharbaraz said i had in mind to smash the usurpers men so thoroughly no one would think of standing against me after this just a victory isnt enough then he moderated his tone but it will have to do and its ever so much better than getting beat isnt that the truth abivard said sharbaraz said i want to question some of the men we caught who fought so hard against us i want to learn how smerdis managed to keep them loyal after they learned i hadnt given up my throne of my own free will the sooner i find out the sooner i can do something about it aye abivard said but his voice was abstracted he had only half heard the rightful king of kings he was looking over the field and discovering for the first time the hideous flotsam and jetsam a large battle leaves behind he had not seen the aftermath of the fight on the pardrayan steppe he had fled to keep from becoming part of it the other fights in which he had joined were only skirmishes what came after them was like this in kind but not in degree the magnitude of suffering spread out over a farsang of ground appalled him men with holes in them or faces hacked away or hands severed or entrails spilled lay in ungraceful death amid pools of blood already going from scarlet to black with flies buzzing around them and ravens spiraling down from the sky to peck at their blindly staring eyes and other dainties the battlefield smelled something like a slaughterhouse something like a latrine the crumpled shapes of dead horses cropped up here and there amid the human wreckage abivard pitied them more than the soldiers they hadnt had any idea why they died but worse than the killed men or beasts were the wounded hurt horses screamed with the terrible sopranos of women in agony men groaned and howled and cursed and wailed and wept and bled and tried to bandage themselves and begged for aid or their mothers or death or all three at once and crawled toward other men whom they hoped would help them and other men or jackals who walked on two legs wandered over the field looking for whatever they could carry away and making sure that none of those they robbed would live to avenge themselves still others to their credit did what they could for the injured stitching bandaging and setting broken bones a couple of the village wizards had healing among their talents they could treat wounds that would have proved fatal save for their aid but at terrible cost to themselves one of them his hands covered with the blood of a man he had just brought back from the brink of death got up from the ground where he had knelt took a couple of steps toward another wounded warrior and pitched forward onto his face in a faint looking at this i wish we hadnt brought our wives abivard said even if they dont picture us among the fallen theyll never be easy in their minds about the chances of war sharbaraz looked back toward the baggage train which lay well to the rear of the actual fighting that distance seemed to ease his mind it will be all right he said they cant have seen too much abivard hoped he was right the prisoner wore only ragged linen drawers one of sharbarazs followers who had started the day in boiled leatheror perhaps in just his caftannow had a fine suit of mail from the royal armories the captured warrior held a dirty rag around a cut on his arm he looked tired and frightened his eyes enormous in a long dark face realizing who sharbaraz was frightened him even more before the guards who had manhandled him into sharbarazs presence could cast him down to the ground he prostrated himself of his own accord may your years be long and your realm increase majesty he choked out sharbaraz turned to abivard he says that now the rightful king of kings observed this morning though hed cheerfully have speared me out of the saddle amazing what a change a few hours can bring abivard agreed the prisoner ground his face into the dust majesty forgive he wailed why should i sharbaraz growled once you knew id not abandoned my throne of my own free will how could you have the brass to fight against me forgive the prisoner said majesty i am a poor man and ignorant and i know nothing save what my officers tell me they saidi give you their very words by the god i swear itthey said you had indeed given up the throne of your own accord and then wickedly changed your mind like a woman who says i want my red shoes no my blue ones they said you could not go back on an oath you swore that the god would not smile on makuran if you seized the rule now of course i see this is not so truly i do he dared raise his face a couple of inches to peer anxiously at sharbaraz take him away back with the others sharbaraz told the guards they hauled the prisoner to his feet and dragged him off the rightful king of kings let out a long weary sigh and turned to abivard another one another one abivard echoed weve heardwhat six now they all sing the same song so they do sharbaraz paced back and forth kicking up dirt smerdis may he drop into the void this instant is more clever than i gave him credit for this tale of my renouncing my oath of abdication may be a lie from top to bottom but it gives those who believe it a reason to fight for him and against me i thought his forces would crumble at the first touch like salt sculptures in the rain but it may prove harder than that aye abivard said mournfully if that one band hadnt gone over to you we might still be fightingor we might have lost this had crossed my mind sharbaraz admitted adding a moment later however much i wish it hadnt he sighed again i want pocket bread filled with raisins and cheese and onions and i want a great huge cup of wine then ill show myself to denak so shell know i came through alive and well but what i want most is a good nights sleep ive never been so worn in my life it must be the terror slowly leaking out of me your majesty those all strike me as excellent choices abivard said though id sooner have sausage than raisins with my onions and cheese we may just be able to grant you so much leeway sharbaraz said both men laughed roshnani said almost i wish id stayed back at the stronghold what war truly is doesnt look much like what the minstrels sing of her eyes which looked larger than they were in the dim lamplight of abivards tent filled with horror at what she had seen and heard so much anguish i told you so bubbled up in abivards mind he left the words unsaid they would have done no good in any case he couldnt keep his principal wife from seeing what she had seen now that she was here and he couldnt send her back to vek rud domain godarz would have said something like now that youve mounted the horse youd better ride it since he couldnt twit her he said im glad your brother only took a couple of small cuts hell be fine im sure yes so am i roshnani said relief in her voice he was so proud of himself when he came back to see me yesterday after the battle and he looked as if hed enjoyed himself in the fighting she shook her head i cant say i understand that hes young yet abivard said i thought id surely live forever right up till the moment things went wrong on the steppe last year roshnani reached out to set a hand on his arm women always know things can go wrong we wonder sometimes at the folly of men looking back i wonder at some of our folly too abivard said thinking smerdis men would give up or go over to us without much fight for instance the war will be harder than we reckoned on when we set out from the stronghold thats not what i meant roshnani said in some exasperation the whole idea oh whats the use i just have to hope we win the fight and that you and okhos and sharbaraz come through it safe of course we will abivard said stoutly the groans of the wounded that pierced the wool tent cloth like arrows piercing flesh turned his reassurances to the pious hopes they were roshnani didnt say that not with words she was not one who sought to get her way by nagging her husband until he finally yielded abivards will was as well warded against nagging as nalgis crag stronghold against siege but somethinghe could not have said precisely whatchanged in her face perhaps her eyes slipped from his for a moment at a particularly poignant cry of pain if they did he didnt notice not with the top of his mind but he did come to know he had done nothing to allay her fears he was irked to hear how defensive he sounded as he continued any which way what we stand to gain is worth the risk or would you sooner live under smerdis and see all our arkets flow across the degird to the nomads of course not she said at once she was a dihqans daughter now he recognized the expression she wore calculation the same sort he would have used in deciding if he wanted to pay a horsetraders price for a fouryearold gelding if the three of you live and we win then youre right but if any of you falls or if we lose then youre not and since you and sharbaraz and okhos are all right at the fore would you have us hang back abivard demanded flicked on his pride for my sake for your own sake indeed i would roshnani answered then she sighed if you did though that would make the army lose spirit which would in turn make you likelier to be hurt finding the right thing to do isnt always easy we chased that rabbit round the bush when we were talking about howor ifyoud be able to come out of the womens quarters abivard laughed after a while you quit chasingyou jumped over the bush and squashed poor bunny flat or how else did you and denak get to come along with the host roshnani laughed too you take it with better will than i thought you would most men i think would still be angry at me whats the point to that abivard said its done youve won and now i try to make the best i can of it just as i did when i came back from the steppe last summer hmm roshnani said i dont think i fancy being compared to the khamorth and you didnt lose a battle to me because youd already said you were giving up the war i should hope so abivard said you and denak outgeneraled me as neatly as the plainsmen bested peroz and what of it roshnani asked has the army gone to pieces because of it has one dihqan even one warrior with no armor no bow and a spavined nag gone over to smerdis because denak and i are here have we turned the campaign into a disaster for sharbaraz no and no and no abivard admitted we might have done better with the two of you commanding our right and left wings i dont think the officers we had out there distinguished themselves he waited for roshnani to use the opening he had given her to tax him about the iniquities and inequities of the womens quarters and to get him to admit how unjust they were she did nothing of the kind but asked instead about how the wounded were faring only later did he stop to think that if her arguments sprang to life in his mind without her having to say a word she had already won a big part of the battle the farther south and east sharbarazs army advanced the more abivard had the feeling he was not in the makuran he had always known the new recruits who rallied to sharbarazs banner spoke with what he thought of as a lazy accent wore caftans that struck his eye as gaudy and irked him further by seeming to look down on the men who had originally favored the rightful king of kings as frontier bumpkins that caused fights and led to the sudden demise of a couple of newcomers but when abivard complained about the southerners pretensions sharbaraz laughed at him if you think these folk different my friend wait till you make the acquaintance of those who dwell between the tutub and the tib in the river plain called the land of the thousand cities oh but they arent makuraners at all abivard said just our subjects sharbaraz raised an eyebrow so it may seem to a man whose domain lies along the degird but mashiz remember looks out over the land of the thousand cities the people who live down in the plain are not of our kind true but they help make the realm what it is many of our clerks and record keepers come from among them without such wed never know who owed what from one year to the next abivard made a noise that said he was less than impressed had anyone but his sovereign extolled the virtues of such bureaucrats he would have been a good deal cruder in his response perhaps sensing that sharbaraz added they also give us useful infantry youll not have seen that because theyre of no use against the steppe nomads so kings of kings dont take them up onto the plateau of makuran proper but theyre numerous they make good garrison troops and theyve given decent service against videssos for that i would forgive them quite a lot abivard said aye it does make a difference sharbaraz agreed but ill be less fond of them if they give decent service against me why would they do that abivard asked youre the proper king of kings what on earth would make them want to fight for smerdis and not for you if they believe the lie about my renouncing my renunciation that might do it sharbaraz answered or smerdis might just promise more privileges and fewer taxes for the land of the thousand cities that might be enough by itself theyve been under makuran a long time because were better warriors but they arent truly of makuran most of the time that doesnt matter every once in a while it jumps up and bites a king of kings in the arse what do we do about it abivard knew he sounded worried he had learned about some of what sharbaraz had mentioned but till this moment dust had lain thick over what he had studied now he saw it really mattered sharbaraz reached out and set a hand on his shoulder i didnt mean to put you in a tizzy ive sent men on to the valleys of the tutub and the tib i can match whatever promises smerdis makes however much id rather not and infantry is only so much good against horsemen men afoot move slowly often they dont get to where theyre neededand even if they do you can usually find a way around them i suppose so i know about as much of the art of fighting against infantry as i do of the usages of videssos false priests no you wouldnt have the need not growing up where you did sharbaraz chewed on his mustache by the god i dont want the war against smerdis to drag on and on if the northwest frontier stays bare too long the nomads will swarm across in force and driving them back over the degird will mean we cant give the empire the time and attention it deserves abivard didnt reply right away it wasnt that he disagreed with anything sharbaraz had said but his concern with nomads over the border had little to do with what that would mean for the grand strategy of makuran he worried about what would happen to his domain to the flocks and the folk who tended them to the qanats and the farmers who used their waters to grow grain and nuts and vegetables and most of all to vek rud stronghold and his brother and mother and wives his half brothers and half sisters strongholds rarely fell to nomadsup in the northwest they were made strong not least to hold out the khamorthbut it had happened being a worrier by nature abivard had no trouble imagining the worst sharbaraz gave a squeeze with that hand on his shoulder dont fret so brotherinlaw of mine frada strikes me as able and more than able vek rud domain will still be yours when you go home wreathed in victory you ease my mind abivard said which was true to him frada had seldom been more than a little brother sometimes a pest rarely anyone to take seriously that had changed some after fradas whiskers sprouted and more after abivard came back from the pardrayan steppe still hearing the rightful king of kings praise his younger brother made him glow with pride but going home wreathed in victory first there was smerdis to beat and then the khamorth and after them videssos and after videssos had at last been punished as it deserved who could say what new foes would have arisen perhaps in the uttermost west perhaps on the plains once more majesty abivard said with a laugh that sounded shaky even to him with so much fighting yet to do only the god knows when ill ever see home again so long as we keep winning you shall one day sharbaraz answered with which abivard had to be content he was doing his best not to think about the consequences of defeat when scouts came riding in with word of an army approaching from the south horns blared sharbarazs forces aided by officers who now had one battles worth of experience more than they had enjoyed before began the complicated business of shifting from line of march into line of battle sharbaraz said if the usurper and his lackeys will not tamely yield i shall have to rout them out with comrades like you abivard i know well succeed such talk warmed abivardfor a moment after that he was too busy to stay warm his first automatic glance was toward the rear to make sure the baggage train kept out of harms way and kept roshnani and denak safe with it that taken care of he started shouting orders of his own one thing he had seen was that sharbaraz did not care for close companions who were nothing but companions the rightful king of kings expected his followers to be able to lead as well as he helped position sharbarazs riders abivard also scanned the southern skyline for the cloud of dust that would announce the coming of smerdis warriors soon enoughtoo soon to suit himhe spied it a little farther east than he had expected from what the scouts had said that gave him an idea he had to wait for sharbaraz to stop barking orders of his own when he gained his sovereigns ear he pointed and said suppose we position a band behind that high ground by the direction from which the enemy approaches they may not spot our men till too late sharbaraz considered working his jaws as he chewed on the notion as if it were so much flatbread then with the abrupt decision that marked him he nodded let it be as you say take a regiment and wait there for the right moment two long horn calls and one short will be your signal you want me to lead the regiment to his dismay abivards voice rose in a startled squeak why not sharbaraz answered impatiently the ideas yours and its a good one you deserve the credit if it succeeds and if you fought at my right hand in the last battle you can lead a regiment on your own in this one abivard gulped the most men he had directly commanded at any one time was the couple of dozen he had led against khamorth raiders not long before he found out pradtak was holding sharbaraz captive but to say that would be to lose face before the king of kings majesty ill do my best he managed and went off to gather his men some of the officers he ordered to shift position gave him distinctly jaundiced looks they were professionals who had left smerdis force for sharbarazs as far as they were concerned what was he but a frontier dihqan of uncertain but dubious quality the answer to that however was that he was also the king of kings brotherinlaw so however dubious they looked they obeyed we wait for the signal abivard told the troopers as he led them into the ambush position then we burst out and take the usurpers men in flank why the whole battle could turn on us the horsemen buzzed excitedly unlike their skeptical captains they seemed eager to follow abivard of course a lot of them came out of northwestern domains too those men werent polished professionals they were here because their dihqansand they themselveswanted to overthrow smerdis and restore sharbaraz to his rightful place did enthusiasm count for more than professionalism abivard hoped so he had taken his contingent well behind the low swell of ground he had spotted the better to conceal it from smerdis advancing men the only problem was that also meant abivard and his followers couldnt see the first stages of the fighting he hadnt worried about that till it was too late to do anything about it without giving away his position he hoped sound would do what sight could not show him how the battle was going but that proved less easy to gauge than he had expected he could tell by the racket where the fighting was heaviest but not who had the advantage at any given spot he shifted nervously in the saddle until his horse caught his unease and began snorting and pawing at the ground the men he led were just as anxious as the animal let us go lord abivard one of them called hurl us against the usurper others echoed that but abivard shook his head we wait for the signal he repeated thinking or until im sure the battles swung against us that would be time to do what he could for the warriors though he added if we move too soon we give away the advantage of the ambush he hoped that would hold them they twitched every time a horn soundedand so did he sooner or later they would burst from cover no matter what he did to hold them back he felt worthlesssharbaraz would see he wasnt suited to command after all blaaart blaaart blart a shiver ran through abivard now the waiting regiment could move and he would still seem to be in control of it forward he shouted well show smerdis the proper punishment for trying to steal the throne the cry is sharbaraz burst from a thousand throats abivard dug his heels into his horses sides the beast squealed half with rage at him and half with relief at being allowed to run at last it went from walk to trot to gallop as fast as any animal abivard had ever ridden even so he was hard pressed to stay at the head of the regiment sharbaraz the riders cried again as they burst from concealment abivard stared quickly sizing up the battle on this wing smerdis men had driven sharbaraz back a couple of furlongs abivard couched his lance and thundered at the enemy it worked he thought exultantly startled faces turned to stare at him in dismay while shouts of alarm rang out among smerdis followers he had only moments in which to savor them then he speared from the saddle a soldier who had managed to turn only halfway toward him that struck him as less than fair but most effective sharbarazs backers shouted too with fresh spirit abivard and his men rolled up the left wing of smerdis army its commander had savvy to spare he pulled men from the center and right to stem the rout before everything was swept away but a fight that had looked like a victory for the usurper suddenly turned into another stinging defeat smerdis host had trumpeters too abivard recognized the call they blew retreat he screamed in delight pursue pursue the shout rang through not only the regiment he led but from the rest of sharbarazs army as well just as retreat made smerdis men lose heart victory enspirited sharbarazs soldiers they pressed the enemy hard doing their best to keep him from reforming his ranks the warrior who had urged abivard to loose the regiment before the signal happened to ride close to him now the fellow had a cut on his forehead from which blood spilled down over his face but his grin was enormous lord abivard you were right and i was wrong and im man enough to admit it he declared weve smashed them to kindlingkindling i tell you another soldier this one with more gray than black in his beard caught abivards eye lord youd better cherish that he said youll count the times your men own that you were smarter than them on the thumbs of one handand thats if youre lucky mind youre likely right friend abivard said some of smerdis men staged a countercharge to buy their comrades time to get away the fierce fighting that followed swept abivard away from the cynical graybeard to the void with the renunciate smerdis king of kings a lancer shouted as his mount pounded toward abivard abivard dug heels into his own horse the last thing he wanted was to receive an attack with no momentum of his own he got his shield up just before they slammed together the enemy lance shattered on the shield his own held but smerdis horseman deflected it with his shield so it did him no harm that left them at close quarters faster than abivard had expected him to be his foe hit him in the side of the head with the stump of his lance his iron helm kept his skull from caving in but his head suddenly knew what a piece of iron caught between hammer and anvil felt like his sight blurred staying on his horse became all he could do he noticed he didnt have his own lance any more but had no idea where he had dropped it the next thing he fully remembered was a tired thin worriedlooking man holding a candle a couple of fingersbreadths away from one eye the fellow moved it to the other eye then let out a long wheezing breath the pupils are of different sizes he said to someoneabivard turned his head and saw sharbaraz hes taken a blow to the head that i have abivard said all at once aware of a headache like a thousand years of hangovers all boiled down into a thick sludgy gelatin of pain that made him sad he hadnt even had the fun of getting drunk did we hold the victory i lost track there after i got clouted he found himself yawning majesty he needs rest the worriedlooking man said abivard realized he was a physician i know ive seen cases like his the king of kings answered to abivard he said aye we won we drive them still im going to have kakia here take you back to the wagon your wife and sister share theyll be the best ones to nurse you for the next few days days abivard tried to sound indignant instead he soundedand feltsick he gulped trying to keep down what was in his belly the ground swayed beneath his feet as if it had turned to sea kakia put abivards arm over his own shoulder lord its nothing to be ashamed of you may not bleed but youre wounded as sure as if you were cut with your brains rattled around inside your skull like lentils in a gourd you need some time to come back to yourself abivard wanted to argue but felt too weak and woozy he let the physician guide him back toward the baggage train the serving women who had accompanied roshnani and denak exclaimed in dismay when kakia brought him to the wagon in which they traveled im all right he insisted though the gong chiming in his head tolled out liar with every beat of his heart should the god grant which i think likely in this case the lord will be right again in three or four days kakia said which set off a fresh paroxysm of weeping from the women with the curious disconnection the blow to the head had caused abivard wondered how they would have carried on had the physician told them he wouldnt be all right even louder he suspected they were quite loud enough as it was climbing the steps up into the wagon took every bit of balance and strength he had left still twittering like upset birds the women took charge of him and led him into the little cubicle roshnani used as her own she started to smile when he walkedor rather staggeredin but the expression congealed on her face like stiffening tallow when she saw the state he was in what happened she whispered i got hit in the side of the head he said he was getting tired of explaining imkind of addled and they say im supposed to rest until im more myself a day or two if he told that to roshnani maybe he would believe it too what were you doing roshnani demanded as he sank down to the mat on which she was sitting even in his battered state that struck him as a foolish question fighting he said she went on as if he hadnt spoken you could have been killed here you just lie quiet ill take care of you would you like some wine he started to shake his head but thought better of it contenting himself with a simple no im queasy if i drink anything right now ill probably spew it up and if i try to heave right now im sure the top of my head will fall off he rather wished it would here roshnani opened a little chest took out a small pot and undid the stopper in a tone that brooked no argument she said if you wont take wine drink this i dont think youll give it back and it will do you good abivard was too woozy to quarrel he gulped down whatever the little jar held though he made a face at the strong medicinal taste after a while the ache in his head faded from unbearable to merely painful he yawned the stuff had made him sleepier than he already was too thats done some good he admitted what was it youll not be angry at the answer roshnani asked no he said puzzled why should i be even in the dim light of the cubicle he saw roshnani flush because its a potion women sometimes take for painful courses she answered it has poppy juice in it and i thought that might ease you but men from all ive heard have a way of being touchy about having to do with womens things thats so abivard raised a languid hand then let it fall on roshnanis outstretched arm there you may if you like consider that ive beaten you for your presumption she stared at him then dissolved in giggles drugged and groggy though he was abivard knew the joke didnt rate such laughter maybe he thought relief had something to do with it just then denak came into the cubicle stooping to get through the low entranceway she looked from roshnani to abivard and back again well she said things cant be too bad if i walk in on a scene like this things could be better abivard said if they were one of smerdis rotten treacherous men wouldnt have tried using my head for a bell to see if he liked the tone but if they were worse hed have smashed it like a dropped pot so who am i to complain he yawned again staying awake was becoming an enormous effort the servants say the physician who brought him here thinks hell get better roshnani said to denak as if abivard were either already unconscious or part of the furniture but hell need a few days rest this is the place for it denak said an edge of wormwood in her voice its as if we brought the womens quarters with us when we left vek rud stronghold a womens quarters on four wheelswho would have imagined that but were just as caged here as we were back there i didnt expect much different roshnani said she was more patient less impetuous than her sisterinlaw that we are allowed out is the victory and everything else will flow from it some years from now many women will be free to move about as they please and nobody will recall the terms we had to accept to get the avalanche rolling the avalanche rolled over me abivard said two foolish jokes nowyour brains cant be altogether smashed roshnani said thus put in his place abivard listened to denak say by the god its not right weve escaped the womens quarters and so we should also escape the strictures the quarters put on us what point to leaving if we still dare not show our faces outside the wagon unless summoned to our husbands tents roshnani surely made some reply but abivard never found out what it was between them the knock on the head and the poppy juice in the medicine she had given him sent him sliding down into sleep the next time he opened his eyes the inside of the cubicle was dark but for a single flickering lamp the lamp oil had an odd odor he couldnt remember where he had smelled it in the past he fell asleep again before the memory surfaced when he woke the next morning he needed a minute or so to figure out where he was the shifting of the wagon as it rattled along and his pounding muzzy head conspired to make him wonder whether he was getting up in the middle of an earthquake after a long night of drinking then roshnani sat up on the pallet by his hows the spot where you got hit she asked memory returned he gingerly set a finger to his temple sore he reported she nodded you have a great bruise there i think though your hair hides most of it youre lucky the usurpers man didnt smash your skull so i am abivard touched the side of his head again and winced he didnt miss by much i dont think roshnani blew out the lamp this time abivard recognized the smell its burning that whatdotheycallit rock oil thats it perozs engineers used it to fire the bridge over the degird after the few stragglers came back from pardraya they said the southern folk put it in their lamps i dont like itit smells nasty roshnani said but we ran low on lighting oil and one of the servants bought a jar of it it does serve lamps well enough i suppose but i cant imagine that it would ever be good for anything else the serving women fixed abivard a special breakfast tongue brains and cows foot spiced hot with pepper his head still ached but his appetite had recovered he didnt feel he was likely to puke up anything he put in his stomach all the same roshnani wouldnt let him get up for any reason save to use the pot sharbaraz came to see him around midmorning the god give you good day majesty abivard said as you see ive already prostrated myself for you the rightful king of kings chuckled youre healing id say he remarked unconsciously echoing roshnani im glad sentiment out of the way he reminded abivard he was perozs son with a blunt to business then the usurpers army has made good its withdrawal we still have some horsemen shadowing us but they cant interfere as we advance good news abivard said nothing to keep us from getting south of the dilbat mountains and then turning north and east to move on mashiz eh on the surface no sharbaraz said but what we ran into yesterday troubles me and not a little either aye we won the fight but not the way id hoped not a man not a company went over to us we had to beat them and when we did they either fell back or if they were cut off surrendered not one of them turned on the others who back smerdis that is worrying abivard could feel he was slower and stupider than he should have been which left him angry sharbaraz needed the best advice he could give after a moment he went on seems to me the only thing we can do is press ahead all the same we cant very well give up just because things arent as easy as we thought theyd be i agree sharbaraz said as long as we keep winning smerdis falls sooner or later he pounded a fist against his thigh once twice three times but i was so sure the usurper would go down to ignominious defeat as soon as it was known i lived and hadnt abdicated on my own one of the things my father always said was that the longer you lived the more complicated life looked abivard said he said only boys and holy men were ever certain men who had to live in the world got the idea it was bigger and more complicated than they could imagine i think ive told you my father praised your fathers good sense sharbaraz said the more i listen to godarz through you the more i think my father knew whereof he spoke your majesty is gracious to my fathers memory abivard said warmed by the praise and wishing godarz were there to hear it what do you plan to do next keep on with the straightahead drive toward the capital aye what else the rightful king of kings frowned i know its not subtle but we have no other good choices smerdis has already had one army wrecked and another beaten hell hesitate to hazard a third with luck well be able to closely approach mashiz before he tries fighting us headon again we win that fight and the city is oursand if smerdis wants to flee to nalgis crag stronghold say hell learn we have the patience to starve him out his eyes glowed with anticipation in the space of a few minutes sharbaraz had gone from gloom about the way smerdis backers declined to go over to him to excitement at the prospect of starving his rival into submission abivard wished he could lose his depressions as readily but he like godarz before him seemed a man who went through life without sinking deep into the valleys or climbing high on the peaks he said first things first majesty once we have mashiz assuming we dont bag smerdis with it then we can worry about hunting him down otherwise were riding our horses before we bridle and saddle them he laughed ruefully i have to say im just as well pleased were not storming the capital tomorrow id not be much use to you even on a horse already bridled and saddled you let yourself mend sharbaraz said as if giving an order to some recalcitrant underling thank the god we wont be doing much in the way of fighting till youre ready to play your proper part once more you set me straight very smartly there when i let enthusiasm push me like a leaf on the breeze your majesty is kind abivard was pleased with sharbaraz as long as the rightful king of kings could recognize when he was letting his passion of the momentwhatever it might berun away with him he would do well the question was how long would that last after he won his civil war sharbaraz reached out and touched him on the shouldergently so as not to jostle his poor battered head i have to go off and see to the army i expect ill be back this evening to visit you and denak both rest easy till then your majesty what choice have i abivard said even if i wanted to be out and doing roshnani would flatten me should i try to get up without her leave men usually keep their wives shut up in womens quarters but here she has me trapped sharbaraz laughed loud and long at that as if it hadnt been true he ducked out of the cubicle abivard listened to him getting onto his horse and riding away he was already shouting orders as if he had forgotten all about the man he had just visited rationally abivard knew that wasnt so but it irked him anyhow as a proper makuraner wife should roshnani had stayed out of sight while another man visited her husband she returned to the cubicle as soon as sharbaraz was gone so ive trapped you here have i she said you were listening how could i help it when only curtains separate one part of the wagon from the next looking innocent and mischievous at the same time she pulled shut the curtain that opened onto the cubicle so youre trapped here are you she repeated and knelt beside him trapped and flat on your back are you what are you doing abivard squawked as she hiked up his caftan she didnt answer not in words her long black hair spilled over his belly and thighs he did his best to rise to the occasion and his best proved quite good enough where southern makuran was a desert it was barer than the wasteland around vek rud domain where it was fertile it was far richer we tax the land here at twice the rate we use in the northwest sharbaraz said to abivard and even then some of the ministers think we are too lenient crops are very fine here abivard admitted what are the winters like youve driven the nail home sharbaraz said nodding id read of winters on the steppe and close to it but never lived through one till i was sent to nalgis crag stronghold and then went on to yours even closer to the frontier here they grow things the year around they get snow only about one winter in two remembering blizzards and snowdrifts and hail and ice three months of every year and sometimes four or five abivard laughed at that he couldnt make up his mind whether to find it unnatural or one of the most wonderful things he had ever heard before he decided a scout rode back toward sharbaraz saluting the fellow said majesty a party of riders is approaching under shield of truce let them come to me sharbaraz said at once tell them that if theyre conveying smerdis surrender ill be happy to accept it the scout laughed wheeled his horse and booted the animal up to a gallop as he went off to escort the newcomers to the rightful king of kings sharbaraz turned back to abivard and chuckled ruefully id be happy to accept smerdis surrender aye but i dont think im going to get it a few minutes later a whole squadron of scouts came back with smerdis delegation without being ordered to do so they placed themselves between sharbaraz and smerdis menno assassinations here the scout who had announced the coming of the truce party said majesty here are the usurpers dogs scorn harshened his voice a couple of smerdis followers stirred restlessly on their horses but none of them spoke sharbaraz did pointing to one of their number he said ah inshushinak so youve taken the old mans silver have you inshushinak was hardly in the first bloom of youth himself he was fat and graybearded and sat his horse as if he hadnt ridden one in a long time he nodded to sharbaraz and said son of peroz his majesty smerdis king of kings he got no farther than that some of sharbarazs scouts reached for their swords while others swung down lances one of them growled show proper respect for the king of kings curse you sharbaraz raised a hand let him speak as he will he comes under shield of truce the god hates those who violate it i shall remember but then i already remember he has chosen to follow the man who stole my throne say on inshushinak that did not make inshushinak look much happier but he rallied and resumed son of peroz his majesty smerdis king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase bade me come with these my followers he waved to the halfdozen men who rode with him three soldiers a couple of bureaucrats and a skinny little fellow who could have been anything at all to seek to compose the differences that lie between you and him inshushinak was my fathers treasury minister sharbaraz murmured to abivard once smerdis superior now it seems his servant he raised his voice and addressed the delegation from mashiz you may go back to the capital and tell my cousin that if he casts aside the throne and recovers all the arkets he squandered on the khamorth and agrees to be confined for the rest of his days as he confined me i may perhaps consider granting him his worthless life otherwise son of peroz smerdis king of kings did not send me to you in token of surrender inshushinak looked as if he wished smerdis had not sent him to sharbaraz at all but went on would you care to hear the terms he proposes not very much but sharbaraz relented since you came to deliver them you may as well you are gracious even inshushinaks years at court could not make that sound sincere in the interest of sparing the realm the torment of civil war smerdis king of kings will confer upon you the title of king of the northwest and will concede you autonomous rule there subject to your paying him an annual sum to be determined by negotiation smerdis is generous sharbaraz said and for a moment inshushinak brightened but perozs son continued how kind of him to concede to me a small piece of what i already hold and to be willing to negotiate the sum i pay for the privilege since i can take all the realm though i shall not rest content to be given a part one of the soldierly men with inshushinak said be not so sure son of peroz in most wars unlike the one that overthrew your father last year a single battle does not decide a campaign sharbaraz bit his lip in anger but held his voice steady as he replied my best guess as to why you failed to go with my father hakhamanish is that he reckoned you more a loss than a gain in the field im not even angry at you for choosing smerdis side measured against a real general youre apter to hurt the usurpers cause than help it hakhamanishs face went darker yet with angry blood abivard said well struck majesty inshushinak said perozs son am i to infer from this that you reject the gracious offer of smerdis king of kings you need not infer it sharbaraz said i openly proclaim it i give you leave to take my words back to smerdis be wary of dining with him though lest you wake in a place you least expect he paused and one more thingif you fear to deliver my message out of worry over what he may do to you for reporting what i say simply tell him ill be in mashiz soon enough to give him the answer in person son of peroz arrogance will be your downfall as it was your fathers hakhamanish said you shall never approach mashiz much less reach it inshushinak scowled at the officer so did the nondescript little man who on any crowded street would have become invisible as readily as a colorshifting gecko going yellowbrown when set on a slab of sandstone hakhamanish might have been on the point of saying more but instead jerked hard at his horses reins made the unhappy animal rear and wheel and rode away without so much as a farewell the rest of smerdis party imitated his unceremonious departure although inshushinak rode off quite sedately if his horse an elderly gelding had reared no doubt he would have gone off over its tail sharbarazs eyes narrowed as he stared after smerdis backers they are more confident than they have any business being he said to abivard smerdis the god curse him still thinks he can win this war and he has no business thinking so not on the way its gone so far which means he knows or thinks he knows something we dont abivard said majesty might it not be wise to follow this embassy and see if theyre part of whatever he plans follow them at a discreet distance of course not a bad thought sharbaraz rubbed his chin then called to a couple of scouts and gave the orders adding one of you report back to me at nightfall to tell me where theyve camped and whether anyones met with them the other should watch them through the night as best he can the horsemen saluted and rode out after inshushinak and his companions abivard said mind you majesty i dont expect theyll find out anything in particular but better to send them and learn nothing than not send them and not learn something we should have sharbaraz said i wouldnt think of arguing with you the army rode on off in the distance the sun shimmered from a saltpan a little closer the illusion of water danced in the air that happened up by the vek rud too though not so often if you believed the water was really there and went after it you could easily end up dying of thirst evening came camp straggled over what seemed to abivard like a farsang and a half had smerdis had an army in the neighborhood it could have struck sharbarazs scattered forces a deadly blow the encampment of the grand army peroz had led into pardraya had been no better organized abivard wondered if something could be done about that before he had the chance to think seriously about it he all but bumped into sharbaraz as the rightful king of kings came back from a walk round the camp to make sure everything was running smoothly what word from the scouts majesty he asked are smerdis henchmen planning to transform the lot of us into camels sharbaraz laughed but quickly grew sober once more do you know brotherinlaw of mine i cant tell you because that scout never came in abivard glanced to the east a fat moon just past full was climbing over the horizon and spilling paleyellow light over the barren landscape hard to lose the army dont you think the smile altogether vanished from sharbarazs face it is wouldnt you say do you suppose smerdis men waylaid them smerdis men didnt look well mounted abivard demurred and if your scouts cant get away from the likes of the men we saw there weve got the wrong people doing the job youre right about that sharbaraz said but what does it leave accident possible i suppose but not very likely as you say scouts had better have a pretty good idea of what theyre doing and how to get around magic maybe abivard had meant it half as a joke but the word seemed to hang in the air he said maybe wed better not take any chances with magic majesty smerdis might well have sent out his men to see if he could buy you and and if that failed hed turn a wizard loose on me sharbaraz finished aye that makes sense and it fits the characteror rather lack of charactersmerdis has shown all through his misbegotten misnamed reign what do we do to foil him he answered his own question we send out men to track down the embassys camp see whats going on there and break it up if its what we fear he raised his voice and bawled for the scouts finding smerdis folk wont be easy especially not at night abivard said and who knows how long the wizardif there is a wizardhas been busy youre going to need magical protection just to keep you safe he went out of sharbarazs tent grabbed a man by the arm and said dyou know where tanshar the fortuneteller and the rest of those skilled in sorcery pitch their tents usually theyre all close together off to one side of the stores wagons aye lord the fellow answered i went to one of emnot tanshar i forget what his name wasthe other night and he looked at my palm and told me a big reward was coming my way soon get tanshar and the rest of them back here to the king of kings tent as fast as you can and that fortunetellers word will come true abivard said the soldier blinked scratched his head then suddenly left at a dead run he might have needed a moment to figure out what abivard meant but he wasted no time once he got it abivard stared up at the moon when you keep looking at it he thought it seemed to stand still in the skyand if the moon didnt move how could time pass but the racket of the camp went right on with a sudden addition when a troop of scouts resaddled and mounted their horses and rode off into the moonlight inside the tent sharbaraz made a noise it wasnt a word nor yet a cry it wasnt a noise quite like any abivard had heard he ducked back through the entry flap as he straightened up the camp bed in the tent no finer than that which belonged to any other officer went over with a crash sharbaraz thrashed on the floor wrestling with something he could see and abivard could not abivard sprang to his aid guided by the motions of sharbarazs grasping hands he tried to pull away the king of kings foe even though that foe was invisible to him but his hands passed through the space between himself and sharbaraz as if that space held only the empty air his eyes perceived the same was manifestly not true for sharbaraz he writhed and twisted and kicked and punched and when his blows landed they sounded as if they struck flesh by the god abivard cried what is this madness when he spoke the gods name he heard a groan that did not spring from his lips or sharbarazs as if it pained the invisible attacker that did not stop the thing whatever it was from keeping up its assault on sharbaraz it started to choke him struggling like a madman the rightful king of kings tore itshands from his throat by the god abivard said again this time he noted no effect maybe because he was deliberately using the gods name as a weapon rather than invoking his deity out of need watching the king of kings fight for his life and being unable to aid him brought back the dreadful helplessness abivard had known when afoot he had watched peroz and the flower of the makuraner army tumble into the trench the khamorth had dug lord abivard your majesty never had abivard been so glad to hear an old mans quavering voice in here tanshar and quickly he cried tanshar burst into the king of kings tent panting from having hurried from his own resting place the fortuneteller stared at the spectacle of sharbaraz struggling for his life against a foe imperceptible to others he burst out with the same ejaculation abivard had used the same any makuraner would have used by the god where the attacker had groaned when abivard called on the god he screamed now as if beaten with redhot pokers he still grappled with sharbaraz but now as they rolled over and over the king of kings was on top as often as his assailant tanshar wasted no time with another invocation of the god instead he snatched a vial of powder from the pouch he wore on his belt and sprinkled it over both sharbaraz and whatever he was fighting with no not whateverthe powder let abivard make out the faint outline of a naked heavily muscled man strike tanshar cried what you can see you can slay abivard jerked his sword from its scabbard and slashed at the stillmisty figure sharbaraz was fighting this time he understood why the wouldbe assassin cried out with pain the blood the fellow shed was plainly visible he cut again and again sharbaraz got a grip on his opponents throat they knew they had slain their foe when all at once his body became fully visible to abivard for the first time sharbaraz stared down at the bloodsplashed face of the man who had tried to assassinate him turning to abivard he said wasnt he one of the warriors who rode with inshushinak majesty i couldnt say for certain abivard answered a mail veil doesnt show much of a mans faceand besides i paid most attention to the men who were talking but if you say it i wouldnt presume to disagree youd better notim the king of kings sharbarazs laugh was shaky he felt at his neck the wretch was strong as a bear i must be bruised i never saw him either till he seized me by the throat nor i majesty abivards face went hot with shame he must have walked past me and into your tent while i was outside sending for tanshar here sharbaraz shook his head then winced his neck was sore dont blame yourself magic defeated your vigilancehow can you be expected to see through a mages charm besides what you say doesnt have to be true for all we know he could have been lurking here pretending to be a piece of air like any other until you went outside and he found the chance to strike it could be so abivard agreed gratefully as long as he lived only tanshars magic powder let me see him and fight him the fortunetellers laugh ran raucous in the tent your majesty lord i used no magic powder for i had none that was just finely ground salt for my meat nothing more abivard stared then how did we defeat the spell from smerdis sorcerer i have no idea whether you defeated the spell tanshar answered you defeated the man on whom it lay and that sufficed but abivard struggled to put his thought into words when i called on the god and then again when you did this whoreson was plainly hurt how do you explain that if not by magic that probably was magic tanshar said when we called on the god we disturbed the linkthe evil link evidentlythrough which smerdis mage controlled the sorcery he had set in motion perhaps we deformed the nature of the spell not enough to destroy its effectiveness but enough to cause this fellow pain as the mage regained or retained his power i am but guessing you must understand for such magic is far beyond my power yet you helped defeat it just as against all odds you helped me get free from nalgis crag stronghold sharbaraz said i think you give yourself too little credit i shall not make the same mistake when mashiz is mine once more you have but to name your reward majesty you cannot give me back thirty years nor yet the sight in this eye tanshar said raising a finger to point at the one a cataract had dimmed i have no great needs and ive seen enough years go by that i have no great desires either i wonder whether i should pity you or be bitterly jealous sharbaraz observed have it as you will then but know that my ear is yours should you ever find any service i can perform for you tanshar bowed your majesty is generous beyond my deserts for now if you will but grant me leave to return to my tent the fortuneteller waited for sharbaraz to nod then bowed again and slipped out into the night when he was gone sharbaraz abandoned some of the brave front he had kept up prodding the body of his assailant with one foot he said pour me some wine brotherinlaw of mine if youd be so kind this son of a thousand fathers came far too close to killing me aye majesty a jar and some cups sat on a folding table that somehow had not gone over during the fight abivard poured two cups full handed one to the rightful king of kings the other he held high in salute to your safety a good toast and one ill gladly drink to sharbaraz raised the cup to his lips he winced when he swallowed that hurts this cursed murderer he prodded the body again was strong as a mule and i think his hands were as hard as ganzak the smiths abivard had his doubts about that but held most of them from his reply the metal ganzak pounds is harder than your neck cant argue with that sharbaraz drank again more cautiously this time but winced again anyhow wheezing a little he said thats three times youve saved me now but for you smerdis would be sitting comfortably on the throne and ii expect id be heading toward madness locked up inside nalgis crag stronghold to serve the king of kings is an honor abivard said youve earned honor thats certain sharbaraz emptied the cup and held it out to abivard fill it up again and drain your own so you can fill that too by the god ive earned the right to drink deep tonight even if it sets my throat on fire and i dont care to do it by myself let me drag this carrion out first abivard seized the assassin by the feet and hauled him out of the king of kings tent the camp had quieted for the night no one exclaimed at the sight of a corpse returning abivard said we can leave him there for the dogs and the crows to eat a fine notion now pour me that wine if you please the two of them were on their fourth or fifth cupssince abivard was having trouble keeping track probably their fifthwhen riders came pounding into the camp majesty majesty the cry rose above the thunder of hoofbeats and probably woke a good many men who had already gone to sleep sharbaraz reached for his sword have todefend myselfif those arent my scouts coming back his speech was thick abivard suspected he would be more dangerous to himself with that blade than to any foes he yanked out his own sword he had already slain one wouldbe killer with it tonight why not another the wine that made his movements slow and fumbling eloquently put forward its opinion side by side the king of kings and abivard went out to meet the approaching horsemen in the moonlight abivard recognized the officer who had reported the arrival of smerdis embassy the man saw sharbaraz majesty he exclaimed weve rid you of a scorpions nest of traitors sharbaraz and abivard exchanged glances thatshic wonderful the rightful king of kings said tell me at once what happened to abivard he whispered hed better tell me at once i have to piss fit to burst the scout luckily didnt hear that he said we rode out until we found the camp where that inshushinak the god drop him into the void had paused with his henchmen for the night outside the camp at a distance where they could watch and not be seen we also found the two men you sent to keep an eye on the embassy why didnt one of them report back here as ordered sharbaraz demanded a scout broke in majesty they was frozen stiff near enough the officer agreed they were warm and breathing but otherwise they might as well have been turned to stone one of the men inshushinak had with him he must have been a wizard we found that out for ourselves as a matter of fact sharbaraz said dryly but this is your tale pray go on with it aye majesty the scout leader answered curiosity in his voice well when we got a good look at what the son of a serpent had done to poor tyardut and andegan we were so angry we couldnt even see we got back on our horses and charged straight for the camp some of us probably feared the wizard would do to us what hed done to our friends but not a man hung back and thats a fact whether you know it or not charging with rage in your hearts likely was the best thing you could have done abivard said sorcery wont bite on a man whos full of passion thats why love magic and battle magic are such chancy things he knew he was giving back tanshars words but if tanshar didnt understand how sorcery worked who did however that may be lord the scout said anyhow we came down on the camp like wolves jumping on an antelope theyve cut out of the herd nothing alive there now just carrion we had a couple of men hurt neither one bad it looks like and hear this toowhen we started back we found the scouts had come back to life killing that wizard must have broken the spell that held them sharbaraz sighed now smerdis will curse me for having slain an embassy and do you know what brotherinlaw of mine i shant lose a moments sleep over it not when he tried to slay me by sorcery under cover of that embassy majesty the only thing concerning me there is that while you know what you say is true the rest of the realm may not know it abivard said sharbaraz waved scornfully to show how little he cared for what the rest of the realm knew or didnt know soon enough all makuran will be mine then it will know what i wish it to know the peaks of the dilbat mountains petered out into low rolling foothills after sharbarazs army rode south for another few days getting through the mountains then was no longer a matter of forcing a narrow heavily defended pass but simply heading east and then turning north abivard found the change disconcerting the very first day im used to watching the sun rise out of the mountains not set behind them he said ive seen both sharbaraz said ones the same as the other as far as im concerned what i want to see is mashiz restless hunger stalked along his voice how long till we reach it abivard asked he wanted to see mashiz too not just because entering the capital would mean victory but also because he was curious about what a real city was like some of the towns that sheltered under strongholds in the south of makuran were a good deal larger and busier than the one in his own domain but basically of the same type he wanted to find out how different mashiz would be ten or twelve days from here sharbaraz answered thats if we do nothing but ride mind you i expect well see some fighting though if smerdis doesnt throw everything he has at me now he loses may he lose any which way abivard said to which the king of kings nodded neither of them spoke as much of smerdis men deserting as they had when the campaign was new and their enthusiasm unchallenged abivard had concluded that most of the men who followed smerdis were going to keep right on following him if sharbaraz was to win he would have to do it with the forces that had begun the fight on his side that didnt make it impossible but it didnt make things any easier either as long as we keep winning were fine sharbaraz said maybe he was trying not to think about the desertions that hadnt happened too once his army left the northwest he had stopped sweeping in whole strongholdsful of recruits if he ousted smerdis with what he had abivard expected the whole realm to acknowledge him as its ruler if he didnt abivard tried not to think about that three days after sharbarazs host turned north they met another of smerdis armies this time the scouts were laughing as they came back to bring the news to sharbaraz smerdis must be running out of horses majesty one of them said for half his men are foot soldiers maybe more the men of the thousand cities abivard said sharbaraz nodded aye no doubt well smash straight through them and scatter them like chaff one such lesson and theyll know better than to fight for the usurper ever again perozs son indeed abivard thought aloud he said wouldnt we be wiser to try to flank them out of their position we can move faster than they and if we hit them while theyre trying to shift to keep up with us we stand a better chance of striking the deadly blow you want but the rightful king of kings shook his head and waved to the east saying thats still desert out there we arent yet up to the tutub and the tib wed have a hard time keeping ourselves in fodder for the animals and water for them and us both besides i dont want to be seen as sidestepping smerdis i want to show the realm my men are bolder and fiercer than his i hope thats so majesty abivard said as close to direct criticism as he dared come sharbaraz glared at him then shouted for zal and his other captains and began giving orders for the direct assault no one contradicted him or showed any misgivings at the end he turned to abivard and said will you do us the honor of accompanying the attack certainly majesty may the god grant you success and may he know i wish it for you abivard said however much he tried to ignore it sharbarazs sardonic question stung he did not think his sovereign was making the right choice but how was he supposed to tell that to sharbaraz when he would not listen he found no way all that was left then was to go forward and hope the rightful king of kings was right martial music ordered the men into line of battle word that they were facing infantry raced up and down the line they seemed confident even contemptuous well squash em flat for you lord one of the horsemen said and all the troopers around him nodded abivards worries eased confidence counted a great deal in war if the soldiers thought they couldnt be beaten maybe they couldnt smerdis men came into sight as the scout had said they were infantry and cavalry both the horse on the flanks the foot in the center abivard shouted sharbarazs name the war cry rose from the whole army smerdis soldiers shouted back a great din rose to the blue sky horns belled the charge abivard swung down his lance and spurred his horse the pound of the beasts hooves and of all those around him filled him like a quicker stronger pulse the enemy horsemen moved forward from their position on the wings to engage sharbarazs riders smerdis infantry held its ground as abivard drew nearer he saw it sheltered behind a barricade of thorny brush through thundering hoofbeats through the clamor of war cries the clear pure note of reed whistles rang out abivard scowled under his mail visor that was no signal he knew but it meant something to the infantry in an instant arrows filled the air one flight then another and another they whistled too loud enough to drown out the call that had set them flying graceful as birds they curved high into the skythen fell on the charging horsemen sharbaraz had archers too and they shot back at the foot soldiers but not with so many arrows so steadily discharged men and horses crumpled and when they fell they fouled others just behind them the attack faltered an arrow slammed into abivards upraised shield and stood thrumming a palms breadth to one side and it would have pierced his leg instead the brush barricade was very close now his horse pushed against it the animals body was armored but the thorns on the brush still tore the tender skin of its legs it hesitated whinnying in protest abivard kicked it in the ribs with his boots inflicting worse pain to force it to obey his will forward the god curse you he yelled the horse pushed forward but hesitantly abivard got a good look at the foot soldiers on the far side of the barrier dark stocky men in leather jerkins their long black hair bound in a club at the nape of their necks some of them shouted insults in harshly accented makuraner others yelled what did not sound like pleasantries in their own guttural language and all of them kept shooting arrows along with the quivers on their backs they had others at their feet had the brush been stiffened with stakes it would have made a worse obstacle as it was the barrier broke here and there letting trickles of sharbarazs men in among the enemy they worked a fearful slaughter but for their bows the foot soldiers had only knives and clubs to defend themselves abivard thrust his lance over the brush at an archer at the same instant the archer let fly at him maybe the two men frightened each other for they both missed they stared across the brush the archers face tired and worried abivards hidden from the eyes down by chainmail they both nodded if not with joint respect then at least with recognition of their joint humanity by unspoken common consent they chose other foes after that pressure from behind forced abivards horse forward against the thorns no matter how little it cared to go branches scraped at the beasts armored sides and at the iron rings that protected abivards legs then he too was through the barricade and a knot of sharbarazs warriors right behind him shouts of triumph rang in his ears and cries of fear and dismay from smerdis infantry some of the foot soldiers recklessly brave rushed toward the horses and tried to pull their riders from the saddle most of them were speared before they got close panic spread through the archers many threw away their bows to run the faster but they could not outrun horsemen abivard struck with his lance till it shivered by then it was scarlet almost to the grip he took out his sword and cut down more of the fleeing foe he never looked back on that part of the battle with prideit always struck him afterward as more like murder than war with their center broken the cavalrymen smerdis generals had posted on either wing also had to give way lest they be cut off and defeated in detail the chase went on until nightfall forced sharbaraz to break it off abivards stomach twisted as he rode back over the field his horse had to pick its way carefully to keep from stepping on the bodies of fallen foot soldiers every few yards it would tread on one despite all its care and snort in alarm as the corpse shifted under its hooves then abivard passed the broken barrier and saw what the archers had done to his own companions he had pitied the hapless infantrymen as he had speared and hacked at them and afterward as he saw their bodies sprawled in death now he realized they were soldiers too in their own fashion they had hurt sharbarazs followers worse than smerdis cavalry had managed in either of the earlier two fights he looked around for the banner of the rightful king of kings the fading light made it hard to spot but when he found it he rode toward it sharbaraz had dismounted from his horse he held out his arm for the physician kakias ministrations youre wounded majesty abivard exclaimed an arrow through my armor and through the meat sharbaraz answered he shrugged then winced wishing he hadnt he tried to make the best of it not too bad your sister neednt worry that i need replacing having done his utmost to make light of an injury of his own not long before abivard turned to kakia for confirmation the physician said his majesty was fortunate in that the arrow pierced the biceps of the upper arm and again in that the point came out the other side so we did not have to draw it or force it through causing him further pain if the wound does not fester it should heal well and youll make sure it doesnt fester wont you sharbaraz said i have a decoction for that very purpose yes kakia answered taking a stoppered vial from a pouch on his belt here we have verdigris and litharge alum pitch and resin stirred into a mixture of vinegar and oil if your majesty will undertake to hold the wounded member still sharbaraz tried valiantly to obey but when kakia poured the murky brownish lotion into the wound he hissed like redhot iron with water poured into it by the god youve set fire to my arm he cried biting his lip no majesty or if so but a small fire now to prevent the greater and more deadly fire of corruption later that brew will prevent anything sharbaraz said feelingly as kakia bandaged the arm copper and lead and alum and pitch and resinif i drank it instead of having it inflicted on me as you did id be poisoned for certain no doubt you would majesty but the same holds true for many nostrums intended to go onto the body rather than within it kakia replied with some asperity for that matter your caftan belongs around you but would you swallow it chopped up with cucumbers to everything its proper place and application with his arm paining him not only from the wound but also from the physicians treatment of it sharbaraz was not inclined to be philosophical he turned to abivard and said well brotherinlaw of mine you seem to have come through this fight with your brains unscrambled for which i envy you aye i was luckier this time the day is ours abivard looked around at the grisly aftermath of battle ours aye but dearly bought sharbaraz suddenly looked exhausted as well as hurt his skin stretched tight over his bones abivard was easily able to imagine how he would look as an old manif he lived to grow old which was never a good bet most especially for a claimant to the throne of makuran engaged in bruising civil war each fight is tougher the rightful king of kings said wearily i thought smerdis backers would collapse after the first battle but theyve given me two tougher ones since how his officers keep their men in line i could not saybut they do well have to fight again before we reach mashiz and if smerdis is stronger then than now he didnt go on he plainly didnt want to go on you didnt expect him to offer battle till just in front of the capital no sooner had he spoken than abivard wished he could have his words backno point to reminding sharbaraz of past errors he couldnt correct now but sharbaraz did not get angry he only nodded my graybeard cousin has proved himself a man of more parts than id guessed the god curse his thieving soul it wont save him but it makes our task harder again abivard envied the king of kings for being able to haul himself out of swamps of gloom apparently by sheer force of will he asked how many more foot soldiers do you suppose he can bring against us they hurt us worse than i would have dreamed such troops could and i sharbaraz agreed well theres a lesson learnedi cant charge straight at archers with any sort of protection not unless i want more of a butchers bill than i fancy paying he curled the hand on his wounded arm into a fist abivard was glad to see he could do that i hope the lesson wasnt too dearly bought aye abivard said much will depend on the spirit of the men if they decide this is another victory on our way to mashiz all will be well we have to worry that they dont see it as a setback too trueif you think youre beaten you probably are sharbaraz looked bleak i thought smerdis would reckon himself beaten by now well majesty if he doesnt well just have to convince him abivard said and hoped he sounded optimistic the land of the thousand cities was a revelation to abivard the land of his own domain wasnt rich enough to support one city let alone a thousand but in the river valleys large towns squatted on little hillocks raised above the flat muddy terrain when abivard asked how those hillocks came to rise in the flatlands sharbaraz chuckled and said its the cities fault seeing that abivard didnt follow he explained those cities have been there a long long time and theyve been throwing out their rubbish just as long when the street gets too much higher than your door you knock down your house its not stone only mud brick then you build a new one at the level the street has risen to do that for hundreds of years and pretty soon youre sitting on a hill from then on abivard looked at the hillocks in a whole new way as pieces of time made visible the idea awed him the hill on which vek rud stronghold perched was purely naturaldig down a foot anywhere and you hit rock that people could make their own hills had never occurred to him why shouldnt they roshnani said when he spoke of that in her cubicle one evening her voice turned tart from all ive seen this land is nothing but mud pile mud up and let it dry and you have a hill hmm he said his principal wife had a point and one that diminished his wonder at what the dwellers in the land of the thousand cities had done he wasnt sure he wanted that wonder diminished manmade hills seemed much more impressive than heaps of mud it takes a lot of mud to make one of those hills as i said theres a lot of mud here roshnani might have been sweetnatured but she was also as tenacious in argument as a badger abivard changed the subject tacitly conceding the skirmish to her along with the mud went abundant moisture irrigation canals spread the waters of the tutub and the tib over the plain between and alongside them qanats would have wasted less but you couldnt drive qanats through mud either wherever it was watered the plain grew abundantly grain dates onions melons beans and more farmers worked their fields wearing only cloths round their loins and straw hats against the pounding sun sweltering in his armor abivard most sincerely envied them a few yards past the far ends of the canal the land turned gray and dusty and held only thorn bushes if those the folk of the thousand cities fled into their towns and took shelter behind their walls as sharbarazs army drew near how are we supposed to get them out abivard asked at an officers council we dont zal answered if we besiege every one of these towns well stay in the land of the thousand cities forever and we wont get to mashiz we just pass em by take what we need from the fields and keep moving they wont love us for that abivard observed they dont love us now zal said which though cynical was also undoubtedly true abivard looked an appeal to sharbaraz zal is right sharbaraz said if we win the war with smerdis well hold the allegiance of the land of the thousand cities and if we dontwhat difference will it make he laughed bitterly so we take what we need ten days after the battle with the archers smerdis had mustered against them sharbarazs men turned west again away from the valleys of the tutub and the tib and toward the dilbat mountains once more ahead lay mashiz also ahead and closer lay the army smerdis had gathered to hold his rival out of the capital smoke from its cook fires smudged the sky as sharbarazs forces drew near hes making us come to him the rightful king of kings said as his own army encamped for the night theres only one broad straight route into mashiz caravans and such have other choices but a handful of men can block those passes ill send scouts out to check but i dont think smerdis would have left them open for us can his men sally from any of them abivard asked zal did not sound happy when he answered it could happen lord we have a harder time keeping him away than he does us but he hasnt shown much in the way of fighting push or trying to do more than one thing at a time with his armies up to now odds are goodnot great but goodthings will go on that way since the odds of my ever being free to fight this war were long indeed i am content and more than content with good odds sharbaraz declared the chief question ahead of us remains how best to win the main battle there once more i fear we have little choice but to go straight at the foe he said i fear the top of his mind still vividly remembered the tough fight when his men had attacked smerdis archers headon but despite his words he sounded eager to go toe to toe with the enemy like his father before him he had as his chief notion of strategy closing with whatever enemies opposed him and pounding them to pieces that worried abivard but he had to keep silent he did not know the lay of the land in front of mashiz and so could not offer an opinion on how best to fight there zal had served at the capital the tough graybearded officer said aye if theyre going to stay there and wait for us we dont have much choice but to try and hammer em out if we try to outwait them make them come down and attack us its just a gamble on where disease breaks out first and since the water coming out of the dilbats is cleaner than what were drinking its a gamble wed likely lose onward then sharbaraz said with decision once the capital is in our hands all the realm will come to see who properly belongs at its head onward his captains echoed abivard among them as zal had said all other choices looked worseand one more victory would give sharbaraz mashiz and all of makuran viewed thus chances looked good enough to bet on mashiz till he had rescued sharbaraz abivard had never imagined seeing the capital of the realm he had been born on the frontier and expected to live out his life and die there but now tiny in the distance but still plain his eyes picked out the spreading gray mass of the palace of the king of kings and not far from it the great shrine to the god in all the world only the high temple in videssos the city was said to be a match for it seeing the wonders of mashiz though was not the same as entering the city in triumph between those wonders and abivard stood smerdis army in a position its leaders had chosen for making a stand the closer abivard got to that position the more his stomach griped him the more misgiving grew in his mind by the look of things no army made up of mere mortals was going to force its way through smerdis host yet the effort had to be made horns blared forward the archers officers cried heavy horse usually the cream of a makuraner force could not play its normal role today for smerdis captains perhaps learning from their failure in the recent battle to the south had posted unmounted bowmen behind a barrier of stones and dirt and timber what the lancers could not reach they could not overwhelm and so the horse archers men wearing leather rather than costly mail and splint armor rode ahead of the lancers to try to drive smerdis infantry back from its sheltering barricade shafts flew in both directions men and horses screamed as they were pierced mounted detachments brought fresh sheaves of arrows from the supply wagons to help the horsemen keep shooting smerdis barricade did not quite cover the entire width of the approach to mashiz the usurpers heavy cavalry waited at either wing when sharbarazs archers were well involved in their duel with the foot soldiers smerdis lancers thundered forth in that narrow space the mounted archers could not stand against the charge of their ironclad foes some were speared out of the saddle more fell back in confusion but sharbaraz had been waiting for that forward the lancers he cried a command echoed by his officers and the martial musicians in the army at last the chance to fight abivard thought with something between eagerness and dread he swung down his lance booting his horse in the side the foe he struck never saw him coming his lance went in just below the fellows right shoulder the luckless warrior gave a bubbling scream when abivard jerked out the lancehead blood poured from the wound and from his nose and mouth as he slumped over his horses neck the melee in front of the barricade became general smerdis archers kept shooting into the milling crowd of warriors even though some of them were on their side all of smerdis horsemen and horses in the fight were armored in iron while many of sharbarazs were not so their arrows remained more likely to hurt foe than friend abivard was in the thick of the melee sharbaraz he shouted again and again riders on both sides cried out the name of the king of kings they favored in such a mixedup fight that was the only way to tell smerdis backers from those who followed sharbaraz a man yelling smerdis cut at abivard he took the blow on his shield then returned it iron sparked against iron as their swords clanged against each other they traded strokes until the tide of battle swept them apart little by little smerdis cavalry gave ground retreating back toward either end of the barricade that sheltered the archers some of sharbarazs riders raised a cheer abivard yelled too until he took a good look around the field driving those horsemen back meant nothing as long as the barrier kept sharbarazs men from breaking through and advancing on mashiz victory remained out of reach sharbarazs mounted archers went back to trading shafts with smerdis foot soldiers that wouldnt do what needed doing if the battle went on for the next week as long as those archers held their ground behind the barrier sharbarazs men couldnt get close enough to tear it down that was what had to happen for victory but abivard didnt see how it could sharbaraz had another idea pointing to the left of the barrier he cried well force our way through therewe have more lancers than smerdis can throw against us then we can take those cursed bowmen in flank instead of banging our heads against their wall horns and yelling officers slowly began to position sharbarazs army for the charge he had in mind abivard didnt know if it would work but it held more promise than anything he had come up with himself he swung almost out of the saddle to grab an unbroken lance that had fallen from someones hands smerdis horsemen gathered themselves to withstand the assault before the charge was signaled though the horns on the right wing of sharbarazs host rang out in confused discord shouts of dismay and fear rose with the alarmed horn calls whats gone wrong now abivard cried twisting his head to see all at once he understood why smerdis army had seemed so light in cavalry it was light in cavalry for the usurpers generals had divided it sending part of the force to emerge from one of the narrow canyons and take sharbarazs men in the flank much as abivard had done against smerdis troops earlier in the civil war the results were much the same here too the right wing of sharbarazs army crumpled even zal who commanded there could do little to stem the collapse and with their enemy in disarray smerdis men who had been about to receive a charge made one instead they shouted with fresh confidence and fury sharbaraz also shouted fury filled his voice but not confidence fall back he ordered sounding as if he hated the words fall back and regroup rally by the god rally the day may yet be ours his men did not give way to panic or despair most of them were raw troops who had gone from victory to victory abivard had wondered how they would face defeat if ever it came the answer was what he had hoped but hadnt dared expectthey kept fighting hard but fighting hard was not enough with their line broken on the right under simultaneous attack from flank and front they had to retreat and keep retreating so they would not have whole bands of men cut off and captured or slain after a while retreat took on a momentum of its own smerdis men did not push the pursuit as hard as they might have what point they had the victory they had needed sharbaraz would not parade into mashiz sharbaraz would not go into mashiz at all not now and as soon as word of that spread through makuran many who had been sitting on the fence between the two rival kings of kings would decide in favor of the man who held the capital three farsangs east of the battlefield sharbaraz ordered his men to halt for the night the bulk of the army or what was left of it obeyed but a flow of men less than a flood but more than a trickle kept on streaming east and south the first ticks dropping off the horse that fed em abivard said bitterly bad choice of metaphor sharbaraz answered with the air of someone criticizing a bards work ticks leave a horse when its dead and we still have life in us aye majesty abivard said inside though he wondered how much of sharbarazs defiance consisted of keeping up a brave front maybe more for himself than for anyone else a lot of it he feared a rebel needed win after win until power was his now the rightful king of kings had to be wondering how to rally his men and turn his right to the throne into real possession of it well renew the assault in the morning sharbaraz said making sure this time that weve covered the mouths to all the passes aye majesty abivard repeated dutifully but he didnt believe it not for a moment fraortish eldest of all the most fiery of the prophets four couldnt have rallied the army to a renewed assault if he had promised the god would come through the void and fight alongside sharbarazs men even sharbaraz seemed to sense his words rang hollow well well see what seems best when morning comes he said abivard trudged wearily back to the baggage train he breathed a silent prayer of thanks that smerdis men hadnt pressed the pursuit if they had they might have overrun the train and captured the wagon that carried roshnani and denak his principal wife and sister exclaimed in delight and relief when he went up into the wagon and then again when he told them sharbaraz remained hale but what happens next roshnani asked with the way to mashiz blocked what do we do his majesty spoke of a new attack tomorrow abivard said roshnani rolled her eyes and then tried to pretend she hadnt even denak who supported sharbaraz as automatically as she breathed didnt say anything to that if denak didnt believe the attack would come off it was surely foredoomed roshnani called to one of the serving women who fetched abivard a mug of wine he drained it sprawled out on the carpet in roshnanis cubicle to relax for a moment and fell asleep before he realized it attack came the next morning but sharbarazs men did not launch it perhaps emboldened by their victory smerdis cavalry some archers the rest lancers followed their foes through the night and struck just as dawn was breaking sharbarazs followers outnumbered them it did not help they were demoralized from losing the day before and disorganized from camping hastily after a retreat they had not expected to have to make some of them fought well others broke and fled as soon as the first arrows hissed down among them the army as a whole held its own till about midmorning after that men began falling back again in spite of desperate shouts from sharbaraz and their officers scenting victory smerdis men kept up the pressure attacking wherever they saw weakness by the end of the day sharbarazs army had returned to the land of the thousand cities the floodplain of the tutub and the tib the rightful king of kings looked stunned as if he had never imagined such a disaster overfalling him abivard hadnt imagined it either so he suspected he looked stunned too i dont think i can rally them straightaway sharbaraz said gloomily best perhaps to fall back to country where the nobles and people back us with whole hearts there to rebuild our strength to fight again another day fall back to the northwest he meant essentially what smerdis had offered him before the sorcerous attack and what he had rejected with a sneer then but at that point of the civil war he had been winning battles and smerdis losing after a couple of losses of his own he must have thought keeping some of the flock better than losing it all aye majesty perhaps that would be for the best abivard said sharbaraz was right the army he led had lost heart and smerdis no doubt gained a corresponding amount under such circumstances inviting battle also invited disaster and while a return to the northwest would seem like exile to the rightful king of kings to abivard it would be going home he wondered how his brotherand his domainfared he had heard not a word since he set out on campaign the next morning sharbaraz ordered his men to turn south to skirt the dilbat mountains again so they could head north and west into territory friendlier to his cause than the land of the thousand cities smerdis men dogged their trail not in such numbers as to invite attack but always lurking watching reporting every movement back to their superiors sharbarazs soldiers had not ridden more than a farsang when they found canals broken open to spill out their water and flood the plain making the way impassable on the far side more of smerdis soldiers sat their horses watching with evident pleasure the discomfiture of their foes abivard shook his fist at them where now majesty he asked theyve blocked the way homeward i know sharbaraz looked as hunted as abivard felt here in the valleys of the tutub and the tib were like flies trying to get out of a spiders web and the spider can push us to any piece of the web he likes before strolling over and sinking his fangs into the withered husk of our army theres a pleasant picture abivards stomach churned have we any way to start moving by our own will rather than smerdis perhaps if we strike north and get over one or two of the major canals before they can break the banks and open the sluices the thing could be done bridges of boats span the more important waterways the army tried when they got to the canal sharbaraz had wanted to cross they found the boats drawn up on the far bank more of smerdis men were strung out along the far bank too waiting to see if sharbaraz would try to force a crossing they quickly found the canal was too deep to ford sharbaraz sighed wed be asking to get massacred if i had the men swim across with or without their horses we cant go south we cant go north theres an army behind us to keep us from turning back to the west even if the men would obey sharbaraz thought in terms of strategy abivard in the more homely things he had had to worry about back at the domain theyre herding us he said aye they are and drop me into the void if i can see what to do about it either sharbaraz said i cant reach smerdis traitors there he pointed north across the canal or to the south and if i do make the army turn against the turncoats between us and mashiz they wont even deign to accept battle i can see that already theyll just fall back and open more canals to hold us up they can wreck them faster than we can fix them i fear youre right majesty abivard said weve already crossed the headwaters of the tib what happens if they force us across the tutub as well whats on the far side of the land of the thousand cities scrub country near desert and then videssos sharbaraz spat nothing i want to visit i assure you but in spite of what sharbaraz wanted the army had to keep moving east they could not stay in one place more than a couple of days at a time after that they began to run low on food and fodder both smerdis men and the canals they had opened blocked the way in other directions the folk of the thousand cities shut themselves up behind their walls and would not treat with sharbaraz i might as well be leading videssians he fumed id pay the locals well with money and later with exemptions to aid me in setting the canals aright and free us up to maneuver but they will not hear me okhos chanced to be riding close to sharbaraz when the rightful king of kings loosed that blast he said majesty when you sit on your throne as you should surely you will take such vengeance on them as to make the bards sing and miscreants shudder a thousand years from now oh a few city governors will find themselves short a head come the dayno doubt about that sharbaraz told roshnanis brother but past that what point to vengeance kill the peasants and craftsmen and where do the realms taxes come from okhos stared he was still new at running a domain let alone the realm of makuran after a moment he asked do taxes count for more than honor sometimes sharbaraz answered which made okhos eyes get wider the rightful king of kings went on besides the peasants and craftsmen are but obeying the command of their governors how can i fault them for that when i would expect it of them were those governors mine massacre strikes me as wasteful ill have revenge aye but measured revenge okhos considered that as he would have a lesson from a tutor at last he said your majesty is wise my majesty is bloody tired sharbaraz said and if i were so wise id be sitting in mashiz right now instead of slogging through the land of the thousand cities a bug landed on his cheek he slapped at himself but it flew away before his hand landed they ought to call these river valleys the land of the ten million flies it seems to have more of them than anything else oh i dont know majesty abivard said in my humble opinion it breeds more mosquitoes still he scratched at a welt on his arm sharbaraz snorted his laugh was grim but a laugh one of the few abivard had heard from him since things went wrong in front of mashiz brotherinlaw of mine i admit it you may be right taking advantage of his sovereigns relatively good humor abivard said may i speak majesty at sharbarazs nod he went on you may be wise to show yourself moderate in more things than vengeance on the land of the thousand cities throwing an army headlong into battle cost your father everything and has badly hurt you as well the scowl he got from the rightful king of kings neither surprised nor upset him how often did sharbaraz hear criticism after a long pause though sharbaraz slowly nodded again you may be right i aim to do my foe as much harm as i can as quickly as i can that i sometimes do myself harm as wellhow could i deny it his wave encompassed the hot floodplain across which his unhappy army perforce traveled try as he would he found no opportunity to break free of the network of flooded canals hostile cities and enemy forces that hemmed him in smerdis by all appearances cared nothing for the impetuous charge if he could get results without it hardly shooting an arrow his men drove sharbarazs riders ever farther east well be at the tutub soon sharbaraz raged what then does he think well drown ourselves in it for his convenience im sure he wishes we would that would be easiest for him abivard answered he makes war like a man who used to head the mint he spends nothing more than he has to that cheeseparing cost him west of the dilbat mountains but it serves him well here sharbaraz swore at him and rode off in a fury abivard wondered what would happen when they came to the tutub he was ready to bet the river would be too wide and deep and swift to ford if smerdis men backed their foes against it sharbaraz would have no choice but to throw his army at that part of smerdis that looked to be most nearly accessible abivard didnt expect victory in such an effort but he would follow without hesitation the man he had chosen as his sovereign what were the odds sharbaraz would have escaped from nalgis crag stronghold if he had managed that anything might happen the thought consoled abivard until he realized how spiderwebthin was the line that ran from might to would pushed on unable to make a stand because their worst enemies were hunger and broken canals rather than archers and lancers sharbarazs men reached the tutub three days later abivard fully expected to have to form up for a last stand of desperate battle after backing sharbaraz he was not dead keen on falling into smerdis hands in any case he wished roshnani and denak hadnt persuaded sharbaraz and him to let them accompany the campaign back at vek rud stronghold they would have been safe enough no matter what happened to their husbands herebut to his surprise scouts who rode up and down the river came back with word that a bridge of boats still stretched across it well go over sharbaraz said at once on the far side of the tutub well be able to move as we please less harassed by the troops who dog us abivards horse did not like the way the planks laid across the boats shifted under its feet it snorted and sidestepped and did its best not to go forward until he booted it in the ribs hard enough to gain its undivided attention the far side of the tutub seemed much like the near one but as soon as sharbarazs army had crossed smerdis men rode up and set fire to the bridge of boats the rising smoke made abivard wonder too late how many boats were left on the east bank of the river to aid sharbarazs army in returning to the fray he didnt know but he had the feeling the answer would be none we cant cross back and we cant stay here long abivard said to roshnani that evening as the unhappy army made camp that leaves us little choice if we had a choice which would be better she asked even if we had a choice neither would be much good abivard answered back on the western side of the tutub wed face all the problems that led to our getting trapped here in the first place and even if we had all the livestock and grain and fruit in the world at our fingertips here so what being king of kings for the land east of the tutub is like being mobedhanmobhed for the khamorth not enough of them worship the god to make them need a chief servant for him and this land is about enough to rate a dihqan but not a sovereign you will have seen more of it than i since im closed up here in this wagon roshnani said denak would have sounded furious at that roshnani just stated it matteroffactly to let abivard draw what conclusions from it he would she went on your point is well made both choices you named seem evil what if we went east then abivard shook his head a gesture full of patience love and the desire to be as gentle with her naivete as he could east of here is scrub country about as bad as the land between oases back in the northwest its no place for us to stay and regather our strength and east of that liesvidessos he spoke the name with a shudder to him as to any makuraner warrior videssos was and could only be the enemy but roshnani pounced on it like a cat leaping after a mouse that appeared from a hole it hadnt noticed why dont we fare into videssos then their avtokratordo i rightly remember his name as likinios could hardly do worse by us than smerdis pimp of pimps could he she brought out the contemptuous soldierly title with a fine curl of her lip abivard opened his mouth to begin an automatic condemnation of the idea but stopped with it unuttered put that way it could not be dismissed out of hand what he did say was i dont see much point in throwing myself on a videssians mercy when hes not likely to treat me any better than smerdis would either once she got a notion roshnani was not one to abandon it before she had taken it as far as it would go she said why wouldnt he treat sharbaraz better likinios is a king of kings too of sorts does he take kindly to having a cousin steal a throne that ought to belong to a son if he does one fine day he may find a cousin stealing his own throne thats abivard started to say it was foolish and ridiculous but it wasnt if smerdis had the gall to usurp the throne why shouldnt a videssian do likewise by all accounts videssians were knavish and thieving by nature if one of their emperors left a throne lying around vacant somebody to whom it didnt properly belong would try to abscond with it thats not a bad idea he finished in tones of wonder my thought was simple what have we to lose by going into videssos roshnani said while abivard looked for an answer there something else occurred to him the third piece of tanshars prophecy where am i likelier to find a narrow stretch of sea than in videssos he said roshnanis eyes got wide i hadnt thought of that she said if the prophecy itself is urging us eastward denak stuck her head through the cloth curtain that screened off roshnanis cubicle she nodded to her brother then said eastward how can we think of going eastward not only would we be fleeing but theres nothing in that direction but scrub and desert anyhow theres also videssos beyond the scrub roshnani answered which made denaks eyes widen in turn speaking alternate sentences almost like characters out of a traveling play about one of the prophets four she and abivard explained their reasons for wanting to take refuge in the empire and seek aid from the avtokrator when they had finished denak stared from one of them to the other i thought we were in a box she said so did sharbaraz so no doubt did smerdishe has to be looking forward to finishing us off at his leisure but if a box doesnt have to stay a box if we can break down one of the sides and escape in a way no one imagined abivard raised a warning hand we have no guarantees if we try this he reminded his sister the videssians may prove as wicked and treacherous as the tales say they are or they may take us for enemies and attack no matter what we do to show them were friends or for that matter some of the men here may prefer smerdis mercy to what they think theyll find in videssos well lose more than a handful to desertion i fear roshnani laughed here we are reckoning up the good points and the bad to this move when we have not the power to order it abivard took a deep breath here i am to say that having women along on this campaign may prove its salvation i tell you now i never would have thought of using videssos for refuge if i lived to be a thousand if it succeeds the credit goes to roshnani thank you my husband roshnani said quietly and cast down her eyes to the carpeted floor of the wagon as if she were an ordinary deferential makuraner wife who had never imagined setting foot outside the womens quarters of her stronghold thank you abivard denak said for being open enough to see that and honest enough to say it he shrugged father always relied on mothers wisdomoh not out in the open but he made no great secret of it either and wasnt it you who said that if a womans counsel was worth something back at the stronghold it would be worth something on campaign too i said it yes denak answered whether anyone listened to me is another matter one of the things i found with pradtak is that men often dont judging all men by pradtak i suspect is like judging all women by ardini abivard said which made denak frown angrily and roshnani after a moments hesitation nod he went on do you expect sharbaraz to ah attend you this evening still frowning denak said no not really hes come here less often since things went wrong hed sooner brood than try to make himself feel better youre probably right abivard got to his feet the top of his head brushed the canvas canopy of the wagon ill go and take the idea to him then if he says no and i cant get him to change his mind ill send him hither i hope you wont think less of me for saying wives have ways to persuade a man that brothersinlaw cant use think less of you no denak said but i wish youd not reminded me of things i did that id sooner forget im sorry abivard said and left in a hurry sharbarazs tent had guards round it now and one of the armys sorcerers stood watch outside abivard doubted the need for that now that smerdis was winning the war by ordinary means why would he bother with sorcery the sentries saluted as he came up to the tent inside sharbaraz sat on his camp bed his head in his hands what word brotherinlaw of mine he asked dully by his demeanor he cared nothing for the answer but abivard gave him a word he had not looked for videssos what of videssos now sharbaraz showed interest if no enthusiasm has likinios decided to cast his lot with smerdis and join in crushing me he would be wise if he did smerdis wont trouble videssos for as long as he lives you misunderstand majesty abivard said and went on to explain roshnanis idea the longer he talked the more animated sharbarazs features became by the time he was through the rightful king of kings seemed more nearly himself than he had at any time since his army was forced across the tutub it might work by the god it just might he said at last as you say it will cost us men who refuse to follow it will cost more than that too without a doubt any aid we get from likinios will have a price attached to it but even so aye even so abivard said then he added i barely knew the avtokrators name before we set out on this campaign i still know next to nothing about him has he sons of his own if he wants to make sure the throne passes to one of them he may be more inclined to take your side he has four sharbaraz answered for a videssian thats a good numberthey take but one wife apiece hes been fighting a war with kubrat up north and east of videssos the city i daresay thats why he tried to set the khamorth against us to keep us from invading his western provinces while he was busy on the other frontier it worked abivard said sorrowfully the rightful king of kings snorted yes didnt it just he bowed very low to abivard i would violate custom if i told the lady roshnani how much in her debt i am therefore i rely on you to pass on to her my gratitude i shall also convey the same message to your sister he headed toward the tent flap plainly intending to go out you mean to visit her now abivard asked indeed i do sharbaraz said and vanished into the night abivard left the royal tent a moment later he did not head back toward the wagon from which he had just come but if sharbaraz was going to call on denak when he had stayed away since things began going wrong that was a powerful argument that hopeamong other thingshad revived in him sharbarazs army or the two thirds or so of it that was left descended on the oasis like a pack of wolves tearing to bits a single chicken with water a small ring of fields and a grove of date palms the place was ideal for caravans crossing the badlands between makuran and videssos sharbarazs men ate everything in sight and he had to post armed guards around the water hole to keep them from fouling it when they rode out again two days later men and beasts refreshed and water skins all filled abivard said wed war with the videssians more often i think if we could get at them more easily most armies theirs and ours both go by way of vaspurakan sharbaraz answered the passes through the mountains there are the best invasion routes but with things going against us we couldnt hope to get there and get through and still have an army left when we were done i wonder what the videssians will think when we show up on their border abivard said maybe that weve started our own invasion his smile held no humor one daybut not yet abivard looked around even battered as it was from desertion and defeat sharbarazs army numbered several thousand if they threw themselves headlong against the videssians and took mem by surprise they could do a good deal of damage before they were overwhelmed but as he had said that was not the plan for now if they were to regain makuran they needed videssos help sharbaraz peered eastward if the charts and the guides dont lie one more oasis two days ride from here then a couple of more days of scrub and then serrhesa different empire a different world do you speak videssian majesty abivard asked he could follow the khamorth dialects after a fashion but they were cousins to his own language of videssian he knew nothing but sharbaraz rattled off several sentences in a smooth purring tongue that rather reminded abivard of wine gurgling out of a jar glug glug glug to his relief the rightful king of kings dropped back into makuraner i was tutored in it aye my father thought it something i needed to know a fair number of nobles and merchants speak it especially in the east and south of the realm some of the videssian grandees know makuraner too thats a relief abivard said i was afraid id be the same as a deafmute all the time we were there no youll manage sharbaraz told him and videssian isnt that hard to pick up though some of the sounds are hard for us to pronounce he lisped and hissed to show what he meant then went on but videssians cant say sh so it evens out the language is very good for putting across delicate shades of meaning i dont know whether thats because they use it so much to quarrel about the exact nature of their god phos or whether they quarrel the way they do because videssian lets them which came first the sheep or the lamb i dont know abivard answered i wasnt cut out to be a wise man whenever i start thinking about complicated things my wits seize up like a water wheel clogged with mud sharbaraz laughed most of the time simple is better he agreed if things were simple id have taken my fathers throne and that would have been that but things arent simple that way and so we have to face the complications of videssos abivard pointed to a cloud of dust ahead just at the edge of visibility we may have to face them sooner than we expected whats that i dont know sharbaraz said in a hollow voice but it looks like an army to me he slammed a fist down on his armored thigh how could they have learned we were coming we cant put up much of a fight against a foe thats ready for us not now scouts were already riding forward to take the measure of the new threat after a few minutes one of them came galloping back toward the main body of the army abivard was shocked to see him laughing fit to burst sharbaraz saw that too and purpled in fury have you gone mad he shouted at the scout theyre going to beat us like carpets and you laugh majesty i crave your pardon the scout said but he didnt stop laughing tears of mirth cut clean tracks through the dust and grime on his cheeks thats no army up ahead majesty just a big herd of wild asses raising a cloud same as if they were cavalry sharbaraz gaped then laughed himself a high shrill cackle that seemed made up of concentrated essence of relief asses you say by the god they made asses out of us lets make them pay for their presumption abivard exclaimed theyre fresh meat after all and we havent seen much of that for a while hunting them would be fitting punishment for frightening us out of our wits so ordered sharbaraz said archers pounded after the animals which fled across the scrubby ground watching the asses gallop away in terror made abivard wish all foes could be so easily overcome abivard was never quite sure just when the army crossed into videssian territory one stretch of arid landscape looked much like another when the soldiers came to a village though all possible doubt disappeared along with the scattered stone houses stood a larger building with a wooden spire topped by a gilded domea temple to phos the videssian god of good the people had disappeared along with the doubt dust trails in the distance showed the direction in which they had fled nice to know we still look like a conquering army to someone abivard remarked zal who was riding close by clicked his tongue between his teeth a couple of times this from the trusting young lord who let the tax collector into his stronghold without even checking how sharp his fangs were going off to war has coarsened you lad he grinned to show he meant no harm by the words youre probably right abivard answered once you watch your hopes bounce up and down a few times youre not as sure things will all turn out for the best as you used to be isnt that the truth zal said its too cursed bad but its so from then on sharbaraz ordered the scouts to carry shields of truce so the videssians would learn as quickly as might be that he had come as a supplicant not an invader that forethought soon proved its worth early the next morning a scout came back not with the report of a herd of wild asses but with a videssian officer in tow like a lot of sharbarazs men abivard stared curiously at the first videssian he had ever seen the fellow was mounted on a mediumgood horse with a mediumgood mailshirt worn above leather trousers he had a bow ready to grab a quiver on his back and a curved sword at his belt his helmet was halfway between the standard makuraner cone pattern and a smooth round dome no veil or iron links descended from it so abivard got a good look at his features his skin was slightly paler than that of most makuraners his nose on the thin side and his face nearly triangular sloping down from a wide forehead to a chin of almost feminine delicacy a fringe of beard outlined that chin and his jaw do you speak my language sharbaraz asked in makuraner aye a bit the videssian answered few on this frontier dont he used makuraner well enough though his accent sometimes made him hard to understand one of his eyebrowsso thin and smoothly curved that abivard wondered if he plucked it into shaperose but i ought to be the one asking the questions for starters who are you and what are you doing in my country with an army tagging along his quick scornful glance up and down the line of riders said he saw betterlooking armies every day of the week and sometimes twice a day he added which side of your civil war were you on i am sharbaraz rightful king of kings of makuran and i was on my own side sharbaraz proclaimed abivard had the satisfaction of watching the videssians mouth drop open like a toads when it snapped at a fly sharbaraz went on i have come to videssos to seek the avtokrator likinios aid in restoring me to the throne that is properly mine surely he will understand the importance of preserving unbroken the legitimate line of succession the videssian stayed silent for most of a minute before he replied later when abivard came to understand that videssians rarely kept quiet for any reason he would have a deeper appreciation of the depth of shock that conveyed at last the fellow managed to put words together uh lord sarbaraz as sharbaraz had said videssians couldnt make the sh sound but the officers accent was not what offended abivard say your majesty as you would for your own emperor he growled your majesty the videssian said at once your majesty im not the man to treat with you the lord with the great and good mind knows thats so his laugh came rueful im not the man to stop you either when the villagers rode into serrhes screaming that all the soldiers in the world were heading that way the epoptesthe city governor youd sayfigured a pack of desert bandits had got bold he sent me out to deal with them i have fifty men back there no more who will treat with me then sharbaraz asked is this epoptes of yours a man of sufficient rank to discuss matters of state no the videssian said then added your majesty but i hear tell likinios eldest son is traveling through the westlands keeping things on an even keel here while the avtokrator phos bless him campaigns against the heathens of kubrat hosios will be able to deal with you indeed sharbaraz regally inclined his head will he come to the town of serrhes if so when drop me in the ice if i know the officer said apparently an oath but not one abivard recognized if he wasnt planning to come there in his progress though i expect hell change his mind when old kalamossorry your majesty thats the city governorsends a letter off to wherever he is now telling him youve come into the empire i suspect you may be right sharbaraz said he and the videssian soldier both laughed at the understatement serrhes struck abivard as being halfway between a stronghold town and a real city the whole perimeter was fortified with a wall higher and thicker than vek rud stronghold boasted inside on the highest ground in the place stood a massive citadel where warriors could retreat in case the outer wall was breached pretty strong fortress to stick out in the middle of nowhere he remarked to sharbaraz the rightful king of kings chuckled the only reason the videssians would site a fortress here is to protect their land from us abivard thought about that then nodded belonging to a people who could inspire such precautions made him proud by the smooth way in which the epoptes took over the provisioning of sharbarazs men he might have had makuraner armies dropping in for a visit every other month some of the grain came from the storerooms in the cellar of the citadel soon pack animals were fetching more from farther east the spring that made the town possible at all was barely adequate for the sudden influx videssian guards made sure no one took more than his fair share they were stern but abivard had to admit just hosios arrived a bit more than two weeks after sharbarazs shrunken host came to serrhes the epoptes a plump little man went about his town in a transport of nervousness if the protocol for the meeting between the avtokrators eldest son and the claimant to the title of king of kings of makuran broke down the blame would all land on him for both primary parties to the meeting were of rank too exalted for any to stick to them had abivard been wearing kalamos boots he would have been nervous too as a matter of fact he was nervous and for reasons related to those of the city governor coming to videssos had been roshnanis idea which he had sold to sharbaraz if it did not bring the results for which he had hoped sharbaraz would remember of course if it didnt bring those results sharbaraz would not be powerful enough to make his displeasure felt the ceremony the epoptes devised was as elaborately formal as a wedding hosios rode out from the city accompanied by kalamos and a ceremonial guard of twenty men at the same time sharbaraz advanced from the tent city that had sprung up outside serrhes along with abivard and twenty men of his own ah sharbaraz murmured as the avtokrators eldest son drew near he wears the red boots do you see abivard i see they are red abivard answered does that mean something special sharbaraz nodded the videssians have ceremonial usages of their own as complicated as ours only an avtokrator may wear boots all of red without black stripes or something of the sort hosios is junior emperor in his own right in other words i am treating with an equal at least in theory abivard didnt need that explained to him in practice likinios made the decisions abivard said im glad hosios speaks makuraner otherwise id be as useful here as a fifth leg on a horse sharbaraz waved him to silence hosios was drawing close enough to hear he was about abivards age with a narrowchinned videssian face made distinctive by a sword scar on one cheek and by eyes that gave the strong impression of having seen everything at least once he wore a golden circlet that did not quite hide the fact that his hairline had begun to recede because sharbaraz had entered videssos he spoke first i sharbaraz king of kings good and pacific fortunate and pious to whom the god has given great fortune and a great realm a man formed in the image of the god greet you hosios avtokrator my brother hosios inclined his head evidently he knew not only the makuraner language but also the flowery rhetoric that flourished in sharbarazs realm he said in the name of likinios avtokrator of the videssians viceregent of phos on earth i hosios avtokrator greet you sharbaraz by right of birth king of kings my brother he held out his hand sharbaraz urged his horse forward a pace or two and clasped it without hesitation but also without joy abivard understood that the videssians had flowery ceremonial language of their own but he had caught the implications of by right of birth king of kings it sounded well but promised nothing if at some future time likinios saw wisdom in recognizing smerdis he could do so with a clear conscience for having the birthright of a king of kings was not the same as actually being one sharbaraz released hosios hand and introduced abivard to him abivard bowed in the saddle saying your majesty i am styled young majesty to distinguish me from my father hosios broke in your pardon young majesty i was about to say i never expected to have the honor of meeting a videssian avtokrator save perhaps on the battlefieldand then the introduction would have been edged with iron not words ayesharper than the one of us or the other would have liked thats certain hosios sized up abivard with the knowing eyes that along with his scar said he had been on a few battlefields in his time perhaps against the kubratoi whoever they were to abivard at any rate no more than a name sharbaraz said you will understand hosios with his rank he was entitled to use the junior avtokrators name unadorned i would sooner meet you as foe and outright enemy myself you would know i was lying if i said otherwise but since fate compels me to come before you as a beggar i own that is what i am he bowed his proud head to hosios the junior avtokrator reached out to set a hand on his shoulder no harm will come to you and yours in videssos sharbaraz may phos the lord with the great and good mind damn me to the eternal ice if i lie whatever else befalls i promise you a mansion in videssos the city and estates in the countryside with appropriate lodging throughout the empire for the men who have followed you here you are generous sharbaraz said again with something less than a whole heart again abivard had no trouble figuring out why hosios proposed to dissolve the makuraner army like a small spoonful of salt poured into a great tun of water after a moments pause to show he also grasped that point sharbaraz resumed but i did not come here seeking a new home for me and mine i came to beseech your aid that i might return to makuran where i already have a home i know that hosios answered calmly were it in my power you would have what you ask for on the instant but my power though large does not reach so far you will have to wait on my fathers will sharbaraz inclined his head once more your father is well served in you the god grant he realize it in such ways as you can in your distress you are generous to me hosios said smiling one would have to be a very bold man indeed to contemplate going against my fathers will as with my power my boldness is large but does not extend so far beside him kalamos the epoptes nodded vigorously he had a good and healthy respect for the avtokrators power abivard approved of that he wished a certain mintmaster back in mashiz had shown similar respect for the power of the king of kings may i ask a question majesty he murmured to sharbaraz when his sovereign nodded he turned to hosios and said if likinios has such power and boldness as you describe young majesty what could keep him from coming to our aid he didnt know what sort of answer he had expected but it was not the blunt reply hosios gave him two things spring to mind eminent sir one your principal there may not offer concessions substantial enough to make it worth our while to restore him to the throne and two related to one the war against the kubratoi has caused a hemorrhage in the treasury videssos may simply lack the funds to do as you desire however much we might want to we in makuran speak of videssos as a nation of merchants sharbaraz said i regret to say it seems to be so hosios had his own kind of pride not the haughty arrogance a makuraner noble would have displayed but a certainty all the more impressive for being understated if we were but a nation of merchants makuran would have conquered us long since i would be impolite to remind you who seeks whose aid and so i would never presume to do such a thing of course sharbaraz said sourly hosios notreminder could scarcely have hit any harder had the junior avtokrator held up a sign we are friends here or at least not enemies hosios said i bid you to a feast this evening to be held in the residence of the noble epoptes here bring a score of your chiefest captains with you or even half again as many and since i am told you and your brotherinlaw have your wives accompanying you bring them as well many of the leading citizens of serrhes will have their ladies with them my own wife is back in videssos the city or i would do the same this is not our custom sharbarazs voice was stiff abivard nodded hosios ignored both of them he said we have a proverb when in videssos the city eat fish if you come to the videssian empire should you not accommodate yourselves to our usages sharbaraz hesitated as soon as he did abivard knew another fight was lost this time he resolved to get ahead of the rightful king of kings thank you for the invitation young majesty he said to hosios roshnani will be honored to attend especially since its you who command it hosios beamed and turned to sharbaraz the rightful king of kings gave abivard a soyouvehadyourrevenge look then yielded with as much grace as he could muster where abivards wife may go how can his sister be left behind denak too will conform to your customs this evening excellent the junior avtokrator carefully refrained from sounding smug or triumphant i shall see you at sunset this evening then at sunset sharbaraz carefully refrained from sounding enthusiastic im so excited roshnani squeaked as she walked through the streets of serrhes toward the epoptes residence she stared at the golden dome atop a temple to phos i never imagined i would see a videssian city from the inside i hoped i would after taking it in war abivard said but not this waynever as guest to the avtokrators son a couple of paces ahead denak strode along beside sharbaraz by the casual glances she cast this way and that she might have been born in serrhes and come back to it after a few months absence she appeared interested but a long way from fascinated unlike her sisterinlaw she took the invitation to hosios supper as no more than her due the officers who trailed after sharbaraz and abivard imitated denak in one respect just as she did her best to seem unimpressed with the videssian city so they tried to pretend that she and roshnani were not with their party their idea of society was rigidly masculine and they aimed to keep it that way kalamos residence and serrhes main temple to phos looked at each across the market square below the hillock in which the citadel stood the temple was impressive with a large dome surmounting on pendentives walls thick enough to make another citadel in time of need by contrast the epoptes residence was severely plain whitewashed walls slit windows a red tile roof if such a meager home was a perquisite of office abivard wondered how the videssians managed to lure anyone into the job his perspective changed when he went inside videssians confined the loveliness of their homes to the interior where only those so bidden could observe it mosaics of herding and hunting scenes brightened the floors while tapestries made the walls seem to come alive the residence was built around a courtyard a fountain splashed there in the middle of a formal garden torches did their brave best to turn evening to noontime hosios and kalamos greeted the makuraner leaders as they arrived beside the epoptes stood his wife a plump pleasantfaced woman who seemed pleased to greet roshnani and denak and a trifle puzzledthough politeness masked most of thatthe rest of the guests had no women with them other officials as hosios had said also had their wivesand sometimes along with their sons their young and pretty daughtersat the supper they all took that utterly for granted which bemused even abivard who thought of himself as a liberal in such matters its what youre used to i suppose sharbaraz said after accepting greetings from yet another highborn videssian lady but by the god ill need a while to get used to this not all the videssians spoke makuraner nor did all the makuraners know videssian those who had both languages interpreted for those who did not some from each group hung back resolutely unsociable suspicious of their longtime foes or both no one hung back from the wine servants circulated with trays of alreadyfilled cups some of the wine had a strong taste of resin a makuranerspeaking videssian explained to abivard we use pitch to seal the wine jars and to keep the precious stuff inside from turning to vinegar i hadnt noticed the flavor for years till you reminded me of it its what youre used to abivard said echoing his sovereign the main course for the banquet was a pair of roasted kids as the second highestranking makuraner abivard was seated by kalamos he turned to the epoptes and said i recognize garlic and cloves and the flavoring but not the rest of the sauce the oil is from the olive kalamos answered which i know is not common in makuran and the rest is garum brought hither all the way from videssos the city garum that was not a word abivard knew what goes into it it has a tang not quite like anything ive tasted he smacked his lips unsure whether he liked it or not its made from fish the epoptes explained if he had stopped there everything would have been fine but he went on they make it by salting down fish innards in pots open to the air when the fish are fully ripe a liquid forms above them which is then drawn off and bottled a great delicacy dont you agree abivard needed a moment to realize that when the helpful videssian said ripe he meant putrid his stomach got the message before his head did he gulped wine hoping to quell the internal revolt before it was well begun then he shoved his plate away i find im full he said what was he saying about fish in the sauce asked roshnani who had been talking in very simple makuraner with the epoptes wife never mind abivard answered you dont want to know he watched the videssians downing their young goat with gusto sauce and all they really thought they were giving their guests the best they had and in fact the meal while strange to his palate hadnt tasted badbut after he found out what garum was he couldnt bring himself to eat another bite of kid fruit candied in honey and cheese made safer choices minstrels played pipes and pandouras and sang songs that struck the ear pleasantly even if abivard couldnt understand the words the sweets and wine helped drown the memory of fermented fish sauce sharbaraz and hosios had spent the banquet in earnest conversation sometimes in the language of one sometimes in that of the other they seemed to get on well which abivard thought an advantage it would have been a bigger one though had hosios had authority to do anything much without likinios leave sharbaraz bowed to his host as he stood to go abivard and the rest of the makuraners imitated their sovereign as they headed out of the epoptes residence a videssian woman let out a short shriek and then exclaimed volubly in her own language oh by the god sharbaraz clapped a hand to his forehead she says bardiya stuck his hand between herwell felt of her where he shouldnt have get that fool out of here the rest of you as some of the makuraner officers manhandled bardiya out into the night he howled what is she complaining about she must be a whore or she wouldnt show herself to other men like that she somebody clapped a hand over his mouth muffling whatever else he had to say forgive him i beg you kind lady and you also my generous hosts sharbaraz said rapidly he must have drunk too much wine or he would not have been so rude and foolish to abivard he muttered under his breath this is what comes of banquets run by customs other than our own hosios said perhaps it would be wiser if that man did not come into serrhes again one lapse is fairly easily forgiven more than one sharbaraz bowed it shall be as you say of course thank you for your gracious understanding torchbearers lighted the makuraners way back to their encampment once they were out of earshot of the epoptes residence abivard said that idiot might have ruined everything dont i know it sharbaraz answered lucky bardiya didnt try to drag her back among the flowers that would have been a pretty picture wouldnt ita rape at a feast given us by our benefactors if hed done that he should have answered for it with his head denak said as it is he ought to suffer more than just being hustled away in disgrace her voice had a brittle edge abivard remembered what she had endured from sharbarazs guards back at nalgis crag stronghold what do you suggest sharbaraz asked though his tone gave no assurance he would heed what she said stripes well laid on denak answered at once use him to teach the lesson and it wont have to be taught again too harsh sharbaraz sounded like a man dickering over figs in the market square heres what ill do come morning ill have him apologize to that lady as if she were likinios wife right down to knocking his head on the floor that may even humiliate him worse than a flogging and it wont cost me as much goodwill in the army its not enough denak said darkly its better than nothing and more than i expected youd get roshnani said having her sisterinlaw speak up for what sharbaraz had proposed made denak nod too a sharp abrupt motion that showed consent without enthusiasm we think of the videssians as devious doubledealers sharbaraz said like a coin that has two sides in their poems and chronicles they look on us as fierce and bloodthirsty most times thats a good reputation for us to have now though we have to seem civilized enough by their standards to be worth helping a formal apology should do the job its not enough denak repeated but then she let the argument go hosios conveyed his recommendations whatever they were to a courier to take to his father in the distant northeast of the empire of videssos not long after he did so he too departed from serrhes he had other things to do besides attending to a ragtag band of makuraners after he was gone the town seemed to shrink in on abivard as if the world outside had altogether forgotten him and his companions summer turned to fall the local farmers harvested their meager crops without the wagonloads of grain that came into serrhes every day its makuraner guests would have starved fall brought rain herdersmuch like their makuraner counterpartsdrove their cattle and sheep to the fields that showed the most new green soon the winds from out of the westfrom makuranwould bring snow instead of rain the climate might be somewhere close to as harsh as that round vek rud stronghold and tents were worse suited than castles to riding out winter blizzards rain turned roads to mud even had sharbaraz and his host wished to pull up stakes and go somewhere new they would have been hardpressed to move far or fast through the gluey clinging ooze only when the first freeze turned the mud hard did travel cautiously begin again about a month after that first freeze a courier came into serrhes to report that the avtokrator likinios was little more than a day outside of town the epoptes went into a cleaning fit like a village woman who sees from her window her fussy motherinlaw approaching as if by sorceryand abivard wasnt altogether sure kalamos hadnt resorted to magecraftwreaths and bunting appeared on the streets that led from the gates to the square below the citadel just the streets likinios was likeliest to travel sharbaraz also did his best to bring order and cleanliness to his camp outside the wall even after that best was done the camp still struck abivard as a sad ragged place as if a broken dream had been badly animated and brought halfway to life but he held his peace for likinios should he choose had the power to revitalize sharbarazs cause in full anything that might prompt him to do so was worth trying when likinios did reach serrhes the ceremonial ordained for his meeting with sharbaraz was similar to that which hosios had employed with abivard and his honor guard sharbaraz rode out from his camp to greet the avtokrator who came forth from the city walls abivard had looked for an older version of hosios just as peroz in both looks and style had been an older version of sharbaraz but likinios although by his face he had plainly sired his eldest son as plainly came from a different mold his features were individually like those of hosios but taken as a whole gave abivard the impression that the avtokrator was totting up how much the ceremony costand not caring for the answer he got likinios wore gilded armor but on him it seemed more a costume than something he would don naturally i welcome you to videssos your majesty he said in fair makuraner his voice was tightly controlled not abivard thought because he was using a language foreign to him but because that was the sort of man he was the word that ran through abivards mind was calculator i thank you for your kindness and generosity to me and my people your majesty sharbaraz replied you have already dealt with the epoptes here so i need not introduce him to you likinios sounded relieved at not having to spend any unnecessary words your majesty i have the honor to present to you my brotherinlaw the lord abivard dihqan of vek rud domain sharbaraz said abivard bowed in the saddle to the avtokrator likinios grudged him a nod in return youre a long way from home sir he observed abivard stared at him could he know where in makuran vek rud domain lay abivard would not have bet against it sharbaraz said all my men in this your realm are a long way from home your majesty with your gracious assistance we shall return there one day in the not too distant future the avtokrator studied him for a while before replying likinios eyes didnt see just surfaces abivard had the feeling they measured like a cloth merchant checking the exact length of a boltand reckoned up cost with the same impersonal precision at last likinios said if you can show me how helping you is worth my while ill do it otherwise he let the word hang in the air your son was more forthcoming on this your majesty sharbaraz said he did not presume to call likinios by name as he had hosios my son as yet is young the avtokrator made a sharp chopping gesture with his right hand he has no trouble deciding what he wants but he has not yet learned that everything has its price surely having a king of kings in mashiz who was grateful for your generosity would be worth a pretty price sharbaraz said gratitude is worth its weight in gold likinios said abivard thought the videssian ruler was agreeing with sharbaraz until he realized words had no weight sharbaraz also needed a moment to catch that when he did he frowned and said surely honor and justice are not words without meaning to a man who has held the imperial throne for more than twenty years no indeed likinios answered but other words also have meaning to me risk and cost and reward not least among them putting you back on your throne wont be easy or cheap if i decide to do it i expect to be rewarded with more than gratitude your majesty the way he aimed the honorific at sharbaraz only emphasized that the rightful king of kings would not be truly entitled to it without videssian aid if you fail to help me now and i reclaim the throne even so sharbaraz began ill take that chance likinios said his voice flat abivard leaned over to whisper to sharbaraz bluff and bluster will get you nowhere with this one majesty all thats real to him is what he can see and touch and count his son may be sentimentalhis son might not even make a bad makuraner if it comes to thatbut hes the coldhearted videssian in all our tales come to life i fear you may be right sharbaraz whispered back he raised his voice to address likinios once more what could be more valuable to videssos than quiet along your western frontier we have that now the avtokrator answered were likely to keep it as long as smerdis rules too sharbaraz grunted as if kicked in the belly also as if kicked in the belly he needed time to find the breath for a reply i had not looked for your majesty to be so blunt likinios shrugged my father hosios had me work in the treasury for a time before the throne came to me once youre around numbers for a while you lose patience with twisting words around thats not what smerdis found sharbaraz said with a sour laugh he pointed to likinios you took the throne from your father and you want your son to have it from you but what if some treasury official not of your house takes courage from what smerdis did in mashiz and steals the throne that ought to belong to hosios if you encourage usurpers in makuran you encourage them in videssos too there is the first argument of sense youve put forward likinios remarked abivard felt like hugging himself with glee that wasnt sharbarazs argument it was roshnanis at least in essence how she would laughhow she would brag when he told her what the avtokrator of the videssians had said about it how much weight does it have sharbaraz asked by itself not enough likinios said flatly smerdis will give me peace in the west as well as you will i need that peace for now so i can properly deal with the kubratoi once for all their horsemen raid all the way down to the suburbs of videssos the city a century and a half ago the cursed savages forced their way south of the istros river and set up their robbers nest in land rightfully videssian i aim to take it back if it costs me every goldpiece in the treasury this i understand your majesty abivard said we have our own trouble with nomads spilling south over the degird videssos had subsidized those nomads but he forbore to mention it his sovereign needed videssian aid likinios eyes swung away from sharbaraz and onto him they were redtracked pouchy full of suspicion but very wisemaybe dangerously wise had his father godarz been filled with bitterness instead of calm he might have had eyes like those the avtokrator said then you will also understand why i say videssos aid has a price attached and what price will you seek to extract from me sharbaraz asked whatever you ask of me you may be fairly sure i will tell you aye but you may also be sure i shall remember and you your majesty may be sure i am sure of both those things likinios smile stretched his mouth wide but did not reach those disconcerting eyes a nice calculation dont you think how much to demand so that i show a profit from the arrangement and yet keep from enraging you afterward he shrugged we need not decide the matter now after all we have the whole winter ahead of us you look forward to the dicker abivard blurted imagining a videssian avtokrator as devious was easy imagining him as a merchant in the bazaar was something else again but likinios nodded of course i do snow swirled through the streets as sharbaraz and abivard rode toward the epoptes residence abivard was beginning to pick up some videssian he laughed after he and the rightful king of kings went past a couple of locals chatting with each other sharbaraz gave him a curious look whats so funny didnt i understand them abivard said werent they complaining about what a hard winter this is oh i see his sovereign managed a smile but a thin one i would have said the same thing till i saw what you endured every year in front of kalamos home a servitor took charge of the makuraners horses another servitor bowing deeply admitted them to the residence then made haste to shut the door behind them abivard heartily approved of that ducts under the floor carried heat from a central fire to keep the epoptes residence if not warm then at least not cold that second servant led them to the chamber where likinios awaited they could have found the room without his help they had been here a good many times before the servant turned to abivard shall i bring hot spiced wine eminent sir he asked in videssianhe knew abivard was trying to learn his tongue yes please that be good abivard said he wouldnt be writing videssian poetry any time soon but he was starting to be able to say things other people could follow likinios bowed to sharbaraz then nodded to abivard when the formalities were done the avtokrator said shall we go back to the map he spoke of the square of parchment as abivard might have of a fine horse or ganzak the smith of a wellmade sword it was his passion the place where his interest centered in most circumstances abivard would have judged that a spiritless thing to have as a controlling interest but not now in the duel likinios waged with his makuraner guests maps were tools of war no less than horses and swords as he always did abivard admired the videssians lucid cartography his own people didnt worry so much about portraying every inch of ground perhaps because so much of the ground in makuran held little worth portraying but likinios had detailed pictures of land videssos didnt even ownyet i knew we would come down to haggling over valleys in vaspurakan sharbaraz said gloomily youd not have the wit to be king of kings if you didnt know it the avtokrator retorted he pointed to the map again the mountain valleys of vaspurakan ran east and west between videssos and makuran up to the north of serrhes they offered the best trade routeswhich also meant the best invasion routesbetween the two lands these days most of those routes lay in makuraner hands sharbaraz said along with the lay of the land vaspurakan grows good fighting men i hate even to think of giving them up caught between your realm and mine they have to be good fighting men likinios said which drew a startled chuckle from abivard he hadnt thought the avtokrator a man to crack any jokes even small ones likinios continued the vaspurakaners also worship phos videssos grieves to see them under the dominion of those who will spend eternity in skotos ice for their misbelief i think videssos grieves more over that than the vaspurakaners do sharbaraz answered they think you worship your god the wrong way and complain that you try to make them follow your errors our usages are not errors likinios said stiffly and no matter what they are you your majesty are in a poor position to point them out to me sharbaraz sighed thats true i fear reluctantly he walked over to the map show me again what you propose to wring from me in exchange for your aid likinios ran his finger down a zigzagging line from north to south he was not modest in his demands at the moment makuran held about four fifths of vaspurakan were sharbaraz to accept what likinios wanted that holding would shrink to less than half the disputed country abivard said tell him no your majesty what he asks is robbery no other word for it that is not true likinios said it is a price for a service rendered if you do not wish the service your majesty you need not pay the price it is still too high a price sharbaraz said as i warned you when we first met did i pay it i should feel honorbound to try to recover it when my strength allowed i tell you this again your majesty so you may be forewarned youd start that war of revenge for this eh likinios frowned and paced back and forth it could be so it is so sharbaraz answered i pledge my word on it and the word of a makuraner nobleunless he be smerdisis to be trusted if you insist i will pay this price but we shall have war afterward i cannot afford more war now likinios said irritably spitting out afford as if it were a curse however much i should like a friendly king of kings in mashiz you tempt me to think an ineffectual one will serve as well abivard studied the map once more he also listened again in his mind to the way likinios had spoken he pointed to a symbol in one of the valleys likinios sought to claim these crossed picks represent a mine not so likinios nodded abivard continued what would your majesty say to a boundary that marched more like this he drew his own zigzag line this one taking in several valleys with mines but not the great stretch of territory to which the avtokrator wanted to lay claim it still gives away too much sharbaraz said at the same time likinios said this is not enough the two men of royal blood looked at each other abivard took advantage of their hesitation your majesties isnt a plan that leaves both of you less than happy better than one that satisfies videssos too well and makuran not at all or the other way round ah but if i am not satisfied i have only to withhold aid and my life goes on anyway much as it would have without these talks likinios said while thats true your majesty if you dont give me aid you lose the chance to put a king of kings beholden to you on the throne in mashiz and you leave a usurper there as a temptation to every ambitious man in videssos sharbaraz said and if you think smerdis will be grateful to you for not backing me remember how he treated me likinios scowled and studied the map again encouraged because he did not reject the proposal out of hand abivard said if the precise border i suggested fails to please you your majesty perhaps you will propose one along similar lines or perhaps my master the king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase might offer one of his own how do you speak of the realms increasing in one breath and ask me to take away a great slice of vaspurakan in the next sharbaraz asked but to abivards relief he did not sound angry instead he walked over and gave the map a long hard look himself abivard thought serious talk as opposed to posturing began then between the king of kings of makuran and the avtokrator of the videssians the next time he tried to suggest something to move the talks along both men stared at him as if he were a drooling idiot he felt humiliated but not for long two days later they reached an agreement not very far from the one he had outlined on the map with his finger tanshar bowed low to abivard may it please you lord the fortuneteller said you are being spoken ofcomplimented to make myself clearby our people and the videssians alike he bowed always an honor to serve you and doubly now what is your wish were i to suggest what i propose to you in aid of a king of kings rather than an avtokrator i should be guilty of treason abivard answered the fortuneteller nodded unsurprised you want me to learn what i can of the videssian royal house just so abivard said i want you to scry out if you can how long likinios will remain on the throne and how long hosios will rule after him i shall try lord but i make no guarantees as to the results tanshar answered as you say you would be committing treason if you sought to learn these things about the royal house of makuran not only that you would have a hard time learning them even if you had no fear of treason the king of kings will normally surround himself with spells that make divining his future as difficult as possible in my judgment a sensible measure of selfpreservation i would be most surprised if the avtokrator did not similarly ward himself i hadnt thought of that abivard said unhappily but yes youre likely to be right do your best all the same perhaps you will have better luck than a videssian mage might for id guess the avtokrator would be best protected against the kind of sorcery usual in his own country no doubt thats so lord tanshar agreed but we plainly are the next greatest magical threat to the avtokrators wellbeing so his future may be shielded against our magecraft as well i understand abivard said if you fail were no worse off than we would be otherwise but if you succeed well have learned something important about how far we can rely on the videssians do the best you can thats all i can say fair enough tanshar said i appreciate your not expecting the impossible of me what i can do i shall do when do you want me to make the attempt as soon as may be of course lord tanshar said although you may not find it exciting to watch the charms involved have little drama to them i confess and i may have to go through several of them to find one that worksif indeed any of them succeeds as i said i have no assurance of success in this undertaking but if you like i will begin trying this evening after you return from the latest talks between his majesty and the avtokrator likinios that will be fine abivard said having haggled over what sharbaraz would yield in exchange for aid the two men were now dickering over how much aid he would get likinios would indeed have made a marvelous rug seller in the end abivard suspected sharbaraz would make most of the concessions once more having the royal blood without ruling makuran ate at him when abivard went back to tanshars tent he found the fortuneteller waiting for him i have assembled a number of means for looking into what may be tanshar said the god willing one will pierce not only the veil of future time but whatever the videssians may have thrown up around their avtokrator he tried scrying with water as he had when abivard brought him ardinis curse tablet since abivard had touched and dealt with likinios tanshar reckoned him an appropriate link to the avtokrator of the videssians but no matter how still the water in the scrying bowl became it never gave the fortuneteller and abivard any picture of what likinios was doing or how long he might go on doing it i might have known tanshar said scrying with water is the simplest way of looking into the future if the videssians warded against any of our styles of divination that would be the one he tried again with a clear faceted crystal in place of the bowl of water the crystal turned foggy abivard did not need to ask anything of the fortuneteller to realize that meant his magical efforts were being blocked tanshar replaced the clear crystal with one of chalcedony this is a videssianstyle divination he said perhaps it will have more success but it didnt as he had guessed the videssians warded the avtokrator against their own methods of seeing what lay ahead too next he tried a divination that was in large measure an invocation of the god abivard had high hopes for that one surely the god was stronger than the false deities of good and evil in whom the videssians believed the invocation though failed as utterly as had the earlier divinations how can that be abivard demanded i will not imagine for a moment that the videssians worship correctly and we do not nor need you imagine that tanshar answered the truth is more simple and less dismaying while the god of course outstrips phos and skotos in power so also must the videssian wizards charged with protecting their ruler surpass me together they and their gods he curled his lip in scorn suffice to block my efforts had we a stronger makuraner mage here like the one who tried to slay sharbaraz abivard broke in thank you but no im sure you will use whatever you find in the service of the rightful king of kings not against him tanshar bowed you are kind to an old man who never looked to be drawn into the quarrels of the great his clouded eye but made the smile he donned more rueful i wish i could live up to the confidence you place in me you shall i have no doubt of it abivard declared i wish i didnt tanshar rummaged in a leather pouch he wore on his belt and came up with a lump of coal that left black smears on his hands perhaps divination by opposites will evade the videssians wards he said few things are more opaque than coal likinios future however seems at the moment to be one of them he poured the water out of the scrying bowl and set the coal in its place the dialect of makuraner in which he murmured his summons to the god was so archaic abivard could hardly understand it he wondered what would happen if the scrying succeeded would the lump of coal become transparent as his clear crystal had grown murky with a snap almost like a small bolt of lightning the coal burst into flame tanshar jerked his head away just in time to keep his mustache and bushy eyebrows from getting singed a pillar of greasy black smoke rose to the roof of his tent does that tell you anything abivard asked one thing and that most clearly tanshar answered in a shaken voice i am not likely to learn how long likinios will remain avtokrator not with any sorcery i have under my control abivard bowed his head accepting that but he was the sort who when thwarted in one direction would turn to another to gain his ends all right then he said lets see how long hosios will reign once he succeeds his father tanshar waited till the coal had burned out then swept the ashes from the scrying bowl he swung a small censer full of bitterly aromatic myrrh over the bowl i want to purify it before my next attempt he explained no trace of that previous magic may remain he began anew with the simplest scrying tool plain water in the bowl together he and abivard waited for stillness then touched the bowl and waited again abivard had not placed much faith in this try he gasped when the water roiled and bubbled then gasped again when instead of showing him a scene that would answer his question it turned thick and red blood he said choking a little you see that too tanshar said yes what does it mean unless im much mistaken tanshar said sounding sure he was not it means hosios shall not live to wear the avtokrators crown and red boots for by that conjuration the blood was surely his spring came to serrhes a couple of weeks earlier than it would have in vek rud domain by the time rain replaced snow and closed the roads for a spell though likinios had brought in a goodsized force of cavalry to join sharbarazs men against smerdis at the head of the cavalry regiments was a general who reminded abivard of a fatter version of zal a tough fellow in his fifties not long on polish but liable to be very good in the field his name was maniakes in spite of that he didnt look like a videssian he was blocky squarefeatured with a truly impressive fleshy promontory of a nose and a tangled gray beard that hung halfway down the front of his mail shirt im videssian enough thanks he answered when abivard asked him about it even if all four of my grandparents came out of vaspurakan but abivard scratched his head dont you worship differently from the videssians i do aye but my son was raised in videssos faith the officer answered from what my grandfathers said thats a smaller change to make than worshiping the god whom you makuraners were trying to ram down the throat of vaspurakan oh abivard wondered if the makuraner overlords of vaspurakan still behaved as they had in the days of maniakes grandfather he hoped not if they did the folk of that land might be more ready to welcome videssos than sharbaraz thought with the cavalry came a regiment of engineers with wagons full of carefully sawn timbers and lengths of thick rope and fittings of iron and bronze the men seemed more like mechanics than soldiers they practiced assembling engines and putting together bridges much more than they went out with bow and spear in his campaign against smerdis the year before sharbaraz had enjoyed no such aid that had cost him in the maneuverings between the tutub and the tib it would not cost him this time when do we move out abivard asked the rightful king of kings after a morning of mock cavalry charges were ready the videssians are readyand so is their vaspurakaner general sharbaraz made a sour face he had found out about maniakes then the trouble is the tutub and the tib arent ready this is their flood time the engineers dont want everything swept away if the flood proves worse than usualand theres no way to gauge that till it happens the vek rud and the degird wouldnt come into flood so soon abivard said after a moment he went on musingly of course the snow wouldnt be melting so early in the season up in my part of the world either he shrugged prepared to make the best of it more time to spend with roshnani sharbaraz laughed at him having but one wife along has turned you uxorious what will the rest of your women think when you go back to your stronghold they knew she was my favorite before she set out on campaign with us abivard said i do begin to understand now as i didnt before how the videssians even the grandees among em make do with but one wife each some truth to that sharbaraz agreed having the wife in question be as clever and lovely as the lady your sister does add to the compensation i must say you are gracious majesty im yearning to return to my country sharbaraz said i wonder what smerdis is expecting hell know we fled to videssos of course and hell know some of whats been going on here from caravans and single traders but whether he knows well have an imperial army with us when we head west againthat well have to find out if he does hell be using it to whip up hatred against you abivard said hell be calling you things like traitor and renegade all he can call himself is thief and usurper sharbaraz answered next to that he cant do much of a job with the tar brush on me but youre righthell try let him the rightful king of kings folded his hands into fists im looking forward to renewing our acquaintance abivard had always reckoned his own folk pious he believed in the god and the prophets four he invoked them frequently and he would not have thought of undertaking anything major without first praying the same held true for any makuraner but the videssians were not merely pious they were ostentatiously pious in a way that was new to him when their army prepared to sally forth with that of sharbaraz the chief prelate of serrhes came out to bless them in a robe of clothofgold and seed pearls with a blue velvet circle over his heart behind him marched a couple of younger men almost as gorgeously robed who swung golden censers that distributed puffs of incense widely enough for even abivards heathen nostrils to twitch and behind them came a double line of priests in plain blue robes with clothofgold circles on their breasts they sang a hymn of praise to phos abivard could not understand all of it but the music was strong and stirring a good tune with which to march into battle among all the holy men the farewell from kalamos almost got lost in the shuffle the epoptes made his little speech the videssian cavalrymen near enough to hear it clapped their hands a couple of times and he went back to his residence to sign parchments stamp seals and probably do his best to forget that the makuraners had ever disturbed his nearly vegetative peace sharbaraz made his own speech pointing to the gold sunburst on blue that fluttered at the head of the videssian ranks he said today the lion of makuran and videssos sun go forth together for justice the god grant we find it soon his men cheered a roar that dwarfed the spatter of applause the videssians had deigned to dole out to kalamos one thing sharbaraz knew was how to play to a crowd he waved made his horse rear and then turned it toward the west toward makuran and home his lancers followed after them came his baggage train refurbished and supplemented by the videssians their army did not ride directly behind sharbarazs but on a parallel track that was not just to keep from having to swallow their new allies dustit also served to remind sharbaraz and those who traveled with him that the videssians were a force in their own right before long they rubbed that in even more unmistakably videssian scouts trotted up to ride alongside the lead detachments of sharbarazs force that did not sit well with abivard he pointed to them as they went past and said dont they trust us to keep a proper watch on what lies ahead sharbaraz sighed for the first time since he had learned likinios would aid him even if at a price he seemed almost like the hopeless despairing self he had shown when things went wrong the summer before he said the short answer is no the videssians will do as they please and were in no position to call them on any of it youre in overall command of this army abivard insisted likinios agreed to that without a murmur as he was in honor bound to do now sharbaraz smiled but the expression seemed more one of pity than amusement every so often brotherinlaw of mine you remind me that the world of a dihqan along the vek rud differs from that of mashizor of videssos the city he held up a hand before abivard could get angry no i mean no offense your way is surely simpler and more honest but let me ask you one question if maniakes declines to obey an order i give how am i to compel him abivard bit down on that like a man breaking a tooth on a pebble in his bowl of mutton stew as many videssians were riding west as makuraners maybe more maniakes could more easily force sharbaraz to do his bidding than the other way round if he withdrew sharbarazs makuraners could not beat smerdis by themselves they had proved that the year before i begin to think running a realm may be a deeper sorcery than many over which the mages crow abivard said at last you have to keep so many things in mind to hope to do it properlyand you have to see them to be able to keep them in mind that one never occurred to me maybe i am the innocent you say i am sharbaraz leaned over and set a hand on his arm you do fine better not to have to look for serpents under every cushion before you sit down if theyre there youd better look for them abivard said oh indeed but i wish they werent there sharbaraz replied by the god when i take mashiz and the throne ill kill every one i find that would be splendid majesty may the day come soon abivard rode along for a while in silence then he said in a way though i am sorry to be leaving videssos so soon what why sharbaraz asked sharply has your own realm lost its savor after half a year in another no of course not abivards fingers twitched in a gesture of rejection he went on its just that because videssos has around it so many seas i thought tanshars prophecy of something shining across a narrow one might come to pass here ive already seen fulfilled the other two he gave me if thats your reason i forgive you sharbaraz said nodding but prophecy is a risky business thats so abivard remembered he hadnt told his sovereign of the scrying he had had tanshar do of hosios future he described how the water in the scrying bowl had taken on the semblance of blood now thats intriguing sharbaraz said slowly had likinios refused me aid i might have used it against him to claim he like my father ran the risk of being the last of his line but since the videssians do ride with us i dont know quite what to make of it or how to employ it best simply to bear it in mind i suppose till the time comes when it proves of value to me he paused i wonder if likinios wizards made similar inquiries into my future and what they learned if they did that was something else that hadnt occurred to abivard he bowed in the saddle to the rightful king of kings majesty henceforward i leave all the searches for serpents and scorpions to your sharp eyes id be more flattered at that if id spotted smerdis sharbaraz said abivard spread his hands conceding the point every pace their horses took moved them farther west roshnani said im sorry were leaving videssos thats odd abivard sat up in her little cubicle in the wagon she shared with denak the sudden motion stirred the air and made the lamps flame flicker i said the same thing to the king of kings earlier today what are your reasons cant you guess she asked women there live as your sister and i would oh abivard chewed on that for a little while then said and they also suffer outrages they never would in makuran look what happened to that videssian lady when bardiya took her for a woman of no virtue but bardiya is from makuran roshnani said i dare hope at least that videssian men used to the freedom of their women and not thinking it wrong or sinful would never behave so i didnt see them doing so or hear tales of it abivard admitted but being a man i know somewhat of men if men find themselves around such free women all the time a good number of them will surely become smooth practiced seducers of a sort we also do not know in makuran roshnani bit her lip i suppose that is possible she said abivard admired her honesty for admitting it she went on on the other hand i doubt the videssians are troubled by problems like the one ardini caused in your womens quarters last year youre probably right there he said now she smiled he did too understanding her well neither of them was one to deny the other could have a point lowering her voice to a whisper roshnani said unlike your sister i dont claim giving women freedom from their quarters will solve all their old problems without causing any new ones thats not how the world works but i do think the problems that come will be smaller than the ones that go abivard said do you suppose some women once freed as you say might turn into seducers themselves denak would have got angry at such a suggestion roshnani considered it with her usual care very likely some would she said as with men some are more lecherous than others and some also less happy with their husbands than they might be she ran a hand down along his bare chest and belly there i proved very lucky and i he stroked her cheek he thought of what he had said to sharbaraz earlier in the day with you i think id have no trouble holding to the videssian custom of having but one wife my father would laugh at that im sure but after all weve been together on this campaign for most of a year and ive never felt the need for variety he sighed somehow i doubt though that all men are so fortunate or all women roshnani said he took her hand in his and guided it a little lower yet and what shall we do about that again so soon but she was not complaining even the badlands that lay between videssos western outposts and the land of the thousand cities donned a ragged cloak of green in springtime bees buzzed among flowers that would soon wilt and crumble not to be seen again till the following year horses pulled plants from the sandy ground as they trotted west saving some of the fodder the army had brought with it maniakes rode up to sharbaraz and abivard with him came a young man hardly more than a youth who was his image but for a beard that showed no sign of gray and features thinner and less scarred he said the worst thing smerdis could do to us would be to poison the wells along the way wed have skotos own time making it to the tutub without stopping for water along the way even at this time of year when the stream beds may yet hold some he wont sharbaraz said confidently maniakes raised a bushy eyebrow what makes you so sure he wondered abivard wondered the same thing but couldnt have been so blunt about asking it sharbaraz said the first thing smerdis thinks of is money if he poisons the wells caravans cant cross between videssos and makuran and he cant tax them sooner than that hell try to find some other way to deal with us it could be so you know smerdis better than i do nobody in videssos knows much of him at all maniakes kept his voice neutral he turned to the young man who looked like him and asked what do you think in slow makuraner the young man replied i would not give away a soldierly advantage sir to gain money later but some might as smerdis was mintmaster money may matter much to him well reasoned sharbaraz said indeed abivard said to videssians who loved logicchopping that was higher praise than it would have been for a makuraner he wondered if the same held true for vaspurakaners who had adopted videssian ways in case it didnt he nodded to the younger manwho was a few years younger than heand asked maniakes your son maniakes bowed in the saddleabivard had pleased him he said aye my eldest eminent sir he said rendering the videssian title literally into makuraner and your majesty allow me to present to you maniakes the younger unfair sharbaraz said makuran and videssos are usually foes not friends and one of you on videssos side is trouble enough for us two seems excessive the elder maniakes chuckled the younger one murmured your majesty does me too much credit to rank me with my father so soon abivard noted the qualification of his modesty he said may i ask a question after waiting for the two maniakai to nod he went on how is it that you both share a name in makuran its against custom to name a child after a living relative we fear death may get confused and take the wrong one by mistake the videssians share that rule with us i think sharbaraz put in the elder maniakes rumbled laughter just goes to show that even if my line follows videssian orthodoxy were still vaspurakaners under the skin phos made us first of all peoples and we trust him to know one of us from another no matter what name we bear isnt that so son aye the younger maniakes answered but he said no more and looked uncomfortable at having said so much abivard suspected he was less vaspurakaner under the skin than his father thought after a while if a family lived among people different from them wouldnt that family take on more and more of its neighbors ways spurred by that thought he asked the elder maniakes have you any grandchildren eminent sir he used the same nonmakuraner honorific the general had applied to him no none yet maniakes answered though a couple of my boys have wed as will my namesake here if the girls father ever stops pretending shes made of gold and pearls rather than flesh and blood even though his own father hadnt so much as named the lady to whom he wouldor rather mightbe married the younger maniakes got a soft dreamy look in his eyes abivard recognized that look he wore it whenever he thought of roshnani from that he concluded that the younger maniakes not only knew but had already fallen in love with his notquitebetrothed that was yet another way the videssians differed from his own people among whom bride and groom seldom set eyes on each other before their wedding day or so things worked among the nobility at any rate rules for the common folk were looser though arranged marriages were most common among them too abivard wondered how lax things were for videssian commoners and if they had any rules at all the elder maniakes turned the conversation back toward the business at hand your majesty what do we do if the wells are fouled either fall back into videssos or press on toward the tutub sharbaraz answered depending on how far weve come and how much water we have with us i wont lead us across the waste to die of thirst if thats what youre asking if you try i wont follow you the elder maniakes answered bluntly but aye you talked straight with me and youll seldom hear a vaspurakaner princewhich means any vaspurakaner just so you knowcomplain about that he snorted sometimes you can go for days before you get a videssian to come out and tell you what he means again abivard glanced toward the generals son the younger maniakes didnt say anything but didnt look as if he fully agreed with his father abivard chuckled to himself aye videssos had its hooks deeper in the son than in the father knowing that might prove useful one day though he couldnt guess how sharbaraz pointed ahead theres the first oasis unless my eyes are playing tricks on me well soon find out what smerdis has been up to here smerdis had not poisoned the wells both armies had their wizards and healers test the water at each stop on the journey west toward makuran and used a few horses to drink several hours before the men and the rest of the animals refreshed themselves just in case the wizards and healers were wrong with the last oasis past nothing but scrubnow rapidly going from green to its more usual brownlay between the armies and the tutub but before they reached the river that marked the eastern boundary of the land of the thousand cities smerdis sent forth an embassy not to sharbaraz but to the elder maniakes abivard had feared that smerdis best hope now was to split the videssians away from the rightful king of kings he had a way to do that too by offering more concessions to likinios than sharbaraz had the videssians were a devious people for all abivard knew maniakes might have accompanied sharbaraz precisely to extort those concessions from smerdis if he got them would he turn on sharbaraz or would he simply order his horsemen to turn around and ride for home that would be disastrous enough by itself scouts had reported to sharbaraz the arrival of the embassy had sharbaraz been dismounted he would have paced back and forth abivard understood that when zals men had in essence seized his stronghold to force smerdis tax levy from him his fate was taken out of his hands now sharbaraz had to wait for others to decide his destiny if he sells us out ill kill him sharbaraz snarled one slow word at a time i dont care what happens to me afterward better i should fall slaying videssians than at smerdis hands ill be beside you majesty abivard answered sharbaraz nodded pleased at the pledge but his face stayed grim then the elder maniakes accompanied by his son rode toward the rightful king of kings trailing the two videssian officers came a handful of unhappylooking makuraners the elder maniakes jerked a thumb back toward them they were inquiring into the price of having us switch sides he remarked were they sharbaraz fixed smerdis envoys with a smile that might have belonged on the face of a wolf the god give you good day paktyes so you serve the traitor now do you one of the envoyspresumably paktyeslooked even more uncomfortable than he had before sson of peroz i serve the authorities in mashiz he said by which he means hell lick any arse thats shoved in his face abivard said his voice greasy with scorn i never thought id see anything worse than a traitor but now i have a man who just doesnt care he is disgusting isnt he sharbaraz remarked talking about paktyes as if he werent there was nicely calculated to make the ambassador all the more miserable ignoring him again the rightful king of kings turned to the elder maniakes and asked well my friend how much is the pimp of pimps offering the videssian general blinked then guffawed till he coughed when the coughs subsided to wheezes he answered oh these fellows here say hell give up the whole of vaspurakan along with enough silver for a man to walk dryshod from the westlands across to videssos the city if he poured it into the cattle crossingthats the strait between em a narrow sea abivard thought maybe that was what tanshar had meant but how likely was he to cross all the wide westlands and come in sight of videssos fabled capital thinking of his personal concerns made him miss for a moment the way sharbaraz stiffened that is a considerable offer and one more ah generous than i would care to make sharbaraz said carefully how have you replied i havent till now the elder maniakes answered i wanted you to hear it first why to make me match it if likinios needs silver so badly likinios always needs silver maniakes interrupted and even if he didnt hed think he did im sorry your majestyyou were saying if he needs silver i can pay him some once i regain the throne sharbaraz said if he must have all of vaspurakan the rightful king of kings bent his head back exposing his throat strike now he shall not have it from me there do you see paktyes cried my master offers you better terms but my master doesnt care the elder maniakes said he doesnt like the idea of people stealing thrones that dont belong to them hed sooner have an honest man ruling makuran than a thief you see can you blame him whoevers on the throne in mashiz likinios is going to have to live with him and honest men make better neighbors very well then paktyes said he did his best to seem fierce but succeeded only in sounding liverish still snapping he went on the brave armies of the king of kings may his years be long and his realm increase have routed the renunciate once they can surely do it again even if he has treacherously gained aid from our ancient foes in videssos he and his delegation rode back toward the west the elder maniakes turned to sharbaraz and said if hes the best your rival can send out this campaign will be a walkover that would be nice wouldnt it aye it would the rightful king of kings answered but i thought my campaign last spring would be a walkover too and so it wasfor a while the longer it went on though the tougher smerdis men got maniakes chuckled i know how to fix that beat him good early so he doesnt have time to get better late sketching a salute he kicked his horse in the ribs and went off to his own army theres a relief abivard said the videssians could easily have sold us out and they didnt he thought sharbaraz would also be pleased but the rightful king of kings replied so far as we know they didnt paktyes and maniakes could have said anything at all before they came to us i have no idea how good a mime maniakes is but any general needs some of that if hes to adapt himself to the things that can go wrong in war as for paktyes i know for a fact that deceits in his blood how could it be otherwise when he swings this way or that like a bronze weathervane on a farmers roof always turning whichever way the wind of influence blows your majesty you are right abivard looked over his right shoulder at the elder maniakes who had almost rejoined his men for a few minutes he had been elated at the idea of the videssians probity being assured now he saw it was not so the world remained full of ambiguity sharbaraz said the only way to be certain the videssians stay on our side is to have them actually fight against smerdis even then we wont be absolutely sure until after the last fight is won any sooner than that and they could be dissembling building our confidence and trust so as to make betrayal the more devastating when it comes abivard sighed with every day that passed he was gladder his brotherinlaw was the rightful king of kings and not himself sharbaraz saw and took precautions against treachery in places where abivard didnt even see the places he had let down his guard for one moment against his elderly cousin and that lapse might yet forever cost him his throne abivard wondered if sharbaraz would ever let down his guard for anyone again he said if the videssians do betray us what can we do about it sharbaraz gave him a very bleak look nothing even so early in the season mirages danced and sparkled across the badlands that lay between serrhes and the land of the thousand cities abivard had grown used to them and as used to ignoring them when he saw water ahead then he discounted it as just another illusion but this water did not seem to stay the same unchanging tantalizing distance ahead of him no matter how far he traveled the farther west he rode the closer it looked before long he could make out the greenery it supported a murmur ran through the army the tutub weve come back to the tutub how many of them when they had left the easternmost river of makuran and struck out across the desert for videssos had really believed they would returnand return with a good chance of restoring sharbaraz to the throne not many was abivards guess he had had doubts himself and the move had been his own wifes idea what must the rankandfile soldiersthose who hadnt deserted the rightful king of kingshave thought the murmur grew to a great roar the river the river men cheered and wept and pounded one another on the back makuran lay ahead of them no so many had never expected to see this day abivards eyes filled with tears no matter how little the land of the thousand cities resembled vek rud domain he too was coming home as he drew nearer he saw horsemen waiting on the far side of the tutub they probably had not looked for sharbarazs return either and had to be less than delighted to see it now some held their places others rode off to the west no doubt to warn of sharbarazs arrival green and growing things covered both banks of the river so soon after the spring flood the greenery extended a long way out from the tutub canals guided every precious drop to plants that would perish without the lifegiving water sharbaraz sent riders up and down the tutub a couple of farsangs north and south to see if smerdis men had left behind a bridge of boats on which they could cross abivard was unsurprised when they found none he had watched the engineers of peroz king of kings throw a bridge across the degird river that had taken days now he saw the videssian engineers in action the structure they put together was a lot less impressive than the bridge the makuraners had run up but they built it a lot faster they anchored thick heavily greased chains to the shore at one end and to a wooden pontoon at the other then they rowed out to the pontoon in a tiny boat anchored a new set of chains to its far side and hitched them to another pontoon farther out in the tutub they had long planks to reach from pontoon to pontoon and incidentally to reduce the distance each newly placed pontoon could drift downstream from its predecessor they had shorter planks to lay across the long ones and in an amazingly short time they had themselves a bridge at first smerdis men on the west bank of the tutub didnt seem to realize the videssian engineers were creating a structure on which sharbarazs army could cross to attack them only when the western end of the bridge was well within bowshot did they send a few arrows toward the laboring engineers the khamorth on the north bank of the degird had harassed perozs artisans much more effectively as perozs men had the videssians used soldiers with big shields to hold off most of the arrows they also brought archers of their own forward along the growing bridge to shoot back at their foes before long the bridge was anchored to the west bank of the tutub as well as the east riders began to crossfirst videssians for the elder maniakes made his own men use the bridge before he risked makuraners on it then sharbarazs lancers and last of all the wagons of the videssian engineers and the rest of the baggage train as soon as the last wagon rolled onto the west bank of the tutub the engineers began disassembling the pontoon bridge watching abivard thought they might have used a magic to aid them in the deconstruction just as the bridge had grown from the east bank of the tutub to the west so now it shrank in the same direction the engineers rolled up the last heavy greasy chain stowed it in the wagon from which it had come and shouted in videssian that they were ready to move on the elder maniakes rode up to abivard and sharbaraz coughing a little he said you understand i hope it wont be this easy all the time oh indeed sharbaraz said we caught them by surprise theyll be more ready to fight back next crossing we have to force but being back in makuran in my own realm feels so fine in and of itself that i wont worry about the future till i bump into it the land of the thousand cities isnt much like vek rud domain abivard said i was thinking that a little while ago serrhes reminded me a lot more of home dust and heataye and cold through the winterand a healthy fear for enemies from over the border you mean us sharbaraz said grinning so i do abivard smiled too but i got to thinking what i would have done if an important khamorth chief crossed the degird with his clan and came to my stronghold asking for makuraner help to get him back his grazing lands what should i do there probably about what kalamos did act as friendly as i could while i sent a messenger hotfooting it to the capital to find out how i was really supposed to act you couldnt go far wrong doing something like that sharbaraz agreed such things have happened now and again too sometimes wed aid the nomads sometimes we wouldnt depending on what looked advantageous abivard thought of likinios and his beloved map yes the avtokrator had settled for fewer concessions from sharbaraz than he had demanded at first but he had taken a bite out of makuran just the same suppose sharbaraz had refused to yield that bite where would he and his followers be now abivard saw two answers the first was the one hosios had promised the army broken up with each man getting land according to his rank in that case abivards grandchildren would likely have ended up as videssian as the younger maniakes not the worst of fates but not the best either given the way likinios looked at the world though the second picture that sprang into being in abivards mind struck him as much more likely what better use for the avtokrator of the videssians to get out of a host of makuraner refugees than to take them to the northeast and hurl them against the kubratoi every nomad horseman they killed would help videssos while they did the emperor no harm even if they died the scheme was devious underhanded and economical likinios to the core abivard was glad the avtokrator had not had the chance to think of it sharbaraz said this whole realm is mine the land of the thousand cities no less than any other part of it perhaps it helps that i grew up looking out on it from mashiz and that i visited some of the cities down here on the flood plain its not alien to me though i admit i prefer the highlands i am a true makuraner by blood after all of that majesty no one had any doubt abivard waved to the flat green landscape ahead where i have doubts is wondering how were to move here in any direction save the ones smerdis dictates are the videssian engineers good enough to let us do that my father always had the greatest respect for them sharbaraz said invoking peroz as abivard was wont to invoke godarz never having fought against them nor seen them in action i cannot speak from firsthand knowledge i will say this though theyd better be as they had before the cities of the land of the thousand cities closed themselves to sharbarazs army as he had before the rightful king of kings bypassed them and kept moving if he beat smerdis they would fall to him if he didnt abivard saw no point in worrying about that smerdis did not have a large force between the valleys of the tutub and the tib his men shadowed sharbarazs host and the accompanying videssian army but made no effort to attack cowardice sharbaraz snorted he thinks hell stay on the throne if he can outwait me strategy the elder maniakes insisted hes holding back to hurt as much as he can at a time of his choosing being the two men of highest rank in the army they had trouble finding an arbiter to choose between them but before long they settled on abivard he said may it please your majesty i think the eminent sir is right smerdis isnt quite the fool you made him out to be if he were wed never have needed aid from videssos hes a thief and a liar sharbaraz said no doubt he is your majesty the elder maniakes agreed politely however wicked those qualities are in most walks of life though they often come in very handy in war two days later smerdis men broke down the eastern bank of one of the larger canals that stitched together the land of the thousand cities the videssian engineers quickly repaired the breach and ended the flood but that did nothing to deal with the furlongs of black smelly mud the waters left in their wake now we see if they earn their silver abivard declared the engineers earned not only makuraner silver but also videssian gold they used the same planks that had paved the pontoon bridge over the tutub to lay down a roadway that let the army advance through the flooded zone and up to the canal they also recovered the planksexcept for a few that had been trampled deep into the mudso they could use them again in either bridge or roadway now i understand sharbaraz said as the engineers matteroffactly went about bridging the canal they let the videssian army go wherever it wants to you cant just make a flood or build field fortifications and think youre safe from the imperials theyll be inside your tent before you even know theyre around they are good abivard admitted grudgingly i havent had a lot to do with them but just watching them go about their business seeing them talking and gambling around campfires of evenings makes them seem more like ordinary men than they ever did before our tales always make videssians out to be either wicked or ferocious or underhanded ori dont know what all but none of it good and theyre just people its very strange you take any one man from anywhere and hes apt to be a pretty good fellow abivard said even a khamorth will probably love his children or his sheep abivard put in the rightful king of kings snorted its rude to interrupt your sovereign when hes waxing philosophical i dont do it much maybe it comes from being around videssians since theyre finer logicchoppers than anyone else as i was saying your plainsman will love his children he wont beat his wife more than she deserves and hell care for his horses as well as any groom in makuran put him in the company of a couple of hundred of his clansmates and let him overrun a makuraner village though and hell do things that will give you nightmares for years afterward but we have a lot more than a couple of hundred videssians here and theyre still behaving well abivard said thats what surprises me part of that i suppose is that theyre aligned with us if they act like a pack of demons theyll make the people here hate them and us both and so hurt our cause sharbaraz said and theyre more like us than the khamorth are when they arent soldiering theyre farmers or millers or artisans they dont destroy canals for the fun of watching other farmers starve abivard plucked at his beard that makes sense majesty maybe you shouldwhat did you call it wax philosophic more often no thank you sharbaraz answered theres also one other thing i didnt tell you i asked the elder maniakes to make sure his priests stuck to their own and didnt go about trying to get honest makuraners to worship their false god the bluerobes who follow phos are better organized than our servants of the god and they go after converts like flies diving into honey they have been quiet abivard said i didnt realize this isnt the way they usually behave it isnt sharbaraz assured him theyre as certain of the truth of their phos as we are about the god and since they think they have the only true god theyre sure anyone who doesnt worship himor who doesnt worship him the right waywill spend eternity in ice just as we know misbelievers vanish into the void and are gone forever they think they have a duty to get people to worship as they do getting maniakes to muzzle them hasnt been easy why not abivard asked puzzled if a noble gives an order those who serve under him had better obey sharbaraz laughed raucously abivard looked offended the rightful king of kings said brotherinlaw of mine youre not used to dealing with videssians from all ive seen from all ive heard those bluerobed priests are so drunk with their god they dont care to take orders from any mere noble even the avtokrator sometimes has trouble getting them to do his bidding we dont do things so untidily in makuran abivard said northerwesterner though i am i know that much if the mobedhanmobhed ever presumed to displease the king of kings in any way thered be a new mobedhanmobhed inside the hour sharbaraz finished for him after all the king of kings is the sovereign no one has any business displeasing him he laughed again this time at himself ive been nothing but displeased since the throne cameor should have comeinto my hands when its truly mine at last that wont happen any more his voice held great certainty at first that pleased abivard sharbaraz needed confidence that he would be restored then abivard wondered if the rightful king of kings simply meant he would refuse to listen to anything distasteful once he ruled in mashiz that worried him even a king of kings might need to be reminded from time to time of how the world worked something had changed abivard knew it as soon as he climbed up into the wagon roshnani and denak shared even before he set eyes on his wife the serving woman who bowed to him said not a word out of the ordinary but her voice had a timbre to it he hadnt heard before my husband roshnani said as he stepped into her small cubicle again the words were everyday but the tone was not then she added close the curtain it helps keep out some of the mosquitoes that plague this land that sounded like her abivard obeyed as he did he studied roshnani she lookedlike herself if a little more tired than usual he scratched his head wondering if his imagination was running away with him is anything wrong he asked as she tilted her face up for a kiss wrong whatever makes you think that she laughed at him then went on unless im very much mistaken though i am going to have a baby im glad everythings all ri abivard said before what roshnani had told him got from his ears to his mind his mouth fell open when he shut it again he said how did that happen if roshnani had laughed before now she chortled great ringing peals of mirth that left her hiccuping when she finally brought herself back under control unless im very much mistaken she said deliberately echoing herself it happened in the usual way weve been wed for going on two years now i was beginning to wonder if i was barren abivards fingers twisted in a sign to turn aside words of evil omen the god prevent it he said then he blinked the god has prevented it hasnt he yes she has roshnani said they both smiled when a man and a woman talked about the god in backtoback sentences the effect could be odd on the ear roshnani went on may i give you a son may it be so abivard sobered i wish my father were here so i could set his first grandchild in his arms if that child were heir to vek rud domain all the better he thought of something else lowered his voice i might even wish it werent fathers first grandchild have you told denak youre with child roshnani nodded i told her this morning this is the first day ive been sure enough to speak to anyone she hugged me i understand what you mean though how wonderful it would be if a first grandchild were also heir to the throne of the king of kings of course if father were alive peroz king of kings would likely also still live and denak wouldnt be wed to sharbaraz king of kings abivard mused the more you look at things the more complicated they get he spoke quietly again im glad shes not jealous youve conceived when she hasnt i think perhaps she is a little roshnani said almost whispering herself but then shes also a little jealous that you visit me more often than the king of kings comes to see her is she do i abivard knew he wasnt altogether coherent but he had never before been told he was going to be a father none of the serving women and occasional courtesans he had bedded had made that claim on him and they would have with even the slightest suspicion he had put a child in them as a dihqans son he would have been obligated to make sure their babes were well cared for and none of his other wives had quickened before he left with sharbaraz perhaps he should have fretted over the strength of his seed yes and yes roshnani answered everything he said this evening seemed to amuse her she called to the serving woman for a jar of wine and two cups the jar was a squat one from the land of the thousand cities when she tilted it to pour the wine slithered out slowly she made a wry face not only is it made from dates the people here seem to think they ought to be able to poke a knife in it and bring it to their mouths that way it doesnt matter not for this abivard took one of the cups from her and raised it in salute to our child may the god grant himand youlong years health and happiness he drank so did roshnani not only was the wine thick as molasses it was nearly as sweet too he almost felt the need to chew to get it down it did what wine was supposed to do though by the time he had finished the cup the world seemed a more cheerful place roshnani poured it full again as he sipped the words of his toast came back and so did worry women could die giving birth or of childbed fever afterwards the possibility loomed too large to be ignored but the idea of commending young and vital roshnani to the god because her span was cruelly cut short sent fear through him to keep from thinking about it he gulped down the second cup of sweet date wine when he had finished it he said may denak and sharbaraz soon know this same happiness he was happy despite the worry he would worry about his sister too but he would also be glad for her and her husband roshnani nodded not only will it be good for them it will be good for the realm as well especially if it proves to be a boy having an heir to the throne can only help settle the realm it should help settle the realm you mean abivard said peroz king of kings had an heir too if youll recall i recall it perfectly well roshnani said if smerdis had recalled it too wed all be better offexcept for smerdis which i daresay was all he thought about too true abivard sighed when i was growing up at vek rud stronghold i thought about seeing the land of the thousand cities and videssos aye but i expected to go to war against videssos for the king of kings not with videssian allies against a man who calls himself the king of kings civil war is a strange business when i was growing up i never thought about seeing anything except the stretch of road between my fathers stronghold and yours roshnani answered id known only the stronghold and later only the womens quarters in it next to that my bridal journey seemed travel enough to last me a lifetime she laughed we cant always guess whats to come can we no abivard said thinking of tanshar and even if we do learn whats to come we dont know when or where or how the only thing left for us is to go on as best we can roshnani said come to think of it thats what wed be doing even if we knew just what all the prophecies meant so it is abivard looked at her sidelong the best way to go on after finding out youve a child in your belly that i can think of is roshnani might have had the same thought at the same time the date wine made abivards fingers a little clumsy as he unfastened the wooden toggles at the back of her dress but after that everything went fine smerdis men did their best to delay and misdirect sharbarazs army and his videssian allies by opening canals between the tib and the tutub but their best was not good enough not when the videssian engineers could repair holes in the canal banks and plank roads as fast as the enemy damaged them when we cross the tib theyre ours sharbaraz said aye majesty abivard answered though he could not help thinking that sharbaraz had shown the same confidence the summer before only to have it prove to be overconfidence but perhaps smerdis came to the same conclusion as his rival as sharbarazs men neared the tib their foes drew up in battle array to try to stop them from crossing a major canal prominent in the ranks of smerdis men were the dismounted archers who had brought such grief to sharbarazs forces as they had advanced from the south against mashiz the previous year the elder maniakes looked down his formidable nose at the bowmen if we ever close with them their souls will be falling down to skotos ice quick enough after that he said oh indeed sharbaraz answered the same holds true for my lancers but i dont relish trying to force a crossing in the face of all the archery they can bring to bear on us hes learning abivard thought with something approaching joy the summer before sharbaraz would have chosen the most straightforward way to cross the canal and get at his foes and would have worried about casualties later if at all your majesty may i make a suggestion the elder maniakes asked i wish you would sharbaraz said the videssian commander spoke for several minutes when he was through sharbaraz whistled softly you must have a demon lurking in you to come up with a scheme like that no wonder makuran seldom profits as much as it should in its wars against videssos youre too kind to an old man the elder maniakes said considerably exaggerating his decrepitude you would have seen it yourself in a moment had you but noticed the little hill that town there rests on youll want us to sit tight through the night and start the attack in the morning then wont you eminent sir abivard said well have better hope for success that way surely the videssian general answered he beamed at abivard you do see what needs doing eminent sir and thats a fact cant complain about that and i wouldnt think of trying he plucked at his gray beard hmm now that i think on it eminent sir is probably too low a title for you what with you being brother to his majestys wife but i mean no harm by it i promise you i took no offense abivard said and even if i had i wouldnt have shown it not after that lovely plan you came up with the elder maniakes beamed the only reason i thought of it was to give my son some glory ill have him lead the interesting half sharbaraz turned to abivard the time to trust videssians least is when theyre being modest of course that isnt something youll run into often enough to have to worry about it much your majesty i am wounded to the quick the elder maniakes clapped both hands over his heart as if hit by an arrow you do me a great injustice the biggest injustice i could do you would be to underestimate you the rightful king of kings answered you will forgive me i prayyoure not so young youre plump youre droll when you want to be and youre as dangerous a man as ive ever seen not least because you dont seem so what do i say about that the elder maniakes wondered aloud only that if youve seen through the act it isnt as good as it should be and ill have to put more work into it he sounded genuinely chagrined the next morning dawned clear and hot as did almost every morning in late spring summer and early fall in the land of the thousand cities the videssian engineers had enough pontoons and chains and planks to bridge the tib and tutubplenty to bridge an irrigation canal many times over as soon as it was light they started throwing a good many bridges across the canal that held them apart from smerdis men to abivards dismay scouts from smerdis army were alert no sooner had the bridges started to snake across the oilylooking water than the unmounted archers came rushing up from their camp and began shooting at the engineers as at the crossing of the tutub some of the videssians held big shields to protect the rest from the rain of arrows as the bridges moved forward videssian horse archers rode out onto them and started shooting back at smerdis men they were badly outnumbered but did damage to the foe all the same few of smerdis bowmen wore any sort of armor the heavy cavalry with the foot soldiers gathered in knots in front of the growing bridges to fight off any of sharbarazs men who managed to cross sharbarazs own armored lancers assembled near their end of a bridge that grew ever nearer the west bank of the canal abivard sat his horse at their head wondering how if the men he led charged over the bridge in one direction while smerdis followers charged in the other the videssian engineers would keep from getting squashed between them he found out as soon as the engineers got the last planks in place they dove into the canal and started swimming through the turbid water back toward the eastern bank no sooner had they splashed down into the water than abivard cried sharbaraz and booted his horse forward the bridge swayed as if in an earthquake under the galloping hooves of dozens of horses abivard met his first foe not quite two thirds of the way toward the west bank of the canalhe might have started a heartbeat sooner than smerdis man and perhaps he was better mounted too he twisted his body away from the questing point of the foes lance at the same time he struck with his own the blow caught smerdis soldier in the chest and pitched him off over his horses tail abivards mount a trained warhorse lashed out at the fallen lancer with ironshod hooves abivard spurred the horse ahead toward the next enemy the bridge was not wide more splashes some of them big ones marked men and horses falling or getting pushed into the canal in their heavy iron armor most of them did not come up again sharbaraz abivard cried again he and the backers of the rightful king of kings slowly pushed smerdis men toward their own end of the bridge not one of sharbarazs followers though had yet set foot on the muddy western bank of the canal smerdis troopers yelled the name of their candidate for the throne as loudly as sharbarazs warriors extolled him then from the north a new cry rang out along the canals western bank sarbaraz abivard whooped gleefully even if the videssians couldnt pronounce the sh sound they were not only good soldiers but subtle planners the elder maniakes had predicted smerdis soldiers would be so busy fighting the warriors they saw that they would pay no attention to anything else some of his engineers had taken advantage of the cover offered by the hillock the videssian general had mentioned to run one more floating bridge across the canal a large force of videssian mounted archers proceeded to cross with no opposition whatever they shot up smerdis unarmored foot soldiers then crying sarbaraz once more they charged them swinging sabers and thrusting with light spears they werent quite so deadly as makuraner lancers would have been but they were more than enough to rout the dismounted archers who were useful when they could ply a foe with arrows without being directly assailed in return but whose clubs and knives offered next to no defense in close quarters smerdis heavy cavalry had to break off the fight at the bridgeheads to swing back against the videssians and keep themselves from being surrounded and altogether destroyed but that let abivard and his men reach the west bank of the canal just as the flight of the bowmen let the videssian engineers finish more bridges so more of sharbarazs lancers could cross the officer who led the videssian flanking force had a nice sense of what was essential he let the archers run and concentrated on smerdis horsemen his own troopers were more heavily armed than nonnoble makuraner warriors though they didnt wear iron from head to toe and their horses bore only quilted cloth protection they could hurt smerdis men if those men didnt assail them with everything they had and could stand up well enough against an allout charge to ensure that smerdis lancers couldnt smash through them and escape from sharbarazs men smerdis lancers were quick to realize that they began throwing down their long spears and swords some cried mercy others shouted sharbarazs name some fought on most of those went down but a few managed to break away and run the videssian commanderit was the younger maniakes abivard rememberedwas not content with victory but sent his own horsemen after smerdis fleeing lancers they brought down quite a few more before returning to their comrades a cheer for the maniakai father and son abivard shouted the one planned the victory the other made it real the makuraners he had led yelled themselves hoarse any of them who happened to be near videssians pounded their allies on the back bawled in their ears and offered them wine from the skins they wore on their belts for that moment at least the ancient enemies could not have been closer friends abivard rode toward the younger maniakes well done he said youre younger than i am i envy you your cool head the younger man smiled he had a small cut on his left cheek and a dent and a sparkling line on the bar nasal of his helmet without the nasal he would have taken a bad wound he said you did well yourself eminent sir if you hadnt pressed them so hard they might have punched through us and got away in a body thats what i was trying to stop all right abivard said nodding therell be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth in mashiz when word of this fight gets back to smerdis pimp of pimps good the younger maniakes said grinning that was the idea after all and therell be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth in the land of the thousand cities too we used those unmounted archers hard and anyone with an eye in his head to see with can figure out that we would have used them harder if we hadnt had more important things to do the folk hereabouts may want to think twice before they back smerdis over sarsharbaraz he pumped his fist in the air in triumph at correctly pronouncing the makuraner sound we beat those archers once and fought them again but it didnt make the thousand cities change their mind abivard said maybe this time it will though i hope so this fight happened in the middle of the land of the thousand cities not off in the southern desert the younger maniakes said and smerdis army looks to have broken up to boot every man who gets away alive will go home and every man who gets home will spread the tale of how we smashed smerdis general that cant do smerdis cause any good so it cant abivard eyed the videssian commanders son with new respect not just a fighter eh you like to think about the way things work too i can see that the younger maniakes had an impressively luxuriant beard for a man of his few years a trait that abivard had learned testified to his vaspurakaner blood in spite of that beard which reached up almost to his eyes abivard saw him flush he said you are generous to a man who after all is more likely to be your enemy than your friend i hadnt forgotten that abivard assured him but maybe just maybe the help likinios avtokrator is giving to sharbaraz will bring our two realms a long peace the god knows we both could use it phos grant that it be so the younger maniakes said impulsively he stuck out his hand abivard took it they squeezed with all their strength and let go smarting after a draw all i truly want to do is get back to my domain in the northwest and make sure the khamorth havent ravaged my lands too badlyor punish the plainsmen if they have abivard said peace with videssos will ensure that i can do that peace with makuran will let the avtokrator likinios finish punishing the kubratoi too the younger maniakes said a peace both sides can use is more likely to last than any other kind i can think of aye abivard had agreed before he remembered that videssian gold had stirred up the khamorth tribes north of the degird river against makuran in the first place without that incitement peroz king of kings might never have campaigned against the nomads which meant smerdis wouldnt have stolen the throne from sharbaraz which meant in turn that videssos and makuran wouldnt have joined together against the usurper abivard shook his head indeed the more you looked at the world the more complex it got something else crossed his mind the more you looked at the world the more you could learn videssos would never directly threaten his domain the empires reach wasnt long enough but the khamorth were causing endless trouble in the northwest of makuran and that worked to videssos advantage if makuran ever needed to put similar pressure on videssos who could guess what a subsidy to kubrat might yield abivard stuck the idea away in the back of his mind neither he nor any makuraner could use it now makuran had to put its own house in order before worrying about upsetting those of its neighbors but one of these days he glanced toward the younger maniakes for all his obvious cleverness the videssian officer hadnt noticed abivard was thinking about enmity rather than friendship good abivard thought as he had said he wouldnt mind a spell of peace even a long one with videssos but certain debts would remain outstanding no matter how long the peace lasted the younger maniakes said do you think theyll try to stop us again this side of the tib i doubt it abivard answered we smashed smerdis cavalry and you were the one who noted that those unmounted bowmen are likelier to make for home than to come back together again what does that leave not bloody much eminent sir the younger maniakes said cheerfully thats how i read things too but this isnt my realm and i wondered if i was overlooking something if you are im overlooking it too abivard said no as i see it we have one fight left to win the one in front of mashiz he had thought as much the summer before too but sharbaraz hadnt won that fight after the victory sharbarazs forces and their videssian allies pushed hard toward the tib smerdis men broke the banks of canals on their route the videssian engineers repaired the damage and the armies kept moving smerdis troops did attempt one stand along the western bank of a canal wider than the one they had used as a barrier before the battle abivard worried when he saw how strong the enemys position was so loudly did sharbaraz the elder maniakes remained unperturbed as the sun was setting on the day the army came up against smerdis force he ostentatiously sent a detachment of engineers and a good many of his horse archers north along the east bank of the canal inky darkness fell before they had gone a quarter of a farsang when morning came smerdis soldiers were gone you are a demon eminent sir sharbaraz exclaimed slapping the videssian general on the back wed hurt em once with that trick the elder maniakes replied they werent going to give us a chance to do it again he chuckled wheezily so by threatening that trick we won with a different one the army crossed the canal unopposed and resumed its advance after that city governors from the land of the thousand cities began trickling in to sharbarazs camp something they had never done the summer before they prostrated themselves before him eating dirt to proclaim their loyalty to him as rightful king of kings not yet in a position where he could avenge himself on them for having stayed loyal to smerdis so long he accepted them as if they had never backed his rival but abivard watched his eyes he remembered every slight sure enough abivard wondered if smerdis men would contest the crossing of the tib though the flood season had passed the river was still wide and swiftflowing determined opposition could have made getting across anything but easy but the west bank was bare of troops when sharbaraz and his allies reached it the engineers extended their bridge one pontoon at a time the army crossed and moved west again abivard eyed the approaches to mashiz with suspicion sharbarazs troops had come to grief there once before and the army the rightful king of kings commanded now was smaller than the one he had led the previous summer one more victory though would redeem usurpation and defeat and exile the makuraners who had suffered so much for sharbarazs cause were grimly determined to achieve that victory the videssians who had accompanied them and made victory possible had no such personal stake in the war abivard wondered how they could fight so well without that kind of stake he asked the younger maniakes with whom he had become more and more friendly after the battle in the land of the thousand cities the videssian commanders son rolled his eyes from what my father says youve met likinios avtokrator how would you like to go home and explain to him that you hadnt done quite all you could at first the prospect didnt seem too daunting likinios hadnt struck abivard as a man who flew into a murderous rage without warning as some memorable kings of kings of makuran had been in the habit of doing then he thought of the videssian emperors coldly calculating mind likinios wouldnt kill you because he was angry he would quietly order you slain because he judged you deserved it but you would end up just as dead either way i take your point he told the younger maniakes the videssian rulers style might be coldblooded and alien to the makuraner way of doing things but it had its own kind of effectiveness sharbarazs force advanced through the wreckage of the failed campaign of the year before skeletons of horses and mules some with mummified skin still clinging here and there the burnedout remains of overturned supply wagons and unburied human bones as well the rightful king of kings surveyed the near ruin of his hopes with an expression thoroughly grim not this time he declared not this time but taking the capital of the realm would not be easy where before smerdis men had built a temporary barricade across most of the one wide way into mashiz now permanent fortifications protected the city from attack getting past them looked like a formidable undertaking dont worry about it the elder maniakes said when abivard did just that well manage never you fear promises even from one who had shown he delivered on them left abivard cold when the videssian engineers began taking wood and ropes and specialized parts of bronze and iron from their wagons and assembling them into large complicated contraptions however he felt oddly reassured what they did with such things wasnt magic in any true sense of the word but it struck him as every bit as marvelous as a lot of the things sorcerers achieved theyre very good sharbaraz agreed when he said that aloud i think the ones who went north over the degird with my father could have matched them though but most of my fathers engineers are dead with the rest of his army and i dont think smerdis has many of those who are left alive working for him either were things different the lack could hurt makuran badly well have to train up a new team of such folk as soon as may be but for now having engineers when our foes dont works for us the timbers the videssians had used to make the flooring for their pontoon bridges and to corduroy roads through the muck left by flooded canals also proved to be the right size for constructing the frames of the engines they were erecting at first abivard thought that an amazing coincidence then he realized it wasnt a coincidence at all the sophisticated planning inherent in that deeply impressed him the engines went up at the front and on the right of the northern flankthe one on which smerdis men had gained success the summer beforewell out of range of archers sheltered by the works the usurper had thrown up sharbaraz asked will they be enough to let us pass by the fortress without losing so many men as to ruin us provided we beat the men they have outside the walls the engines will keep those within too busy to do much to us the elder maniakes replied abivard said what about men issuing forth from one of the narrow ways into mashiz that flank attack ruined us last year and we dont have the men to plug all those routes not if we want to do real fighting too the trick of the trade is getting what you want with as little fightingespecially the messy expensive handtohand you meanas you can the videssian general said he pointed over to the bank of dartthrowers going up on the northern flank skotos hold my soul in the ice forever if those dont make any charging lancer ever born the most thoughtful man you know may it be so sharbaraz said my men are eager for the attack when will all this hammering and spiking be done well be through by evening the elder maniakes replied smerdis men could have given us a deal of grief if theyd come sneaking around trying to wreck the engines or burn em down but they didnt maybe they didnt think of it or maybe they just didnt think itd work he shook his head to show his opinion of that you always try every once in a while you end up surprising yourself with what you can do i agree sharbaraz said if i didnt i never would have fled into videssos last year if roshnani hadnt thought of it youd never have fled into videssos abivard thought that brought a surge of pride in his wife it also brought the realization that denak had been right all along womens counsel could be as valuable on campaign as back in the womens quarters of the stronghold abivard wondered if sharbaraz had figured that out yet he didnt get long to contemplate the notion the elder maniakes said true enough your majesty but were on the point of bringing you back home now dawn brought the promise of a day to steam a man in armor abivard was sweating even before he donned the leatherlined shirt of mail and splints the mail skirt and the trousers of iron rings by the time he had affixed his ringmail veil and aventail and settled his helmet on his head he felt ready to go into the oven and come forth as cooked meat perhaps in spite of everything smerdis still had spies in sharbarazs camp or perhaps his officers were just good at piecing together what they saw from the works he had built in front of mashiz in any case his soldiers came forth from their camps behind those works and filled the gaps between their walls and the nearly impassable badlands to either side no getting into mashiz was not going to be the triumphal parade abivard and sharbaraz had imagined when they set out from vek rud stronghold the elder maniakes took charge of proceedings at the outset collaring abivard he said i want you and your best men in front of the siege engines to protect them what abivard said indignantly youd ask me and our best lancers to forgo the charge if the videssian general noticed his ire he ignored it thats just what id ask for the beginning of the fight anyhow he answered if were to win this battle thats what we need to do youll get enough fighting to satisfy the most picky honor later on i promise you he spoke as if honor were something worth only a couple of coppers you make war like a merchant and your son is twice the man youll ever be abivard thought but he could not insult an ally by saying such things to his face if he took the question to sharbaraz he shook his head he couldnt do that if he did the elder maniakes would lose prestige or else he would lose some himself either way the alliance would suffer that left him only one choice very well eminent sir he said icily i shall rely on your promise the elder maniakes paid no more attention to ice than he had to indignation good good he said as if he had taken abivards compliance for granted now do get moving if youd be so kind we cant put on our little show until you do still fuming abivard rounded up zals regiment of lancers zal and many of his riders grumbled when abivard told them they werent going to sweep gloriously down on the enemy he said youll do real fighting later in the day by the god i swear it he had to hope he wasnt giving them a false oath grumbling still the lancers took their places in front of the siege engines the videssians had built made with muddy timbers the engines looked like frameworks for houses abandoned after a flood the engineers loaded heavy stones into some and large stoppered jars with greasy rags sticking out of the stoppers into others abivard twisted in the saddle so he could watch the videssians touch torches to those greasy rags at the command of their captains the engineers discharged the creations the engines jumped and kicked as if they were wild asses like those that had given sharbarazs followers such a fright the autumn before the stones and jars described graceful arcs through the air as their captains cursed them to ever greater efforts the videssians turned windlasses to rewind the engines ropes and ready them to shoot again abivard paid scant heed to that he watched the stones smash into smerdis works some fell short some crashed against the wall some flew over it to land within he wouldnt have wanted to be under one of those stones when it came down any more than he would have cared to be a cockroach stepped on by a lancers armored boot the jars trailed smoke as they flew even from a couple of furlongs even through the shouts of smerdis soldiers inside their fortress he heard pottery smashing columns of black greasy smoke started rising from within the fortifications abivard turned in the saddle again any of you speak my language he asked the engineers behind him when one of them nodded he went on whats in that stuff youre flinging there the videssian grunted rock oil sir and sulfur he said in fair makuraner and some other things i dont want to tell you what they is burns good dont it yes abivard said one of the pillars of smoke was growing rapidly he guessed the inflammable liquid had splattered over wood or canvas the engines bucked again this time in a more ragged salvo ragged or not though it sent another round of stones and jars flying against the fortress by the god zal said id not like to have to go out in that kind of rain his gaze sharpened and if that kind of rain keeps falling on the fortress for very long the folk there wont be worth much theyll be too squashed or toasted to do anything to speak of in the way of fighting thats the idea abivard said also suddenly figuring out why the elder maniakes had said defending the engines would be a crucial role to play sooner or later smerdis generals would realize they had to stop the videssians from rendering their fort useless they couldnt do it with archers the engines were out of range of any bowman they would have to charge down on them instead sure enough the charge came but not from the warriors gathered directly in front of mashiz instead smerdis generals loosed a flanking force of the sort that had brought sharbaraz such grief in his last attack on the capital shouting smerdis name the horsemen thundered down out of the narrow way to the north as they had the year before they got a different reception from the one they had had then though the engines on the armys right flank went into action some of them threw stones that smashed men and horses alike no armor could stop the yardlong darts others shot they pinned soldiers to their mounts and sent them crashing to the ground to foul the troops behind them smerdis men were brave enough they kept coming in spite of the toll the engines took videssian horsemen rode out to keep them away from those engines and from the main body of sharbarazs force that was the sideshow the distraction the chief action remained at the front the videssian engines there kept on pounding the fortress smerdis had erected its wall which could have stood forever against mere lancers began to look like a man with bad teeth as it got knocked to pieces behind the wall flames leapt high smoke rose higher it made abivard cough and must have been twenty a hundred times worse for smerdis soldiers in the fort those lucky enough not to have been cooked the videssian captain of engineers shouted more orders in his own language his men swung the engines slightly off to one side then they started shooting again this time at smerdis lancers gathered by the fortress zal grinned a wicked carnivorous grin what a nasty choice that leaves them he said withdraw out of range and open the way for us or come out and fight and open it anyhow if they lose horns rang out in smerdis battered army lanceheads glittered in the sun as riders couched their weapons here they come abivard said smerdis might have been a treacherous usurper but the troops who had stuck by him had courage enough and to spare abivard swung down his own lance till it pointed straight at the onrushing horsemen sharbaraz he cried and booted his horse in its armored sides to get it going it sprang forward seemingly glad to run zal echoed his war cry so did the rest of the soldiers they had waited far too long to suit them now they would have the straightup fight they had craved someone screeching smerdis spurred straight for abivard above the fellows chainmail veil he caught a brief glimpse of hard intent eyes his foe was as glad to be fighting at last as he was smerdis men hadnt just had to wait they had also watched their comrades in the fortress bombarded and then taken a bombardment themselves by the way he sat his horse the fellow boring in on abivard knew exactly what he was doing instead of aiming for the larger target of abivards torso at the last moment he flicked the point of his lance up at his face fear turned the inside of abivards mouth dry and rough he barely turned the stroke with his shield his own went wide he didnt care he was just glad to be alive to fight someone else who wouldnt unfurl quite so many lethal tricks as cavalry battles have a way of doing once the initial impetus of the charge is lost this one turned into a melee with men milling about and cursing at the top of their lungs when they werent shouting their chosen sovereigns name to keep their friends from trying to kill them they thrust with lances and slashed with swords their horses many of them stallions joined in the fight with bared teeth and flailing hooves that could dash the brains out of a man on the ground somehow one of smerdis men had got turned around so he faced back toward the burning fortress abivard thought him an ally till he yelled the usurpers name then he speared the fellow in the back thrusting with all his strength to force the lance point through the warriors armor the fellow screamed and threw his arms wide his sword went spinning through the air the soldier screamed again he crumpled blood pouring from a hole somewhere between his left kidney and his spine he hadnt known abivard was there till the lance went into him abivard felt more like a murderer than a warrior until someone tried to blindside him after that he bore in mind that in battle there was precious little difference between the two little by little sharbarazs men forced their foes back toward the fortress videssian horsemen and lightarmed makuraner cavalry more nimble than either sides lancers tried to nip in behind smerdis horse and cut them off clearing the way for sharbarazs lancers to burst through and storm for mashiz a few archers up on the battered walls of the fortress shot at them hundreds would have been up there but for the pounding the siege engines had given the place but many now were dead many more hurt and others fighting the fires the pots of oil had started onward that voice some yards ahead of him made abivard jerk his head up sure enough there was sharbaraz laying about him with his sword and spurring his horse on toward the gap that led to mashiz abivard couldnt imagine how the rightful king of kings had pushed so far forward in the fighting but sharbaraz would have been a dangerous warrior no matter what his station the only trouble was that if he fell now everyone elses exertions would be for nothing onward abivard cried and pointed to his sovereign now he did not call out sharbarazs name for fear of drawing the enemys notice to the rightful king of kings he pointed to him though and waved his arm to urge on his own followers not all of them understood his gestures but enough did to give sharbaraz a respectable force of protectors in a few minutes but sharbaraz did not want protectorshe seemed to want to be the first man into mashiz he plunged into the press once more his ferocity made those of smerdis men who were not in deadly earnest draw back from him his own men pushed forward to fill the gap and to guard him from the foes who remained full of fight a tiny lull in the battle gave abivard a moment to look around at more than swords length from him he realized with surprise and sudden and growing triumph that smerdis fortress was no longer in front of him and the rest of the leaders of sharbarazs forcesinstead it lay to their right sharbaraz had lost this fight the summer before but he was winning it now come on abivard yelled waving again one more push and we have them once we get past the walls here the way opens out again and drop me into the void if smerdis lancers can hold us out of mashiz then smerdis soldiers saw that as clearly as he did they rallied fighting desperately but sharbarazs men were desperate too knowing what another defeat in front of the capital would mean and their videssian allies even without personal stake in the battle fought as bravely as anyone they plied smerdis men with arrows and pressed the fight at close quarters with sabers and spears sharbaraz had worried about betrayal but the men from the east stayed not only loyal but ferocious the counterattack from smerdis lancers faltered yard by yard they began giving ground once more then all at once the way the fortifications had narrowed grew wide again to mashiz shouted sharbaraz still at the van not only the capital of makuran loomed ahead closer and perhaps more tempting were the tents that marked the encampment of smerdis men ill castrate anybody who thinks of loot before victory abivard said first we win then we plunder as far as he was concerned the prospect of entering mashiz was worth more than any booty he could pull from the camp other poorer men though were liable to think of silver before victory smerdis army the last army that could hold sharbaraz out of his capital began to break up here and there knots of determined men still fought on although they had to know victory was hopeless but others fled some back toward mashiz others over the badlands hoping their foes would be too busy to pursue them and still others as they had between the tib and the tutub threw away their weapons and gave up the fight abivard shouted for some videssians to take charge of the prisoners thats well done sharbaraz said recognizing his voice thank you majesty he answered my thought was that they wont be as hot for revenge as our men he rode closer to the rightful king of kings before quietly adding and the fewer of them who go into mashiz with our men the better aye thats just right sharbaraz agreed theyve been all we could ask for as alliesmore than i looked for them to be the god knows but mashiz is ours we can reclaim it on our own bitterness crossed his face for a moment the videssians have sacked mashiz a couple of times while weve never made our way into videssos the city what i wouldnt give to be the king of kings who changed that oh indeed abivard said quietly still not tomorrow though no sharbaraz nodded at that but im willing to bet videssos will give us the chance before too many years go by however well we work with father and son of the maniakes clan as you say first things first he booted his horse in the ribs wanting to lead his army into mashiz the capital lay less than a quarter of a farsanga quarter hours rideto the west abivard kicked his own mount up to a fast trot to keep pace with his sovereign will we have more fighting to do inside the city he asked i hope not sharbaraz said with any sort of luck his army will have gone to pieces but the palace is a formidable place if he has men willing to fight for him he could hold out a long time there the videssians and their siege engines abivard began sharbaraz shook his head no by the god he said harshly if they pound the usurpers men or the works he threw up against me well and good but the palace doesnt belong to smerdisits mine just as mashiz is ours i dont want it wrecked if i can find any way around that i want to live in it after i take mashiz as i did before smerdis stole the throne very well majesty abivard said humbled to him the palace was just another military target to sharbaraz it was home on they rode the closer they got the bigger mashiz looked to abivard it dwarfed serrhes which was the only city into which he had ever gone the towns of the land of the thousand cities might well have been as crowded but they werent large not with each one sitting atop a mound made from generations of its own rubble mashiz sprawled over the foothills of the dilbat mountains at the eastern edge of the city was a marketplace big enough all by itself to swallow serrhes now it boiled like an anthill knocked down by a small boy all the merchants who had never imagined sharbarazs troopers could enter the capitaland there seemed to be quite a few of themnow were trying to hide their goods and often themselves too too late for that sharbaraz said pointing ahead i wonder how big an indemnity to set on them for doing business as usual under my thief of a cousin his laugh held a predatory note theyre wondering the same thing too we can worry about that later though surely majesty abivard said first we need to take the palace and lay hold of smerdis pimp of pimps aye sharbaraz said predatory still he knew the way through mashizs maze of streets though the palace was an imposing structure of gray stone other lesser buildings kept blocking it from view so abivard might have taken hours to find his way to it down streets that twisted back on themselves like snakes as if in a deliberate effort to keep newcomers from going anywhere on them the palace had an outwall formidable enough to make abivard think once more of having to batter it down but no soldiers paced upon it or shouted defiance down at the rightful king of kings all the gates their timbers shod in iron looked formidable but they all stood open hes yielded sharbaraz said in tones of mixed wonder and suspicion he urged his horse across the open area in front of the wall abivard went ahead with him so did the soldiers who had accompanied them through the city abivard was about halfway across the open area when everything went black it did not feel as if he had been stricken blind rather nightmoonless starless lightlessseemed to have fallen on mashiz his horse snorted and stopped dead in an odd way that reassured him if the animal was dumbfounded too the trouble did not lie inside his own eyes majesty he called to sharbaraz a few feet away abivard the rightful king of kings replied is that you i can hear your voice but i cant see you i cant see anything abivard said can you now that you mention it no sharbaraz raised his voice to call to his soldiers can anyone see anything several people said no several others were shouting things that werent answers but that also meant no abivard stared through the darkness that filled his eyes seeking without success to find light he also stared with his ears trying to have them serve for the sense that had failed him with them he had better luck shouts and screams came not only from near but also from as far as he could hear the whole citys gone black he exclaimed youre right i think sharbaraz said a few moments later as if he had first paused to listen and to weigh what he was hearing smerdis must have made the court magicians cast this gloom down upon us for his own purposes battle magic abivard began but then stoppedit wasnt battle magic not really for it seemed to have fallen on all of mashizs inhabitantseven on the animalsand not just on combatants in battle magic rarely bit on a man his passions were too likely to be inflamed for it to be effective now though sharbarazs soldiers victory already in their hands had eased away from the peak of lifeordeath excitement and so i pray the gloom does extend over the whole of mashiz sharbaraz said if smerdis men can see while our eyes stay swaddled in darkness abivard admired him for laughing but he did not sound amused in that case smerdis pimp of pimps will enjoy a longer reign than id thought there was a thought to put fear in a man abivard wondered what he would dowhat he could doif horns suddenly blared and horses clattered across the cobbles at him swing his sword wildly in all directions until a lance he never saw skewered him better to yank off his helm and draw that sword across his own throat that at least would be quick but no horns belled out a blast of triumph all he heard around him was chaos slowly the fear of sudden attack faded but fear did not fleeit merely changed its shape smiths at their forges tavernkeepers with torches to light up their taprooms cooks at hearths and braziers how long before one of them started a fire impossible to fight if that happened he didnt know what he could do about it save to bake like a round of pocket bread in the oven you couldnt flee fire any more than foe not if you couldnt see which way to run what do we do sharbaraz asked by his voice thoughts like abivards had been running through his mind majesty i dont know abivard answered what can we do all i can think of is to stay as calm as we can and hope the light returns believe me brotherinlaw of mine i have no better ideas sharbaraz raised his voice called out his name and abivards suggestion and added pass my words on to those too far away to hear them straight from my lips say also that our sorcerers will soon overcome the darkness smerdis pimp of pimps has raised against us in a muttered aside to abivard he said theyd better aye abivard said i wonder how far out from the palaceor out from mashizthis blackness reaches as soon as he spoke the words he wished he hadnt they made him imagine not just the magicians groping in darkness but the whole world so afflicted from the noise wrenched out of sharbaraz the rightful king of kingsthe veritable king of kings if light ever returneddidnt care to think about that either after a moment he found words im going to ride forward very slowly until i fetch up against the wall then ill know exactly where i amand ill have something at my back im with you majesty abivard said at once having something at his back suddenly seemed precious as emeralds foes might still come at him then but from only one direction sharbarazs horse clipclopped across the cobbles one cautious step after another abivard didnt know howor ifhis own mount would respond when he urged it ahead but it obeyed as if relieved to find that the human atop it knew what he was doing after all abivard hoped the animal wasnt paying him too great a compliment he heard a faint thump from ahead followed a moment later by an indignant snort ahive found the wall sharbaraz said found it the hard way unless im wrong abivard said and sharbaraz did not tell him he was he eased back on the reins slowing his horse even more in an effort to keep from imitating his sovereign he didnt succeed though his horse fetched up against the wall before he knew it was there in the absence of eyes the other senses hadnt given either him or the animal warning enough to stop in time the horse let out the same sort of irritated snort sharbarazs beast had used it turned its body till it was parallel to the wall in the process scraping abivards leg against the stones it snorted again this time in satisfaction as if assured it had taken its revenge for his part he was glad of the armor he wore is that you brotherinlaw of mine sharbaraz asked yes majesty abivard said i wonder how long well have to wait till the light returns what he really wondered but would not say was whether the light would ever return when he got thirsty and hungry how would he find his way out of mashiz if he couldnt see where he was going those are all fascinating questions sharbaraz said when he posed them aloud im sure theyre occurring to other people about now too i wish i could truthfully say i had so little concern that theyd never occurred to me but i cant he sighed i wish i had answers for them too time stretched since abivard could see neither sun nor moon nor stars he couldnt tell how much of it was passing to give him some sense of duration he sang and hummed and hummed and sang that helped but not enough his ears told him other men were doing the same and doubtless for the same reason eventually he had to make water when he dismounted he was careful to hold onto the horses reins for fear of getting turned around and never finding the animal again if he let go of them that meant he had to take down his armored breeches little better than onehanded and worse pull them up again the same way amazing what you can do when you try he remarked to the blackness around him out of the blackness sharbaraz answered so it must be im going to have to try to imitate you before too long if i manage to lose myself call my name and ill come to the sound of your voice as you say majesty if id dropped the reins there i would have asked the same of you i wonder what happened to smerdis men sharbaraz said its as if the god scooped us all into the void abivard drew in a sharp frightened breath at that the comparison was only too aptabivard wondered if it wasnt literal truth rather than comparison why the god should choose to do such a thing at a moment when righteousness was about to triumph he could not imaginebut the god did not have to justify himself to a mere mortal either through the confused and often panicstricken hubbub through the ragged snatches of song that calmer men used to keep themselves enspirited came a more purposeful chant sung by many men at once at first abivard just noted the strong calm music of it which lifted his own spirit then he realized it was not in his own tongue but in videssian the chanters came closer as they approached he made out more and more words he had heard the hymn before back in serrhes it was a song of praise to phos the videssian god of goodand abivard remembered of light whether he believed in phos or not light was what he and all of mashiz needed most at the moment his ears said the videssians were entering the square around the palace their joyous song rang out glorifying not only their god but also the sun phos chiefest symbol marked by the golden domes atop the spires of their temples and by the clothofgold circles videssian priests wore on the breasts of their blue robes just above their hearts then he saw the videssian priests for a moment they were all he did see striding through the blackness all around them as if unaware of its existence after that moment his sight cleared altogether and he saw the whole square when it blurred in his sight alarm ran through him but he did not need long to realize tears of relief accounted for that sharbaraz gave the videssians one of their own salutes his right fist over his heart my friends i am very glad to see you he said in videssian then dropped into his own language to add and you may take that however you wish one of the videssian priests bowed in return the lateafternoon sun gleamed from his shaven pate as if it were one of the gilded domes that topped his faiths temples seeing how close to the mountain peaks the sun had slid gave abivard an idea of how long he had been without sightquite a while longer than he had thought in fair makuraner the priest said your majesty we are sorry we did not come sooner to your aid this was a strong magic and needed all our strength to overcome also you makuraners have a way of working wizardry different from ours so we had trouble devising counterspells to deal with what had been done however you did what you did im glad you did it sharbaraz said now we can enter the palace and cast down smerdis once for all happy to be of service your majesty the priest said and bowed again with light restored servitors began straggling out of the palace compound some of them recognized sharbaraz they went to their bellies eating dirt before the king of kings now you come into your own majesty abivard said softly not quite yet sharbaraz said not until the usurper is in my hands but none of the palace functionaries for all their loud protestations of loyalty to sharbaraz admitted to knowing where smerdis was sharbaraz sent soldiers through the palace he sent eunuchs into the womens quarters where soldiers could not go no one found a trace of his elderly cousin before long though some of the soldiers brought him three men whom he recognized ah the royal wizards he said while the videssians and his own men bristled i take it you worthies are to blame for the recent events abivard admired his sangfroid the wizards knocked their heads on the cobblestones majesty forgive one of them wailed your rival compelled us to do his bidding holding our families hostage to ensure that we did as he demanded forgive he repeated and the other two echoed him perhaps i shall then again perhaps i shant sharbaraz said tell me more khuranzimtell me the purpose of a magic that darkened everyones sight for instance why to allow smerdis to escape unseen of course answered the wizard who had spoken beforepresumably khuranzim over him the spell held no power he tried to make us extend that over his soldiers as well but we told him truthfully that such was impossible attempt to employ this cantrip as battle magic and you throw it away for the spleen of men assailed by unseen foes would be so roused that in moments it would hold no sway over them beside sharbaraz abivard let out a long sigh of relief the nightmare he and the king of kings had feared could not have come truealthough no small number of men would have died before the rest awoke from that nightmare he thought of something else wizard you say smerdis had you cast this large and complicated spell just to let him get away yes uh lord khuranzim answered cautiously sharbaraz he knew he had never seen abivard before and could not gauge how high in the affection of the king of kings he stood high enough to merit a soft answer at any rate abivard said by the god why didnt he simply have you change his face so he could sneak out of mashiz with no one the wiser lord your words make it evident you are a man of sense khuranzim said bowing his lip curled the same cannot be said of smerdis to him how large and showy a magic was counted for more than its mere effectiveness when i suggested to him the very plan you named he said he would cut the throat of my eldest son give my principal wife over to his guardsmen i am a potent mage lord given time to prepare my charms edged iron can be too quick for me can you track him now to learn where hes fled sharbaraz asked possibly your majesty khuranzim said cautious again but some of the shielding spells laid on a king of kings do not require frequent renewal so detecting him by such means will not be easy sharbaraz made a sour face but then his expression lightened never mind search your best but whether you find him or not my men will his voice flamed with anticipation lord abivard one of the serving women who had accompanied roshnani and denak from vek rud stronghold waited for abivard to notice her then went on the lady your sister would speak with you if you have the time denak of course ill see her he said though he suspected he sounded surprised she had sometimes come to talk with him when he visited roshnani but he couldnt remember the last time she had asked him to come herself lead me to her the wagon that had taken his sister and his principal wife through so much remained with the rest of the baggage train just outside of mashiz the serving woman went up and into it ahead of abivard after a moment she beckoned at the entrance for him to follow denak waited in her little cubicle which was on the other side of the wagon from roshnanis and fitted out in mirror image to hers which made it familiar and disconcerting at the same time for abivard after he hugged his sister he sat down crosslegged on the carpet and said what is it how can i help you you probably cant denak answered bleakly she sat down too leaning against the outer wall of the wagon with her hands on her belly im with child and im going into the royal womens quarters tomorrow youre going to have a baby with luck an heir to the throne thats wonderful abivard exclaimed then he really heard the rest of what denak had said where else would you stay but in the womens quarters staying there is one thing denak said whether i ever come out again before they bury me is something else again her eyes flicked back and forth like those of an animal caught in a trap i might have borne it before when i knew no better but ive been freewell freerawhile now and the thought of being caged up again i dont think i can why should you be trapped i mean abivard said the king of kings let you travel with him we all dined in serrhes together hes been good about keeping the promise he made back at our stronghold not as good as he might have been but on the whole yes youre right all the same denak looked at abivard as if he had proved himself a blockhead as if teaching a small boy his letters she went on i am going into the womens quarters tomorrow my husband will ride out in pursuit of smerdis the same day until he gets back do you think i shall be able to poke so much as the tip of my nose outside the womens quarters oh abivard said and tasted the emptiness of the word he did his best to look on the bright side hes already sent riders after the usurper the god willing hell be back in mashiz very soon the god willing yes but what if hes gone for months even if im resigned to spending some time in the womens quarters here will he remember his promisewill he honor it when he gets back after hes gone for a long time i dont know abivard admitted i will say though that he strikes me as careful in matters that touch his honor from the little i saw of peroz king of kings his father was the same way may you be right denak said the other thing i worry about is what will become of me in the womens quarters ill be a white crow there not just because im the daughter of a frontier dihqan and not a princess from one of the seven clans but also because ive been out in the world and seen things and done things what will they think of me if they have any sense theyll be jealous abivard said when sharbaraz does come back why dont you try to get him to give his other wives the same privileges hes granted you if that works how can they help but be grateful to you knowing what goes on in womens quarters i suspect theyd find a way denak said but she leaned forward and kissed abivard on the cheek just above the line where his beard stopped it is a good idea ill try it the worst he can tell me is no she seemed to change the subject youll be riding with sharbaraz wont you yes of course abivard answered denak sighed then lowered her voice and youll be taking roshnani with you naturallyeven though smerdis fled south away from vek rud domain thats still the way around the mountains and back toward home she sighed again how i envy her those extra weeks of freedom it will be all right denak abivard summoned up courage of a kind different from what he had needed to face foes lance to lance on the field and said surely it will be better than what you would have known at nalgis crag domain even had sharbaraz never ended up there denak stared at him since she and sharbaraz had escaped from nalgis crag stronghold abivard had hardly ever mentioned it that he did so now deliberately made her stop and think aye it will be better than that she said but her voice was grudging better though is not good i didnt say it was abivard answered at once but nothing happens all at once no matter how we wish it would and if you work to make better better still your daughteror her daughtermay think her life is good maybe at first denak did not seem convinced but after a moment she slowly nodded the pursuit of smerdis went south as denak had said every day abivard expected the hardriding scouts at the head of sharbarazs pack to run his cousin to earth like an exhausted antelope every day though the hunt went on the dilbat mountains were dwindling into desert foothills soon if he so desired smerdis would be able to swing north and west i wonder what likinios would have done if hed fled to videssos abivard said as they encamped east of those foothills sharbaraz looked at him like a man staring at a cockroach cooked into his bowl of lentils now theres an interesting thought he said after a pause in which he seemed to discard several more pungent descriptions i dont suppose hed put him at the head of a new videssian armythat would be too raw more likely hed keep him in luxury at videssos the city for as long as he lived just to remind me id better behave myself unless i wanted trouble from the east thats what id do in his boots anyway abivard nodded thats about what i was thinking majesty now i want us to be able to do something to smerdis so do i sharbaraz said if hed yield himself up id be grateful enough that id strike off his head and have done i wouldnt even bother hauling him back to mashiz to see how ingenious the executioners could be fair enough abivard said then kicked at the dirt in frustration where has he gone to anyway drop me into the void if i know the king of kings answered when i set out on this chase i thought it would be over soon now he stamped his foot too abivard thought of what denak had said before he could speak though the king of kings went on im glad we brought the regiment of videssian engineers with us after all if hes managed to hide himself in a stronghold somewhere theyll help us winkle him out what with their baggage train they slow us down abivard said in oblique disagreement even the scouts cant get too far ahead of our main body for smerdis has scraped up enough followers to treat a small band roughly im not worried about that well run him to earth pretty soon come what may sharbaraz said hes an old man after all and he was a mintmaster not a horseman hell wilt in the saddle like greens in the stewpot he stood tall and proud and young and confident every inch a proper king of kings of makuran seeing that kingly arroganceall of it deserved no doubtabivard had to remind himself that sharbaraz had underestimated smerdis before i dont believe it sharbaraz said in disgust i dont believe it abivard said in sympathy i dont believe it the commander of the videssian engineers said in awe ypsilantes was a lean dour sunbaked man who would have been on the quiet side even for a makuraner for a videssian he was astonishingly taciturn but when he stared up and up at the stronghold atop nalgis crag he was as impressed as any makuraner would have been sharbaraz treated him with respect perhaps more than he might have given to a makuraner in the same position he said having seen what your men accomplished between the tutub and the tib i refuse to believe anything beyond your powers surely youll devise some ingenious way to force smerdis to come down damn me to the ice if i know what your majesty ypsilantes answered his quiet had nothing to do with the way he spoke makuraner he was quite fluent he was simply one of those uncommon people who say only whats necessary and not a word more the king of kings scowled starving nalgis crag stronghold into submission would take years ypsilantes just nodded which did nothing to improve sharbarazs temper he clenched his fists abivard knew he would have liked nothing better than to see nalgis crag stronghold torn down stone by stone but getting up to the stronghold let alone tearing it down would be the next thing to impossible abivard said majesty it strikes me that the stronghold does have one weakness after all ypsilantes grunted and shook his head he got more meaning into that than some men would have with an oration sharbaraz freighted his voice with sarcasm enlighten us o sage of the military art the distinguished engineer sees a perfect fortification i must confess i see a perfect fortification how gratifying then that youve found a weakness which evades us and that weakness is pradtak son of artapan abivard answered at once the fortress itself could be all of adamant not just stone and iron with pradtak leading it it might yet fall youve had some dealing with him majesty am i right or am i wrong sharbaraz did not reply at once his eyes got a faraway look that had nothing to do with staring up and up to the fortress that crowned nalgis crag till that moment he had been considering only the fortress not the men inside it he made small clicking noises as he thought at last he said brotherinlaw of mine it could be so knowing the man you fight is better than knowing the fort he fights from ypsilantes saida very videssian notion when you got down to it he turned to abivard what of this pradtak eminent sir now abivard hesitated how to characterize his former brotherinlaw hes weak he said after a moment hes not a coward nothing like that but he has a crust of bluster if you know what i mean crack that and hes soft underneath like an oyster ypsilantes said abivard knew the word though he had never tasted one he nodded the engineer rubbed his chin how to crack the shell then tell him what will happen to him when nalgis crag stronghold does fall at lastand fall it shall sharbaraz said anticipation in his voice not only do i owe him for giving smerdis refuge but also for the delightful accommodations he granted me year before last put enough fear in him and hell do what we want he must know what the executioners back in mashiz can make him suffer before they finally let him die but abivard shook his head forgive me majesty but i dont think you can put him in fear for himself not that way even if we do take nalgis crag stronghold he was too polite to contradict the king of kings directly but he still doubted it could be done how do you propose to take pradtak himself a step off the wall and hes cheated the executioners he shivered a little from the walls of nalgis crag stronghold it was a long way down what would you think about the wind whipping at you till the moment of blackness sharbaraz glared at him but ypsilantes said good sense in a way that would have made sharbaraz seem petulant even to himself if he disagreed what then the king of kings snapped if we cant even reach pradtak how are we to put him in fear enough to make him want to hand over smerdis he meant it as a rhetorical question and it was certainly one for which abivard had no good answer clenching his fists sharbaraz went on outrageous that a single dihqan should be able to defy the entire realm had abivard not defied the entire realm sharbaraz rather than smerdis would have been mured up in nalgis crag stronghold he thought it impolitic to mention that but the complaint from the king of kings sparked a thought in him majesty youre right all the realm is yours while pradtak holds but the one domain here if you were to begin to wreck it most methodically leaving him with the prospect of holding nothing but the stronghold once you were through with an engineers practicality ypsilantes said he is up high he can see a long long way every village that burned sharbaraz didnt answer right away abivard had learned better than to push him too hard especially now that he was coming into full awareness of his power he waited to hear what the king of kings would say well try it sharbaraz declared at last first though we shall warn pradtak of exactly what we intend if he chooses to sacrifice his domain for smerdis pimp of pimps let the blame rest on his head as you say majesty abivard nodded the god willing hell yield to the threat alone and not make us carry it out he will if he cares a fig for his domain sharbaraz said and i know the perfect envoy from this force to put our terms to him too whos that majesty after getting his idea abivard hadnt taken it any farther sharbaraz clicked his tongue between his teeth as if to say abivard had disappointed him he stabbed out a forefinger you abivard held the truce shield high as he rode the narrow winding track up toward nalgis crag stronghold he wished he had a surefooted mule or donkey under him rather than his horse prestige forbade it of course if his horse slipped and he fell he would die of prestige that was far from the most common cause of death in makuran but it was also far from unknown he felt very much alone if pradtak wanted to seize him too and hold him as a hostage to try to twist sharbarazs will he could abivard didnt think that would have any effect on the king of kings and didnt care to think about the effect it would have on him he had already passed several of the garrisons on the lower less steep parts of nalgis crag sharbarazs army could conceivably have driven them out of their positions though it would have hurt itself badly in the driving as for the barrier ahead and the men who stood guard beyond it a warrior scrambled over the stones what would you abivard flourished the shield of truce i come with a warning from sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase as to what will befall nalgis crag domain if the dihqan pradtak fails to yield up the rebel smerdis to him i am ordered to deliver this warning to pradtak personally you wait here the man said who are you that i may give your name to my lord the dihqan abivard son of godarz once his brotherinlaw abivard answered pradtaks man stiffened as if unexpectedly stung by a wasp abivard stiffened too he had dreaded that question pradtak was liable to have left orders that he be killed out of hand but evidently not the warrior said i shall take the dihqan your words wait rather jerkily he climbed back over the stones that could rain down on attackers and hurried toward the stronghold abivard dismounted fed his horse some dates and brushed down the animal he did his best to ignore the men watching him from behind the heaped stonesand the ones he had already passed the ones who could block him from returning to friends and safety it wasnt easy and grew harder as time crawled by he looked up the ever steeper slope toward the stronghold his patience was at last rewarded when he caught sight of two men riding slowly in his direction after a few minutes he knew one of them was the officer who had gone up to tell pradtak he would come then he recognized pradtak too his former brotherinlaw scrambled over the stony barrier between them and approached behind the barrier pradtaks men waited with drawn bows if abivard thought to try anything he would be pincushioned before he could since he didnt he bowed to pradtak and said the god give you good day youre moving very well im glad the ankle has healed as it should it doesnt trouble me much any more not so far as moving goes pradtak answered but when rain or bad weather is coming i always know it a day before anyone else in the stronghold he fixed abivard with a suspicious stare you didnt ride up here to talk about the state of my leg thats true abivard said i came up here to demand in the name of sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase who is my brotherinlaw through my sister denak whom you will no doubt recall the person of the usurper smerdis i dont give a moldy date for what sharbaraz demands pradtak said snapping his fingers in contempt hes nothing but a renunciate and smerdis the proper king of kings and i dont give a moldy date about you either the sooner you drop into the void the happier ill be have you forgotten its war to the knife between us only your truce shield and my generosity keep me from ordering you slain this instant he puffed out his chest obviously sure he had made abivard afraid having seen him bluster before though abivard was less than impressed he said sharbaraz king of kings will spare you even though you imprisoned him providing you yield up the usurper if you dont your domain will pay the price for itand so will you once he starves you out pradtak snapped his fingers again that for sharbaraz and his threats and you may tell him i said so if he proposes to take nalgis crag stronghold i wish him joy of the attempt but nalgis crag stronghold is not all of nalgis crag domain abivard answered he told pradtak what he and sharbaraz had worked out adding by the time were through with your lands a crow that flies across them will have to carry its own provisions i warn you heed what i say pradtaks face darkened with fury now abivard knew fear fear that pradtak would be enraged enough to forget the shield of truce and the generosity he had averred only moments before i shall not give smerdis up pradtak said thickly he has my oath of loyalty which i honor yet he lied as to the terms under which you swore it abivard said for sharbaraz king of kings did not give up the throne of his own free will thus the oath has no true hold on you you might as well be a videssian like the ones to whom sharbaraz sold his soul for a chance to steal the realm pradtak said i dont care what you claimi shall not surrender smerdis to you your domain will pay the price for your stubbornness and so will you when eventually you yield to the king of kings abivard warned think twice think three times on what you do today pradtak he didnt want to push his former brotherinlaw too far lest he push pradtak into a place from which he could not extricate himself thus he spoke as softly as he could within the limits sharbaraz had set him but it was not soft enough pradtak shouted go down to your master and tell him ill never wear his livery abivard could not resist a parting shot why should that worry you when you wore his seeming for a couple of days he wheeled his horse and rode down nalgis crag away from the curses pradtak hurled after him sharbaraz looked gloomy when abivard returned emptyhanded he said if that pompous fool thinks im bluffing ill have to show him how wrong he is i hate ithis subjects are my subjects toobut i will have smerdis from him come what may abivard rode with the party that fired the village at the base of nalgis crag the people there had been warned of what was coming most of them were already on the road carrying such belongings and treasures as they could when the soldiers came into their village a few stragglers still remained behind though one of them an old woman shook her fist at the jingling horsemen the god and the four curse you for harming us who never harmed you she cried her voice mushy because she had no teeth go on grandmother take yourself out of here abivard said his left hand twisted to turn aside the curse blame your lord for not giving sharbaraz king of kings the fugitive who is his by rights if you blame lord pradtak burn lord pradtak the old woman retorted but sharbarazs army could not do that not with the dihqan impregnable inside nalgis crag stronghold so pradtaks subjects would have to suffer in his stead still cursing and bemoaning her fate the woman shouldered a blanket wrapped around her few meager possessions and trudged after the rest of the villagers i dont envy these folk abivard said if pradtak holds to his purpose we may have to burn them out again and again one of the horsemen passed out torches another got a fire going in the center of the market square when flames crackled there abivard thrust the head of his torch into them then waved it in the air to bring it to full life he touched it to the thatched roof of a nearby house the dry straw caught almost at once flames ran toward the crown of the roof burning straw fell down into the building to ignite whatever was inside a couple of dogs sat in the square not far from the fire the trooper had set they howled disconsolately breaking off only to sneeze and snort now and again as the smoke grew thicker abivard watched the soldiers torch the village some of them went at it with real enjoyment ducking into houses to emerge with jars of wine or with trinkets for camp followers then burning with whoops of glee the places they had just looted others simply set a fire went on to another building and did it again in the end abivard couldnt see that it mattered much one way or the other the village burned coughing his eyes streaming from the smoke he rode with the rest of the incendiary party back to camp the black column of smoke that rose from the villages funeral pyre climbed higher than the summit of nalgis crag the wind whipped it and frayed it and eventually dissipated it but the smell of the burning must surely have reached the stronghold pradtak though made no move to surrender smerdis when morning came sharbaraz sent abivard out with another troop of horsemen to burn down the village next nearest to nalgis cragabout a farsang off to the north a shower of arrows greeted them when they arrived a couple of men and a horse were wounded forward abivard cried the troopers rode into town full of grim determination more arrows fell among them wounding another horse in this kind of fight horses were not much use armored men were once they knocked down a few doors and killed the defenders inside the fight went out of the rest of the people in the village abivard barely kept his soldiers from slaughtering them just the same they had a right to fight he insisted no one warned them thered be a massacre afterward if they did next time though he drove the villagers out of their homes with only the clothes on their backs and a chunk of pocket bread and a wine jar each after that the smoke rose into the air again a pillar even thicker and darker than the one that had gone up the day before the troopers went about their business with a singlemindedness they hadnt shown in the other village they wasted no time on horseplay here sharbaraz nodded when abivard told him what he had done that was just right brotherinlaw of mine tomorrow if we need to go out tomorrow well tell them they may leave with what they can carry if they offer no resistance otherwise well treat it as war in all ways he looked up toward nalgis crag stronghold with any luck at all pradtak will see hell have no domain left if he keeps the usurper much longer but a village to the south went up in smoke the next day the people there left sullenly but without fighting the king of kings lancers who went out in greater force the day after that villagers in a fourth hamlet had to be overcome in battleand were along with the houses vines and pistachio trees also burned sharbaraz had meant what he said pradtak might keep nalgis crag stronghold for a long time but nothing in the domain except for the stronghold would be worth having once the soldiers and their torches were done on the fifth day the village of gayy the one sharbaraz had known of and exploited during his escape from the stronghold was given over to the flames sighing he said whatever i learned about the town will have to be rewritten his incendiaries were about to ride out for their sixth day of devastation when a man bearing a shield of truce came down from nalgis crag and prostrated himself before him after the ritual eating of dirt the fellow said majesty may your years be many and your realm increase if lord pradtak surrenders to you the person of your cousin smerdis will you forgive him whatever transgressions he may in your mind have committed leave off destroying his domain and confirm not only his safety but his tenure as dihqan here i hate to give him so much sharbaraz said but when he glanced at abivard abivard nodded sharbaraz frowned irresolute but finally said very well for the sake of ending this civil war i will let the usurper be brought to me before noon today and all shall be as pradtak says the dihqans envoy rode back toward nalgis crag at a gallop sharbaraz turned back to abivard and said i may forgive but drop me into the void if i forget abivard took that to mean pradtak would be wise to stay up in nalgis crag stronghold the rest of his mortal days unless he wanted those days abruptly curtailed the thought slid out of his mind almost as soon as it formed overwhelmed by surging relief that the long struggle which had torn makuran apart soon would at last be over he was also consumed with curiosity to learnfinallywhat the man who had taken sharbarazs throne looked like long before the sun reached its high point in the sky three men rode down from nalgis crag two warriors leading a graybeard who had been tied onto a mule once smerdis was in sharbarazs hands the soldiers didnt wait around to learn what sort of reception they would get from the king of kings like pradtaks earlier spokesman they galloped back toward safety though smerdis was unkempt and wearing only a dirty caftan the family link among him peroz and sharbaraz was easy to see he did his best to hide the fear he had to feel well cousin what have you to say for yourself sharbaraz asked him only that i should have taken your head along with your throne smerdis answered his voice was almost as mushy as that of the old woman in the village he had lost a good many teeth a mistake i will not imitate sharbaraz said but you have more spirit than i credited to you ill just shorten you and have done smerdis nodded sharbarazs officers gathered round to witness the execution one of his men cut smerdis bonds and helped him off the mule he got down on all fours and stretched out his neck for the sword it bit his body convulsed briefly had he lived as well as he died he might have made a worthy king of kings its over sharbaraz said along with the wagon that carried roshnani the surviving horsemen who had come from vek rud domain and tanshar the fortuneteller abivard rode back toward his home with a company of troops from the army that had besieged nalgis crag stronghold call them my parting gift sharbaraz said as he took his leave you may run into plainsmen along the road to your domain thats so abivard clasped the hand of the king of kings the rest of sharbarazs army was breaking camp too some of the northwestern contingents to return to their home domains some to go south to mashiz with the king of kings and ypsilantes videssian engineers to fare back to their native land abivard went on majesty ill miss you more than i can say after so long sharbaraz snorted i named these men here a parting gift brotherinlaw of mine not a farewell gift you have to make sure your own house is in order i understand that but before too long ill want you at my side again you know what my plans are abivard glanced over toward the videssians none of them was in earshot even so he lowered his voice we owe them a debt majesty that was as close as he felt like coming to reproving the king of kings i know sharbaraz answered calmly a debt is exactly what it is as if id had to borrow ten thousand arkets from a moneylender ill pay it back as i can and once i have do you think such a stickler as likinios will give me no excuse to get back makurans own put that way no abivard said likinios was a very able ruler he had seen that but sharbaraz was right in trying to calculate everything beforehand the videssian avtokrator left scant room for anything outside his calculations and no man however wise was wise enough to foresee everything that was for the god alone sharbaraz clapped him on the back the god grant that alls well with your domain and your family thank you majesty abivard hesitated then said majesty if you see your way clear to giving my sister some freedom from the womens quarters it would mean a great deal to her i know that too sharbaraz said you need not worry there i owe denak far more than i owe likinios i shall attend to it he laughed i may even make it the fashion for men to be seen with their wives what a scandal that will be for the graybeards he sounded as if he relished the prospect majesty i thank you abivard said go on home tend to your businessand in a while it will be time to tend to mine sharbaraz said the last time abivard had traveled from nalgis crag stronghold back to vek rud domain he had made the trip as fast as he could without killing the horses he sharbaraz tanshar and denak were riding till he got back onto his own land he had feared pradtaks warriors were one ridge behind him riding hard to recapture the fugitive king of kings now he could make the journey at an easier pace not only did he no longer fear enemies at his back he had enough men with him to overawe almost any band of khamorth turning to tanshar who rode beside him he said the nomads missed their chance to take big chunks of the northwest and turn them into an extension of the pardrayan steppe so they did the fortuneteller said nodding they all joined together against us when peroz king of kings crossed the degird in arms but theyre clans not a nation if they started squabbling among themselves once their victory was won they wouldnt have had the chance to do as you said i dont know thats what happened mind you but it could have been abivard laughed odd to hear a fortuneteller say he doesnt know what happened youre supposed to know such things lord when as many years pile onto you as weigh my shoulders down youll find out that one of the biggest things you know is just how little you know tanshar answered oh if i was ordered and if i could get past the tribal shamans magic i might be able to learn why the khamorth didnt swarm over the degird as we feared but who cares about the why after the fact that they didnt is what matters mmm abivard chewed on that he found a hard core of sense there i see what youre saying but dont go parading your own ignorance you accomplished more on that campaign thanthan he stopped not sure how to go on without insulting tanshar which was the last thing he wanted to do more than youd expected from a village fortuneteller do you mean tanshar asked gently abivard felt his ears heat but had to nod smiling tanshar went on ive lived in the village under vek rud stronghold all my days and what came to me were villagesize concerns i do not complain mind i was as content as a man without a good wife can be there must be many men like me in all walks of life through the whole of makuran most of them stay in their villages their whole lives long and never have the chance to show what they might do on a larger stage thanks to you i had that chance and i took it the fortunetellers quiet words gave abivard a good deal to think about was what tanshar said true could any man if opportunity came his way do more than he had ever dreamed of if so how many common folk were wasting lives of potential excellence just in the round of making a daily living on farms and in villages throughout the realm if tanshar was right would it pay the king of kings to seek them out how would he find them without some crisis in which they could display their talents abivard didnt know the answers but thought the questions worth sending on to sharbaraz he also found another question to put to tanshar when darkness came on mashiz the videssian priests were the ones who raised it what happened to you and the rest of the makuraner wizards sharbaraz king of kings had with him what happened to us lord the fortunetellers laugh was full of selfdeprecation what happened shows the limits of what i said before for against that magic we were all helpless as children we had neither the training nor the skill to raise it till this past year i never heard anything good about videssos but i thank the god the videssians were there without them mashiz might be dark yet now theres a thoughta nasty one abivard said the idea of blundering through the streets trying to escape the spell of being essentially blind sent cold chills through him even though the possibility had evaporated weeks before the party rattled on toward vek rud domain high summer lay heavy on the land burning spring greenery yellowbrown and the ground itself gray without the fodder and the jars of water in the supply wagons abivard wouldnt have cared to make the trip through the desert at that season little spiral winds kicked up dust and danced across the flat baked ground abivard took them for granted some of the soldiers in the company sharbaraz had given him though claimed the little whirlwinds were the outward manifestation of mischievous demons one of the men shot an arrow through a whirlwind which promptly collapsed he turned in triumph to abivard you see lord hmm was all abivard said though he wondered if the fellow might not have been right the next day strong winds threw sand and grit at the travelers from sunup to sundown it wasnt one of the disastrous sandstorms that could change the whole look of the landscape and bury a caravan in blowing dust but it was quite bad enough when toward evening the wind eased at last abivard issued a stern decree no more shooting at whirlwinds he didnt know whether the archery could have had anything to do with the storm and he didnt care to repeat the experiment that evening when he went into the wagon to see roshnani he found her green around the gills morning sickness the serving woman said i wish lemons were in season sucking on one would help ease it given the choice between those two i think id sooner have morning sickness abivard said roshnani wanly shook her head you dont know what youre talking about she said since that was literally true he spread his hands and yielded the point she said at my fathers stronghold some of the women would be sick all the way through their time while others would have no trouble at all i seem to be in the middle some days im fine but others she made a horrible gagging noise today was one of those i hope tomorrow will be a good day for you abivard patted her hand just a few days more and well be home again at last from outside roshnanis cubicle the serving woman asked my lady would you care for some mutton broth and flatbread that should sit well in your stomach maybe later roshnani said gulping you should eat abivard said reprovingly i know i should she answered but if i ate anything now id just give it back and that wouldnt do me any good she hugged herself carefully my insides are sore enough as is very well abivard said since he knew next to nothing about how pregnancy workednot that a man could know much anyhowhe was willing to trust his wifes estimate of the state of her stomach from what he had seen of roshnani these past couple of years her estimates of most matters deserved trust she laughed a little he raised a questioning eyebrow she said forgive me but i still have trouble thinking of vek rud stronghold as home ive spent more time in this wagon than i did in your womens quarters and weve been gone for more than a year so it hardly seems real to me i can understand that abivard said ive seen more of the world since we set out on campaign than i ever imagined i would you roshnani exclaimed what of me i dont have quite the same fear denak did of being caged forever but staying in one place seeing only rooms and walls and always the same landscape out the windows will seem very strange she stopped there but sent abivard an anxious look he knew what it meant now that he was coming home in triumph would he forget the promise he had made to let her out of the womens quarters now and again he said dont worry youll be able to go round the stronghold and see things from all sides thank you she said quietly after so much travel even that will seem little enough but thank you abivard thought of the conversation hed had with tanshar if men in large numbers never got to do all they might because they stayed on farms or in villages and never met the wider world what of women confined to their own quarters from the onset of womanhood to death if his fellow dihqans didnt ostracize him for the scandalous favoritism he had shown roshnani he might quietly accomplish more for the realm simply by his example than by most things he had done during the civil war when he musingly said as much aloud roshnani cocked her head to one side and studied him for a few seconds as she had a way of doing well of course she said traveling with a large force and the supply wagons needed to keep it fed and watered meant a slow journey back to vek rud domain to compensate for that it gave abivard the luxury of posting van and rear guards as well as scouting parties out to either side of the track that ran through the wasteland he availed himself of that luxury had peroz king of kings done the same sharbaraz might still have been a prince back in mashiz and smerdis mintmaster there now the one was king of kings and the other no doubt would serve as an object lesson of execration to minstrels and chroniclers for generations to come a couple of days before abivard expected to enter his own territory once more a rider from the vanguard came pelting back toward the main body of the force which traveled with the wagons lord theres plainsmen and their flocks up ahead he said dont know how many of them and how many of their beasts but enough to stir up a deal of dust thats certain abivard ran a hand down the front of his caftan in the summer heat without expectation of a fight neither he nor his horse wore armor the same held true for his entire band no help for it now he thought he and his followers could quickly don helmets and grab shields at any rate that would be plenty to put them on a par with the khamorth before he started talking he spent a little while in thought though nearly two years had passed since the disastrous battle on the pardrayan steppe he could still hear his father as if godarz stood beside him your brains are smarter than your mouth son if you give them the chance to be when he gave his orders they came in crisp succession he sent riders galloping out to recall the scouting parties on either wing he sent another man back down the road they had just traveled to bring up the rear guard to protect the wagons meanwhile like him the soldiers of the main body were grabbing helms and targets and checking to make sure their bowstrings were sound and their quivers full when everyone had come in and prepared he waved his arm and shouted forward crying his name and that of sharbaraz his men rode forward but he kept a wide line of scouts out a couple of furlongs ahead of the main band he had no reason to expect the khamorth might have set a trap as far as he could tell this was but a chance encounter but he had no interest in repeating the tragedy of peroz on a smaller scale a man nearby pointed ahead abivard saw not only the cloud of dust the nomads and their animals kicked up but also the animals themselves sheep he clucked thoughtfully maybe sheep could find enough forage to get through summer in the badlands but he wouldnt have wanted to try it cattle would already have starved instead of giving him the fight for which he had nerved himself the nomads fled in wild disorder they numbered somewhere between a double handful and a score when they saw more than a hundred makuraners bearing down on them they did the only thing that might have saved their lives in their stirrups abivard would have acted the same way some of his men pursued the khamorth and knocked a couple of them out of the saddle with good archery the nomads shot back over their shoulders as they fled and scored one or two hits on troopers from the company sharbaraz had lent to abivard the khamorth steppe ponies were little and ugly but they could run after perhaps half a farsangs chase the makuraners gave up and went back to rejoin their comrades abivard set the men to work rounding up the sheep which had done their best to scatter in the confusion fresh mutton tonight he shouted which raised cheerseveryone was tired of smoked meat yogurt pocket bread and other travelers foods he added the sheep we dont butcher well bring home to my domain heres a fight against the nomads where we turn a profit that brought fresh cheers from the soldiers only after he had said it did he stop to think that he sounded more like a videssian than a proper makuraner noble too bad he thought winning fights was better than losing them no matter how you phrased it the khamorth had let their flock range wide over the desert floor so the sheep could take advantage of whatever dry grass and water they happened to find the nomads let the animals set their direction and they followed unlike them abivard was going somewhere in particular and bringing the sheep along if the forage happened to be bad alongside the track that led to his domain he preferred losing a few beasts to turning aside to let them fatten up when he and his followers approached the most southeasterly village in his domain the villagers saw the flock and began to flee thinking the sheep heralded the arrival of a band of plainsmen on discovering they were wrong they returned to their homes with glad cries greeting abivard as warmly as if he were king of kings himself news was slow trickling into the northwest of the realm the villagers had yet to hear that sharbaraz had vanquished smerdis the report sent them into fresh transports of delight although abivard had trouble seeing how it would change their lives much one way or the other by way of experiment he brought roshnani down from the wagon in which she had traveled so far and announced his hope that she was carrying the heir to the domain some of the people in the villagethe older ones mostly and a couple of welloff merchants who probably kept their own wives secluded in imitation of the nobilityseemed startled to see her out in public but most cheered that as one more bit of good news for the day emboldened by those cheers roshnani leaned over and kissed abivard on the cheek that startled him with its boldness but the raucous yells of approval it drew from the crowd declared the people werent shocked beaming roshnani said there you seeno one really cares if a nobles wife turns out to be a human being like any other most people dont seem to he admitted i must say i expected it to cause a bigger stir but i can tell you one person who will care very much my mother roshnanis face fell she had been away from the formidable presence of burzoe for more than a year and flourished like a flower transplanted from shady ground into bright sun after a moments pause to collect her thoughtsand perhaps to hold back something bitingshe said if living her life in the womens quarters suits her i would never be so rude as to try to make her do anything different why cant she extend me the same privilege because her way of life has been customary for so long she thinks the god ordained it abivard said only half joking but you have one weapon in the fight that i dont think shell be able to resist what roshnani suddenly giggled oh she interlaced her fingers and put both hands over the child growing as yet invisibly in her belly thats right abivard nodded not many mothers from all ive heard can resist the idea of becoming grandmothers he paused thoughtfully of course weve been traveling long enough that frada may have taken care of that already hes fond of a pretty face no reason he couldnt have sired a bastard or two in all this time but thats not the same as fatheringor carryingthe heir to the domain if its a boy of course if its a boy roshnani echoed just how much that would matter never struck me till now she gave abivard a worried look will you be very angry at me if it turns out to be a girl me of course not id just want to try again as soon as we could eventually i expect wed get it right but mother might be upset ive heard that she apologized to father when denak was born because she was a daughter not a son no wonder denak wants so much to be free of the womens quarters roshnani exclaimed i hadnt thought of it that way but youre probably right abivard said of course you hadnt thought about it that wayyoure a man roshnani said men dont have to worry about such things women do abivard spread his hands not having any reply he thought adequate when denak had said things like that she sounded angry roshnani just said them as if remarking that the mutton wasnt cooked with enough mint somehow that made coming up with an answer even harder sensibly he changed the subject if it is a boy we ought to know that so we can tell my mother right away he snapped his fingers tanshar should be able to tell us are you that curious she asked when he nodded her face lit up good i am too lets go find him the village boasted a couple of taverns but the fortuneteller wasnt in either of them nor was he still feasting with the soldiers and villagers they finally came upon him rubbing down his horse when abivard had explained what they wanted of him he smiled aye i believe i can do that lord lady the village women ask it of me often enough only there you see abivard said triumphantly then he noticed he had interrupted the fortuneteller only what tanshar coughed delicately the magic requires a single hair plucked from ah the private place of the woman who is with child as soon as the spell is complete the hair is burned but if the noble lady objects to providing it of course i shall understand he seemed a little uneasy in roshnanis presence again though for a very different reason this time abivard didnt know how to respond his face warmer than summer alone could be blamed for he looked to roshnani she said if the women in the village can do this i can too i see you have your saddlebags there tanshar do you have what youll need for the spell in them let me think lady the fortuneteller said after a few seconds he nodded yes im sure i do are you certain that before he could answer the question she turned her back and walked off toward her wagon when she came back she was holding somethingpresumably the hairbetween thumb and forefinger she made a wry face that stung she said eryes tanshar didnt quite know what to make of such cooperation if you will just keep that for a bit while i ready the spell he fumbled through one of the saddlebags until he found his scrying bowl instead of filling it with water though he kept on rummaging until at last he turned up a small shapely glass jar with a cork stopper he held it up with a grunt of satisfaction that looks like videssian work abivard said it is tanshar answered its full of olive oil often a wizard will attempt this spell with melted fat then if hes not most careful the sex of the animal that provided the medium will affect the magic choosing a vegetable oil should reduce the chances of that rock oil would be even better roshnani said in that particular way yes but not in others since it comes from the ground rather than from a living creature it is not the medium to be preferred for detecting new life the fortuneteller said you know best im sure roshnani said yes tanshar agreed absently he poured oil into the bowl then held it out to her if you would be so kind as to put in the hair my lady when she had done so he turned to abivard and said you see lord that i have not and shall not touch the hair myself so you havent abivard said from the fuss the fortuneteller made it was as if he was assuring abivard he hadnt and wouldnt touch the place whence that hair had come abivard suddenly sobered magic dealt with just such equivalences perhaps the assurance was more than polite formality after all tanshar set the bowl on the ground then squatted by it lord lady i daresay you will want to observe this for yourselves he remarked so abivard and roshnani squatted too tanshar began a slow nasal chant that frequently invoked fraortish eldest of all and the lady shivini using two of the prophets four one of each gender to seek from the god the information he desired the short curly black hair quivered in the bowl of olive oil then all at once stretched out perfectly straight what does that mean roshnani asked my lady it means you have a boy child growing inside you tanshar answered may he prove as brave and clever and handsome as his father roshnani and abivard stood up and hugged each other thats splendid news abivard said he dug in the pouch at his belt took out a jingling handful of silver arkets and gave them to tanshar when the fortuneteller tried to protest he ignored him then curiosity got the better of him and he asked were it a girl what would the sign have been instead of straightening so the hair would have twisted into the form of a circle tanshar said he pulled flint and steel from the saddlebag then a clay lamp which he filled from the jar of olive oil he also took out a small leather pouch filled with crushed dry leaves dry grass and small twigs he made a small pile of the tinder striking flint and steel over it till it caught when he had a small fire going he lit a twig at it and used the twig to set the lamp alight pointing at the scrying bowl he told roshnani take out the hair and burn it in the lamps flame since its been used once for magic it becomes more vulnerable to being used so again unless consumed she did as he bade her the oil that coated the hair made the flame flare hot and bright for a moment roshnani had got her fingers oily too she jerked them away to keep from being burned a boy abivard said softly after he and roshnani made their goodbyes to tanshar youre going to have a boy it seemed real to him for the first time women know intimately what it is to be with child men have trouble taking it in until their wives bellies swell or sometimes until they hold the babes in their arms your mother will be pleased roshnani said i wasnt thinking about that not in the slightest he replied they smiled at each other and ignoring centuries of encrusted custom walked back to her wagon hand in hand after nalgis crag the rocky knob on which vek rud stronghold sat seemed to abivard hardly more than a pimple on the face of the earth but the familiar bulk of the almost triangular fortress raised a lump in his throat so much had changed for him in the year and more he had been away but the stronghold his home remained the same as it should he thought actually that wasnt quite true banners flew from the walls as he drew closer he saw they bore the red lion of makuran considering why he had set out on campaign that felt fitting and proper the village below the fortress was also decked out in festival garb bright with banners and garlands and with everyone dressed in holiday finery abivard turned to the commander of the company sharbaraz had lent him youre welcome to revel with us for as long as you like but feel free to make for your own homes whenever you care to thank you lord the captain said grinning by your gracious leave ill take you up on both halves of that tanshar rode up to abivard lord with your kind consent ill go start cleaning out my house the women here will have taken care of it for me no doubt but no ones hand is ever as right as your own abivard pointed up toward the stronghold youre welcome to come and stay with me you know youre not just a village fortuneteller any more as you yourself said youve shown your talents are greater than that that may be but my place is here tanshar answered he sounded so determined abivard did not try to argue with him the fortuneteller headed for his neat little home by the marketplace the gates to the stronghold were open frada stood there waiting for abivard the two brothers waved to each other one on horseback the other afoot by the god its good to see you frada called by the god its good to see everyone and everything here abivard answered which raised a cheer from all who stood close enough to hear him he went on roshnanis back there he pointed to the wagon and carrying tanshar says a boy and denak back in mashiz will bear the child of the king of kings that news also brought cheers though not quite so many as he had expected he rode past frada into the courtyard and looked toward the doorway of the living quarters wondering if his brother had arranged a procession of his mother and wives and half sisters the occasion was surely solemn enough but no women came forth from that ironshod door he supposed frada hadnt cared to usurp a prerogative he might have reckoned exclusively his own and concluded that frada had more delicacy than he had suspected he got another cheer a loud one when he swung down off his horse and set foot on the cobbles of vek rud stronghold once more roshnanis wagon rattled through the gates and into the fortress he walked over to it and called to her to come forth she did to loud applause no one thought he was violating custom by showing her off now not when he and she were returning in triumph i give my last command before turning the domain back to abivard my brother frada shouted let everyone feast and drink and make merry the yell that went up after that dwarfed any abivard had got but he didnt care had frada not given that command he would have he hugged his brother it is so good to be home he said as may be but here i am jealous of you again frada said you get all the glory and i stay behind i told you two years ago theres less glory to war than you think abivard answered whatever there is though youll get your share with sharbaraz on the throne may his years be many and his realm increase theres not doubt of that may you be right frada said im glad youre home too though his face clouded as if continuing the same sentence he went on mother wants to see you as soon as you can spare even a moment i want to see her too of course abivard said i really think you should do it as soon as you can frada said still sounding unhappy maybe even nowwhat with the feasting no one will particularly notice if youre away from the middle of things for a bit roshnani caught what abivard was missing somethings gone wrong in the womens quarters hasnt it frada seemed uneasy at the prospect of speaking to his brothers wife but he nodded abivard clapped a hand to his forehead battle was clean and simple you could tell at a glance who had won and who had lost and often have a good idea about why none of that held true for disputes in the womens quarters having but one wife with him he had been free of such tangles the past year and more an advantage of monogamy he hadnt considered till now he said all right ill see her this instant relief blossomed on fradas face come with me then he gestured to include roshnani in the invitation but still did not say anything directly to her as abivard walked toward the doorway into the inhabited part of the stronghold eyes watched from the windows of the womens quarters what were his wives or perhaps his half sisters thinking in there what had gone wrong past the power of his mother and brother to fix inside the entranceway the savory smells of fresh pocket bread and roasting mutton the bouquet of sweet wine made his nose twitch and his stomach rumble no less than anyone else he wanted to feast and drink and rejoice but he turned away from the kitchens and went with frada and roshnani down the hall that led to the dihqans bedchamber frada stopped at the door ive gone into this room brother to meet with our mother by the god i swear i have not gone past it and into the womens quarters proper since you set out with sharbaraz to reclaim his throne just telling me would suffice abivard said you neednt take on about such a matter as that if i didnt trust you would i have left you in charge of the stronghold frada didnt answer nor did he seem eager even to enter the bedchamber now that abivard was back at vek rud stronghold his scruples seemed excessive but abivard shrugged and went into the chamber with roshnani alone as he closed and barred the door fradas footfalls rapidly receded down the corridor abivard shrugged again he had carried a key to the door of the womens quarters all the way to videssos and back now he used it to open that door he was anything but surprised to find his mother waiting for him on the other side he took her in his arms kissing her cheek its so good to be back he told her as he had frada burzoe accepted his affection as her due as she did roshnanis more formal greeting to roshnani she said if you think i approve of your breaking our ancient customs you are mistaken if you think i am not delighted to learn you are carrying a son and heir you are even more mistaken i welcome you back to the domain and your proper place in it principal wife of my son i may not always stay in what you think my proper place mother of my husband roshnani answered abivard would have had trouble imagining her impolite but that did not mean she would abandon the greater freedom she sought we shall speak of this again burzoe said retreating not a barleycorns width from her position but now is not the proper moment she turned to abivard come with me to my chamberthe two of you may as well come now that i think on it the decision here though must be yours my son what is this in aid of mother abivard asked as they walked down the hall frada told me something was amiss but would say no more than that he acted properly burzoe said she stood aside to let abivard precede her into the chamber then went in ahead of roshnani a serving woman appeared at the doorway as if conjured up by magic burzoe fixed her with a baleful glare bring kishmar and onnophre here they know what they need to bring yes mistress the woman hurried away her face was pale and frightened wives not half sisters at any rate abivard thought in a way that was a relief he had bedded both the women a few times for forms sake but that was about all they were pretty enough but no great spark had flared in him nor he thought in either of them the serving woman returned behind her came kishmar and onnophre their appearance startled abivard both were heavier softer than he remembered and both had dark tired circles under their eyes the reason for that was easy enough to understand thougheach of them carried a baby wrapped in a soft wool blanket abivard did not know a great deal about babies but someone who knew much less than he would have known these two were far too small to have been conceived while he was at vek rud stronghold he stared at his mother she nodded grimly oh dear he said she rounded on his junior wives her voice fierce the dihqan has returned to his domain what have you to say for yourselves whores onnophre and kishmar both began to wail producing a hideous discord that grated on abivards ears forgive onnophre cried a heartbeat before kishmar bawled out the same word they started telling their stories at the same time too so he sometimes had trouble figuring out which one he was listening to it didnt matter both stories were about the same they had been bored they had been lonely they had feared he was never coming back from wherever he had goneneither woman seemed quite clear on thatand so they had managed to find a way to amuse themselves and paid an all too common price for that amusement he looked at them by the way things seem you didnt wait any too long before you found yourselves ah friends that set his wives wailing again ignoring the racket he turned back to burzoe are there any others with bulging bellies she shook her head there should not have been these two the blame for them is mine i failed to keep proper watch on the womens quarters but the fate of these two sluts and their worthless brats lies in your hands oh dear abivard said again if he felt like slaughtering the women and the babies he would have been within his rights many a dihqan would have whipped out his sword without a second thought many a dihqan wouldnt have waited to hear what the miscreant wives had to say he would have slain them as soon as he saw the babes in their arms what will you do with those who have brought cuckoos eggs into your nest burzoe demanded her eyes expected blood roshnani stood silent this choice was abivards not hers all the same he looked at her he could not read her face he sighed i make a decent soldier he said wearily but i find i havent it in me to be a butcher i shall find black pebbles and divorce them and send them far away too many in makuran have died this past year four more will not help it is not enough burzoe cried and abivard was reminded overwhelmingly of denaks dismay at anything that smacked of half measures father and son mother and daughter he thought kishmar and onnophre babbled out thanks and blessings onnophre took a step forward as if to embrace him then checked herself which was one of the wiser things she had done abivard said if i didnt put ardini to the sword how can i kill these two they werent so much wicked as foolish they can sew they can spin theyll make their way in the world cast them out at once then burzoe said every day they stay in the womens quarters adds to their shameand to my own abivard suspected the latter concern weighed more heavily in his mothers mind than the former he said since the scandal has been here for months one more day to settle it wont matter ive been away for more than a year today i aim to enjoy my return burzoes upraised eyebrows spoke eloquently of disagreement but all she said was you are the dihqan of vek rud domain and the master of the womens quarters it shall be as you ordain abivards soontobeformer wives showered him with benedictions they could have faced the sword like smerdis with their babes left out on the hillside for dogs and ravens and well they knew it no doubt it hadnt seemed real to them while he was away on campaign he might not have come back at all in which case their adulteries stood a chance of going unpunished having him before them suddenly put matters in a different light be still he said in a voice he might have used to order his lancers to charge onnophre and kishmar stared at him no one plainly had ever spoken to them so if someone had perhaps they might not have found themselves in their present predicament he went on i do not forgive you i merely spare you if the god grant that you find other husbands use them better than you did me the women started to talk he overrode them youve said too much youve done too much already take your bastard babes and get out of my sight tomorrow i will find the black pebbles and send you forth they fled out of burzoes chamber burzoe looked at him with a small grudging hint of approval that was well done she said was it abivard felt weak and sick inside as if he had just been through a battle in which he almost died tomorrow it will be over they can go off and be stupid at someone elses expense not mine it wont be easy for them even so roshnani said yes they can earn their bread but theyll have hard lessons in living outside the womens quarters how to deal with butchers and merchants how to speak to men that they know already burzoe said savagely what would you have had me do abivard asked roshnani she sighed what you could do you did as you said this should be a day of joy im glad you chose not to stain your hands with blood here burzoe shook her head he was soft mercy now will only encourage others to act as those sluts did mother of my husband we do not agree roshnanis voice was quiet she did not offer burzoe argument but she did not back away from her own view either burzoe did not seem to know what to make of that roshnani had been properly deferential as a daughterinlaw should have but had not yielded as most daughtersinlaw would have the combination was disconcerting she took refuge in a common complaint you young people have no respect for the way things should be done if id gone gallivanting off to the ends of the world the way you and denak did i dont knowand i dont want to think aboutwhat would have happened to my reputation nothing happened to denaks reputation roshnani said with the same quiet determination to get her point across that she had shown before save that she got to bear a child who with luck will be king of kings far earlier than she could have if shed stayed behind here till the war was won if roshnani hadnt come with us the war likely would have been lost not won abivard told his mother and explained how it had been his principal wife who had the idea to take refuge in videssos he added if theyd stayed you probably never would have had a grandchild with a chance to be king of kings custom burzoe said but she let it go as that the prospect of a king of kings or royal princess as a grandchild did have considerable allure abivard said nor will the world end if roshnani who after all has already traveled far sometimes comes out of the womens quarters to see the rest of the stronghold sharbaraz king of kings has promised to allow denak the same liberty in the palace at mashiz and how can following what the king of kings does be wrong i dont know the answer to thatyoud have to ask smerdis his mother replied tartly abivard felt his ears heat roshnani sucked in her breath with a sudden sharp soundburzoe could still be formidable but she went on you will do as you will do and take no special notice of me in the doing so life goes however the old try to make it otherwise but if you think you will make me love the changes you work please think again greatly daring abivard went over to her and put an arm around her shoulder she had always been the one to console him never the other way roundtill now he said by the god mother i shall let no dishonor come to vek rud stronghold nor to any who dwell here i thought the same burzoe said and look what came of it it will be all right abivard said with the confidence of youth roshnani nodded vigorously now it was burzoe who did not agree but forbore to argue she said it will be as it is however that may prove but i know son that you would sooner be feasting than dealing with the troubles of the womens quartersor with me go on then perhaps the lady your wife will spend a little while here and regale us with tales of the faroff lands shes seen of course i will roshnani said at once abivard could read her thoughts the more women heard of the outside world the less content they would be with separation from it maybe burzoe saw that maybe she didnt in either case having made the invitation she could scarcely withdraw it abivard took leave of them both he locked the door to the womens quarters behind himnot that that had mattered much to onnophre and kishmar he wondered who had fathered their children if he ever found out vek rud stronghold would have a couple of more folk leaving it frada still waited in the hallway not far from the dihqans bedchamber you heard he demanded abivard nodded his brother went on what will you do ill divorce them both tomorrow and send them out of here abivard answered that will do ive seen too much blood spilled this past year to want more on my hands his brothers shoulders slumped with relief i told mother your answer would be something like that she was all for taking their heads the minute their bellies started bulging he rolled his eyes we went round and round on that one like peasant women in a ring dance finally i got her to wait for your word what was it father would say easier to do something now than undo it later if it happens to be wrong something like that anyhow id have been upset if i got home to find two of my wives had gone on the chopping block like a couple of pullets thats what i thought frada answered youre more tenderhearted than father was or you put up with more nonsense anyway women promenading all over the landscape his snort showed what he thought of that but youre the dihqan now and the stronghold runs by how you think we ought to do things am i abivard said more tenderhearted i mean he wondered what godarz would have done had a wife of his borne a child he could not have sired something interesting and memorable he had no doubt well maybe i am every now and then the world does change maybe so almost like roshnani frada acknowledged without necessarily agreeing then he clapped his brother on the back however that may be theres a feast waiting for us down the hall if youd stayed closeted much longer my nose and my belly would have dragged me off to it i expect id have forgiven you abivard said lets go somehow word of what he had decided in the womens quarters got out to the rest of the stronghold faster than he did some people praised his mercy others plainly thought he had been too soft but everyone knew what the verdict had been he drank two quick cups of wine to try to dull the edge of his bemusements in the kitchen a cook gave him a plate of lamb and herbs and chickpeas all mashed together and a bowl of lamb broth with toasted chunks of pocket bread floating in it as an accompaniment he dug in with a silver spoon thats good he said blissfully now in truth i start to feel at home didnt they make it at mashiz frada asked they did yes but with different spicestoo much garlic and not enough mint if you ask me abivard answered this is the way its supposed to taste the way its tasted ever since i was a boy the way its tasted as long as abalish has commanded in the kitchens you mean frada said and abivard nodded his brother went on and what did they eat in videssos that must have been interesting they generally bake their bread in loaves not in pockets abivard said thinking back they eat lamb and kid and beef much as we do theyre even more fond of garlic than the folk around mashiz and he broke off suddenly remembering the fermented fish sauce what is it frada asked eagerly abivard told him he looked revolted though not as revolted as abivard had felt youre making that up abivard shook his head frada said i hope you didnt eat any of the horrible stuff i did till they told me what it was abivard spooned up some broth to drive away the memory when that didnt work he drank some wine what did it taste like frada asked like one small boy querying another who had just swallowed a bug abivard had trouble recalling after he had learned the sauce was made from rotten fish horror overwhelmed whatever flavor it might have had at last he said it wasnt as bad as it might have beenmore cheesy than anything else better you than me brother of mine thats all i have to say frada waved to a halt a woman with a tray of boiled mutton tongues sweetbreads and eyes he filled the plate he had emptied of mashed lamb now heres proper fare youre right of course abivard said here mandane let me have some of those too when his plate was full he took out his belt knife and attacked the savory spread with gusto presently full to the point of bursting and drunk to the point where he seemed to float a hands breadth above the stones of the floor he made his way back toward the bedchamber only then did it occur to him that he ought to summon one of his wives to bed with him and one other than roshnani she had had him all to herself for a year and more which had to have stirred up savage jealousy in the womens quarters he hoped that jealousy wouldnt manifest itself as it had with ardini but whom should he choose whichever wife he first bedded on his return would also be an object of jealousy the other relevant issue was that he was so laden with food and drink that he did not want a woman and had doubts he could do one justice such fine points spun slowly through his mind as he went into the bedchamber and after a couple of fumbles let down the bar he took off his sandals trying to work the buckles was harder than barring the door had been at last he managed with a sigh of relief he lay down to think about which wife he should call the next thing he knew it was morning for the first time since he had become dihqan abivard had the chance to run his domain in something approaching peace from time to time small bands of khamorth would cross the degird and trickle south to his lands sometimes with their flocks sometimes as mere raiders but he and his horsemen always managed to drive them off the great eruption of plainsmen into makuran everyone had feared after the disaster on the pardrayan steppe did not come much as i hate to say it maybe the tribute smerdis paid the nomads did some good abivard remarked frada spat on the walkway of the stronghold wall they paced together that for smerdis and his tribute both stinking usurper how could you speak any good of a man against whom you spent most of two years at war if it werent for you hed likely still be king of kings arent you glad hes gone that i am as you say i went through too much getting rid of him to wish he were still here a little voice inside abivard though asked how much difference having sharbaraz on the throne rather than smerdis would mean for makuran in the long run was changing the ruler worth all the blood and treasure spilled to accomplish the job fiercely he told the little voice to shut up in any case whatever the civil war had done for makuran as a whole it had surely made his fortuneand his clans without it he would never have become brotherinlaw to the king of kings nor possibly uncle to sharbarazs successor he would have stayed just a frontier dihqan rarely worrying about what happened outside his domain would that have been so bad the little voice asked he ignored it roshnani came out of the door to the living quarters and strolled across the courtyard she saw him up on the wall and waved to him he waved back the stablemen and smiths helpers and serving women in the courtyard took no special notice of her which abivard reckoned progress the first few times she had ventured out of the womens quarters people had either stared popeyed or turned their backs and pretended she wasnt there which struck abivard as even worse from the womens quarters eyes avidly followed roshnani as she walked about because of what kishmar and onnophre had done abivard hesitated to give his other wives and half sisters the freedom roshnani enjoyed he would willingly have granted it to his mother but burzoe did not want it if one of the faces behind the narrow windows was hers he was sure her mouth was set in a thin line of disapproval frada nodded down to roshnani and said that hasnt worked out as badly as i expected theres the most praise ive yet heard from you about the idea abivard said its not meant as praise frada answered its meant as something less than complete hatred of the notion which is the place from which i began anything less than complete hatred is the most praise ive heard from you abivard insisted frada made a horrible face at him and mimed throwing a punch in his direction then hesitantly he said i hope you dont mind my telling you that ive talked to the lady roshnani a few times abivard understood his hesitation if by makuraner custom a noble was the only man who with propriety could look at his wife he was even more emphatically the only man who could with propriety speak to her abivard said dont fret yourself about it i knew such things would happen when i gave her leave to come out of the womens quarters i didnt see how it could be otherwise if she came out and no one would speak to her that might be even worse in her mind than staying confined in there doesnt it bother you frada demanded youve stood more customs on their heads im not the only one abivard reminded him sharbaraz king of kings is doing with our sister what im doing with my wife and a lot of customs got overthrown summer before last along with our army ive tried to keep the changes small and sensible really i dont think father would have disapproved frada pondered that at last he gave a grudging nod you may be right father i wont say he often broke custom but he never seemed to take it as seriously as say mother does well put abivard nodded in turn hed work within custom whenever he could but i dont think hed let it bind him if he needed to accomplish something hmm if you put it that way brother of mine what do you accomplish by letting roshnani out of the womens quarters frada looked smug as if sure he had come up with a question abivard couldnt answer but abivard did answer i get the benefit of her advice more readily which served meand makuranwell on campaign and her advice is apt to be better if she sees things for herself than if she hears about them secondhand and on top of all that i make her happy which as youll discover when you marry is not the least important thing in the world he sent frada a challenging stare his brother said if its not the least important thing in the world why did you set it at the foot of your list of arguments not at their head no dont answer i know why to make the others seem bigger well what if i did abivard said laughing he set a hand on his brothers shoulder youve grown up this past year when i went off to war youd never have noticed the way an argument was made ive heard enough of them since wearing your sandals while you were away frada rolled his eyes by the god ive had more people try to sneak lies past me than i ever imagined some folk have no shame whatever theyll say anything if they think they see an arket in it i wont say youre wrong because i dont think you are what made smerdis do what he did except that he thought he saw an arket in it rather more than one frada said well yes abivard said but the idea behind his greed and everyone elses is the same he gave frada a sidelong look and how many lies got past you drop me in the void if i knowi couldnt very well notice the ones that got past me now could i frada answered he paused for a moment then resumed fewer and few as the months went by i do hope yes thats something worth aiming at abivard agreed he looked out over the battlements toward the vek rud river to the north ripening crops watered by qanats made the land close to the river a carpet of gold and green herds grazed on the scrub farther away he let out a long sigh what is it frada asked i was standing just here near enough and peering out toward the river two years ago when father came up on the wall and told me the videssians had been spreading gold around among the khamorth to make them want to fight us abivard said everything that followed sprang from that its a different world now frada said it certainly is i didnt expect to be dihqan for another twenty yearsthe same for okhos and for pradtak too i suppose abivard said sharbaraz didnt expect to be king of kings for a long time eitherand smerdis i daresay never expected to be king of kings at all frada looked out at the domain too lords come and lords go he said the land goes on forever truth again abivard said i give thanks to the god that the nomads contented themselves with going after our flocks and herds and didnt seriously try to wreck our croplands repairing qanats once theyre broken isnt a matter for a season it takes years we fought a couple of skirmishes with them last year near the edge of the irrigated land they wanted to pasture their flocks in the wheat and the beans frada said but when they found out we had enough warriors left to keep that from being an easy job they gave it upthe god and the four be praised he wiped his forehead id be lying if i said i wasnt worried for a while i feared youd hardly have a domain to come home to thats all right abivard said for a while i didnt think i was coming home anyway smerdis had us by the neckpushed out across the tutub away from the land of the thousand cities with the desert at our backs if it hadnt been for roshnani i expect wed have perished there frada glanced down at roshnani who was talking with a leatherworker he still hesitated to look directly at her for more than a moment but let his eyes slide across her and then back even so he said well considering what she did maybe she does deserve to be out and about since that was as close to a concession as he would get from his brother abivard clapped frada on the back i thank you he said do remember this is new for me too i expect it will grow easier for both of usand maybe for roshnani as wellas time goes by the videssians let their women out freely and so do our common folk i dont think well fall into the void if we do the same i notice you havent turned your other wives loose frada said i would have if kishmar and onnophre had kept their legs closed while i was away abivard answered irritably youll notice they both got themselves with child while they were supposed to be locked away in the womens quarters too they could hardly have done more if they were selling themselves in the market square down in the village but rewarding the others right after that would have been too much what about our half sisters frada asked youre full of impossible questions today arent you abivard said he thought that one over then sighed i probably wont let them out not right away anyhow having them known for wandering about outside the womens quarters wouldnt do their chances for a proper marriage match any good that makes good sense frada allowed i give you credit for seeing the potholes and ruts in the road youre traveling im glad of that abivard said sometimes i dont think you see the road in the potholes and ruts im traveling both brothers laughed abivard said by the god i did miss you sharbaraz king of kings is a fine man and a good friend but hes not an easy fellow to be foolish with nice to know im good for something frada said if alls well up here as it looks to be shall we go down and find out how ganzak is doing with the latest armor if he stays as busy as he has been well be able to outfit a formidable band of lancers before long his grin turned predatory all the neighboring dihqans will fear us there are worse things abivard said aye lets go together they descended from the wall and hurried across the courtyard to ganzaks smithy in winter the smithy had been a welcome refuge against the cold with fall still some ways away sweat started on abivards brow as soon as he went into the firefilled chamber ganzak labored naked to the waist his forehead and broad hairy chest gleamed with sweat its odor filled the smith along with woodsmoke and the almostblood smell of hot iron when abivard and frada came in ganzak was working not on armor but on a sword blade his muscles rippled as he brought a hammer down on the iron bar he held to the anvil with a pair of tongs metal clashed against metal sparks flew the smith plunged the bladetobe into a barrel by the anvil the hiss that rose might have come from the throat of a great venomous snake ganzak lifted the blade out of the quenching bath examined it with a critical eye and set it aside he laid the tongs down on the anvil with a clank the god give you good day lord he said nodding to abivard and to you abivard answered then he blurted how do you stand the heat in here ganzak threw back his head and laughed loudly and gustily lord this chamber is my home when i come out of it i sometimes think im about to start shivering im so used to it here abivard and frada exchanged glances frada said what i think is that you ought to go down into the village and have tanshar or one of the old wives brew you up a potion for its plain youre not a well man the smith laughed again he was always goodnatured which given his size and strength was fortunate now he stretched and the molten motion of the muscles under his sweatshiny skin was like those under a lions pelt do i look infirm to you he demanded no no frada said hastily however goodnatured ganzak was only a foolish man would undertake to argue with him abivard said we came to see how you were faring with the armors the domain needs i should finish the eighth suit before the moon is new again the smith answered thats gear for man and horse both you understand and puts us two equipages ahead of where we were before peroz king of kings led the army up into pardraya were also ahead in helms and shields both and ive had men ask for mail shirts too theyre a long way from full armor ill not deny but better than leather dipped in boiling wax i know where they got the idea unless im much mistaken abivard said are they men who rode with sharbaraz king of kings ganzaks brow furrowed now that you mention it lord they are how did you know that before abivard could answer the smith snapped his fingers wait i have it you think they filched the notion from the videssians dont you i certainly do abivard said the videssians wore armor enough to dominate our lightarmed horse archers and even to confront our lancers but they were a lot more mobile than heavy cavalry their way of doing things had merit i thought and from what you say i wasnt the only one mmi wouldnt quarrel with you ganzak said they turned out to be men of more parts than id expected i will say that for em i figured theyd be all gold and sneakery and no guts and they werent like that at all his jaw worked as if he were chewing on something whose flavor he didnt quite fancy i dont know but what id sooner have had em be more like the tales tell theyd be less dangerous i think i think youre right abivard said ganzak showed clear understanding he was a good smith no doubt about that abivard wondered what sort of dihqan he would have made had he been born to the nobility a good one was his guess the realm needed smiths yes but it also needed good leaders as tanshar had asked what was it losing because so many men never got to display the things of which they were capable frada looked frustrated to the point of bursting everyone chatters on about the videssians and how theyre this and how theyre not that he cried and here ive never been within a thousand farsangs of one dont let it bother you brother of mine abivard said youll have your chance against them too when frada asked when im old and gray like smerdis i wont be able to do any good against them then what with sharbaraz king of kings all friendly with likinios avtokrator were liable to have peace for the next generation he spoke as if that were one of the worst things that could happen but then he had never been to war i dont think youll have to wait so long abivard said sharbaraz king of kings is a man of honor he wouldnt pick a fight with likinios without good reason but likinios is liable to give him reason he took a chunk of vaspurakan from us remember as the price for his aid hes the kind whos always reaching out for his own advantage one day he may well overreach himself and then youll have your wish frada bent his arm as if to couch a lance in the crook of his elbow it cant come soon enough abivard laughed at him i said one day brother of mine not tomorrow or even next year i heard what you said frada answered i just didnt listen to you the winter before abivard had passed his time in chilly exile at serrhes in the empire of videssos the winter before that had been filled with excitement and frantic preparations for revolt with sharbaraz a fugitive and smerdis holding most of makuran in the hollow of his hand this winter was different it wasnt the near hibernation abivard had known in his younger days he was dihqan now not godarz and on his shoulders rested responsibility for solving the squabbles in his domain and for making sure supplies would stretch till spring but the harvest had been goodbetter than he had expectedand the storehouses held enough wheat and nuts and fruit to ensure that the domain would not go hungry before warmth returned he got the chance to relax a little the first time hed had that chance for two and a half years he made the most of it sleeping through long winter nights drinking hot spiced wine to fight the chill of snowstorms and icy breezes taking advantage of the good harvest to eat until he had to fasten his sword belt one notch closer to the end than he had before some crops grew despite the beastly weather roshnanis belly swelled which she regarded with a mixture of pride and wry amusement as her pregnancy advanced her ankles also swelled when she was on her feet for any length of time that limited her trips outside the womens quarters much to her annoyance abivard kept calling her to his bed even after she had grown quite round that irked his other wives one of them complained why dont you summon me more often arent i prettier than she is if you have to ask the question the answer is always no abivard answered because just letting it cross your lips makes you ugly the woman stared at him in bafflement i dont understand she said i know he answered sighing thats part of the problem little by little he began to let his other wives make excursions outside the womens quarters he remained unconvinced that was a good idea but found no way around it before he let any of his wives out to explore the rest of the stronghold he offered such freedom to his mother burzoe rejected it as she had before he had expected as much but it still saddened him others were moving in new directions but her path through life remained fixed what are we going to do with her he asked roshnani one chilly night when the two of them huddled together in the bed in the dihqans bedchamber as much for warmth as from affection if those others go out and see things and do things she doesnt how will she keep the lead in the womens quarters she probably wont roshnani answered it will pass to someone else since she was the present dihqans principal wife when she said someone else she undoubtedly meant herself but she was characteristically selfeffacing she was also sure to be right abivard realized that change would have to come anyway sooner or later burzoe was after all only the widow of the former dihqan but she had been undisputed mistress of the feminine side of the stronghold for longer than he had been alive the idea of that power slipping out of her hands was as upsetting as an earthquake he shook his head in bemusement roshnani felt the motion and asked what is it he explained then said i was thinking of all the changes that have happened lately but heres one i hadnt looked for maybe thats what makes it so upsetting as you said though its a change thats coming because she refuses to change roshnani reminded him and more changes are yet to come she took his hand and set it on her belly the skin there was stretched tight over her growing womb the baby inside her kicked and squirmed then pushed something hard and round against abivards palm thats the head he said in delight that has to be his head her hand joined his i think youre right she said just before like some magical island that could rise out of the water and then vanish once more it sank away from them as the baby shifted position abivard hugged roshnani to him as he did so the baby kicked vigorously they both laughed someones doing his best to come between us he said roshnani turned serious that will happen for a while you know she said ill need some time to recover after the babys born and hell need me for a while too in spite of servants and wet nurses i do know that abivard said i expect it will be all right im just waiting to see which of us he favors if he looks like your brother okhos hell have all the maidens sighing for him ive no reason to complain of the looks on your side of the family roshnani said which made abivard hug her again and also made the baby wiggle in her bellyor perhaps the baby would have wiggled anyhow roshnani went on and what shall we call him once he comes out id like to name him varaz after my brother who perished up on the pardrayan plain abivard answered do you mind you lost your father and brothers on the steppe as well hell be of vek rud domain and heir to it so he should have a name that goes with it roshnani said after a little thought well have others to remember my kinand your father too id thought you might want to name the boy godarz in fact why dont you because my fathers memory will stay green for years to come in the hearts and minds of everyone who knew him abivard said he had thought about that too he was dihqan and a good one he touched peoples lives thats a better monument than a babys name but varaz was cut down before he had the chance to show everything he could do in life he deserves to be remembered too and for him i think this is a good way ah roshnani nodded against his chest every so often youve accused me of being sensible husband of mine i have to say im not the only one here with that affliction accused affliction abivard snorted you make it sound as if somethings wrong with common sense the only thing wrong with it i can think of is that not enough people have any of it some of my former wives spring to mind he added with a touch of malice roshnani refused to let the last gibe distract her what could be more wrong with it than that she asked and as she had a way of doing left abivard groping for an answer winter solstice came and went the year before in serrhes the videssians had celebrated the day with raucous sometimes rowdy rites here it passed quietly almost unnoticed in a way that felt good and normal in another way abivard missed the excitement of the videssian festival snowstorms rolled down from the north one after another invaders from the steppe as dangerous as the khamorth and unlike the nomads impossible to repel the storms killed beasts and occasionally herdsmen like everyone in the stronghold and the village below abivard worried that the fuel carefully gathered during the warm season would not last through the cold every icy blast that shook the shutters on the window to his bedchamber made him fret more then one day when the years reckoning said the equinox was approaching but the snowcovered ground seemed certain winter would last forever such mere pragmatic concerns as fuel vanished from his mind for a maidservant came out of the womens quarters and wrapped in thick sheepskins hurried down to the village she soon returned with the midwife a grayhaired woman named farigis abivard met the midwife in the courtyard just inside the main gate she bowed politely then said your pardon lord but i would sooner not stand about here making polite chitchat your wife has more need of me than you do right now of course abivard said stepping aside to let her pass she swept by him without a backward glance her long coat trailing in the snow far from being offended abivard was relieved to his way of thinking anyone who put business ahead of conversation was likely to know that business he did not follow farigis into the womens quarters for one thing he suspected she would have thrown him out and in such matters her word not his was law and for another childbirth was a womens mystery that frightened him worse than any of the armored lancers he had faced during the civil war this was a battlefield on which he could not contend as he paced the hall outside his bedchamber he murmured lady shivini if youll hear the prayer of a mere man help bring my lady through her ordeal that done he went back to pacing he wanted to send the prayer up again and again but refrained fearing he would anger the prophet if he seemed to nag after a while frada took him by the arm led him into the kitchens sat him down and set a mug of wine in front of him he drank mechanically hardly aware of what he was doing this is taking a very long time he said presently it can do that you know frada answered although he knew less about the matter than abivard did which given the level of abivards ignorance was not easy he picked up abivards empty mug and carried it away returning a moment later with it full and a matching one for himself in his other hand every time a serving woman came into the kitchens abivard jumped thinking either that she was farigis or that she brought word from the midwife but the sun had set and darkness settled over the stronghold like a cloak before farigis came forth abivard sprang to his feet the smile on the midwifes face told him everything he needed to know but he stammered out his questions anyhow is she is the baby both well and you have a son as i gather tanshar told you that you would farigis answered a goodsize lad and he cries as loud as any ive heard which is good though your lady wont think so when he wakes up howling a few weeks from now she says youll name him for your brother the god grant him a long and healthy life may i see her abivard asked and then correcting himself may i see them aye though shes very tired the midwife said i dont know how long shell want to see you and this once lord youd do well to let your wifes wishes prevail not your own my wifes wishes prevail more often than you think abivard told her she didnt seem much impressed abivard got the feeling she was anything but easy to impress the sweet jingle of the silver arkets with which he paid her fee though definitely gained her complete undivided and approving attention congratulations lord the call followed abivard through the stronghold to the door of his bedchamber then picked up again higherpitched in the womens quarters roshnani looked up when he came into her room farigis had warned him she was weary but the exhaustion she showed shocked him beneath her naturally swarthy cast of skin she was dead pale the room smelled of stale sweat as if she had labored in the fields rather than in childbed are you all right he asked alarmed the corners of her mouth turned upward in what would have looked more like a smile had it come with less obvious effort she said if i could sleep for the next week i might be well enough after that but i doubt varaz here will give me the chance she shifted the blanketcovered bundle she held in the crook of her left elbow let me see him abivard said and roshnani lifted the soft lambs wool from his sons face again he was shocked and again did his best not to show it varaz looked like nothing so much as a wizened little red monkey with an absurd fringe of hair like a bald old mans his eyes were shut tight enough to pull his whole face into a grimace he breathed in little snorting grunts and occasionally twitched for no reason at all hes a handsome boy abivard declared the most sincere lie he had ever told isnt he roshnani said proudly either she was lying too or mother loveor possibly the rigors of childbirthhad left her blind abivard would have bet on the latterthe longer he stared at varaz the better the baby looked may i hold him he asked gulping a little he knew how to hold newborn pups but babiesespecially this baby his own babywere something else again here roshnani held the wrapped bundle out to him keep one hand under his head mind youhe cant hold it up for himself i dont blame him poor chap abivard answered its much the biggest part of him varaz squirmed as the transfer was made and threw out his arms and legs without waking up abivard carefully supported his head once i was this small with my father holding me could it be possible if youd been born the size you are now your poor mother would have been upset is hardly the word roshnani returned bringing forth even a baby is quite hard enough thank you abivard blinked then laughed if you can joke youll get over it sooner than you think may you be right roshnani yawned and said set him in the cradle would you id like to sleep as long as hell let me as if varaz were made of parchmentthin glass abivard laid him down when the corner of the babys mouth brushed the blanket that lined the cradle he made little sucking noises abivard kissed roshnani and said do rest i hope he gives you plenty of chances so do i roshnani said but thats in his hands not mine she yawned again whatever chances he gives me ill take when abivard had walked to his bedchamber the night he had come back to vek rud stronghold too much wine had made him feel his feet were floating above the ground he had drunk some wine waiting nervously while roshnani delivered varaz but was for all practical purposes sober nevertheless he floated much higher now than he had then winter yielded to spring in its usual grudging curmudgeonly way varaz thrived as if he were an early spring flower himself everyone exclaimed at his size at his looks at how enthusiastically he nursed he quickly learned to smile he had had abivards heart before but with that he captured his father all over again the first crops were beginning to sprout when a dusty muddy horseman made his way up the knob to vek rud stronghold asking after abivard men hurried to fetch the dihqan for the rider bore word from sharbaraz king of kings he bowed when abivard came before him and said lord i am bidden to deliver two messages to you first is that your sister the lady denak was before i departed for this domain delivered of a daughter the princess jarireh she and the little one were both well when i left mashiz this for your good news abivard said giving him a couple of arkets he hoped denak hadnt apologized to sharbaraz for bearing a girl he would have reckoned the news better still if she had had a boy but as long as she had come through birth all right she would have more chances for that later he asked the horseman what is the king of kings other message lord it may not please you the rider nervously licked his lips sharbaraz king of kings orders you to come to mashiz as fast as you may what abivard said does he say why he does not the messenger said but there you are bidden would you presume to disobey the king of kings of course not abivard replied at once he suddenly realized that being sharbarazs brotherinlaw could bring him danger as well as privilege if he didnt obey the king of kings even in the smallest particular he ran the risk of being suspected of treachery or undue ambitionnot that the two would look much different from sharbarazs point of view if an obscure cousin could aspire to the throne what of a less obscure brotherinlaw abivard had no more desire to become king of kings than he did to climb up on the stronghold wall and jump off he also had the feeling that the more he tried to convince sharbaraz of that the less sharbaraz would believe him he asked the messenger does his majesty want me to leave for mashiz today indeed he does lord the fellow answered i am to accompany you on the journey and to make it as quick as may be he pulled a pair of parchments from a message tube on his belt here is his written order which i have just delivered and here is a command enabling us to draw on the stables of all the domains on the way back to the capital thus speeding us on our way hes in earnest then abivard said nodding only half in jest he added have i your leave to make farewells before we set out lord i am your servant the messenger said but we are both servants of sharbaraz king of kings may his days be long and his realm increase well said abivard answered here come to the kitchens take food and drink i shall attend you as soon as i can he called to one of his men to take the rider into the living quarters of the stronghold then went looking for frada his brothers eyes snapped with excitement when abivard gave him the news what do you suppose it means frada asked do you think were at war with videssos already i dont see how we could be abivard said sharbaraz wouldnt attack likinios without good reason and likinios went to too much trouble too recently to put sharbaraz on the throne to give him a good reason so soon frada made a clucking noise id argue with you but i dont see how i can but off you go again and leave me behind to watch over the stronghold it hardly seems fair he laughed at abivards expression no no dont look like that im just giving you a rough time whatever sharbaraz wants i expect ill find out if theres a place in it for me maybe its something to do with denak theres a thought abivard agreed you could be rightthat might account for his not telling the messenger much now he knew he looked worried i hope its nothing bad but no it could hardly be not with the other word the fellow brought youll know fairly soon frada said mashiz is a long way from here but you wont have to fight any battles to get there not this year id better not abivard exclaimed laughing he quickly grew serious once more that leaves you in charge of the domain again brother of mine i know you can run ityouve had more chance to show that than i have only one place where ill tell you anything at all the womens quarters i hope frada said why did i guess you were going to say that abivards chuckle was rueful as a matter of fact though youre right let my wives keep the privileges ive given them but grant no new ones if you need advice you could do far worse than going to either mother or roshnani or to both of them if they agree theyre almost sure to be right if they dont youll have to use your own judgment myself im more inclined to think along with roshnani frada nodded ill bear all that in mind but its not what im really worried about thats simple what do i do if one of your wives has a belly that starts to bulge ill take care of that by the god abivard said grimly he hunted in the dirt of the courtyard till he found three black pebbles then rounded up three witnesses he chose men of unquestioned probity among them ganzak the smith whom no one would have thought of doubting with the witnesses watching abivard passed frada the pebbles saying to my brother i commit these and give him my proxy to use them to divorce any wife of mine who adulterously gets herself with child while i am gone from the stronghold i shall keep these pebbles safe against a day i hope never comes frada said his voice solemn we have seen your purpose lord and will speak of it should there be need ganzak said i also hope that day does not come the heads of the other witnesses bobbed up and down so do i abivard said but what i hope and what will be he let that hang his brother and the witnesses all knew whereof he spoke by the time he went into the womens quarters the messengers news had already got there he did not warn his wives he had left the pebbles with frada he doubted threats of that sort would keep them on the straight and narrow path if they were inclined to stray and if they could not figure out that he might do such a thing they were too foolish to belong in the womens quarters even as ornaments roshnani said you wont have me nagging you to come along this time husband of mine not with varaz still so small ill pray to the god that she bring you home quick and safe ill offer him the same prayer abivard answered roshnani started to say something closed her mouth on it then cautiously tried again will your other wives and i be confined to the womens quarters while youre away from the stronghold no abivard answered ive told frada that your privileges are to remain the same that got him a hug fervent enough to squeeze the breath from him and to make him wish sharbarazs messenger wasnt waiting impatiently in the kitchens roshnani said truly the god has been kind enough to grant me the most generous most forbearing husband in all the world i bless her for it and love him for it abivard had intended to go on with something commonplace and fatuous about not abusing the privileges that would continue instead he stopped and stared he and roshnani had been man and wife for close to three years now in all that time he didnt think either of them had mentioned love marriages were made to bind families together if you were lucky you got on well with your wife you could rely on her and she gave good adviceto say nothing of an heir all those things he had had with roshnani anything more she was watching him warily perhaps wondering if she had said too much after a moment he observed thoughtfully do you know wife of mine until you named the name i didnt realize we had the thing it describes thats a magic worthy of tanshar at his best and do you know what else im angry at you because of it you are why roshnani asked puzzled because now ill be even sorrier to go away from you and even more begrudging of every day till im home again he squeezed her as hard as she had him those days will be empty for me too roshnani said but then because she was a practical person she laughed at her poetic pretension and said well not quite empty not with varaz filling them so but ill miss you more than i know how to say i understand because i feel the same way he said and then cautiously i love you too he hugged her again and now i have to leave he kissed her then made his way quickly toward the door to the womens quarters because those steps were so hard to take he made himself hurry them lest he find he could not sharbarazs man was finishing his wine when abivard walked into the kitchens he got up from the bench on which he sat let us be off lord he said if you will be so kind as to show me to the stables certainly although i would like the chance to ready a packhorse before we set out abivard answered strongholds even villages are few and far between up here in the northwest and the land from one to the next often bad if anything should go wrong which the god prevent id sooner not be stuck in the desert without any supplies at all thats how vultures grow fat the messenger muttered under his breath but had to nod servants carried sacks of pocket bread and lamb sausage rich with garlic and mint and cardamom and skins of roughedged red wine out to the stables where grooms lashed them aboard a big gelding with good endurance a couple of hours before sunset sharbarazs man swung up onto his horse with very visible relief abivard mounted too and put the packhorse on a long leather lead with the messenger he rode out of vek rud stronghold down the knob on which it sat and away toward the southeast as abivard had predicted the journey to mashiz went far more smoothly than it had when he had set out for the capital with sharbaraz two years before not only did no one take up arms against him as he traveled but lesser nobles went out of their way to offer hospitality as extravagant as they could afford being brotherinlaw to the king of kings had its advantages so did the warrant sharbarazs man flourished whenever occasion arose not only did it entitle him and abivard to fresh horses at their stops but to victuals on demand the bread and meat and wine abivard had packed back at vek rud stronghold stayed all but untouched i dont care he said when the messenger remarked on that who knows what might have happened if we didnt have them with us something to that the fellow admitted things you get ready for have a way of not going wrong its the ones you dont look for that give you trouble sharbarazs rebellious army had swung south around the dilbat mountains and then up through the desert toward mashiz because the realm was at peace and the season approaching summer abivard and sharbarazs man traversed the passes through the mountains instead abivard had thought he was used to high country he had grown up atop a knob after all and he had scaled nalgis crag which was a most impressive piece of stone all by itself but looking up to steep mountains on either side of him reminded him of his insignificance in the grand scheme of things more forcefully even than the immense emptiness of the pardrayan plain fortresses in the passes could have held up an army indefinitely both by their own strength and with the avalanches they could have unleashed against hostile troops seeing the gray stone piles and the heaped boulders abivard understood why sharbaraz had never once considered forcing his way through the shorter route he would not have reached mashiz as things were though the officers who commanded the forts vied with one another to honor the brotherinlaw of the king of kings the men struck him as being as much courtiers as soldiers but the garrisons they commanded looked like good troops and then early one morning he and the messenger came round a last bend in the road and there laid out before them as if through some great artists brush sat mashiz with the river valleys of the land of the thousand cities serving as distant backdrop abivard studied the scene for a long time he had seen and even entered mashiz from the east but the capital of the realm took on a whole new aspect when viewed from the other direction this is how it must have looked to our ancestors the god only knows how many years ago when they first came off the high plateau of makuran and saw the land they would make their own he said the messenger shrugged i dont know anything about that lord im glad to see mashiz again because im coming home to my wife and son you took me away from mine abivard said although not in real reproof the man was but obeying the command of sharbaraz king of kings lead me to the palace now so i can learn the king of kings wishes and go back to my home once more in many ways this was the first good look he had had at mashiz when he had entered it with sharbaraz he had been too busy fighting for his life to pay much attention to his surroundings and then just as he reached the palace sorcerous darkness had swallowed the city now he took it all in merchants and whores servants of the god and horse traders drunkards and servitors farmers selling lettuces farmers buying copper trinkets singers dancers beggars two men with picks stolidly knocking down a mudbrick wall women hawking caged songbirds and a thousand more besides the noise was overwhelming both in volume and variety without the messenger to guide him he would soon have been hopelessly lost streets writhed and twisted and doubled back on themselves but sharbarazs man unerringly picked his way through the maze and toward the palace at the gates he turned abivard over to a plump beardless flunky and rode away at first abivard thought the functionary was a man although he had never seen a man without a beard then he thought the person was a woman for the voice with which he was addressed seemed too high and smooth to belong to a man but he had trouble imagining a woman in such a prominent position at the court of the king of kings then he realized he was dealing with a eunuch he felt like a country bumpkin unused to the sophisticated ways of the capital as the courtier guided him to the throne room though he wondered what the fellow thought of his own state sophistication had its prices too great and magnificent lord i shall be beside you as you are presented to sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase the eunuch said at my signal thus he touched abivard on the arm you are to prostrate yourself before him as you say abivard agreed being brotherinlaw to the king of kings did not excuse him from any of the formalities of court ceremonial if anything it made his punctiliousness in observing those formalities more important than it would have been for someone of less exalted rank his feet glided soundlessly over thick wool carpets beautifully dyed and elaborately woven carpets too fine to be walked upon anywhere save in the palace of the king of kings the torches that lit the hallways were of sandalwood their sweet smoke filled the air he had put on his best caftan to enter mashiz but felt woefully underdressed all the same we approach the throne room the eunuch murmured in his strange sexually ambiguous voice walk beside me as i told you and be ready for my signal courtiers ministers generals and high nobles from the seven clans filled the throne room abivard felt their eyes on him and did his best to bear up under the scrutiny he looked straight ahead and tried not to notice the grandees staring at him studying him taking his measure they had to be wondering what is this backwoods noble like holding his own eyes on the throne helped him keep his composure it was not he saw a single seat but two there sat sharbaraz unmistakable in his gorgeous robes and crown but who was that beside him the throne room was very long abivard had advanced halfway toward the high seats when he suddenly grinned an enormous grin and felt all his nervousness fall awaydenak sat next to her husband now he looked around at the important personages who packed the throne room to see how they liked the idea of having a womanand not just any woman but his sister in the company of the king of kings if they didnt like it they didnt let on that was as he had expected no one but sharbarazs guards stood closer than about five paces from the throne the eunuch halted there like a welltrained horse abivard halted too the eunuch unobtrusively tapped him on the arm he prostrated himself before the monarch of makuran the carpet had stopped a few paces before the stone to which abivard pressed his forehead was worn smooth and shiny he wondered how many prostrations had been performed just there over the centuries he also noticed a thin tiny seam that separated the stone on which he crouched from the one just ahead and tried without any luck to figure out what it might mean rise brotherinlaw of mine and advance to receive my favor sharbaraz said abivard got to his feet and walked up to the throne the guards stood aside to let him pass but did not leave off watching him sharbaraz also rose took two steps toward him embraced him and offered him a cheek to kiss suggesting the two of them differed only slightly in rank tiny murmurs ran through the throne room as the courtiers used to reading such subtle signs drew their own conclusions denak beamed proudly i have come to mashiz in obedience to your command majesty abivard said hoping sharbaraz would give him some clue as to why he had been summoned but the king of kings merely said that is as it should be we have much to discuss you and i of great import to the realm again abivards ear caught those little ripples of whispering this time he thought with an excited undertone to them the assembled grandees knew what sharbaraz was talking about even if abivard didnt but he thought proudly the king of kings wanted to confer with him not with them after that formal greeting sharbaraz gave him back into the keeping of the eunuch who led him into a little chamber of such perfect elegance that he guessed it had to be a waiting room for the king of kings a servant brought in roasted pistachios little cakes savory with almond paste and a wine sweet as honey smooth as silk and warming as the sun on a fine spring day abivard refreshed himself then piled some cushions high and leaned back against them to await his sovereign sure enough sharbaraz came in after a little while denak a pace behind him when abivard rose and began another prostration sharbaraz waved him to a halt youve finished the ceremony he said now we do business may i see my niece first majesty abivard asked ill go fetch her denak said and hurried away i have someone else i want you to meet but ill introduce him to you presently sharbaraz said he took a pistachio cracked the thin shell between thumb and forefinger and popped the nut into his mouth denak came back she pressed a tiny bundle into abivards arms and smiled when he automatically held the baby so as to support her head thats right you have a son of your own she said as if reminding herself was that jealousy in her voice maybe a little he judged she went on hard to remember im an aunt just as youre an uncle shes a pretty baby he said looking down at jarireh not only was she pretty she was for the moment being quiet that as he had learned was a virtue of considerable magnitude im trying to decide which of you she favors she looks like a baby denak said as if that explained everything sharbaraz impatiently shifted from foot to foot i thought you were eager to hear why i summoned you across the length and breadth of the realm i am majesty its only abivard held up jarireh may i use your daughter as my excuse youd have trouble finding a better one sharbaraz said with a laugh but hear me all the same likinios avtokrator is dead ice ran through abivard how did it happen he whispered are you on decent terms with hosios his son or does the war begin now hosios is dead too as tanshar foretold sharbaraz said abivard could only gape at the king of kings who went on hear the tale as it came to me with the beginning of spring you know likinios avtokrator was a pinchpenny we saw that when we were in serrhes and you know also that the empire of videssos was at war with the nomads of kubrat up north and east of videssos the city abivard held his niece out to the king of kings to show how confused he was what you say is true majesty but what has one of these things to do with the other as it turns out everything sharbaraz answered likinios won a string of victories against the kubratoi last year and hoped to ruin them for good and all maybe even conquer them altogether he didnt care to pull his army back into his own country and have to start over again this spring so he ordered them to winter north of the istros river out on the edge of the steppe and to support themselves by foraging that way he wouldnt have to pay for feeding them through the winter you see he was already behind with their silver no i take it back videssians payor in his case dont payin gold by the god abivard said softly he tried to imagine a makuraner army ordered to winter north of the degird troops would to put it mildly not be happy about that he had to ask the next question what happened then just what youd expect sharbaraz answered i can see that in your eyes aye they mutinied killed a couple of generals not the maniakai i hope abivard exclaimed and then remembered whom he had interrupted forgive me majesty its all right the king of kings said this news is enough to make anyone jumpy no the maniakai father and son had nothing to do with it when they got back to videssos likinios named the elder one governor of some island on the edge of nowhere and sent the younger there too to command the garrison it was supposed to be a reward for a job well done but i think the avtokrator was just putting someone who might be a rival out of the way now where was i with the main story the mutiny abivard and denak said together ah thats right likinios army rebelled as i say killed some highranking officers and named a fellow called genesios as avtokrator the god only knows why he was nothing more than a cavalry captain a commander of a hundred but they made some red boots put em on him and marched for videssos the city with that kind of leader against him youd think likinios would have won easily abivard said if they fought wars on parchment youd be right sharbaraz said but as soon as likinios had a rival any sort of rival everyone stopped paying attention to him this wasnt the first time hed fallen behind with soldiers pay and everybody just got sick of him he ordered troops out against genesios they left videssos the city sure enough but then they went over to the rebel that city could stand siege forever i think but the men at the gates opened them for genesios soldiers likinios should have fled abivard said he must have known youd have received him well here just for what he did for us in serrhes none of the sailors would take him and his sons across the little strait to the westlands sharbaraz said the words tolled like doom through the little private chamber abivard picked up a pistachio then put it back in its silver bowlhe had lost his appetite the king of kings went on in the end he tried to get across in a boat he and his sons would row themselves too late genesios men were already in the city they caught him and killed him and hosios as you already told me abivard said they did worse than that denak said she had heard this tale of horror before they slew each of likinios sons before his eyes hosios his eldest last of all and then they slew likinios too a little bit at a time she shuddered filthy maybe because she had just had a baby herself she seemed to find the idea of slaying anyones child particularly in front of him especially dreadful and that is how genesios avtokrator took the throne in videssos sharbaraz said part of it ive pieced together through the tales of travelers and merchants and the rest from the embassy genesios sent me to announce his accession as avtokrator of the videssians once hed murdered his way into the palace he decided he would start observing the forms you see what did you tell the envoys abivard asked i told them to leave the realm and be thankful i didnt clap them into the dungeons under the palace here sharbaraz answered i said i would not treat with men who served a ruler who had murdered my benefactor his eyes flashed thinking of likinios terrible end infuriated him but he shook his head before going on i might have served my purpose better if id kept my temper and given them a soft answer as things stand genesios knows i am his foe and can prepare accordingly do the videssians all recognize him as avtokrator sharbaraz shook his head again videssos writhes like a snake with a broken back seethes like a soup pot left too long over the fire some in the empire support the usurper some proclaim they are still loyal to the house of likinios even though that house has been destroyed to the foundations and ive heard rumors that another general or maybe other generals have proclaimed themselves avtokrator in opposition to genesios he rubbed his hands together it is indeed a lovely mess aye it is abivard breathed we had our civil war over these past years now its the videssians turn and from what you say they have the disease worse than we did what will you do majesty let them stew in their own juice this year i think unless they fall altogether to pieces sharbaraz replied but i will take back all the stretch of vaspurakan likinios made me cede to him and i will do it in the name of avenging him he rubbed his hands again plainly savoring the irony there his voice turned dreamy but i want more than that much more and i have a key to open the lock ill show it to you he hurried out of the chamber what does he mean abivard asked denak she smiled i know but i wont tell you not when youll see in a moment that would spoil the surprise the king of kings returned then in the company of a young man gorgeous in videssian imperial robes and shod with scarlet boots he had a videssian cast of feature too narrow and more delicate through the lower part of the face than most makuraners to abivard he said it is good to see you again eminent sir he spoke with a strong videssian accent forgive me sir but i do not believe weve met abivard told him then he turned to the king of kings majesty who is this fellow ive never set eyes on him in my life what sharbaraz played startled confusion too melodramatically to be quite convincing can you tell me youve been so quick to forget the face of hosios son of likinios legitimate avtokrator of the videssians hes not hosios abivard blurted ive seen hosios and talked with him i know what he looks like and he his voice trailed away he stared from sharbaraz to the man who was not hosios and back again i know what hosios looks like and you majesty you know what hosios looks like but how many videssians really know what hosios looks like you see my thought perfectly sharbaraz said in a tone of voice that suggested anything less would have disappointed him as our armies move into videssos how better than if we come to restore the murdered rightful avtokrators son and heir if the god grant that we reach videssos the city than to install hosios here he spoke the name with a perfectly straight face in the imperial palace there no better way abivard said he looked over to the fellow in the videssian imperial costume who are you really the man glanced nervously at sharbaraz eminent sir i am only and have always been hosios son of likinios if i am not he who that walks the earth is abivard thought it over then slowly nodded when you put it that way i suppose no one has a better claim to the name than you do just so with justice sharbaraz sounded proud of his own cleverness here well have the king of kings and the avtokrator leagued together against the vile usurper just as we did against smerdis how can anyone hope to stand against us i see no way abivard said loyally he knew though that ways he did not see might exist that was why you went to war to find out how well the plans you had made meshed with the real world he let his eyes slip to hosios once more whoever he wasmost likely a trader who happened to have been in mashiz when sharbaraz learned of likinios murder or perhaps a renegade videssian soldierhe had to be anxious though he hid it fairly well he was disposable and was a fool to boot if he didnt know it the first time he made sharbaraz unhappy with him he was only too likely to suffer a tragic accident or maybe he would just disappear and someone else styled hosios would end up wearing the imperial raiment sharbaraz said we understand each other well hosios and i thats as it should be majesty abivard said he glanced at the man who was now the only hosios there was taking videssos the city would be splendid no king of kings had ever done it not in all the years of warfare between makuran and the empire of videssos but if sharbaraz succeeded in capturing the imperial capital and put hosios here on the throne how long before the fellow forgot he was a puppet and remembered he was a videssian not long enough was abivards guess it was a pleasure to renew my acquaintance with the eminent sir majesty but now hosios paused i know you have urgent business of your own sharbaraz said again without obvious irony i shant keep you here any longer hosios bowed to him as equal to equal though that rang as false as the king of kings ostentatious politeness toward him the pretender nodded to abivard one sovereign to anothers close companion then left the small private chamber sharbaraz poured himself another cup of wine and looked a question to abivard who nodded sharbaraz poured one for him too and one for denak abivard raised his cupnot plain clay as it would have been back at vek rud stronghold but milky alabaster bored out so thin he could see the wine through it i salute you majesty he said i cant think of a better way for us to take vengeance on videssos he drank so did sharbaraz and denak the king of kings said and do you know what the best of it is brotherinlaw of mine not only are the videssians themselves up in arms against this genesios but from the word that filters through vaspurakan and across the wasteland the man would make the late unlamented smerdis seem a paragon of statesmanship beside him have a care there abivard said you almost made me choke on my wine how could anyone make smerdis look like a statesman genesios manages or so its said sharbaraz answered smerdis had some notion of keeping his enemies quiet the tribute he paid to the khamorth for instance the only thing genesios seems to know how to do is murder killing likinios and his sons made sense enough not the way he did it denak broke in that was brutal and cruel by all accounts genesios is brutal and cruel sharbaraz said and terror the only tool he turns to in ruling hes meted out torture blindings and mutilation to all of likinios cronies he could catch and each new tale that comes in is more revolting than the last part of that may spring from the nature of tales but when you smell something bad youre probably riding past a dung heap thoughtfully abivard said hell frighten some folk into following him with ways like those but most of them will be men who would have favored him anyway he wont cow the ones he really aims to terrify the ones with true spirit theyll just hate him more than they do already just so sharbaraz agreed the more he tries to break their spirits the more theyll do battle against him but he holds videssos the city and if ever there was one its videssos nalgis crag all but impossible to take without treachery his grin was quite broad our best course i think is to let it be known we have hosios here wait while videssos falls farther into chaosand by all appearances it willand then move in if genesios is as bad as latest rumors paint him we truly will be welcomed as liberators isnt that a lovely thought abivard said dreamily you said the two maniakai were sent off to some distant island aye likinios did that not genesios sharbaraz said either way its just as well theyll be safe off at the edge of the world where genesios eye cant fall on them theyre good men the father and the son and they did quite a lot for us i dont want to see them come to harm no sharbaraz said id send up a loud long prayer of thanks to the god and the prophets four if i heard genesios had ordered both their heads to go up on the milestone in videssos the city theyd be in good company by all accounts the milestones supposed to be a crowded place these days majesty abivard said as reproachfully as one could speak to the king of kings denak nodded agreeing with her brother rather than her husband sharbaraz refused to apologize i meant what i said brotherinlaw of mine you said the maniakai were good men and you were right but thats not the pointno it is but only a small part of it the true rub is that the father and son are both of them able men the more like that genesios murders the weaker videssos will be when we move against her abivard pondered his sovereigns words at last he bowed spoken like a king of kings sharbaraz preened ever so slightly but abivard hadnt altogether meant it as a compliment a king of kings had to do things for reasons of state and to look at them from his realms viewpoint rather than his own thus far well and good when you began to forget your viewpoint as a man though and were willing even eager to celebrate the deaths of loyal friends you became something rather frightening that to abivards way of thinking was different from and much worse than recognizing that those deaths would be to your advantage while mourning them nonetheless he opened his mouth to try to explain that to sharbaraz then shut it again with the words unspoken as he had discovered what even a brotherinlaw could tell the king of kings had limits the office sharbaraz held the robes he wore worked toward stifling criticism of any sort oh abivards head wouldnt answer for such an indiscretion sharbaraz would even listen politelyhe owed abivard that much and did not think him a potential enemy or abivard hoped he didnt at any rate but while he would listen he would not hear sharbaraz said your brother or his designee will be running vek rud domain for some time to come brotherinlaw of mine ill want you here at my right hand readying our forces for the move against videssos well begin next year i expect and not just as raiders what i take i intend to keep may it be so majesty abivard said i think ill have to write to frada to give him leave to appoint a designee and join the campaign himself otherwise my guess is that hed appoint one without my leave and come just the same hes missed two chances already he wont stand it a third time sometimes you need to know when to yield a point sharbaraz said though the only time he had yielded so far as abivard knew was when smerdis minions held a knife to his throat abivard shook his head no the king of kings had also given in when likinios demanded territory in exchange for aid in the face of necessity that dire he could retreat a good point denak said and abivard remembered that sharbaraz had also yielded to her in a variety of ways from letting her accompany him on campaign to allowing her to show herself in public here in the palace no he had done more than merely allow that he had adjusted court ceremonial to accommodate it abivard revised his previous opinionsharbaraz could make concessions after all turning to his sister abivard asked how does it feel living in the palace here at the capital instead of back at our domain she considered that with almost the care roshnani might have given it before answering there are good things here i could never have had in the stronghold she glanced down at the sleeping jarirehremembering kishmar and onnophre abivard knew denak could have had a baby in the womens quarters but he kept quietthen over to sharbaraz the king of kings smiled as his eyes met hers the two of them seemed well enough content with each other denak went on but at times its harder here i often feel very much a stranger which of course would never have happened back home some of the women in the womens quarters openly resent me for being principal wife when my bloods not of the highest ive told them theyd better not sharbaraz said sharply when theyve rendered a hundredth part of the service you have then they may begin to complain oh i dont much mind that denak said if i were in their slippers i should probably resent me too the ones who frighten me though are those who spread on sweetness as if it were mutton fat on a chunk of pocket bread when in their eyes i see them wishing id tread on a viper youd not see that sort of dissembling back at vek rud stronghold no abivard said you were already at nalgis crag when ardini tried to bespell me but you must have heard about it when you came home again thats true i did denak said in a small voice id forgotten she laughed perhaps in embarrassment perhaps nervously memory always makes the things youve left behind seem better than they really were doesnt it sometimes it can make bad things seem better than they were sharbaraz said then its a blessing from the god and other times when you sit and brood denak didnt go on she shook her head angry at herself i try to forget i truly do but sometimes things swim up all unbidden it doesnt happen as often now as it did before good sharbaraz said if the god is kind we have many years ahead of us in this world before the time your span is done my principal wife i pray your troubles will have vanished altogether from your mind may it be so denak said abivard echoed her sharbaraz turned to him now you know part of why i summoned you here as i told you ill want you to stay in mashiz you showed in the battles of the past two years that youre fit to be one of my great captains youve hoped to lead an army against videssos now that hope comes true abivard bowed majesty you could do me no greater honor sharbaraz laughed thats not honor brotherinlaw of mine thats because i need you the other part of the reason i ordered you here to mashiz was to do you honor i shall lay on a great feast tonight and summon courtiers and soldiers to see what sort of man has a sister fit for the king of kings now abivard laughed nervously one with a northwestern accent and rustic ways one from the lesser nobility rather than the seven clans one who makes too little of himself sharbaraz interrupted remember the purpose of the feast is to honor you and i delight in doing so everyone there no matter how high his blood will be hoping you offer him a cheek to kiss and for all of them the choice will be yours the prospect is dizzying majesty abivard said that grandees from all over makuran will be noting what i do what i say almost i wouldnt mind going back to obscurity just for the sake of escaping that if you hadnt said almost i would be angry with you sharbaraz answered i know you traveled here quickly i know youre worn and i know youll want to be properly decked out to meet the court clothes are armor of a sort sleep for a bit if you care to when you wake or when we wake you well see to it that youre properly bathed and groomed and dressed sharbaraz and denak left the little room abivard stretched out among the pillows on the floor and did fall asleep a eunuch presently woke him and led him to a steaming chamber where he soaked in deliciously warm water then rubbed scented oil on himself and scraped it off with a strigil videssianstyle a barber curled his hair and beard with hot irons then waxed the tip of that beard and his mustachios to disciplined stiffness he had to admire the image he made in a polished bronze mirror the barber handed him the caftan the eunuch brought him was of saffron silk shot through with silver threads he knew it must have come from the closet of the king of kings and tried to protest but the eunuch was gently implacable along with the caftan came a bucketshaped pilos also covered in saffron silk for abivards head and a pair of sandals with heavy silver buckles the sandals fit perfectly which impressed him all over again for his feet were smaller than sharbarazs when he was properly turned out the eunuch conducted him to the dining hall he hoped a servitor would conduct him back when the feast was done he had doubts about finding his way around the immense palace without help a man with a big deep voice called out his name when he entered the dining hall immediately he found himself under siege for the courtiers and generals of makuran converged on him to introduce themselves to put forward their schemes and to take his measure from what they said every word that fell from his lips was a perfect pearl of wisdom until that evening he had thought he knew what flattery meant listening to such fulsome praise was seductive like having a sloeeyed dancer sway before you while the tambours and pandouras poured forth a passionate tune but just as the dancer might take you to bed more in hope of a gold bracelet than for yourself so the courtiers fulsome words were also plainly selfseeking at last abivard said gentlemen were i as wise as you make me out to be which for a mortal man not of the four seems scarcely possible would i not see that you are interested in me as brotherinlaw to sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase rather than as abivard son of godarz who otherwise would scarcely draw your notice that produced a sudden thoughtful silence the crush around him drew back a little he hoped he hadnt offended the grandees of makuranbut if he had he would bear up under it sharbaraz came in just then with denak on his arm the arrival of the king of kings cast all lesser luminaries abivard included into the shade the eunuchs presently began moving people to their proper places abivard was surprised to note that a couple of men had like sharbaraz brought their wives with them to the feast there as in other matters the royal pleasure counted for a great deal abivard took his place at sharbarazs right hand servitors fetched in wine a sherbet of quinces and lemon juice and another of rhubarb sweetened with honey for the opening toast everyone filled his cup with wine sharbaraz proclaimed let us drink to abivard whom the king of kings delights to honor in return abivard rose and said let us drink to the king of kings to the makuran he rules and to vengeance for likinios avtokrator a storm of applause washed over him hosios who sat at the same table clapped loud and long abivard wondered if his ambitions were for sharbaraz and makuran or for himself then the waiters brought in tureens of soup and abivard stopped worrying about anything but his appetite the soup was a simple oneyogurt thinned with water finely chopped cucumber and ground onions with raisins sprinkled over the top salt was the only spice abivard could taste a peasant might have served the dishs like of its kind though it was as good as any abivard had ever had after the soup came bowls of buttered rice topped with slices of mutton spiced with cloves cinnamon cardamom and ground rosebuds more yogurt and raw eggs accompanied the dish abivard spooned yogurt into his bowl then broke two raw eggs and stirred them into the rice too he didnt remember eating raw eggs in videssos and glanced over at hosios the man who would take the place of likinios murdered son mixed eggs into his rice without a qualm abivard caught his eye and said you have a taste for makuraner food i see so i do eminent sir hosios answered ive eaten it a great many times and find it tasty maybe he had been a merchant then and in the habit of going back and forth between videssos and makuran the servants cleared away the bowls after the feasters had emptied them this time they set plates before the grandees gleaming copper for those tables farthest from the king of kings silver for those closer and gold for his table abivard stared at his platter with such wealth as this at his command smerdis had chosen to squeeze his nobles to find money to pay the khamorth truly the man had been a fool on the plates the servitors set pieces of braised duck cooked in a sweetandsour sauce of onions fired in sesame oil pomegranate syrup lemon juice honey pepper and pistachios ground to powder more pistachios these chopped coarsely were sprinkled over the duck abivard worried meat from the bones with knife and fingers then dipped his hands into a bowl of rosescented water and dried them on a square of pure white linen talk and wine and sherbets occupied the meal by the time he got down the last bite of fatrich duck abivard was convinced as he had been on the day he returned to vek rud stronghold he would never need to eat again he had been wrong then he supposed he might be wrong now he soon found he was from the kitchen came goblets filled with a compote of melon balls and peach slices in a syrup of honey lime juice and rose water as a special treat they were topped with snow brought down from the peaks of the dilbat mountains abivard got to his feet behold the power of the king of kings who brings snow to mashiz in summer he called again the nobles cheeredthis time he reckoned for him and sharbaraz both sharbaraz beamed abivard sat quickly down to enjoy the wonder not all the power of the king of kings could long keep snow from melting here at this season the snow glittered in the light of lamps and torches that gleam called to mind tanshars last prophecy a silver shield shining across a narrow sea the sea abivard was suddenly certain would be the strip of salt water that separated the videssian westlands from videssos the city the great imperial capital but who would make the shield shine and why abivard dug his spoon into the compote when sharbaraz moved against videssos he would find out
