offering but nothing about his meeting with the warlike auldek goes as planned the arrival of the numrek throws the meeting into chaos during it sire neen is decapitated both dariel and rialus are captured but by different factions dariel becomes a prisoner of the resistance movement of quota slaves the free people he is treated harshly for a time reviled for being a prince of the family that established the mist and slave trade despite this he becomes fascinated by his captors mor the beautiful angry leader of the group skylene her lover and tunnel a hulk of a man made more impressive because his skin is tattooed gray and he sports golden tusks in his jaw many of the quota slaves have had extreme alterations made to their bodiestattoos piercings implantsto make them look like the totem animal deities of their auldek masters tunnel and skylene gradually tell him more and more about life in ushen brae rialus was captured by the auldek to his surprise calrach comes to his cell and explains that it was not just the league that had treacherous plots at work the numrek had their own reasons for coming to ushen brae they are an individual clan of the auldek people one of several but they had been exiled years before for violating auldek taboos it was this banishment that took them into the far north from where they eventually found their way down over the pole and into the known world the years they spent in service to hanish and later to corinn were a continuation of that punishment now calrach has returned to his native land with news he believes will regain his clans status among the auldek calrach explains to rialus the same crucial information that dariel learns from the free people the lothan aklun had a device called the soul catcher that could remove the souls of quota children and implant them inside auldek hosts they stored them in their bodies making them effectively immortal but also infertile they need quota slaves for their souls for labor and to be able to watch the natural cycle of life that they are no longer part of the numrek however found that on arriving in the known world they regained their fertility as calrachs son allek proves just by existing calrach returned to ushen brae to convince the auldek to march to the known world via the northern route and make war they can have new lands new children and new lives in the known world the auldek force rialus to tell them everything about the known world and he becomes a personal source of information for the head chieftain of the auldek the everconfident devoth dariel convinced that he can do something to right the wrongs of the quota trade offers to help the resistance they eventually give him a mission they have found a soul shipone powered by trapped soulsthat they do not want the league to get its hands on they ask dariel to pilot the ship to a remote place and destroy it he jumps at the opportunity he even lets mor tattoo his face so that he looks like a quota slave the vessel proves to be fast maneuverable and absolutely unlike anything dariel has ever seen as he races away in it he discovers that the league has occupied the island of lithram len on which the soul catcher is housed if they find the device and learn how to use it they could make themselves immortal dariel does not let this happen like the brigand he used to be he steals explosive pitch from the docks and uses it to blow up the soul catcher a little later after destroying the soul vessel and freeing the spirits captive in it dariel meets up with mor she offers him leave to go as thanks for his deeds or says that she could take him into the interior of ushen brae to meet the elders of the free people following mor he sets off into the wild expanse that is ushen brae back on

eggsinformation she got from her clever spy delivegushe sings sorcery into the unborn creatures charging them to grow into great monsters for her and then she summons a spirit from the dead her older brother aliver akaran is back in the story chapter one corinn akaran stepped into the brilliant morning light she walked across the deck of her transport ship descended the plank to the teh docks and strode through the military officials awaiting her as if all of it were one continuous movement the menincluding melio sharratt and general andeson marah and elite officersparted around her stunned even though they had stood in preparation for greeting her since the dawn for a moment the group did nothing but stare the queen wore armor that melded influences from the empires provinces chain mail covered her arms it was thin and light but made of fine links of steel cuffed at the wrists with a hint of senivalian style a meinish thalba wrapped her torso snug against the contours of her hips and breasts her skirt also of chain mail was as short as any talayan runners leather straps wrapped over her legs completely covering them in a second skin that was tight around the calf loose around the knee and tight again around the upper thighs over all this she wore a light acacian cape that flapped around her as she moved baddel the talayan who had jockeyed to be the first to address her on his homelands soil welcomed her with a barrage of enthusiastic praise he poured forth condolences for the injury done to prince aaden numrek treachery knows no bounds i still cant for a moment he got no further the queens elite guards swept down in her wake jolting the advisers into motion they scurried to keep up with her all except melio sharratt who seemed at ease and said as she passed your majesty ive never seen you dressed in armor were at war corinn said in this im the same as any in the known world general andeson tell me by which she meant update her on the most recent intelligence the general did the first wave of marah had swept in upon the numreks seaside villas catching them at least somewhat unawares theyd fought among the rambling estates across the beaches and piers and gardens in which the numrek had lived in sundrenched splendor soon they had the coastline blockaded corps of the elite pushed inland as the numrek retreated we pressed them back into the hillside fortress the locals call the thumb the general said its an ancient structure wed thought nothing of it but the numrek must have reinforced the walls and stocked it with supplies theyve had time to prepare their treachery weve offered battle daily but they no longer engage theyve suddenly gone coward a younger officer said no theyre toying with us melio said they send their children onto the battlements to float paper birds on the air theyre clever with such things andesons sideways glance at him was disapproving melio shrugged and mouthed what its true its become something of a waiting game andeson said the fortress is built atop a butte there is but a single track that wraps its way up around it too narrow and unprotected to march an army up weve lobbed stones and explosives at them but theyre well dug in there are tunnels deep within the butte accessed only from inside it theres a water source in there somewhere as well it may be a matter of starving them to death an unheroic strategy corinn said i would choose honorable battle every time your majesty but at times ones foes make that impossible these numrek are vile they massacred their own servants you know built a wall of their bodies at the base of the thumb if you had seen im sure our soldiers have performed well corinn interrupted and i have every faith in your leadership ive arrived now ill finish this they progressed out of the docks through a makeshift storage area in the dusty open space beyond the teh coast was somewhat wetter than most of talay but this late in the season the grasses that covered the hills to the north were bleached golden by the sun corinn was glad to have arranged for horses ahead of time the mounts awaited them held by talayan youths who looked nervous about their unaccustomed work queen corinn melio said anything new from mena not since she sent a bird from luana i expect to hear from her again soon ride with me melio when the numrek have been dealt with i have an assignment for you well discuss it as we ride melio bowed his head and they stood as the squire attending corinns horse tried to swing it around into position for her theres a rumor among the soldiers melio said it came across on the last few transports about aliver a rumor have andeson and the other generals heard this rumor im closer to the troops than they thats where i heard it but the rumor is trickling up it cant possibly be true though right between you and me yes melios face lit up all his disparate features aligned in a manner that was surprisingly handsome truly where is he corinn stepped on the stool that had been set down for her preparing to swing onto the horse she said he is safe in the palace he needs seclusion just now he remains fragile best not to fan the rumors yet t he night ten days earlier that she had worked her spell had been long and beyond exhausting she was drained already what with the sorcery she had worked on barad and the song she had sung to elyas children she could have dropped into slumber before she even began her third spell but she needed someone to help her carry the burden of rule she needed her brother as soon as his body became fully corporeal he slumped forward he would have fallen had she not sprung up and guided him onto her bed for a time she stared at the wonder of him he was really there solid warm to the touch breathing he was naked but she thought nothing of that his eyes moved beneath his lids in dream what does a man dream after returning from death what was death anyway was it not the conqueror of all no it wasnt for she had just denied it at least one victim she had so many questions but even as they formed her mind went sluggish she knew that he would slumber long and so she left aliver and collapsed on a divan in an adjoining room rhrenna and two maids woke her two days later rhrenna would not have disturbed her even then she explained save he is awake and asking for you with those words corinn sprang up and rushed back to the other room aliver akaran stood on the balcony his knuckles white gripping the stone balustrade his jaw loose with astonishment he wore a morning robe tied at the waist rhrenna must have ordered it brought for him corinn turned to figure out what fascinated her brother so the sky above was the color and texture of a blue eggshell the morning sun just free of the horizon was cut in half by one long sliver of pink cloud a flock of black neck divers folded their wings one after another and plummeted like darts exploding into the water of the harbor in a feeding frenzy thin lines of smoke rose like flower stems from the lower town it could have been any of these things aliver set his gaze on her his eyes were a darker brown than she remembered his skin was no longer as pale as it had been the first night it was a richer color tanned to a light brown now that she saw him clearly she realized she had combined his features with hanishs when she had pictured him he was older than when she knew him last immeasurably older though he gave that impression not so much in the details of his features as in the distance of the consciousness behind them he said id forgotten so much i as well corinn answered you were a girl he said corinn shook her head i never was aliver tested an expression on his face disappointment or confusion disapproval some combination of these that his features could not spell out yet i am sure you were corinn brushed her hand down the curls of hair near his temple wrapped her palm around the back of his head she pulled him close and touched their foreheads together something her father used to do with her i remember a smaller version of myself but not a girl no girl should be as afraid as i was you still are drawing back she shook her head no i have to explain many things to you in the few days before she left for the teh coast corinn tried to convey as much as possible to him the world had not paused outside the palace to grant her a respite it felt necessary that she have him to herself that she bind him to the truth as she knew it she ordered rhrenna and the two maids to complete silence about alivers return she had her quarters emptied of other staff and servants stationed guards only outside her chambers she wanted to be alone with her brother she did not even try to find a reasoned approach to what she told him she just spoke she offered what information came to her circling back to give context jumping forward to the present and then realizing by the look of glazed distance on his features that she had lost him his eyes sometimes went as stonedead as barads vacant sightless and yet staring each time she stopped and breathed and began again she reminded him who he was she assured him that it was urgent that he return to life and complete the work he had left unfinished not only that there were new complications and threats and she needed someone she could trust completely at her side aliver moved about the rooms restless studying things lifting objects and turning them in his hands she walked following his lead as he explored the gardens touching plants and watching birds and stopping to marvel at thingsthe pressure of the wind when it blew the heat of the sun on his skin the colors in the terrace tiles corinn sometimes thought he had forgotten her but if she stopped speaking he shifted his attention to her they ate together as often as corinn could manage simple meals at first without the sweet and sour spices common to acacian cuisine watching him dip flatbread into olive oil corinn almost thought herself a new mother again he shoved the bread into his mouth and worked his jaw so focused on it that he ignored the oil dripping down his chin he ate as a child does the food had his attention completely she could not stay hidden in her rooms all day there was no end to the work of the empire she had to meet with advisers and senators emissaries still sailed in from around the known world both to offer condolences for the numrek betrayal and to ask if the news of a pending invasion should be credited she told them it could it was real she allowed no doubt about it even though in other meetings she drilled sire dagon as if she did not believe trying to rip more information out of him the world was in turmoil and she alone had the responsibility of calming it good then that she did not feel as overpowered by it as she had before bringing aliver back in some ways things had quieted he had a long way to go before he could emerge as the symbol of her power that she hoped he would but for the time being it was good just being with him he made her think of her father he even made her feel closer to mena and dariel she wished they were here to see what she had done how pleased dariel would be mena too alivers return would make up for all the strife that had tainted their relationships they would start anew f or two days the numrek in the thumb did not answer the messages corinn sent them it was only after she had stood in clear sight of the buttetop fortress and shouted up to them herself that they believed she had come to speak with them with the chieftain calrach gone to the other lands and with greduc and codeth slain on that bloody day in the carmelia corinn had not been entirely sure with whom she would parlay gathered within the shade of a gently billowing linen tent she learned that crannag a relation of calrachs now held power he was older than the chieftain more a warrior than a statesman good that suited her crannag sat alone he set his hands on his knees tossed his black hair and grinned this man had once stood at the door of her quarters of aadens now she could barely recognize the guard he had been in the smug lines of his face all right queen im here he held up his strong arms and made a show of searching his torso for weapons he was shirtless the muscles of his chest sectioned and defined he was some thirty paces away so he had to project his voice what do you want of me i want you to die corinn said crannag guffawed you could have that your marah there ah together me with no weapons them fully armed i think they might have me if they wanted of course i might just be able to get a hand around your neck first he reached out pretending to suffer body blows as he grasped for her the pantomime was too much for him he bent forward around his laughter its not just you that i want to die corinn said i want all numrek to pay for your treachery crannags leatherbrown face went grave you want me to go back in there and get my people to come out and be slaughtered we have other things planned now a long plan queen you didnt know numrek have patience did you you always thought us grumpy grumpy numreks ah he snapped his fingers and his eyes rolled up as he searched for the right word then found it taciturn you like that you thought us taciturn you thought we had nothing better to do than stand by your door as you slept and ate and thought yourself the queen of the world its a tiny piece of turd island but its the center of the world crannag leaned back in his seat it was but a campstool with a slim backrest but he managed to lounge in it we were acting queen just acting waiting you promised us that you would help us return to ushen brae you never meant to keep that promise you lied now you pay for it he drew phlegm from his throat and spat toward corinn considering the distance between them the spittle landed surprisingly close to her feet she felt her marah tense someone drew his sword a few inches from its scabbard you came for nothing we wont fight we can wait therehe pointed up toward the plug of stone that rose out of the rolling landscape behind himfor as long as we need when the auldek come we will greet them as cousins and brothers and we will show them the bounty weve found for them you dont know that the auldek will come for all you know they still scorn you you know nothing crannag rose and his shoulder swiped at the air as he turned away almost like a blow i know this corinn said you are a coward crannag trudged away he waved one arm dismissing her accusation as if it were an insect the numrek hiding in that fortress are quivering corinn continued she stood and began to follow him her guards jumped to keep pace with her your men are dogs no braver than your children your women are whipped bitches i will tell the world this is so news of it will fly on every bird to every province the known world will scorn you and if the auldek ever arrive they will learn of your cowardice i would not wish to be you she spat toward him not after i tell the world that i came here and offered you battle on these terms an equal number of my force to fight yours equal numbers crannag one acacian for every numrek no more the warrior paused but did not turn back to face her how will you explain that she stood in the full sun now the shade tent flapped behind her with a sudden gust of air she waited a moment longer then added more lightly knowing that crannag would turn to make sure he heard her correctly i will be one of them i will take to the field myself a few days earlier on the evening before she was to leave for teh corinn had been occupied with affairs of state all day she did not join aliver until after her late meetings she found him to her surprise standing inside the door that would have led him out into the upper courtyard into the view of the guards and general palace staff what are you doing he blinked rapidly for a moment i want to see my quarters my own rooms with my things i should see them i should stay in them you will corinn gently turned him and led him away from the door back into her own chambers dont rush though you have everything you need here stay here until i return from my trip your trip why are you going what trip is it having gotten aliver seated in a side parlor corinn lowered herself to the plush chair opposite she relaxed into it truly fatigued knowing that she should rest in preparation for the morrow a small fire burned in the hearth and she commented on the warmth of the room and the early chill in the air tonight aliver watched the fire but not with the curiosity he had shown during the first few days he was changing already the world did not amaze him as it had before he was more at ease in his body quicker with words in the new clothes rhrenna had brought for him he looked very much a prince at times his eyes still glazed over but just as often he snapped out of it with a shake of his head there are things i dont understand aliver said corinn bent her head forward as she unwrapped the lace shawl from around her neck you have to relearn the world it cant happen overnight im already forgetting death good aliver good life is what matters even in death spirits told you of the living thats what you said to me the first night we talked i thought that but it doesnt seem the way it was anymore when i was dead i was not a self i was not a single mind i was spread thinly across the world i was part of everything like a very fine dust that gets into everything aliver no longer had difficulty controlling his facial expressions he frowned and corinn did not question whether he meant to or not when i was like that the lives of humans did not register as of much import i cared about the tree of akaran about as much as a stone on the path in the gardens outside does but you said you knew things that had happened after your death i learned those things in the moments you were pulling me together i did know things i do but they didnt have meaning until i was becoming aliver again a piper announced the midnight hour then both siblings cocked their heads to listen as the tune passed from the palace down toward the lower town a delicate cascade of sound it reminded corinn of her fatigue i wish that we could stay locked away for days upon days i would tell you everything absolutely everything id have you understand me completely so that you saw the world with my eyes the rapidity with which his gaze snapped back to her caused her to pause i prefer my own eyes aliver said i mean only that i will help you until you can see fully on your own the world has changed aliver as ive been explaining he shook his head no you havent what do you mean you told me you needed me that i am here to help you you are corinn said but youre not telling the things that matter youre going away tomorrow but you havent told me why for a moment corinn was speechless she stood up and moved behind her chair running her hands over the backrest and then gripping it of course i did alivers mouth puckered into a sour expression corinn remembered from years ago he said no you didnt you brought me back from the dead but you havent even explained how you havent spoken of mena or dariel from your lipsnothing about them thats not true she must have they spoke for hours what else was more important you talk and talk but you tell me nothing you havent even told me of your son to that she had no response it was an impossible statement she thought of aaden always she visited him several times each day she whispered to him all about alivers return she had come back to aliver and i told him nothing of my son she thought why it took all her concentration to nod and say aliver i have a son his name is aaden he is your nephew he is to be heir he will be the greatest akaran monarch yet there thats what i meant to tell him i would like to meet him you will he is not well right now though when i return from teh just rest here until then when i return youll meet aaden and see the rest of the palace youll see others and talk to them well send a bird to mena and well talk about dariel too aliver eyed her you are going to confront the numrek in teh yes what are you going to do what i must she said what they brought upon themselves you cant kill them all what do you know of it corinn retorted you know so little of whats happened let me explain it to you but give me time as you have made such good use of the time weve had so far corinn rubbed the plush arms of her chair she watched the way the passage of her hand changed the look of the velvet from light to dark dark to light i dont like this side of you which side is that the one that thinks the one that blunders through the world with noble ideals based on nothing look at the fact that you died and i did not that you failed and i did not if thats what you believe you should have left me with the dust youve made a mistake was that a note of threat corinn wondered it was wasnt it back among the living so briefly and already we are at odds if they fought here now what battles lay ahead he would be a thorn in her side instead of an ally she knew then that she had made a mistake a small error one that could be corrected the notes of the song swirled in her mind before she had even called for them she would have him as that ally a symbol and miracle to a world that needed symbols and miracles she would also have his obedience the song would make it so she spoke through the spell playing out in her mind when i return aliver we will start to make plans for your coronation brother and sister king and queen no marriage but a union unlike anything the world has ever known why not are we not unlike any that have come before the old laws dont apply to us we will be stronger and wiser together our strengths will bring the empire closer together than ever before can you see that aliver looked away from her unwilling to answer the song whispered through corinns lips quietly binding him binding him so that when he did answer he gave her exactly the affirmation she wished for c orinn walked at the head of a contingent of one thousand three hundred and seventeen soldiers with her included their numbers matched the remaining numrek adults men and women both all those of fighting age and some beyond it but still proud the numrek children lined the walls of the thumb watching from high above the two forces met on the field to the west of the fortress the land was arid and flat perfect for battle the sky a light cloudless blue beneath it the numrek gathered they were tall seven feet the norm among the men the women shorter perhaps but just as stoutly built their hair hung as it always had thick and black oily most wore light armor but many went bare armed and some left their chests exposed they were warriors their curved swords and battleaxes and the jagged slivers of knives at their belts attested to it corinn heard her officers conferring she turned and drew general andesons eyes it remains as i told you last night she said no weapons are to be drawn understood i will do this myself she turned back to face the enemy there was a sudden buzz of arguing behind her she knew what they were saying they thought her some fool version of aliver trying to recreate his mistake in fighting maeander mein on a field much like this one if they had their way she would be shunted to the rear of the army and encased within a wall of marah longlegged soldiers who would stand ready to lift her and sprint at the least sign of danger thats what they had said last night at leastthat her safety was paramount in truth they feared fighting the numrek without a much superior force why offer the terms she had they argued it was madness they might have balked at her order but they feared shame even morejust like the numrek they feared her though they likely half wished she would perish die and yet somehow leave them alive afterward to fight among themselves for power all this was true no matter let them watch and learn yet more of who she truly was what had she told aliver she was going to do she had said for a moment she could not remember and then it came to her she had said destroy them ill destroy them with that thought behind her she opened her mind to the song at first she kept it within the curve of her skull letting it build searching for the rhythms within the dissonance and what a cacophony it was had she not known better she would have thought the noises in her head were the tumultuous ravings of a world exploding raw emotion and anger and beauty and longing and hunger screamed in a thousand ways at once with the timbre of myriad voices and notes played on all manner of instruments at war with one another she could also hear order within the confusion she could pinch with her minds fingers the song fragments she wished each of them a living moving line of codes and runes and words all held in fluid motion along ribbons slithering through the tumult she could hold much more of it now than when she had first begun her study she found meaning more easily than even a few weeks ago before aaden nearly died and before she worked her spells upon barads eyes and elyas children and before gathering back the spirit that had been aliver yes she had much more mastery now she walked forward she parted her lips and let the first notes of the song escape her mouth barely louder than exhaled breaths the numrek accepting her commencement of the battle strode to meet her as the distance between them closed the song grew stronger and began to shift the substance of the air creating currents around her that seethed and squirmed she felt the heart of the spell gather in her chest a stone of greater and greater density her mind seethed with hatred that was what she would give them she would hurl at them a roiling animus that could take no single shape but instead erupted in everchanging forms what she saw happen on the field before her reflected this had she not owned it so completely she would have been just as shocked by the horror of it as the soldiers behind her were suddenly the stone inside her surged up out of her chest scorched through her throat and rushed from her mouth in a great torrent the numrek paused in their tracks some backstepped many fell as if shoved savagely corinn centered her gaze on crannag she knew as it happened that his face was going to blister with a heat from within that his hair was going to burst into flame and that a moment after his skull would burst the man beside him tried to flee but his legs and arms moved stiffly they folded and snapped in seconds he was on the ground writhing but incapable of action his bones fracturing with each effort another numrek stepped over him coming forward and corinn knew the moment his skin would erupt with maggots that consumed his living flesh his armor and weapons and even the sudden wig that was his hair fell to the earth along with the squirming mass that had been his body and so it was throughout the entire numrek force no two among them died the same way but each one did die a woman became a sack of flesh with nothing solid inside a man thrust his hand into his breast and pulled out his own heart some panted and contorted with unknowable tortures some blistered with poxlike scars or went yellow or gangrenous things grew inside a few protrusions and antlers that burst their skin as they screamed some danced as if they were being hacked by unseen weapons one youth ran raging his mouth red with blood an old soldier lowered himself to the ground anda single still point among the chaosfolded into himself and turned to ash through it all corinn let her body be the songs instrument it gave her what she wished and went further making it more terrible than she could have imagined at some point the stream of sound slowed slackened and then ceased altogether the silence was gorgeous even if it was not a complete silence she heard her soldiers retching at least one of the officers behind her spilled his breakfast in a splatter on the ground a few mumbled prayers or expressed disbelief and yet in the wake of the song such sounds were dwarfed by the magic that had come before homage really to the language of creation and destruction the reverence did not just come from the numrek dead not just from her trembling soldiers this silence was sung to her by the entire world all creation had been awed speechless so it seemed for the stretch of many breaths the army came up behind her realizing that her officers stood hushed and waiting corinn said send soldiers to the fortress for the children they are to live for now as our hostages the queen turned around the links of her chain mail clanking as she did so general andeson was staring at her pale faced melio stood beside him his eyes fixed on the carnage they recoiled when the stench of burning flesh and offal hit them the stink and gases of bodies turned inside out was almost too much to bear corinn breathed through her mouth she took her strength from the awe and revulsion and fear in the mens faces but these that ive eliminated here she continued burn them all reduce whats left of their corpses to ashes and have them brought back to acacia we will mix them with mortar and repave the streets of the lower town with them from now on even the humblest peasant will walk atop the remains of the numrek thus it will be for any who oppose me andesons throat caught instead of speaking he nodded corinn turned on her heel satisfied she almost reached the horses before she wavered stumbled then fell chapter two the scav met princess mena akaran on a desolate stretch of beach littered with whale bones and dotted with chunks of translucent sea ice he stood shirtless despite a frigid wind his scrawny chest exposed and his small dense muscles pronounced beneath a thin membrane of whiteblue skin his flaxen hair hung limp and matted plaited in several places with strips of hide he did not look up as mena leaped from the landing boat and kicked her way through the froth to the sand he did not meet her eyes when gandrel announced her or return the gazes of any of her party he answered the questions gandrel put to him in a rough dialect that mena could not follow at all he says this is where the numrek came through gandrel translated he pointed at the man with one thickly ringed hand while his other hovered near mena as if to keep her from stepping too close to him he was like that protective large as a bear and with a jagged scar across his nose as if he had fought on equal terms with clawed creatures where the mountains cry the sea he calls it a narrow pass that leads to a route through the mountains mena glanced up at the sheer black rock that rose from the sand cracked and fissured marbled with veins of silver flaring here and there clouds hung low enough that the tops disappeared into them cascades of frothing water poured through numerous crevices looking like they were draining the sky itself his people are poets then mena said i wouldnt have guessed it hardly gandrel said they just cant say things right he says a little south of here the mountains jut into the sea unpassable the only way through is to go inland via this pass and eventually come down through the ice fields can we believe him mena asked gandrel spoke to the man again listened to the answer he claims his father died here and that many of their clan were killed when they confronted the numrek burned by pitch butchered gandrel pointed at the mans chest the bones on that necklace are from his fathers right hand thats what he says at least mena did not look at the bones an artery pulsed at the base of the mans neck having noticed it she found it hard to look away they fought them menas first officer perrin asked he stood beside the princess tall and long limbed nearly as rangy as a numrek he would have been imposing save his face was so clean lined and pretty it seemed suited for an actor not a soldier his brown hair was perpetually tousled this too managed to be endearing so he claims he comes here sometimes to listen for the ghosts of those who died here thats part of how they hunt they claim the dead guide them and did he hear ghosts mena asked after gandrel translated the question the scavs gaze lifted and touched her face a moment his blue eyes might have been attractive were they not embedded in such a pale weathered visage he dropped them and mumbled his answer he always kills gandrel said because of the ghosts he captured there aside he added thats why hes so plump i guess can we believe him mena asked again no reason to do that we can listen though and look judge for ourselves whats his name his name is kant it doesnt mean what it sounds like its the name of a bird one that dives into the swirls along rocky shores he tried to demonstrate with the edge of his hand gave up halfway through the motion all right mena said tell kant to show me the pass f or the past fortnight mena had sailed north aboard the only acacian warship stationed on the west coast of the known world hadins resolve was paltry compared to the vast array of ishtat crafts floated by the league but she had three masts and was deep bellied and armor plated on the prow she flew the flag of the empire the black silhouette of an acacia tree across a brilliant yellow sunburst a hastily gathered fleet had flanked her mostly made up of imperial soldiers stationed at bases along the coastal towns and of candovian civilians conscripted for the empires protection the ships were a hodgepodge collection some were acacian naval vessels but the armada contained candovian merchant ships brimming with supplies a few of the larger fishing boats from the coastal towns carried contingents of troops while simultaneously trawling the waters for fish to salt and dry north along the candovian coast they pushed off the empires maps and into frigid waters they threaded through mountains of ice that jutted from the water slowmoving floating islands of white and blue and green some carved into intricate shapes ghostly to behold and ever changing with the slip of the sun across the sky never before had an acacian army crossed seas like this they did it on this occasion only because the league and queen corinn believed an auldek army marched to invade them following the land route the numrek had stumbled upon during their years of exile mena fought not to think too often of the two beings she loved most in the world melio had his own missions it was better she knew that he not be here with her this was war not the hunting expedition that chasing the foulthings had been she needed to make the right decisions many of those would send her soldiers to their deaths would she be able to do that to melio or would she protect him unfairly no he wouldnt allow that which might mean he ended up in greater danger far better that he serve the empire elsewhere far better that she make her decisions without thinking of his crooked smile the smell of his hair or the time he held her in their tent on the teh plains the night after aliver was killed or her promise that she would one day take his child inside her what good was thinking of such thingsof longing for the past or hoping for the futurewhen she had a war to fight better not to think about him or about elya she had left the birdlizard in corinns care on acacia after a tearful parting that she had ended abruptly mena feared she had left elya with the impression that she was angry with her nothing could have been further from the truth but mena had pushed her away loving the kindness of her eyes too much mena tried not to think about elya lest the thoughts somehow reach her across the miles this was no place for elya war was no task to set her menas mood blackened with the passing of sea miles the air became colder the wind seemingly trying to shove them back from whence they came but return was not an option queen corinn had made that clear meet the auldek horde she had ordered outside the known world delay them so that the empire had time to better prepare defeat them if such a thing were possible and in all this the implicit be sacrificed for the good of the nation g andrel set his hands on his hips listening as the scav spoke and gestured this is where the numrek first came through the tracks from their carts are still deep in the ground he says they stood about a half mile from the coast on a buttress of rock thrust close to the ceiling of clouds below them the jagged ridgelines on two sides sloped down leaving a gap that headed toward the heart of the ice fields a swath remarkable for its flatness and for the promise of ease of passage as it veered off to the east and out of sight they must come this way perrin pressed if we invest everything here and then they go elsewhere aye gandrel translated kants response its the only way the mountains to the north stand like wolves fangs those to the south he calls bear teeth only here between the two ranges is navigable he calls it the breath between perrin guffawed theyve got a name like that for everything menas gaze drifted over the bleak landscape from the sheer heights down to the flat tundra no doubt about it this was the place corinn meant her to hold this was where her sister wanted the invasion thwarted feeling cold to the core mena pulled her furlined robe tighter around her body i want to go down and check these cart tracks he talks of perrin said i cant believe theyre still there all these years later should i send word for the ships to begin unloading camp supplies not yet mena said come lets all see these tracks we should send a scouting party along the pass as well she began walking before any of the men had responded see the tracks they did they were there obvious once kant pointed them out the ruts were each a carriagelength wide cut by massive wheels that had churned up the soil even covered with spongy moss and tough grass the slashes were kneedeep according to the dispatches that chased them with new information from acacia the auldek would come with vehicles with massive wheels like the ones that had scarred the land she listened to perrins astonished rambling and gandrels translations of kants tales of how the scavs had been the first in the known world to face the monsters she asked questions and made comments and ruminated on how they might use the terrain to their favor speculated on where to place troops set ambushes where best to join battle she acted as a royal war leader should but in truth a question greater than all these details had settled in her mind that evening her officers dined with mena on hadins resolve though cramped and simple by acacian standards the dining hall was quite comfortable the table was one large slab of stained wood beautifully grained and worked so that the contours of the edge seemed to fit each particular person with resting places for each forearm and a modest concavity to accommodate expanding waistlines spiced pork and grilled vegetables sat on whitegold trays with small dishes of relishes pickled whitefish and bowls of sliced fruit the dark red wine was the same consumed on acacia itself to soldiers new to positions of command it must all have seemed quite grand by and large these soldiers were new to her a very different lot from the talayans with whom she had hunted the foulthings paler men and fewer women than she was used to blue and grayeyed candovians some senivalians and even a few who might have claimed meinish identity had that clan not been so defeated and scattered throughout the empire they all seemed so very young few of them had fought against hanish mein all of them wished for glory they seemed to both relish the danger marching toward them and disbelieve in it when they all finally left to return to their vessels mena found herself alone with perrin they sat opposite each other reclining in soft chairs near the small stove that heated the room they sipped a liqueur made from yellow plums despite the warmth caged within the metal stove a chill crept around the edges of the chamber through chinks in the woodwork the portholes had begun to rim with ice perrin propped his shiny leather boots on a footstool and set a hand on his abdomen patting his stomach im going to miss meals like that no matter how well we think weve provisioned such bounty wont last long i had to laugh at how much the troops complained when we didnt accept the casks of wine the league offered us they acted like we were spoiling their planned holiday when the league comes bearing gifts beware melio had said those exact words before saying it herself she heard his voice too right your highness the stuff wouldnt have lasted long in any event i know this from experience you trained on the mein plateau perrin nodded his shoulderlength hair swayed with the motion two years based in cathgergen rather boring really considering that there werent actually any meins to be worrying about anymore did you see much of the plateau its mostly much of the same snow and trees and ice snow and trees and ice oh theres a mountain he feigned surprise that sort of thing i went west as far as scatevith wintered for three months in hardith saw mein tahalian in the height of summer what was it like youve never been mena shook her head in summer it was a misery of mosquitoes and biting flies place was deadly with themwe were bitten and the air was so thick with them we could not help but breathe them in and choke it wasnt the winters that made the meins so cranky it was the summer wildlife is what they say of haleeven mein true that he camps outside mein tahalian yes that he is insane from grief and shame that too perhaps i think i saw him once but he was so covered in furs that it was impossible to tell for sure not much of a life for a man who could have been chieftain of the mein i almost feel for him perrin drew back his legs to let a nervous servant through to the stove the boy fed the fire with the thin shavings of hardwood watching him the young officer continued tahalian itself i saw only from outside it was sealed shut by then it huddled against the ground pretending to be dead waiting for you to come too close dont laugh at me but i used to dream that the tahalian you could seethe wood beams and buttresses of itwas the headgear of a buried giant i woke up sweating in my bedroll more than once to the image of the head rising eyes opening and the whole thing clawing up from the tundra am i embarrassing myself here just the opposite mena thought he was diverting pleasant to look at and to listen to rare to find a man so at home in his body so easy with life and able to talk without selfimportance or hidden meanings knowing well the conspiratorial world of court life on acacia mena found this apparent naivete refreshing did you ever see the route from tahalian to port grace she asked no its a wellestablished road though the ascent from the coast is gradual wide a fortnights march if the weather isnt troublesome mena glanced at the portholes again even more rimmed with delicate lacings of frost now the wind had picked up gusting and setting up a sporadic clanking from the rigging let me ask you something do you think well survive a winter camped here many will die princess mena not even the scav stay out here not exposed this way we could travel inland a bit find a sheltered spot along the pass but still it will be along hard winter ice will lock us in in a month well be trapped here until the spring and well need every day of that month to prepare each day will be shorter colder before long therell be little daylight at all well need to divide our labors quickly some building the shelters some bringing the ships to shore some hunting and fishing kant says there are seal beaches just to the north we should send as many ships as we can fill them full of the blubber well need it you make it sound like the war is with the winter perrin looked at his wineglass again studying it as if the act of doing so would be enough to refill it it will be the other officers can think about slaying auldek i almost wish the auldek would hurry up and get here so we could have this fight who knows maybe they will but id wager were in for a wait he paused a moment drained his glass then rolled the stem between his fingers its whats been ordered though the queens command so well do it you dont think we should i wont say a word against the queens wishes i understand completely how the situation would look from acacia shes right of course if we could stop the auldek here even if we just weaken them delay them the empire could be that much better prepared to meet them if they ever stumble out of the ice fields no i see the advantage of this move very well its just we wont be the ones that reap that benefit mena dropped her eyes when his met hers good night perrin t he next morning mena met with her officers on the northern ridge along the pass and traversed its spine as it snaked inland it afforded an even better view of the mountains stretching off to the north and the curve of the coastline as it vanished into the distant mist perrin and edell the marah captain bledas and the senivalian perceven represented the military units at her command daley the captain of hadins resolve and several others attended on the naval side gandrel was there for his knowledge of the scav the princess waited as the men gathered around her all of them taking in the view desolate yet strangely beautiful to behold look perceven said a chase on a sloping stretch of rockstrewn tundra below them two figures moved they were tiny amid the vastness of the valleys and mountains but their motion was easy to follow a white hare leaped in a crazy jolting zagging line behind it a snow cat bounded mena kept her eyes on the hunt but said loudly enough that all the men could hear we will die here none disputed it they looked at her at one another then back to the pursuit that held menas gaze the auldek will arrive to find an army of ice sculptures waiting them gandrel said true or theyll find us cut to pieces by the scav there are more of them around here i tell you even if theyre hard to spot i wouldnt put anything past them not even jolly young kant here kant watched the hunt and made no sign that he heard or understood there are too many ways our deaths here might be for naught mena said if i knew what was comingwhen and howthat would be one thing but for all we know the auldek might arrive six months from now or they may take a different route or they might never arrive considering all this i cannot have us winter here the snow cat slapped at the hares hind leg for a moment the prey seemed frozen its body tilted as it floated above the tundra then it landed hard the cat fell upon it and the two rolled into one ball of motion when they stopped the cat had its jaws around the hares neck patient now as it suffocated its prey mena looked away as unsatisfied with the outcome as she had been watching the pursuit thats my decision she said but the queen perrin began we leave here immediately mena said sail to port grace from there we march inland to tahalian well winter in the fortress and adjust to whatever challenges the thaw brings with it go and see to it t he next afternoon mena sent a ship south to alert the small settlement of port grace that they would soon be inundated with a passing army on it she also sent a note to be flown by messenger bird once they were far enough south to ensure the bird would know the landmarks she had spent the previous night composing a long missive to explain the situation in all its complexity in the morning she ripped it to pieces instead the message she sent was terser queen corinn the plan to meet the enemy in the far north is untenable i am moving the army to mein tahalian we will winter there training with your permission i will lift haleeven meins exile and ask for his aid chapter three when dariel akaran first looked upon the ruins he had to steady himself by grasping birkes shoulder scoop it up the young wrathic man said grinning and lifting dariels drooping jaw with a finger youll catch flies like that they stood at the summit of a hill on an old road that snaked down into the valley a great ruin of an ancient metropolis stretched before them the city reached up to the hills that held them in wrapped completely by a defensive wall that rose and fell over the contours of the ridgelines dariel got lost in gazing at the maze of thoroughfares and alleys buildings and spires of what must once have been a grand city it matched alecia in size but the pale green of the building stones showed an intricacy of workmanship that would have left acacian architects envious what is this place the prince asked amratseer mor said she came up and stood beside them she said a sentence in auldek what seeren githva birke translated a dead city dead its hardly dead large beaked birds patrolled the skies in raucous groups gray doves labored into the air black starlings darted seemingly for the joy it goldenhaired monkeys similar to those on acacia sprinted around the streets and lounged on rooftops calling to each other in argumentative bursts behind that there was another sound the rustle of vegetation slowly engulfing the city as quiet and relentless as a constricting snake winding tighter and tighter around its prey there was life in abundance here just not the sort the makers of the place had intended since dariel dropped down from those slabs of granite following mor eight days before this new world had swallowed him whole with tam and anira the other two who had come with them they spent the first day climbing over high fingers of stone plunging into damp forests and climbing up over more fingers of stone that night they had camped in a cave mouth that opened toward the west dariel sat staring at the sun setting over an unending undulation of forest as vast as the ocean the third afternoon they had followed the banks of a tributary of the sheeven lek the river water was crystal clear rippling liquid glass that displayed the blue stones of the riverbed and banks when they stopped to eat dariel stripped off his shirt and prepared to leap in ripe with the sweat and dirt of so much walking birke caught him by the arm you dont want to do that a short time later birke led him to the trunk of a fallen tree atop which they could look at a deep pool at a bend in the river beneath them schools of crimsonfinned fish swam in shifting ribbons of motion stretching thin and then clumping together one school joining another and then splitting they could have been dancing some elaborate routine dariel asked if they were edible oh yes very tasty that was when it happened a section of stones on the bottom of the river slid forward slowly at first and then with a sudden upward rush dariel stared as a gaping slit opened it yawned wider than a person was tall and engulfed an entire swath of the unfortunate fish only when its maw shut again and the creature swam forward with leisurely pleased swipes of its tail did dariel understand that it was a massive salamander of some sort its back was patterned to replicate the blue stones of the river it had only to stop moving to become invisible anything else i should be afraid of dariel asked plenty of things t he fourth day they snaked down through crevasses cut deep into the whitish stone of the earth by a labyrinthine network of narrow streams it was a different world with forests of amazingly thin trees that stood side by side at any bend in the riveranyplace that afforded a chance at sunlightand stretched upward branchless until their crowns could explode in plumes of long narrow leaves tiny birds darted through the trees they made their nests well up in them cast between several like hammocks in places the walls pressed in so close on either side that the group disrobed and swam with their clothes and supplies bundled on top of their heads dariels heart thrummed in his chest more from fear of hidden creatures than from the exertion despite this his eyes still managed to linger on the patterning of tattoos on mors back on the way her blond hair billowed in the water and on the lovely motion of her legs mor herself rarely looked at him she may have been his escort to meet the elder yoen at the sky isle but the role had not made her any warmer toward him she made it clear that she had left her heart with skylene back in avina i guess that makes her heartless dariel had thought a t the close of the fifth day they climbed back to the surface of the world and camped sheltered by the thick roots at the base of some massive trees the next morning the prince awoke lying on his back with something gripping the sides of his head pressing on his chest and still another thing moving inside his mouth he opened his eyes and stared into the metallic blue bulbous face of some sort of enormous insect its eyes were each the size of a mans handprint moist and as delicate looking as soap bubbles a pulsing tube from the center of the face extended into dariels mouth and the long stretch of its segmented body pressed him down dariel tried to swat at it but one of the creatures many limbs pinned his wrist down he tried the other hand but he got no further than wriggling his fingers he kicked and thrashed and screamed or he tried to do those things he could not actually kick because the creature had lowered its segmented torso onto his and the cage of its legs trapped his own so pinned at all his points he created little actual motion whatever the creature had inserted in his mouth made it impossible to vocalize that did not stop him from screaming inside his mind tams face came into view looking down at him calmly his eyes shadowed by the dark circular tattoos of the fru nithexeks sky bear a moment later anira and birke and finally mor appeared as well none of them shared his alarm anira reached out and stroked the creatures side gently dariel directed all his confusion into wrinkling his forehead birke laughed and made some remark in answer anira brushed her palms over the creatures eyes and then leaned her forehead against it the tube in dariels mouth withdrew a feeling like many fingers that had been pressing his teeth and tongue the roof of his mouth releasing all at once the creatures bulbous head turned its legs rippling into motion as it curled away from dariel the prince wrenched himself to one side and scrambled to his feet spitting and cursing wiping his mouth he cast about to locate the monster and saw it slipping away on its numerous legs the others laughed theyre harmless dariel mor said dou worms theyre called you should thank them she said something in auldek the others grinned she began to turn away but could not stop from translating for him i said that it has just cleaned your teeth for you it will improve your breath t hat evening looking out over amratseer dariel felt the parameters of how he measured the world crumbling in this place monsters hid in plain sight one beast might appear to swallow you whole another might improve your hygiene this land was cluttered with signs of a civilization older by ages than his own and yet cities and culture and centuries of history had been defeated it all made him feel like he knew nothing about the fullness of the world and all the people and creatures that lived in it instead of frightening him the battering of realizations he had received in ushen brae blew air into his lungs he wanted to see it all dariel strolled over to where the others huddled though he did not take his eyes off the panorama will the gates give us trouble mor looked up from the simple map tam had drawn in the dust why should they we wont be troubling them amratseer seeren githva are the gates locked the gates are open tam said without looking up thats not the problem lets go through then dariel said we could camp in one of the plazas oh id love to explore we dont enter seeren githva mor said afraid of ghosts dariel asked we are mindful of them anira said she rose from her squatting position and crossed her arms she was balbara by birth very dark skinned with a sensuously muscular physique instead of tattoos she showed her anet clan affiliation in scalelike plates beneath her eyes and on the bridge of her nose subtle enhancements that one had to peer closely to see they are auldek ghosts they mean us no good you really dont intend to go through it thats what youre telling me who told you tales of ghosts your auldek masters maybe they told tales because they were afraid to go back and they didnt want their slaves scouring their old cities for treasure which is what you want to do mor said still an akaran i see still love to pillage and steal just look at the place i dont want to steal but arent you curious dont you mor closed the distance between them with a rapidity that made dariel step back no she snapped amratseer seeren githva i care about the living about the people we sleep here and begin to skirt amratseer tomorrow thats all birke take the prince and fetch water for camp if dariel appeared to accept the dismissal it was only because his mind was already beyond it he climbed down to a nearby stream and filled waterskins with birke he ate a stew made from dried strips of meat and fresh roots with the rest of them and he asked questions as if the answers to them were enough to satisfy him in the north there is an even greater ruin than amratseer tam said in answer to one such query he sat crosslegged a small stringed instrument cradled in his hands he played it in short bursts of plucked notes as if he were writing or remembering a tune he seemed to have forgotten the several blunders he had made during their operation to destroy the soul catcher its called lvinreth it was once the home city of the lvin they abandoned it centuries ago even now they say that snow lions live among the fallen stones they walk the empty corridors and roar at night calling for the clan to return why did they abandon it the auldek were once as numerous as the stars this city proves it but that was long ago they killed one another off suffered disease even invasion from a race across the mountains that came plundered and then went home many things left them the weakened race the lothan aklun found huddling together by the coast they never said so but i think they were a scared people on the brink of extinction the lothan aklun saved them from that they gave them immortality and us anira said they gave them the quota the auldek are the ones who really think their old cities are haunted its they who want a new land instead a war has given them a new purpose in life and given us ushen brae anira said its a blessing that theyve gone mor said something in auldek the others received it in silence dariel glanced at her she sat with her back to the group looking not at amratseer but toward the east dariel did not ask her what she had said he was convinced she only spoke auldek to keep him out of conversations to draw the line between them and remind everyone of it he had a mind to ask her why she chose her enslavers tongue at all but he left it l ater that evening tam nudged him awake the excitement that surged through dariel was not anticipation of hours sitting quietly on watch listening to the sleeping and alert for the sound of any creature that might make a meal of them that was not what he had planned whatever was to become of him being in this land was a part of it he was here in this foreign place so far from home he needed to know it completely to learn if he could why his life was entwined so deeply with the fate of ushen brae he sat crosslegged for a time but once tams breathing slipped into its steady near snore dariel lifted his thin blanket from around his knees and stood with his boots pinched between his fingers he tiptoed across the stone down toward the moonlit city the wall was massive draped with veins fissured with cracks cast in shadow and highlight by the moons gray glow it dwarfed even the great wall around alecia dariel had to walk along it for a time climbing over roots and debris around stone blocks that had fallen from the crumbling barricade the night was loud with insect and bird calls with scuffling noises nearby and several distant roars sounds that dariel had heard before but that troubled him more acutely now one of these rent the air in a way that he felt physically as if it flew at him along the long stretch of the wall the beast they called a kwedeir dariel had yet to see one but he had heard about them enormous batlike creatures the auldek had domesticated and used to hunt fugitive slaves they bite the head not hard enough to kill birke said but just enough to get you screaming they like that dariel had not believed the description now he wondered he reached a twodoored gate one door was closed the otheran enormous thing of oldgrowth trunks bound together with intricately worked steelhad fallen from its hinges and slammed back against one side of the entranceway if he had not known better dariel would have thought giants had built this place the roar came again he could not tell if it was closer but it was certainly outside the citys walls he wondered if it would wake the others probably mor would rise cursing him for a fool he would not argue with her if she did but when in his life would he ever stand before these gates again what akaran had ever been here to learn of the world as he was doing none that he knew of of course he had to see what could be seen dariel crept into the shadow beneath the leaning door and entered the dead city of amratseer the green stones of the place glowed with a low luminescence that dariel could not figure out as he moved through the cluttered lanes and alleys he first thought the light was from the moon but it was not only that the glow seemed to fill even shadowed spaces even the insides of houses viewed through the gapping mouths of doors and open crescents of windows it was night still dim and shadowy but it was a different sort of night than dariel had experienced he walked on the balls of his feet careful not to trip on the vines or debris littering the stones just dont get lost he told himself he proceeded straight ahead as best he could sighting on the position of the moon and studying the shape of hills behind him for landmarks soon the high walls of the multistoried buildings blocked his view realizing this he spun around his heart pounded in his chest and a film of sweat slicked his forehead this is absurd he thought ive only come a hundred paces the way back is just there he decided to look around the buildings near at hand stepping into the entrance of one he let his eyes adjust until he could see his way by the dim glow of the walls and floor intricately carved wooden chairs and benches took shape before him no spirits though not yet an overturned bowl on the floor a clutter of long rods leaning in a corner a cloth hung from a hook he entered the next apartment down a living space chairs oddly arrayed in a circle but with no table at its center he found bedrooms and storage chambers tiled rooms that must have been for bathing balconies that looked out onto back gardens that were no longer gardens they were overgrown enough that trees surged out of them and monkeysseveral of whom dariel startled as much as they startled himclimbed right from them to nest in shelter how strange it was to walk into homes devoid of their intended inhabitants and yet so full of the signs of what had been stepping out into the night again dariel noticed an arched gateway a little farther in framed by tall buildings on either side he could not see where it led he walked toward it under the shadow of the archway and through into a massive courtyard what must once have been a marvelous tapestry of paving stones stretched before him there was a patterning in the colors he could tell but it was stained and scarred and faded the stones were heaved up here and there by tree roots that had escaped their plots sending out shoots that burst through to become new trees and creating a ragged patchwork the space was so immense that dariel could barely make out the opposing archway through the screen of trees buildings on either side hemmed the courtyard reminding him of the upper terraces of the palace on acacia only much much larger some of the trees were massive bizarrely so trunks thicker around than any he had ever seen branches like scaffolding devoid of foliage but cluttered with no dariel realized the largest of the trees were not trees at all they were sculptures with branches that served as perches for batlike hulking figures some sat atop the limbs some hung below them kwedeir kwedeir carved in stone or cast from bronze or some other metal dariel walked toward the nearest of these sculptures into the stencil of shadow beneath it were they lifesize it did not seem possible but birke had said they were large enough that an auldek could ride on their backs these were certainly that this place corinn would hate this place for so many reasons one of the kwedeir turned its head toward dariel the prince froze midstep it thrust its snout forward and sniffed the air the creatures two black eyes pinned dariel between them it was not a statue at all a fact which suddenly seemed absurdly obvious it was furred and dark and so clearly alive quite different from the stone family among which it perched dariel let out a whispered curse the kwedeir leaped into the air its wings flared out black against the night sky it let out a cry that seemed to tear the skin from dariels face he turned and ran at full sprint he just barely reached the arch before the kwedeir he bolted straight through as the creature flapped above it he was halfway to the row of buildings he had just explored when a moon shadow swept down on him he jumped to one side as the kwedeir landed on the ground just beside him it was all flapping membranous wings and awkward limbs and a snapping inhaling fetid snout full of yellow teeth dariel backed from it tripped and then he scrabbled away on all fours for a moment the beast grunted and leaped into the air again it came down just behind dariel as he hurtled through the nearest open door the prince stumbled into a chair and sprawled over a table slid off it and crashed onto the floor the kwedeir beat its wings it kicked at the decaying stone around the doorframe part of which collapsed at its first blow it folded its wings and squirmed forward bursting through the stone with the wriggling force of its body dariel fled further into the apartment he heard the creature break through and scrabble behind him he ran through the apartment and into a small courtyard he darted across it leaped through a back window down a flight of stairs and into a dim passageway he could not hear the beast anymore but he kept moving through alleys splashing through ankledeep muck under a bridge and into a small cubicle of a room in which he stood jammed into a corner when his panting had quieted enough that he realized he could hear a rodent squeaking somewhere in the room dariel let himself relax he touched the tips of his fingers to his nose clipping them together as if they were scissors by tinhadins nose he said an expression he had not used since boyhood appropriate now for his knees felt weak as a childs how quickly would a thing like that forget him short memories they must have short memories surely it would be on to something else by now and if it did appear again be ready for it thats all fight it he had not even thought to draw his dagger against the kwedeir he tugged it free now and stepped into the doorways frame he stood there for some time his eyes scanning the sky and moving over the buildings rising around him nothing swept down from above the sounds were all the same as before he had just moved farther out into the lane hoping to get his bearings when something rounded a nearby corner and snapped to stillness staring at him it was not the kwedeir but when a growl started low in its throat and the hair along its ridgeline rose in an angry bristle dariel knew it might just as readily kill him a hound a lean longlegged creature as tall as the hunting dogs at calfa ven its eyes shone the same color as its short tan hair it crouched with its head stretched low to the ground the muscles in its shoulders taut and bulging it stepped forward once and then again muscles and joints smooth in action dariel hunkered down slashing the knife in warning the winged shadow swept in blocking out the sky and freezing the hound with one paw upraised the kwedeir hovered over it the hound cocked its head sensing it before it could react the kwedeir folded its wings and dropped it slammed the hound to the ground and clamped its jaws around the canines head and neck the hound struggled but the kwedeir raked its hind claw down its back ripping deep gouges it pressed down driving its weight through its hind legs the hound began to yelp in short frantic bursts and then the kwedeir bit hard the cracking of bone was audible as was the squelch of fluids spraying through the creatures jaws it did not pause a moment but flared its wings and surged upward the dead hound swung sickeningly from its jaws as it labored up above the height of the buildings over them and out of sight dariel did not move from where he stood framed in the doorway he simply lowered himself to the stones and sat panting just as heavily as if he had been running again did that just happen he looked from side to side as if there might be a companion there to verify it for him there was no one of course but that did not stop him from asking the question several more times as he gradually caught his breath as before he realized he should move again because he heard squeaking somewhere in the room behind him or not squeaking exactly more like whimpering snuffling there was a pattern to it as if rodents were making noise and then going silent calling and then listening come to think of it the sounds were nothing like those of a mouse or other rodent dariel rose and crept back into the room there was a crate there he had hardly noticed before turned on its side its opening facing the wall he approached it and stood silent beside it long enough to hear the whimpering again with his dagger thrust before him he caught the crate with his toe and pushed it to one side until he saw what lay huddled within two pups bigeyed and cautious staring at him innocence in rounded features and floppy ears and slightly trembling jaws oh look at you dariel said he sheathed his knife and reached in cautiously look at you he stroked one of the pups on the head it tried to back away shhh no no its fine his touch was gentle his fingers sank into the soft fur over the ears and then down under the chin the other pup inched forward its eyes were the same color as its fur a slightly auburn tint now that he was up close just like the hound outside dariel offered his hand for it to scent after doing so the pup slapped its pink tongue wetly against his knuckles before dariel could smile with the joy this gave him a realization stopped him that was your mother wasnt it dariel moved to the doorway and scanned the scene it lay as it had before dark and glowing at the same time still and crackling with unseen motion silent and filled with a cacophony of sounds exactly the same yet different now looking back at the pups dariel asked what am i going to do with you two chapter four rialus neptos went to bed each evening swearing to himself that he was not betraying his entire race to really be doing what the auldek asked of him would make him the greatest villain in the history of the known world he could think of nobody else who had sunk so low not even during the unfortunate years he served hanish mein had he been such a traitor he had just been biding his time then pretending to serve hanish and the numrek he had proven as much by bringing the numrek into corinns service and saving the empire he would find a way to do so again he would lie and fabricate confuse and obfuscate trick and deceive and somehow emerge from it a hero for the ages he had to he had a wife gurta he had a child who might already be born and living in the world didnt that matter more than anything going to sleep thus convinced made waking in the morn all the more peculiar he found himself surrounded by the enemy he watched himself go through motions that looked smelled and felt like the very treason he so despised the situation was complicated enough to challenge his capacity for knotted excuses the numrek had never in fact been true to the akarans the allies he had brought corinn had been planning the conquest of the entire known world all along the auldek horde progressing around the curve of the world were every bit the threat they considered themselves to be and they were daily educating themselves on all things acacianwith rialus as their instructor at what point exactly would he transform himself into the agent of acacian defense that he believed himself to be hey rialus leagueman rialus heard the shout from outside his room he recognized the voicealleks he sat crosslegged with a writing cushion before him pen poised above it just leave me rialus thought go on he had begun yet another journal attempt at outlining his actions justifying and explaining how he was handling himself while with the auldek he thought such documents would prove useful should he ever be called before queen corinn for some reason he found it quite hard to organize his arguments coherently fingel uncurled herself from the corner of the room and moved for the door rialus waved her to stillness dont play dumb girl he thought as he had many times before the meinish young woman his slave since avina showed a dogged unwillingness to ever anticipate his desires it should be dead obvious that he would not want to be disturbed there is someone at the door she said staring at him with her gray eyes as if on cue the circular portal was yanked open letting in a howling beast of a wind that surged through the chamber making it instantly frigid a furred figure stepped across the threshold he was bundled from head to foot hooded and wore black goggles he cast about a moment no doubt letting his eyes adjust to the dim lamplight rialus allek said get dressed stop all that scribbling sabeer wants to massage your feet or she wants you to massage her feet i forget which either way she asked for you what charm have you put on her he asked no charm but my wit and the pleasure of my company rialus said the hooded figure guffawed right your charm come rialus show me your charm at work shes in the steamship please tell her im busy im ill drag you by your locks if you dont start dressing now ill enjoy it too just like last time still an ogre rialus thought fine he muttered setting his pen aside and tidying his supplies im coming keep your nose on rialus carefully pulled on his furlined leggings and boots he shrugged himself into his sealskin jacket the garment draped bulkily about him he had learned the hard way that if it hung loose wicked fingers of cold found their way to his skin so he cinched down the buckles he even strapped on the visor to protect his eyes and then tugged his hood in place all this for a walk that would only take a few minutes damn this place so thinking he followed allek out the wind smacked him as if it had clung just above the door waiting to pounce on him he stood on a platform running along one side of what the auldek called stations rocking taking in a scene he still barely believed his room was but one chamber of several in the large wooden and steel structure a rolling tower that churned across the frozen earth with unrelenting steadiness all around him other stations rolled pulled by long lines of harnessed rhinoceroses the same woolly breed that the numrek had ridden down into the known world the structures creaked and groaned the creatures bellowed and snorted the blown snow obscured further stations making it feel like they went on forever out beyond the reach of his vision the vessels were relics of ancient auldek travel quickly outfitted for this journey indeed much of the preparation was made easier because of the great stores of old equipment and devices the auldek had but to dust off and haul into use the stations cargo wagons the sleds stores of arms and supplies tons of grain and other foodstuffs in crates and barrels all of it slid into motion more rapidly than rialus would have thought possible slaves had tended herds of the beasts outside avina rhinoceroses antoks kwedeir not to mention the freketes rialus had not seen much of the monsters since the cold weather had set in but he understood them to be housed in stations outfitted for them beneath and between the structures figures moved driving animals hauling supplies doing the million things needed to feed and care for an army in constant rolling motion rialus had doubted it would be possible but the auldekor their slaveswere more efficient than he thought they unpacked food stores in an organized manner that meant they could abandon the vehicles that had carried them they ate the animals freed up from this or any that got injured or sick rialus even suspected that the slaves themselves became food for the animals or worse he tried not to think about it a man rode by atop an antok swaying with the beasts strides as at ease as a horseman on a trusted mount the swine blew plumes of white vapor from beneath the heavy patchwork of throws that covered it rialus felt the vapor billow around him fogging his visor he smelled the rank scent of the creatures breath but that did not make sense it was not that close rialus scrubbed at his visor a moment smearing the scene before him he pulled back his hood and yanked the visor from his head the antok had moved away but still the steaming breath blew past him a noise at his back turned rialus around to meet the clear blue eyes of a snow lioness the cat crouched just a little distance away on a ledge of the station tensed as if it might pounce it thrust its chin forward and then cocked its head then righted it rialus had no idea what that was meant to convey but the female of the species worried him as much as the massive males in the wild he had been told it was the females that did most of the hunting the males just used their brawn to fight one another and win wives miserable beasts rialus thought he fumbled for the ladder poles dropped over the edge and descended dropping from the ladder onto the frozen earth rialus pitched over as he always did when jumping from the evermoving structure he scrambled to his feet wary of the vehicles massive wheels and had to shuffle run to catch up with allek they cut a zigzagging path through the rumbling roaring groaning flow of men and machines and furred and horned and tusked beasts all the while buffeted by the wind they entered the steamstation through a trapdoor that lowered for them to leap up to a moment later after climbing a winding staircase rialus was shrugging out of his garments the air warm around him at least the steamship had that going for it it was a specially constructed station one that featured an elaborate heating system fueled by the flammable pitch the auldek had brought with them in great quantities a fire burning somewhere inside pumped in enough hot air that the auldek lounged about half naked slaves fanning them and serving them chilled drinks and giving them massages it never failed to remind rialus of the baths at cathgergen a memory which he ran from remembering just how that had turned out ah allek youve found my leagueman sabeer said you never disappoint i try not to dearest one allek said bowing his head dearest one rialus sneered inside as if you have a chance with her come rialus sit with us sabeer lounged on a low divan propped up on one elbow sipping something from a tiny blue glass she was tall and long limbed with a tensile muscularity that hummed like a coiled spring making even languid movements seem somehow dangerous she wore a thin linen garment perfectly designed to hug her contours and yet hang loose another woman jafith lay in a similar posture a man named howlk sat with her feet in his lap an absurdly submissive posture for a warrior who rialus knew enjoyed wrestling naked in death matchesor as close to such as an immortal could suffer two humans stood just outside the group one beating out a rhythm on a waisthigh drum while the other smacked a rattle on his palm if not for the sloshing liquid in the glasses one might have forgotten the entire station was rolling across an icescape rialus sat on the cushion to which sabeer directed him he had been petrified when he learned she was devoths wife but what that distinction meant rialus could not figure out he rarely saw them together and when he did they treated each other more like siblings than anything elsedeeply familiar enough so that they were also deeply dismissive they kept separate quarters and sabeer spent her time with whomever she chose for some reason rialus was one of those howlk was reciting a song to sumerled sabeer said squeezing rialuss thigh continue sir let rialus hear the end the auldek warrior cleared his throat he closed his eyes his fingers kneading the ball of jafiths foot and his upper body swaying with the effort as if he were putting all of himself into the pressure of his fingers he tilted his stern features up long hair flowing over his shoulders and told a tale of epic love and tragedy that would have brought the entire acacian senate to tears two lovers suffered the wrath of the lvin for some crime rialus could not quite pinpoint rialus had heard poems performed like this before but howlk had a particularly good voice for it despite himself he was transfixed rialus had ceased being surprised by the complex collage that was auldek culture at times they seemed as barbaric and prone to violence as the numrek but those moments did not define them entirely devoth with his dancing hummingbirds the time rialus watched them draw garden tapestries with colored pebbles complex works of art that would blur and disintegrate under the first rain they achieved a balance in their lives but it was a balance of extremes here was a race who would howl for blood in the morning and then tend beetle farms on their terraces in the afternoon here was a people who would abandon their land to march to war but then bring with them strange artifacts of gentility he would never forget the makeshift banquet held on a black stone beach waves crashing in the distance the auldek delicately plucked the violet leaves of some flowerlike vegetable they dunked each leathery leaf in fragrant oils and scraped off the softer tissue with their upper teeth the thing tasted fine when you got used to it but it was the spectacle of such rough creatures all silently attending leaf dipping that ranked as one of the strangest sights he had ever witnessed when howlk finished his song and had shaken off the praise offered him rialus asked how old is that tale a couple hundred years howlk said its a newer poem really so as new as that then did you know these illfated lovers personally i mean howlk looked away without answering opening an awkward silence something over rialuss shoulder caught sabeers attention several lvin women climbed the circular staircase though they were human rialus knew them instantly their every movement shouted their status not just with their clan affiliation but as simple sublime motion their bodies were lithe and sculpted honed through torturous training that made them fighters almost on par with the auldek themselves they went about wearing only short skirts they were bare breasted with chiseled arms and long muscles taut in their legs as they climbed like their totem animal they moved with feline grace circling and climbing up toward the next level without pausing behind the women came the white dreadlocks and the pale leonine visage of menteus nemre like the women before him he was nearly naked the slaves muscles bulged absurdly on his chest and arms cut fine divisions on his abdomen and stood out in thick bands running down his legs he paused halfway up the stairs taking in the room for a moment he seemed to stare so intently at him that rialus wanted to squirm actually he did squirm nothing about the attention of menteuss gaze changed though as his torso narrowed the color of his skin changed from powder white to rich dark brown from his abdomen downhis natural color a shade of talay he paused on the landing and studied the lounging auldek group strange to think of this man as a slave for not an inch of him betrayed the slightest subservience rialus had never been this close to him before he could not think of him without seeing images of the damage he had done during the games back in avina the speed of his attack the way limbs and blood flew from his blade work the death he inflicted for no other purpose than to determine the order in which the clans would march away on this campaign realizing the man was staring at sabeer rialus looked back at her she smiled and dipped her head in greeting her gaze ascended as menteus nemre continued his climb you shouldnt ask such things sabeer said returning to rialuss question she leaned a bit closer you embarrass us you see weve forgotten forgotten she shrugged waved him away with her hand and then pointed at the musicians sing howlk asked so what do you believe rialus ive heard the quota speak of few gods there is one that gives yes the god of presents allek quipped yes that one can you get him to give me something i want a great many things they all looked at rialus with playfully serious faces expressions that grew more amused as he tried to convey the essential details surrounding the giver before he had gotten far at all jafith said what nonsense did you just make that up leagueman no ive heard others speak the same many times allek said theirs is a feeble faith dont look offended rialus what sense does it make that one god would create all why would he create rabbits soft and cuddly yes and then create foxes that hunt them down and tear them to shreds why do that that god is no god to the rabbits he is a demon that favors their enemies but nor does that god honor the fox for he creates other animals bigger than it creates wolves creates you acacians even you rialus could kill a fox if you were lucky and had the right weapon and if the creature was lame or old jafith added it simply makes no sense its an addled god who creates hunted and hunter both killer and those to be killed health and disease at the same no the giver did not create disease rialus said elenet did that elenet sabeer asked who is elenet one of the first humans he followed the giver and learned his language and tried to use it but when he did he released disease illness death things like rialuss voice faded as the triumphant expression on howlks face grew listen to yourself youre telling us that a human stole the words of creation from a god all he had to do was talk like a god and he became a god thats like saying if you stole devoths armor and wore it you would become as he allek said do you think that rialus no i but thats what this elenet did howlk said rialus tried to say more but howlk talked over him foolishness from start to finish you know how the world really works life is war its the struggle between forces that defines it hunger gnaws your belly until it is defeated by consumption but then just when consumption lies down to sleep hunger rises and grabs it around the neck and starves it the night overcomes the day the day burns away the night back and forth back and forth war rialus but not chaos thats the difference between us in conflict you and your people see confusion see something to be lived through in waiting for peace we though see conflict as what the gods intended i think this is good news for us yes allek asked the others agreed that it was sabeer rose to her feet rialus pay these fools no mind come lets entertain ourselves privately me rialus said she smiled suggestively yes you none of these others interest me tonight a howling protest answered this mixed with invitations and suggestive encouragements for rialus the humorous remarks followed them to the edge of the chamber where sabeer slipped on boots of white fox fur and a coat of some other hide that she wrapped around herself loosely rialus unsure what he was heading to but trying to be relieved to get away from the others fumbled himself into his outer garments he dreaded that sabeer would expect him to perform in intimate ways dreaded it and yet it was not only his stomach that tingled with anticipation a nother drummer played in sabeers chamber still other servants hovered near but rialus forgot about them as sabeer lay down with him she pressed her strong body against his frail one she spooned around him breasts pressing against his back her long legs entwined with his spindly ones so positioned she stroked her finger up and down his arm do you understand what the two lovers did wrong in howlks song they were old you know yourself that none of us auldek are old in body we all took our first soul at an age of vanity you understand if we were to be immortal we wanted to be forever strong young good for fighting and lovemaking no sign either of our beginnings or of our ends thats why there are none of us in child bodies no immortal children that would be very disturbing i think thats why i chose to look forever as i do now i made a good choice yes rialus blushed you are very well formed such a silver tongue you have sabeer chuckled and then grew serious what those two lovers did wrong was that they disdained immortality they gave up on it and died back into their true souls and then those true souls let their bodies age that itself made them i dont know what to call them outcasts not exactly a holy couple perhaps they would have been but then nearing death they asked for life again they wanted souls from the soul catcher then you understand that they could not have this can you imagine them old forever in love and old forever no we could not allow that i do wish i remembered them though truly remembered them do you not sabeer slid her leg over rialus her skin was soft and hot and he was glad he faced away from her curved around the arousal in his groin no i havent for many years none of us do im making a confession to you rialus we know whats written we know things because we keep the knowledge alive in records in songs we can only hold the memories of eighty years or so the length of a long normal life as we grew past that age our childhoods disappeared and then our youth and even the day we ate our first soul and gained lasting life rialus i once lived in the interior in a palace in the westlands i loved a man name merwyn we lived seventyfive years together but could have no children the sadness of this became too much for him and he let free his lives and died a final death at least thats what the written histories say of him myself i remember none of it we claim we abandoned the cities because of ancient wars and slaughter perhaps thats true but thats not why we fear to return to them i think what scares us is not remembering not knowing our own lives being strangers to ourselves ii understand rialus said that must be likelike when the old in my land lose their minds and memories not just like it of course because they forget yesterday and remember fifty years ago but the same sort of thing sabeer you are like us your immortality hasnt made you different at all youre just like dont be silly she said she propped herself up on her elbow and pressed her finger to his lips to silence him rialus silver tongue thats what we should call you always trying to save your people she smiled and leaned close enough to kiss him i like you rialus silver tongue but when we reach your lands ill take to the field of battle with my kinsmen just as weve planned you cant change that she pulled her finger away but rialus felt it still as if it had left a brand on his lips an old bitter wound already scarred over what was he doing in bed with this creature listening to her talking to her aroused by her and for a moment understanding her fool rialus he tried to remember gurta instead she had wrapped around him like this also but she had done it with true love for him she had said so many times gurta i wont let them have you you know rialus i can see the beauty in your race ive had quota lovers you know theres no shame in it she circled her finger on the soft skin of his inner elbow smiling at some revelry this line of conversation brought back to her no shame at all i even like you rialus though thats strange youre not well a specimen considered attractive by your race are you no one ever called you handsome did they she was a vile barbarian woman he could have found a hundred ways to insult her instead he heard himself say no no one ever called me handsome rialus sabeer said my poor leagueman i dont think youre handsome either but i like you youll always have a place with me after all this is over and your world is ours you should come stay with me in some palace somewhere you can bring your woman too where do you think i should take a palace you never will rialus thought you and all your kind will die first ill make sure of it tell me about the best of them she prompted nudging him tell me things youve not told devoth and despite the thoughts that played inside his mind he began you should see calfa ven in the senival mountains its a hunting lodge oh hunting that sounds good if we go there together ill use you for target practice he swore out loud he said or the cliff palaces of manil palaces on cliffs wonderful ill push you from them and watch you fall into the sea sabeer squirmed against him tell me more and he did he could not help himself of course he said theres the isle of acacia itself chapter five aliver akaran reached out and touched the statues chin he traced the talayans jawline he brushed his fingertips over the full lips and caressed the cleanshaven crown of its head all so very lifelike down to the finest detailsthe texture of the skin and eyelashes the expression of focused engagement the collarbones and lean runners chest and the muscled compartments of its legs it stood frozen in a posture of motion iron spear high in the fingers of one hand the other arm was wrapped above the bicep by an arm ring a tuvey band aliver recalled i know you the prince said we once ran together he said this and knew it to be true it warmed him but he also understood that this figure was only a work of wood and iron and fabric the others spaced out along the lamplit hallway were as well the senivalian wore scaled armor and hefted a curved sword with a brawny arm the vumu warriors eagle feathers flared from a band around his head the various acacians in different military garb their faces like aliverslight brown even featured with a haughty lift to their chins and sagely dark eyes there was even a meinish soldier blond and gray eyed his nose and cheekbones sharp a tuft of gold bristled on his chin i know you aliver said we once fought each other again it was true and not true so many things were true and not true looking back down the corridor that led to his boyhood room aliver saw not just the scene before him dimly lit and quiet with the dead of night but also a thousand other views of this same place he saw it in the morning light and by the afternoon glare from the skylights muted by gray skies and crimson when the setting sun shone through the western windows he saw it with the eyes of the child who ran down the corridor light on his feet and full of play he saw it as the youth he was on the day his father died striding straightbacked and very foolish in his pride he saw it filled with the people who had once moved through life with him i know you all the same sensation surrounded him as he sat in his old room he ran his hand over his silken bedspread he picked up the statue of telamathonhe who had defeated the god reelos and his five disciplesand felt the mans face with fingers he studied the tapestries on the wall and the busts of the early kings facing east to greet the morning sun his room had remained furnished as he remembered almost as if it had been preserved for his return he knew it had not been nobody had expected his return least of all him but he was here body and mind and with each passing hour he became more and more himself less and less whatever he had been it felt almost like his flesh and skin were shrinking to fit his form just now growing snug around him whatever corinn had done to bring him back to life should not have been attempted he knew that as surely as he had ever known anything but it was done and he could only live with it just how to live he was not sure wandering about the palace seemed to be helping though he rose and continued he could not have explained how he knew where to find the boy he simply rose and looked and looking he knew he entered the room as a servant came out of it surprised by his presence she slammed herself against the doorjamb and stood straight as a board as he approached much the same reaction the other servants gave him when he encountered them he studied her softfeatured face a moment not recognizing it but finding it pleasant and then he nodded as he passed by her into the bedroom aaden a child of eight lay on his bedspread dressed in silken green bedclothes he curled to one side his knees pulled up and his hands clasped together something about the posture looked choreographed too precise to be natural perhaps the servant had just repositioned him yes that was it they were caring for him as he slept aliver sat beside him he felt as if he already knew the boy as if he could sit without fear that the boy would think it a trespass as if he had spent time with him already he had not corinn had always delayed their meeting but she was gone for the time being a good thing too he was coming to know himself and the present world faster without the tightly wound energy swirling about her to contend with when will you wake he asked i should like us to talk just us for a time i was a boy like you once a prince promised the world no doubt youve been lied to for your own good theyll believe but nothing good comes from lies not even wellintentioned ones one thing they dont tell you is that the world is not truly yours you are but a part of it you have been born not to be served by it but to serve it at least thats how it felt with me perhaps your birth into this family is no accident you may be the greatest of us all greatest of them all was that his idea strange to feel it anchored in him though he knew nothing of this boy beyond his parentage corinn had said something about aadens greatness she had said many things and she had not said many things aliver was aware of both their conversations had created an unease that itched at the edge of his awareness he could not find a way to draw it nearer or to pull it over himself and inhabit it as some part of him wanted to even when she had said things he did not agree with he was powerless to truly object a few days ago before she left for teh she had told him that she believed the santoth had reached out to her she claimed that they had spoken to her through people in her dreams once i wouldnt have thought that possible she had said she sat sharing the late evening with him the fire had burned to glowing coals and grown warmer for it he watched her fingers as they kneaded a lacy shawl squeezing and letting go squeezing and letting go but now anything is possible anything at all what do they say aliver asked promises entreaties she did not look at aliver she seemed almost to be carrying on both sides of their conversation herself they ask and ask and promise its all quite jumbled really what do they ask they ask me to rescind their banishment bring them back to acacia and give them the song of elenet they act like its theirs and what do they promise theyre vague on that to be my army of sorcerers to protect me from forces i dont understand as if i need them for that perhaps you do they cared for me corinn i went in search of them a foolish thing to do they helped us win the war so i dont fault you too much for it but it was the song itself we needed not other singers of it perhaps she knew best his thoughts were still cloudy on his past life and yet in the end i didnt find them they found me that was exactly right he had thought they were stones he would have died just a few feet from them had they not risen and saved him they wanted only to be released from banishment and to study the givers tongue again i know that much corinn said theyre desperate for my book too desperate wouldnt you be desperate too this brought her gaze up imagine if he could get no further with corinns eyes on him intense and flashing warning his words clipped off as if his throat had been squeezed shut for a moment he did not breathe then he gasped and knew that he had breath it was only words that could not pass his lips corinn looked back to the shawl in her lap theyve left me alone recently im glad of it my dreams are cluttered enough without them we dont need them tinhadin didnt i dont but what if no i am right she said leave it at that before the reverberation of her words had completely faded he believed she was right it was a relief in a way so much confused doubt replaced by her certainty he was not even sure what he had been about to say oh look at this corinn plucked at something on the shawl a slipped stitch she tugged on the yarn pinched between her fingers it slipped free easily she clicked her tongue on the roof of her mouth a reprimand for whoever had knitted it then after a studied pause she continued ripping the stitches out s itting beside aaden now aliver sighed thinking of his sister fatigued him and exhilarated him at the same time he could make no sense of it yet he reached out and stroked strands of wavy hair back from the childs forehead he was handsome how could a child of corinns not be i do wish you would wake and speak to me but you cant i should speak to you how about a story would you like a story aliver stretched out next to him lets see and tell stories he did not just one several he told of the girl kira who had one magical gift she could fold bits of paper into winged shapes and toss them into the air turning them into living birds it was a simple talent that she thought largely useless until she learned better he told of an adventure bashar had while hunting his brother in talay how he fell into a deep pit and could escape only with the aid of a legless man who climbed on his back and described the way out for him he told bits and pieces as he recalled them from his own childhood and he told half the tale of aliss the aushenian woman who killed the madman of caraven only half though for he realized at some point that the ending was a bloodier thing than he wished to describe to a sleeping boy he talked long enough that his voice grew hoarse and he fell into a long ruminative silence staring at the ceiling and listening to the boys quiet breathing eventually when the pipers played the passing of a third hour aliver swung his legs to the floor and rose sleep peacefully my nephew wake soon he had just started away when the boys eyes fluttered open he looked at aliver his irises were meinish gray a startling contrast with the fullness of their acacian shape he worked his mouth a moment licked his lips ii had dreams it did not occur to aliver to be surprised by his awakening he chose delight instead settling back on the edge of the bed he asked of what that i walked outside and the clouds were stones big stones floating really i dont think stones can float these ones could and i dreamed that the water floated out of the pools on the terraces and all the fish started swimming in the air and i could swim too so long as i was touching drops of floating water it was fun until i remembered about the hookfish when i remembered them i knew they were coming and fell down to the ground your dreams have a lot of floating in them not always once i was very thin aaden lifted his arms and shook them slightly demonstrating some aspect of his temporary thinness and one time i could eat anything i mean anything i could just bite the wall and chew it and the bedspread and the lamp oil anything nothing tasted like much but i could still eat it that would be convenient in many ways yes it would when youre fighting a war it would make it easier to supply the troops if they could just eat anything stones grass and stuff aliver grinned that would be an advantage but only if the enemy could not do the same no they couldnt aaden said as if he had thought that through already he looked up at the ceiling clearly considering something else and weighing whether or not to voice it i dreamed that my friend devlyn got killed oh aliver squeezed the boys wrist gently that was not a dream or it was not only a dream i know i hoped you would say it was though i wish you had i would have believed it if you said it who are you aliver leaned closer i am your uncle youre not dariel aaden said hes gone across the gray slopes i dont claim to be dariel im aliver aaden let out an audible breath of affirmation of course you are did mother bring you back aliver nodded are you going to get them who my guards the ones who stabbed devlyn i saw them do it for no reason they wanted to kill me too is he really dead i believe so aliver said i know that he is yes im not sure how i know but i do i know a lot of things aaden but theyre new to me its like i just discovered a new library of books i have them theyre mine but i havent read all the books yet it may take me some time a gasp drew their attention the maid stood inside the door her mouth an oval around a question she could not manage to speak she tried several times then turned and darted out of the room shell be back soon i think aliver said aaden sighed will she get mother no your mother has gone to teh she was angry at all the numrek not just the guards who hurt you and devlyn i believe she went to punish them good theres no excuse for such behavior what is she going to do to them aliver ran his hand over the boys hair what would you have her do to them i dont know aaden said they killed devlyn he was my friend that was wrong of them aaden pressed his lips together nodded why did they do that he didnt do anything except be my friend all of sudden as if the grief of it had just exploded in him aaden crumpled forward falling against aliver he was my only friend aliver held the boy to his chest as he cried stroking his hair so aaden had not inherited his greatgrandfathers gift of being loved by all his peers gridulan was the last acacian monarch to have a band of brothers with him always loyal and adoring if the stories of them were to be believed leodan had only his traitorous chancellor thaddeus clegg aliver himself might have had melio as a close companion but he had been too foolish to accept the youths overtures with the sincerity with which they were offered at least aaden knew to call a friend a friend your mother will take care of them he said she told me she would treat them fairly good aaden said a bitter edge cutting through his grief she should kill them all this drew aliver up kill them all was that the boys idea of fairness or was it his mothers he knew the answer immediately and with it came a greater understanding of the ruler his sister must have become and the sort of mother as well he could not decide how to respond so he held the boy until his sorrow spent itself as he did his horror at the boys wish for vengeance lost its acute shape and blurred at the edges he found it hard to grasp eventually aaden pulled away from him looking exhausted in addition to miserable i think im tired the boy lay down resting his head on his pillow in the indentation already pressed into it when i get up we have to go find elya elya you dont know elya she saved me she is a dragon well of sorts a dragon a lizard a bird all of them together im not sure what to call her other than a dragon though what do you think i dont know aliver admitted i havent thought much about dragons i heard an aushenian tale about dragons before i think it was a scaly creature that kralith their white crane god fought against for some reason i never thought there really was a white crane god so i never gave much thought to dragons either you will shes wonderful she flies mena found her and brought her here where is mena where was mena just framing the question did something inside him he did not have the answer immediately but having put the query in words he felt it leave him and hook into the fabric of the world he did not know but he felt he could know he could if he waited for it just as he had learned his way around the palace simply by remembering it just as he had known where aaden slept simply because he had wondered it and felt the answer as accessible as the air around he could not touch it not grasp it but he could inhale it the answers to things were there for him if he breathed them in she is north of here aliver said in the cold shes gone to make war shes taken the kings trust aaden squinted at him you just said you didnt know where she was a few moments ago you said that now you know im not as i was before you were dead before exactly and now youre not just so aaden pursed his lips considered decided i like you better alive aliver smiled what else do you know i can hear the maid returning aliver said with reinforcements the next moment rhrenna rushed into the room followed by a jumble of othersservants and physicians and officials the room fell instantly into chaos chapter six kelis of umae feared that the santoth would be so conspicuous that they would announce their presence to all talay as he shen benabe naamen and leeka marched up from the far south the silent hooded figures trailed behind them they blurred when they moved and had faces only at a distance near at hand they became less distinct not more though he spent days near them kelis was never sure how many there were he tried counting them but he got lost found them blending together realized he could not remember if he had counted that individual or not their silence was more unnerving than anything it was not simply the absence of noise it was as if they absorbed the sound around them because of this his head often snapped up seeking them feeling as if something had been stolen from the fullness of the world in the area they occupied was he wrong for not trusting them he could not say shen treated them like an escort of loved uncles aliver had spent time among these same phantoms they had welcomed him loved him mourned him and even avenged his death no matter how horrible their violence in battle against hanish meins forces they had fought for aliver for the akarans they had saved countless talayan and acacian lives that counted for a great deal kelis just wished they didnt make his skin crawl when they crossed the shallow river that marked the boundary of the far south kelis tried his best to weave through the loose netting of small villages and herding communities without making human contact shen looked at him skeptically at times benabe did the same at others he directed them without explaining when they could not help but thread a rocky band of hills via a valley that spilled down into the halaly town of bida kelis took naamen off from the others and conferred with him i dont know what will happen when we pass through the town be ready for anything the young man touched his sheathed dagger with his strong arm i am shen thinks nothing of meeting other people but even the halaly have eyes to see i dont know what they will make of the santoth or what the santoth will do in return if the people fear them they may allow us to pass or not should we speak to the old man about this leeka alain is of two worlds now he doesnt understand this one fully anymore i would not share too much with him just be prepared to meet whatever happens were guardians we dont make shens decisions we just protect her as best we can yes naamen said i cant remember when i had any other purpose surprisingly neither could kelis the townspeople of bida built their houses out of volcanic stone irregular shapes that they secured together with a concrete made from ashwhite sand from a distance the town looked like a herd of spotted ruminants grazing among the acacia trees as they descended toward it kelis and naamen led the way with shen benabe and leeka a little distance behind the shifting wake that were the santoth was behind them all the first villagers they passed were herdsmen driving longhorned bulls they had full round halaly faces dark in a way different from the talayans their expressionless stares offered neither hospitality nor aggression they let their eyes flick back to the mother and daughter and then they looked beyond them one said something to the other in what must have been a local dialect they carried on switching at the bulls to keep them on course kelis turned to watch amazed to see the three men and their bulls walk straight through the gathered host of sorcerers the santoth flowed forward without pause allowing a pathway among them to open so that the villagers passed without even noticing them a little farther on near the entrance to the town proper a man peeled away from the defensive wall and stepped into their path he held a spear a twin for keliss own with its fingerthin shaft and long flat spearhead all one piece of iron do you know thirst he asked kelis answered i do but there is water in the sky the man nodded his acceptance of this truth and kelis added we are passing through simply passing through the man would have been within his rights to ask a host of questions in response what were talayans doing walking out of the far south with a woman and a child why were they on halaly land who were all those hooded figures lurking behind them any of these simple as they were would have been knotted traps to answer and kelis felt the responses he had already composed like dry sand on his tongue the sensation was such that it took him a moment to understand what the man was saying as he described where the public well was offering them water if they needed it he said that the market would close soon but that if they hurried they could purchase food for their journey kelis stared at him naamen actually had to tug his arm to get him to move thats strange naamen said once they were among the houses of the village what is benabe asked that were being followed by a host of undead ancient sorcerers or that nobody seems to see them i told you nothing bad would happen shen piped they passed through the village drawing no more curiosity than a small group of strangers would normally merit they took water from the deep well it was clear and sweet in the market stalls they purchased twists of dried antelope meat powdered kive leaves of bitter tea and a long chain of purple peppers that naamen wore around his neck like jewelry benabe chose beads to string into a bracelet for shen all the while the santoth trailed them unseen by the villagers they crowded the streets wove around and through stalls brushed past people who gave them no more notice than they would the touch of a breeze kelis tried not to look at them but it was hard not to the santoth took more notice of the villagers than the villagers did of them one santoth stopped in the entranceway of a hut and stared in for a long chilling moment before moving on a few others seemed to fall out of the collective flow and linger among the shop stalls running their shrouded hands across the food items one stood just inches in front of a talking woman the hooded figure so close that the womans breath ruffled the sorcerers hood keliss heart beat faster than if he had been running one child suddenly spun around and ran into the wall of santoth he went right through them and the santoth walked forward with only a ripple of disturbance to mark the boys impact it was only after when kelis caught sight of him again that the child stood touching his chest with the fingers of one hand looking around puzzled kelis kept the group moving his heartbeat did not slow until they were well away from the village moving into the safety of the plains once again t he sight of umae glowing gray under moonlight was the most tranquilly beautiful thing kelis had seen in ages his home his base for so many years where his family still resided a place filled with memoriesincluding many of aliver he approached it alone having left the others a few days journey away fearing sinper ous interference he did not want them anywhere near the town if anything happened to himif he did not return at a set timethe others were to carry on north at all haste he walked into the sleeping town like a thief which is just what the village dogs would take him for if they heard saw or smelled him he circled around so that the wind blew his scent away from the village he knew the route to sangaes enclosure and made his way to it in and out of the shadows around huts and along storehouse walls stealthily stopping often to listen to the night sounds he passed right by his mothers garden wall running his hand over the sunbaked bricks and whispering a greeting to her the dog that confronted him as he passed the mouth of adi vayeens hut he had known from its birth he chirruped and swept his hand out in the greeting he often used with canines the dog found his hand and pressed against his leg kelis scratched it for a time despite all the familiarity keliss fingers trembled as he stood in the lane beside sangaes sleeping structure he plucked the thin curtain a hanging wall swaying on the nights breath he flicked it with a motion meant to mimic a gust of wind in the time it took the curtain to fall back into place he scanned the room he crawled through the opening sangae lay sleeping on his side on a woven mat he was alone as was his way in recent years since his first wife had died and he had found most restful sleep in solitude kelis had only moved a step closer when the old mans eyes snapped open they fixed on kelis who must have been a featureless silhouette against the startouched fabric of the opening kelis said father forgive the night its darkness the old man took a moment to respond i do for the night air is cool kelis me sangae pushed himself up to sitting and received keliss embrace he squeezed him tight for a moment and then pulled back he ran his fingers over the younger mans features you are living i am we all are shen as well light a lamp so we can see sangae whispered motioning toward a tea lamp on the floor beside him keep it low there is danger here no lets move farther inside first a few minutes later the two men sat facing each other on low stools in the compounds storage shed the lamp cast a yellow glow that etched their features from below around them were the large vases shelves of household goods and stacks of grain sacks sangae had called softly for his dogs and tethered them to guard the shed kelis told of their strange journey to the far south sangae listened brewing a tiny pot of tea above the lamp as he did so kelis found words pouring out of him he had not realized he had held so much in running from the laryx pack with shen strapped to his back mountains that moved around them as if the land were sliding under their feet instead of they moving over it flocks of birds that flew above them like thrown darts only to crash down and die the way the peaks just ended one morning and the famous general leeka alain stood waiting for them alone in a desert walking still farther south until the santoth appeared stones whirling into sand and taking shen with them for a time then bringing her back and announcing that they would all march to confront the queen that was wise the old man said when kelis explained that he had left the rest of the party in hiding well away from the village sinper ou has spies everywhere even here i fear he never trusted you ioma even less so do you know he began sending spies across the plains just after you left it ate at him that he had let the girl go he only let me come home because he thought he would catch me at something sangae poured a small saucer of bush tea and offered it to kelis the man took it and sipped ou has many friends kelis and many more wish to be his friend money such as his has bought many eyes shen has friends of her own the santoth i mean they have come with us they want to stop corinn from doing harm with her magic they feel it shen told me and know she is opening rips in the world or something sangae worked his mouth but found nothing to say i doubt any could take shen from them against their will i dont know what the santoth are i dont know what they really want i have been with them weeks now but they dont reveal themselves shen trusts them though but then you must too i dont he heard himself say ive tried but i cant trust them why kelis clicked his tongue off the roof of his mouth i dont know they feel wrong they never speak a word because their tongues are dangerous you know that perhaps the time has come for them to rejoin the world if corinn could teach them she might become incredibly powerful another tinhadin that would have frightened me before but listen there is something else sangae placed his old coarse hand over keliss and squeezed forgive me for not saying this first i wanted to hear your words before clouding your mind with this it may not be true but many believe it people are saying that aliver lives they say corinn brought him back to life using the song word came just last week anywhere north of here has heard already pilgrims are rushing to acacia so was a portion of keliss mind his thoughts flew out of him in such a rush that his body was left momentarily empty there is no better time to take shen and the santoth to acacia it may resolve everything sinper ou is still a danger but if you get shen to her father he will be no threat you must take her just as they asked you to stay in your small group keep the santoth hidden join the pilgrims converging on acacia and announce shen directly to aliver and if he has not really returned sangae worked his fingers into the wrinkled skin of his forehead pray to the giver that he has i feel that the fate of the world depends on him once more chapter seven standing before a gathering of bocoums merchants barad the lesser knew exactly what he wanted to say he had rehearsed the words inside his head both waking and in his dreams he would tell them this the akaran dynasty was founded on acts of evil deep in the cushion of the royal chairs is the blood of two brothers slain by another brothers hand its a nation built on the split between old friends one that sent the other into exile its the product of a man driven so mad by the power of his sorcery that he banished his companions from the land to punish them for raising him up a people has but two choices when faced with such dreadful truth deny it and live sucking at the tit of the lie like infants or face it with the open eyes of adults and if you face it what then only one possibility you must dismantle the lie you must tear down all the things built on it for they are corrupted and will bring you down ere you look away the merchants listened applauded him praised the queen and thanked him for his words days later speaking to the rich of manil he decided to say this you may ask me why must i change what has worked so well why must i cast my wealth and pride and history onto the ground i say to you that you have no wealth you have no pride you have no true understanding of history these things you cling to are vapors in guise of truth a man cannot eat vapor a woman cannot wrap vapor around herself and find warmth a child cannot wake in the night and rush to vapor for solace and you may say to me my mother lived and died like this my grandfather lived and died like this the world thinks my nation is supreme what madness that you want me to turn from that how do i rebut those words with a certainty that certainty is that each and every crime and lie and falsehood will be returned to you with interest you may say prove it i have only to point north to do so that is what treads toward us across the ice not foreign invaders not the whim of fate not horrors set against us without reason what treads toward us are the living forms of our years and years of folly and injustice the rich of manil offered him toasts in his honor before a meeting of the acacian senate in aleciacalled into session specifically to hear himhe intended to roar and did there is but one thing to do we must tear apart the lies we must shred the swaddling clothes we were born into pull back from the delusion stand naked and afraid for just long enough to reorder the world as it rightly should be it will be hard it will be painful it will be a trial like none we have faced but we will emerge closer to the true beings we all wish to be we will be kindred among the jubilant faces that applauded him as he exited the chamber barad saw hunt the kindred representative from aos he was still closelipped and grave barad wanted to rush to him but instead he walked by turning his face away as he neared why did i do that he wondered even as his feet moved him away when he was done with each of these speeches when he had no more words and his bass voice went silent when he dropped his animated gestures and looked through his stone eyes at the faces his words had worked miracles on he knew that he had not said any of the things he had intended to instead he had praised the queen he had sung her praises and reinforced the empires shackles somehow she controlled each word spoken through his mouth each destination she had chosen each time he turned his strides in a specific direction it was following a path she had laid out at times the words he uttered were his own but only for short moments on occasion barbed comments and asides and even criticisms of the queen escaped his lips in his first days he had thought he could build on these string them together so that he might explain his true sentiments but he managed only to weave a folksy familiar humor in with the comments nor could he express how much he loved the people to whom he preached something he was reminded of at every turn he recognized the faces of the farmers north of danos they were the same ones among whom he had shepherded king grae of aushenia now as he spoke to them he could see in their faces how they struggled to twin his former message with whatever it was he now espoused in bocoum an elderly woman fixed him with her bloodshot eyes her face ridged with some great effort of comprehension he so wanted to explain everything to her instead he had pressed his lips together as he turned and walked away watching as his boat sailed out of alecias harbor he saw the rocks from which children swam with dolphins he caught a splash of spray on his fingertips and touched them to his lips this was a land to love peopled by souls who had never yet been allowed to be fully themselves though he returned to acacia full of dread even the sight of the isle itself reminded him of this to his eyes the island and the sky the moving sea and the leaping creatures in it were all gradations of stone different textures of a granite world solid stone here liquid stone there a stone as transparent as vapor there and stone as glistening as a wet dolphins back there he saw with a clarity no different from before but it was a clarity of sand and rock of white and gray and black in his dreams the world was as it had been sometimes so vibrantly colored that he gasped himself awake with the joy of seeing it awake into his gray curse of world the way acacia thrust up through the turquoise sea layer upon terraced layer climbing ever higher so full of color each spire a jewel trying to outshine its peers as it pierced the belly of the sky how could the heart of a nation so corrupt be so terribly beautiful how could a world he had lived in for so many years continue to astonish confound defeat him how could he see one thing and remember another each and every minute of his imprisoned freedom it was maddening but he should not have been surprised the queen had told him it would be this way weeks ago when she leaped at him and grasped his head in her hands he had lifted his hand to smash her he would have done it except that she slipped her fingers into his eyes and pressed on her lips and in those fingers hummed a power that took away the connection between his will and his ability to act on it his anger did not die within him but the fist raised to crush her recognized no kinship with it it hung there a moment until the fingers opened and the hand came to rest gently on her arm she whispered your mind is mine in answer he formed curses behind his lips refutations a litany of condemnation when his lips moved they said yes he heard this and screamed no but his lips said yes n o longer a pariah barad could wander wherever he wished in the palace even up to the higher terraces near the royal quarters he was trapped but to all the world he looked to be a free man he could follow his feet wherever they cared to take him clearly the queen had given instructions that he was to be indulged like some dignitary of high rank when he was on the island but he could not form actions from any desires contrary to the queens wishes he might decide to leave the island and flee into hiding but he would forget his mission after only a few steps one time he even imagined his own death instead of using the knife he had chosen for the purpose on his own flesh he peeled an apple because of this curse he was sitting on a bench in the center of the maze work of canals listening to the gurgling fountain and watching the slowmoving piscine forms gliding through the water beneath him he was exactly where the queen wished him to be he knew it and he could do nothing about it rhrenna sat beside him scribbling notes on a sheaf of parchment a successful trip i would say the queen will be pleased with you barad pulled his gaze from the water and rolled his eyes toward her the effort of moving the stone orbs was considerable it fatigued him more than moving his large frame through the world and if he moved them too much he developed headaches that lasted for days there was an advantage to them though at times they saw with a clarity his old eyes never had it was not a matter of visual acuity really it was more that they translated the truth more completely as if he read emotions and thoughts as clearly as he saw the features that hid them he cleared his throat to avoid responding to her comment he would have told her that he hated the queen not cared that she be pleased he would have spat at her and called her a servant of suppression a deluded tool of an evil mistress but none of it would come out as he intended did you meet any of your former conspirators any of the kindred as you called them in manil yes he heard himself answer hunt came down from aos and he thought me insane barad said rhrenna smiled an expression that pressed her pale blue eyes nearly closed yes but for an insane man you speak such wisdom im sure thats what affronted him what affronted him barad said is that the kindred has crumbled he blames me word of my support for the queen spreads beyond me like a disease more like a cure a contagious cure rhrenna folded her hands on her writing board and studied the sky thin strips of cloud scalloped the blue the air had a touch of cold in it the chill that passed for autumn on the island the queen will be pleased with you when she returns barad noticed that one of the slivers of hard charcoal rhrenna wrote with had fallen to the bench while she still looked up he placed his large hand over it when will she return a week or two at most her campaign was a complete success i got a bird last night she is recovering from her exertions and will soon be on her way back she would have been back sooner had she not fallen ill after destroying the numrek it was quite taxing on her you should hear the things people are saying about her now she destroys whole armies none can stand against her is that true can none stand against her rhrenna wrinkled her sharp small nose before answering none that i know of she massacred your people he thought he knew better than to try and say it so he just held on to the thought and stared his stone gaze he tightened his hand around the charcoal until he held it in his fist dont look at me like that rhrenna said youre not the first person to have to bend to her will we all do you should find peace with it i have barad we live in truly wondrous times rhrenna set her parchments to the side and stood you may not love our queen but if anyone is capable of leading us now she is look we have princely visitors aliver and aaden entered the gardens barad had not yet seen aliver but he knew him instantly uncle and nephew walked side by side talking softly with the winged creature a few steps behind them the princes saw them waved and quickened their pace the creature hung back moving off along the edge of the canals peering into the water as she stepped gently like some benevolent hunter barad knew she was a wonder spoken of all around the empire but it was the risen prince that truly fascinated him he looked just as barad had imagined him young slim and leanly muscled his posture upright and his motions casually regal he wore the same face barad had seen breaking through his mist dreams years ago as the rebellion against hanish mein grew in power he knew that when he spoke it would be with a voice he already knew the same one that had encouraged him with the power of the truth if any man had ever been his king this one had barad did what he did then without even knowing he was about to barad the lesser he who had spoken for years of the fallacy of monarchal rule fell forward he landed hard upon his knees and bent farther still until he pressed his face against alivers thin boots he heard the prince bid him rise thats not necessary he said really barad you have no need to bow to me he should too bow the young prince aaden said he was my mothers enemy we could have killed him was rhrenna stressed he was our enemy but is not anymore no aliver said he touched barad on the shoulder worked his fingers under him and pulled him to stand he was never an enemy not truly barad looked up at the princes face he wanted to tell him that he had heard his voice in his dreams many times years ago his voice had saved him had given him purpose had spurred him to rise to revolt in kidnaban he wanted to admit all these things instead he said praise to the queen for she has brought back the dead this seemed to underwhelm aliver barad he started but then thought better of it glancing at aaden yes praise the queen she brings much life doesnt she you should see how she made water in the desert aaden piped barad took his seat on the bench again and sat listening to the easy banter between aliver and aaden with rhrenna playing the third aaden reported that he had just shown his uncle elyas eggs they were near to hatching he thought he even saw them move inside the hard casing of their shells theyre just waiting for mother to return he declared the thought of that return ran a shiver of dread through barad but he knew it did not show on the outside aliver reminisced about when he was a boy and had swum the tunnels that connect one pool to the next he had discovered that the pools were all part of one system if he held his breath long enough he could vanish in one area swim through the darkness and emerge in another canal one that looked from above to be separate i could do that aaden said my breath is good oh i dont know aliver said sizing him up i was older than you before i tried it but im a better swimmer how exactly do you know that i just do aliver made a sour face perhaps a wager is in order aaden jumped at the suggestion its too cold rhrenna said hell catch a chill its nearly winter your highness aliver blinked at her and whispered the pools hold the summers heat a little longer than youd expect one last swim wont hurt anyone as the two princes talked through the details aliver pointing and gesturing pacing a bit as he recalled the way the tunnels worked barad wondered why the queen had brought him back to life surely not just to play with her son was there some part of her that was truly willing to face alivers ideology of the world he could not imagine that perhaps she had changed him already made him into yet another mouthpiece to speak her words he saw none of the hesitation with words that he himself felt no hint of frustration barad peered at him bringing the full pressure of his stone gaze on him there was something beneath the skin of his face something not physical and yet tangibly there features that slipped beneath alivers facade like another face pressed against the thin barrier of his skin just for a moment and then it was gone beneath the princes face there was another face or another version of his face all right then aaden lets settle this bet aliver said he began unbuttoning his shirt in nothing but his breeches a few moments later aliver dove into the water much to aadens delight the boy leaped in so near the prince he would have landed on him had the man not ducked under water barad turned to rhrenna he tried to say out loud the words his mind would not let him form in his head he knew what he had seen and should have been able to speak it it was corinns doing another abomination it was just there if he could point it out to her she would see it too he grasped her by the wrist and said with all the gravity he could muster the queens work is a blessing to us all no thats not it he tried to slam his hand down on the stone but only managed to gesture vaguely toward the princes rhrenna nodded isnt it amazing life from death makes you wonder what else corinn will do she gently pulled free of his grasp gathered her things and walked away crisp in her steps looking official once more alone on the bench barad remembered the charcoal he was not a very skilled writer having learned to read only later in life but he knew enough to scratch a brief message he began to write prince aliver we are both enslaved he imagined letters forming on the stone he saw them side by side spelling out his true intent when he finished he could feel his heart beating in his chest this could do it he had only to wave aliver over and have him read the message that would break through he knew it would he tried to catch alivers eye but the prince did not see him he would have to stand he did so glancing back at his message as he rose he froze only half standing the words he had written were prince aliver we are both saved barad lowered himself back to the stone he smeared the words with the flat of his hand and let the charcoal fall from his fingers his heart which had been so profoundly happy a moment before seemed to die within him he watched the princes swim and splash each other dive and chase fish aaden shouted the impromptu instructions of a newly imagined tunnel game aliver added to them with enthusiasm looking like a boy of exactly the same age watching alivers face as he treaded water barad saw the vague motion beneath his skin again aaden could not see it nobody could only he with his accursed stone eyes not even aliver knew he doesnt know that he is trapped inside himself and i cant tell him i cant tell anybody chapter eight melio sharratt watched clytus exit the tavern the thatch hanging from the roof brushed his hair as he emerged leaving him no more or less neatly coiffed for it clytus strode over and stood beside melio with his thick arms crossed and shoulders bunched with muscle and his weathered face one notch down from a full scowl he seemed more like a figure to fear than like one who needed to be cautious once he had been one of dariels close friends a brigand then and still now he said hes here melio asked will he talk clytus cleared his throat and brushed the hard knuckles of one hand along his chin yeah hell talk he answered sliding his gaze over to study a group of children playing a betting game with seashells melio nearly said that nobody on the street was paying them the slightest bit of attention but this was not his territory he had been out of that since corinn sent him south on the ballan all the way around the far south and back up along the western coast of talay in the company of some of dariels old brigand crew clytus captained the ship now with old nineas still as the chief pilot and geena in command of the crew strange the way the passing of time made enemies friends folding one thing in upon another so that it was hard to imagine the old order of things dariel going by the name spratling had once pirated the coast south of here a criminal in the eyes of hanish meins authority now he was a prince of the empire and the brigands who had once been his lawless crew sailed in service to the crown although now he was an absent prince missing in a faraway land perhaps no longer among the living all right come in clytus said grudgingly as if it were against his better judgment lets get this over with as he slipped beneath the overhanging thatch melio reflexively grasped for the hilt of his sword to rest his hand there and feel the tilt of the sheath trailing him like a tail he had to settle for gripping his leather belt instead his sword was back on the ballan with the rest of his things prominent weapons were not allowed in the taverns of the coastal towns he did however carry a smaller one unseen by the eyes of the tavern guard who looked them over as they passed melio followed clytus back through the dim room lit only by the candles at each table and torches along the rear wall where young men poured ale the air oozed with the scent of it mixed with pipe smoke and the pungency of garlic the table they stopped at was no different from the others a circle centered around a thickwicked candle the yellow glow lit two men in sharp highlights one of them rose and moved away when they arrived without so much as a glance up clytus turned and followed the man only turning back when he had seated himself at another table the second man had stayed put large bone earrings shaped like primitive fishhooks dangled from his ears his beard covered only his chin and had been oiled to a curving tip something he kept shaped with caressing fingers his face behind all that was forgettable if melio had turned away and had to describe him he would only be able to recall the earrings beard the oily fingers this is kartholome gilb formerly a small ship pilot for the league now what are you now im between employers at the moment working for myself a brigand then kartholome dipped his head in acceptance of the title clytus already told me who you are sharratt if you want a drink youll have to get it yourself ale only we dont drink the leagues wine here when neither man moved he leaned back on his stool and motioned with his hand that they should feel free to sit so clytus says youve come all the way from the monkeys pucker itself what brings you to tivol if its whores you want youve come to the right place though im disappointed i take it the princess doesnt do the interesting things royalty can be like that with a little coin any girl in town will play the princess for you though melio threw an angry look at clytus i thought you said he was ready to talk he is kartholome stop shifting crap with your tongue and lets get on to what we discussed but its not every day one meets the mighty steed a princess rides he doesnt look so melio lunged across the table so quickly that he had completed his attack and sat back in his seat before kartholome knew what had happened kartholome touched his nose the tip of which bloomed with a thin line of blood that quickly began to drip onto the table he murmured a curse but seemed more impressed than angry or pained melios hand lay on the wood resting over the hilt of the short knife he had just cut kartholome with clytus glanced around the tavern and then broke the short silence calm heads calm heads look kartholome melio sharratt isnt only a marah he trains marah understand that he moves different yeah walks upright and is a little delicate with his hands melio cocked an eyebrow but dont think that just because he talks like a toff that he couldnt remove your liver cut it up and feed it to you before you knew what you were eating hes not to be trifled with and the princess is not a topic hes interested in discussing clytus leaned forward through gritted teeth he said hes here in the service of the queen kartholome shrugged i was just making conversation he pinched the tip of his nose between his thumb and forefinger and seemed if anything more curiously amiable than he had been before receiving the injury all right assuming you let me keep my nose hairs lets talk about what you want to i want to know what happened to prince dariel in the other lands you dont ask much kartholome let go of his nose and dabbed it a few times then put pressure back on it what i heard is that the prince was an offering a deal sweetener the auldek just werent in the mood for making nice grouchy buggers they are melio stared at him what in the givers name are you talking about kartholome rolled his eyes and began again fine try to follow though sire neen didnt care a pear about dariel or about the akarans no leagueman does he also didnt give a pear about the lothan aklun hates them truth be told neen came up with a grand plan to get rid of both of them kill the lothan aklun with some poison or something and then he would go direct to the auldek you see it figured he would control both sides of the tradequota or mist or whatever it was going to be but like i said the auldek didnt like the look of him their chieftain chopped neen limb from limb and took a bath in his blood wouldnt have minded seeing that you you see any of this with your own eyes nah i never went across i worked the outer isles the thousands mostly that doesnt mean i dont know what happened thing like that people talk and dariel kartholome finally satisfied his nose was no longer bleeding released it and sat back the prince he was there when it happened neen was offering him to the auldek sort of a token of good faith here have a prince do with him what you will hes probably dead thoughmind i dont really credit thisone of the ishtat who survived claimed to have seen someone grab dariel not auldek not ishtat just someone guy that looked like a boar he was standing near the prince he said and the guy knocked into him as he passed do you believe this man kartholome dipped his eyes toward the table for a second you going to cut me again melio realized he had tightened his grip around his knifes small handle he released it lifted his palm and tented his fingers over the blue metal of the blade can i speak to him not a chance hes ishtat he talked too much even talking to me but they were all spooked pretty big todo if you ask me i wouldnt know where to find him even if i wanted to and he wouldnt talk to you anyway not a chance how do you come by this information i thought the league never let anyone get out of their fold you shouldnt even exist to be here talking to me the league scrubs their own decks no doubt about it the league used to use contractors for interisland stuff not anymore theyre keeping everything in the family now i just got lucky managed to get away before they permanently retired me if they knew i was alive i wouldnt be he grinned they think im dead and im happy with that look marah trainer ive got more reason to doubt you than the other way around im only talking because i know clytus after a moment he added and because i knew dariel in answer to melios questioning look clytus nodded kartholome smeared drops of semidried blood onto the tabletop with his finger anyway there are more than a few reasons to hate the league i could show you a few if youre up for it you all in the inner sea have no idea what goes on out here at least i hope you dont you know i dont thats why im here all right then lets go fishing tomorrow youll have to show me that knife trick though that was something didnt even see it coming what trick melio smiled his crooked smile i just misjudged the distance m elio had been on his share of dubious vessels in the inner seaand even rafted out as far as the vumu archipelago where he had found mena that wonderful day years ago still when they rowed through the breakers off tivol the next morning he had to swallow hard to keep his breakfast down the boat was too small he could jump from gunwale to gunwale it tookwhateight strides to teeter from the stern to the bow powered by a single square sail the boat skimmed across the water at a good clip faster than he liked considering the size of the gray slopes swell geena from the ballan joined them making for a crew of four a crowd in the tiny fishing skiff but the right number to look like they were working the yellowgill that passed between the mainland and the outer isles that in fact is what they did they spent the afternoon fishing the current that flowed through the channel tacking into the northerly wind the whole time league transports passed in the distance several times once a patrol clipper skimmed the horizon to the north they were in a loose flotilla of fishing boats though and the clipper paid them no mind melio lost himself in the work that was their cover baiting hooks throwing out lines keeping them from tangling and then hauling them back in turn the tiny eellike fish he had crooked onto the hooks came back as lean slivers the length of a mans arm sparkling silver there was no sign of the trait that gave them their name until they were unhooked and gasping in the watersloshed bottom of the vessel each flare of the gills revealed a bright burst of yellow a vibrant hue that would have made a beautiful flower without knowing where the thought came from melio remembered mena he had letters from her wrapped in oiled paper and buckled tight within a case in his satchel back on the ballan he had read through them many times before for in the space of the reading he heard her voice and could imagine where she was and knew her to be safe that illusion held only when the written words spoke in her voice inside his head now on a small boat in the salt air of a vast ocean he knew that she could not have imagined he would be here so how could he have any true idea where she was what she was doing or who with alive or dead he hated it that he did not know he should just be able to feel her she should be able to speak his name and he should be able to answer what did miles matter between two people in love the league brig appeared as if it had emerged right out of the waters depths to the north of them heading southwest it looked to be at a safe passing distance but as it grew nearer its trajectory skimmed it closer figures appeared at the bow the glint of glass catching the light betrayed their spyglass kartholome growled bastards what theyve noticed us theyre too big to bastards the pilot leaped around the boat adjusting the sails clytus leaned on the rudder changing their tack so abruptly melio nearly pitched overboard cursing he spread himself low in the boat half soaked by the warm water sloshing among the fish and tackle and saltcaked old ropes a nervous bunch brigands melio mumbled looking back at the galley he noticed that a school of dolphins leaped and dove in the wave surge pushed out from the prow beautiful then the galleys bow veered toward them in earnest sails bowed as they caught a larger portion of the wind the ship leaned with the turn a sudden change by the big ships standards nothing to account for it as far as melio could see from peering over the gunwale especially as it brought them churning directly toward the fishing vessel ah geena appeared beside him grab on to something she said worming her way under the seat slats grab he did not need to be told twice he worked his hands under a beam pressed against others with his feet like that on his back he could not see the water anymore but he could see the frantic motions and darting eyes of the two seamen the vast rise of the galley bore down on them as tall as any building he had ever seen it came yawning at a slow rhythm out of time with the speed it traveled furl the sail clytus roared whether or not kartholome managed this melio did not get to see the hull of the ship pushed before it a curling fury of water the swell lifted the small boat up the wave curled over them terrifyingly smooth glass green and translucent frothed across the crest with white three dolphins leaped out of the glass and over the boat beautiful then the wave struck the vessel went over the hull bucked and the world tilted and water rushed in like a monster made of liquid muscle melio closed his eyes held his breath and clung as the boat churned over and over jolting and shuddering when it contacted the hull of the great ship for a time all was black motion his lungs began to burn water yanked and smacked him it felt like actual hands and fists battered him trying to get him to let go when the boat popped into the air again it did so with the bow pointed toward the sky twirling as water drained toward the stern melio clung to one of the low benches just as he began to doubt he could hold on any longer the bow smashed back down geena got jolted away from her hold one side of the boat dipped and a gush of water washed in it swept her with it dragging her along the gunwale she fought it clawing for purchase she began to slide overboard one arm upraised and flailing while the tongue of the sea slurped her in melio caught her by the wrist he braced his feet against the submerged gunwale and hauled back with everything he had she smashed into him their limbs entwined as melio scrabbled back toward the rear storage compartment geena in his grip she understood and crammed in next to him the two of them knotted together and stuck fast just as the boat passed into the swirling chaos rushing around the galleys rear end again the small boats stern submerged making the bow pirouette in the air above them melio watched it against the sky among the falling debris water glistened as it dropped the mast had snapped in half and the sail hung like a dead thing a tide of hissing bubbling air rose around them melio tried to breathe but the air was foaming water in his mouth he spit it out but it rushed in again he spit it out it rushed in again he gave up trying he closed his eyes and clung to geena chapter nine it could have been worse mor had been angry fuming and spitting venom on the verge of using those stubby nails of hers to rip new tracks across dariels face she danced through an improvised tribute to her anger one of her eyelids twitched out a rant of its own by the time it all ended dariel had admitted his fault and claimed to be chastened he swore he would never do something as foolish as sneaking alone into amratseer again eventually mor left her exasperation at dariels feet she ordered the others into motion and she told the prince to leave the pups behind he didnt chastened yes but not without some resolve it took them a full day to circumambulate amratseer by the second morning they cleared the semiorder of the agricultural region outside the city and plunged into inafeld forest it extended all the way north as far as anyone had been hemmed in at the west by the mountains of rath batatt tam claimed that they were following a route of sorts but it was one of many that the people had developed over the years not wanting to leave a traceable path to the sky isle they used a variety of trails each of them trodden on rarely enough that they betrayed few signs of actually being trails they wormed over and beneath tree roots along fallen oldgrowth trunks and through dank waterways stepping carefully on the mossheavy stones the forest grew thick enough that the sky was only a distant idea the pups did not make it any easier fully half the terrain was unmanageable for them before long dariel had given up on encouraging them forward and instead carried them in a sack slung over his back when he complained about the weight of them one afternoon birke took one and walked with it cradled like a baby in his arm youll have to name them you know yes i guess i will you must geld them not yet but before too long cut their balls off no i dont think thats scoop it up dariel birke cut in theyre cathounds male ones the anet used them to hunt lions in six months theyll be almost as tall as you are at least theyll be lighter without their balls be sane i saw their mother she was young they birth children young and the females are smaller anyway no dariel believe me youve got more on your hands than you know snip them i could do it for you if you like birke made his fingers into shears and demonstrated the ease of the action he smiled what should have been fearsomethe thick hair that covered his entire face the canine incisors that shone savagely through his grinusually managed to cheer dariel not so this time dariel reached for the pup i dont mind carrying him after all he still carried them both an hour later when they stepped into a clearing in the woods created by an enormous fallen tree a man stood atop it arms crossed and still blinking in the unaccustomed bright light it took dariel a moment to believe that he was really there mor shouted something to him in auldek the man responded and pointed to a route up onto the tree without a word of explanation mor led them up the man was slight of build his head was cleanshaven with a splattering of tattoos across his scalp patterning that dariel had not seen before so this is him the man asked switching to acacian there is much talk of him in avina the destroyer of the soul catcher the rhuin fa he studied the prince with a traders critical eye as if he were considering a purchase funny he just looks like common shivith clan not even ranked i hope he is what he promises i never promised anything dariel said the pups churned in the sack trying to get a view of the stranger dariel tried to stand without flinching but they really did have sharp claws and im standing right in front of you you could address me directly the man gave no sign that he heard him last word from avina was that the clans are squabbling and that league ships are patrolling the coastline more each week if this dariel akaran wishes to prove himself hell have ample opportunity and soon before dariel could respond mor asked tell me messenger why have you come with a message of course he drew himself up and spoke more formally i carry an elder within a voice meant for your ears mor said may the vessel never crack as she and the messenger moved away together dariel unslung his sack he poured the pups out onto the wide tree trunk across which they surged with bumbling enthusiasm greeting one person and then the next and then starting over again whats this about dariel asked birke once the others had settled down to wait birke stroked a puppys head the council sent him with a message about what well see shortly tam said laying out a spread of hard crackers and cucumbers on the tree bark he set out a wooden bowl above it he used his knife to cut off the bottom of a pleeberry a nondescript fruit brown slightly hairy and oblong the liquid inside it gushed out as he squeezed the length of it the juice looked like a collection of frog eggs blue tinted slimy the first time dariel had seen it he had gagged and stared in horror as the others drank it with relish some of your favorite drink dariel after having made a show of being disgusted by the frogegg look of the fruit pulp dariel had to admit he had grown to rather like it it was like drinking liquid sugar and the strange texture of the seeds had actually become his favorite aspect of it he took a slurp from the offered bowl rolling the slick orbs around on his tongue tam pulled his tiny instrument from his pack and began plucking it dariel watched mor and the messenger but could gather little from their distant exchange he thought he saw stiffening in mors spine an indication of anger but the next moment it melted into something softer as she gestured with her hands whats he mean he has an elder within him its quite a trick cant say i understand it really birke pushed one of the pups into dariels arms here take your pup i shouldnt handle them so much ill end up liking them have you named them yet the pup climbed happily enough into dariels lap churning in a circle around the geometry of his folded legs dariel stilled it with his hand rubbed under its chin and looked into its eyes they were the same color as its fur which was a reddishbrown soft short coat only the ridge along its back was different there the hair bristled back against the grain almost spiny it was the only part of him not completely adorable i was thinking of this one as scarlet scarlet birke asked thats no name for a cathound no what is then birke did not hesitate ripper killer punisher jaws of death tam said devothrigrazik offered anira it means devoths bane tam said something in auldek pointing at the other pup who had just tumbled over in an effort to lick his bottom the others laughed no one offered a translation a little later they all stood as the two rejoined them the messenger looked as pleased as ever but mors lips pressed a new measure of annoyance between them she barely opened them when she said the council has spoken we have new instructions from here we go to rath batatt we seek the watcher in the sky mount na gamen birke asked a measure of awe in his voice yes mor said na gamen lets go time is more important now than ever dariel came close to asking who na gamen was but the group was already in motion t he mountains that the people called rath batatt sprouted like bony crests along the backs of horrible reptilian beasts rank upon rank of them stretching off unending into the west beautiful eh birke asked not the description i had in mind they say the sky mount is not far in we wont hike more than a day or so in the mountains just along the edge of them the edge dariel asked how far do these mountains go i dont know no one has been all the way through them this was once wrathic territory my clans home they lived at the edge of rath batatt but ranged into it hunting ive always wanted to do that you never have how could i the young man asked the time that the wrathic hunted in rath batatt is but legend now tales they tell the children to bind them to the clan wonderful tales of packs of wolves and how they hunted mighty beasts together i never even thought id live to see these mountains with my own eyes dariel placed a hand atop his shoulder i imagine the hunting is good now shall we we havent had fresh meat in a while even mor would like that that afternoon dariel and birke loped away before the others they climbed a steep slope navigated the pass at its peak and dropped down into the alpine valley on the other side they picked their way through massive boulders some of which pressed together so that they had to squeeze through or beneath them beyond the boulders stretched a long descent to a crystal blue lake rimmed by short grass abloom with purple wildflowers a herd of woollyhaired oxen grazedstout creatures thickening to face the coming winter with flat horns that spread across their foreheads like helmets welded to their scalps at first they were unaware of the humans and then unfazed and thenwhen birke sank an arrow into ones shoulderfurious the insulted beast charged them after a brief moment of consideration dariel and birke turned and fled they reached the relative safety of the boulders with the oxs hooves pummeling the ground just behind them grunting insults into air suddenly thick with its musk the creature pursued them in it rushed through the narrow crevices between the stones dariel trapped in a deadend corridor of granite had to scramble up it i dont think it was quite like this before birke shouted laughing as he hopped from boulder to boulder the creature snorted outraged breaths below him following them farther into the maze looking rather murderous for a thing that fed on grass and flowers not a wrathic technique then dariel called back it was not the most heroic hunt everthey made the creature a pincushion with arrows shot from safely above itbut the result was satisfying that night they fed on thick steaks roasted over a fire and told stories surrounded by an amphitheater of stone birke recounted the great wrathic hunts of old and of the ancient times when young men were sent alone into the wilderness to return only if they wore the jawbones of a slaughtered kwedeir draped over their necks listening to him dariel almost forgot birke was talking about members of the auldek clan who had enslaved him not about young men like himself he almost forgot that this was not just the hunting trip it briefly seemed he almost accepted it as an evening spent in the company of friends with no purpose save enjoyment almost so tomorrow well see the sky mount why dont you tell me what that is and who the watcher is in the silence after his question dariel realized how different the night was here from what it had been just days before in inafeld forest here in the mountains the main feature of the near silence was the scrape of wind over the jagged peaks that and the sound of mor honing the blade of her dagger on a stone propped on her knee well dariel prompted anira pulled another strip of meat from above the fire set it on the small stone she was using as a table and sliced it into bitesize pieces when she had a few she pinched them in her fingers and offered them to dariel the sky mount is a palace built by a lothan aklun called na gamen he built it long ago back in the early years after they arrived we should see it tomorrow perched atop the highest peak in this area so what is it that mor doesnt believe that the very same na gamen who built it all those years ago still lives in it a lothan aklun lives anira shrugged he may the elders among the people say that long ago he exiled himself there for his own reasons he once came down from the sky isle and gave them promises mor looked up from her work he spoke promises and regrets hundreds of years ago and has done nothing else since but the elders in their wisdom believe that he still sits up there waiting for something for you perhaps you dont believe that mor bent forward and began the rhythmic drag of steel over stone again what i believe doesnt matter im taking you b y noon of the next day dariel had fixed his attention on a single peak in the distance one that came in and out of view as they navigated the ridges preceding it the high clouds that had obscured it in the morning cleared revealing a ring of snow crusting its peak the only mountain thus accoutred so far or so he thought later in the afternoon when they mounted a pass and began down the slope facing the great mountain dariel realized that the snow was not snow at all it was cast around the heights in too peculiar a manner it was actually a solid substance though the white draped across the stone like the cellophane nests of certain birds there was an order to it a geometric intention within the contours he had seen such structures before when he sailed through the barrier isle he had gaped at lothan aklun abodes similarly hung from stone this one however was much larger a fact that grew clearer as they climbed toward it through the lengthening shadows of the aging afternoon when they reached the gate it did not seem they had reached much of anything except a dead end the path had contoured along the steep precipice it dropped off dizzyingly to one side as they came around a corner the path simply stopped and a wall of smooth white stone faced them though it was obviously a manmade structure and a substance quite different from the rough granite of the mountain it molded seamlessly into base stone the mountain curved away out of sight to one side while a buttress of rock hid any view upward they could see nothing of the palace that had been so visible from a distance tam asked should we knock though the wall had no doorlike features they did just that lightly at first and then with fists and feet and harder objects the material absorbed the beating deadening the force of their blows anira tried to climb up over the buttress but only fell crashing back down mor scraped the blade of a knife across the surface searching for some crevice to pry open nothing not even a scratch left behind by her honed point eventually the group gave up there they stood dariel with a sleeping pup in his pack and birke with one in his arms tam massaged the knuckles of his hand and asked what they should do now anira stood with arms crossed head cocked her thoughts trapped in the pucker of her lips the crimson light of the vanishing sun shone on mors delicate features somehow bringing out the shivith tattoos with more vicious contrast than usual dariel kept expecting her to say something she looked like she wanted to and he wished she would entertaining such thoughts he was the last to notice that the wall did in fact have a door in it the last to notice that the door not only existed but was open and that a figure within had leaned through and was intently studying them chapter ten corinn started awake she lashed out sure that hanish mein was attached to her face and devouring her it took a moment for the panic to fade and for the solidity of the world to materialize around her a small comfortable cabin windows open to salttinged air seabirds calling a flap of sail and a slow sensation of motion she remembered she was aboard her transport heading back to acacia the terror had just been a dream just the nightmare she had suffered through since she destroyed the numrek you fool girl she whispered you almost killed yourself she realized this first on waking in a villa along the teh coast that had once belonged to calrach she had been unconscious for days feverish helpless with no memory of being lifted and handled and transported touched by unknown hands the acts of magic she unleashed upon the numrek had nearly ended her the same brutality that ripped them apart could either have left her so spent she just ceased to be or it could have exploded inside her in the future she would have to be much more careful she could only do so much at once if she misjudged what and how to sing she could lose everything in the space of a single mistaken note why was that so obvious after the fact but so easy to forget during the momentwhen all she felt was power she kicked off the blanket covering her she stood and studied herself in the mirror on the back of the cabin door for a horrible moment she could have been looking at her mother in the throes of her illness gaunt in the face her eyes large and sad her body a decaying framework upon which her old beauty hung in tatters why so morbid corinn the image asked afraid of your dreams thats silly youre not silly corinn dont act as if you are who is that man anyway corinn stepped closer to the mirror touched the frame and slid her hand down it across the glass lightly she studied the wrinkled face looking back at her loving it comforted by it no matter that it frightened her he is nobody he is dead hes the one who tried to kill me mother i am not afraid of him when im awake but in my dreams he has power over me changing angle moving to the other side of the mirror the image said only because you let him dont do that dont give in to weakness in your time of triumph remember what you did corinn did remember she saw in her mind image after image of the horrors she had unleashed she saw more in her imaginings than she had seen in the few moments the horrors actually took it was as if each individual death had been stored within her whether she had actually seen it with her eyes or not she watched them all now the stomachchurning revulsion of it matched the raw teethgrinding pleasure of it that power she could rip apart the fabric of life like nobody else walking the earth could she had to be careful yes to plan better to foresee even more but she had the power of a new tinhadin and what of that worm beneath the sea her mother asked do you still dream of it whatever that vague writhing wormlike enormity had been it no longer troubled her she had managed to push it out of her mind to stop seeing those strange images of it she had been so worried in fear for aadens life that worm must have been an internal manifestation of that another creature of nightmare that she had allowed into her waking mind her actions recently had beaten the beast back when it tried to push into her mindwaking or asleepshe had the power to push it back its gone gone gone not only that so many things she had fit into their proper places recently aaden was back on acacia awake and waiting for her she had received news of this a few nights back aliver walked and talked and made himself at home in the palace once again word of that was spreading too she knew her song danced over his skin binding him to her making him the combination of his mind and her will what a partner he would make in the struggles to come elyas eggs were maturing even from a distance she felt them growing they were hers already and would soon stun the world in her name and delivegu should have taken care of the small thing she asked of him by now another threat to aaden removed there were many reasons to feel confident for the time being it did not even matter that mena had deviated from her orders and gone to mein tahalian it sounded crazy to corinn but she must have her reasons corinn would soon ask her directly are you proud of me corinn asked the reflection in the mirror and then answered yes of course you are strong in ways others are not you are the queen you are a noise from the other side of the door caused corinn to start she moved quickly away from it she turned drew herself up with a breath straightened her posture and lifted her chin there she thought seeing herself returned in the image in the mirror no doubt at all who she was anymore is the corinn the world knows let it always be so the image slipped away as the door opened a servant timid behind it peeking in to announce the approach of a skiff carrying the head vintner of prios for a moment corinn could not remember who the head vintner of prios was or what he would wish to talk about she could not ask anyone but rhrenna such a question instead she called for documents pertinent to the meeting from them she refreshed her memory an hour later paddel entered the transports conference room sweating his gait a rolling waddle he patted his forehead and scalp with a handkerchief the action did little to clear away the moisture but much to highlight that his scalp had been tattooed in imitation of hair it looked like he wore some tight rubber cap on his head the man seemed entirely oblivious to this effect the queen sat at the far end of an oval table the rooms central feature wearing her light chain mail once again she looked the picture of royal composure there was a martial edge to the slant of her head and position of her arm which was crooked to one side in a masculine manner she modeled the posture after a remembered image of maeander mein but she made it her own now surely its not that hot outside paddel she had no problem using his name she remembered him quite well now and his little project no no not at all its just that sea travel doesnt agree with me turns my legs to jelly and my guts to oh but you dont want to hear my troubles your majesty im overjoyed to see you well these past few weeks weve been so worried about you as you can see im fine corinn said yes you are may i just say that you are a wonder the talk of the entire empire news of your triumph in teh competes with word that aliver has risen from the dead as always with this man corinn decided on brevity she cut off his babbling before he could work up momentum its all true we wont discuss it now though you brought a sample the one virtue paddel had was that he did not seem to mind being cut off i did he said and began a fumbling search of his silken robes he produced a small blue vial delicate like something used for perfume this your majesty is the vintage pure a drop of it in a goblet of wine and the drinker is never the same again corinn gestured toward a carafe of wine on the table paddel taking the suggestion uncorked and poured a glass then making sure the queen could see his actions he let a single drop of the clear liquid land in the wine lost instantly in its rich maroon he swirled and thats it and thats it corinn studied the liquid as it slipped around the glass paddel you have heard what i did to the numrek it was a demonstration of my power and i know that word of it is flying about the empire as quick as a thousand wagging tongues now that could be good or that could be bad in relation to power people can choose to bow in adoration to it or they can choose to fear it i prefer one reaction instead of the other understand paddel nodded unsure when he said nothing corinn added i would have the people adore me the vintners jowly face jumped with relief thats exactly what the masses do the vintage is already going down throats across the empire everyone thinks your acts are wonders works of beauty magnificent theyll rally behind you more than ever theyll go to battleif thats called forwith even more confidence i promise you that good corinn said she held up her hand for the glass paddel came around the table and handed it to her bringing it close to her nose she inhaled the scent of it paddel looked like he had a word pinched between his lips something dangerous that he wished to release im not going to drink it fool corinn thought but i would know the smell of it it wouldnt do for me to be poisoned with it would it when she was confident that she knew the scent and could build her sensitivity to it with the help of the song she set the glass down you know that i want none of this consumed in the palace understood completely and utterly each cask and bottle carries a label marking it i briefed your secretary on it gave her all the information as i understand it she will pass the knowledge on to those who will keep the palace free of it you and family will remain quite untouched by it what of the question i put to you when we last met about the effects when one who is addicted is then deprived i told you to bring me a report on that ah yes of course paddels scalp bloomed with a new coating of sweat i hope that youll forgive us weve been so very busy with distribution with getting it out fast behind the news that youve abolished the quota in all the confusion the results have been inconclusive which means what we just dont know for sure corinn stared at him are you lying to me i would never your majesty i would die before a lie escaped my lips in your presence he made the mainland gesture for death a quick motion of mimicking plucking out one of his eyes and tossing it over his shoulder but its all a bit confused the league tabulated the data and they were not clear with us on whwhat they found corinns brow grew more and more creased as the vintner talked you should have told me this before a thousand pardons please your majesty if wed had the time we surely would have seen it all through but even now i assure you this changes nothing they assured me the vintage is fine and i assure you the same corinn snatched up the vial and stood this displeases me paddel i asked you to do something and you handed the job to another that is not an action of a loyal servant ive come to doubt you pocketing the vial at her waist she paused and smiled at the look of utter dismay on paddels face but since you are confident i propose you drink in celebration she pointed to the glass on the table do so drink o nce on acacia corinn disembarked into the pleasantly cool air acacian winter at last just chilly enough to require long sleeves and a lace scarf she had just taken the reins and prepared to step up onto her mount when a buzz of noise followed by a sudden hush drew her attention she paused stepped back opened her fingers and let the leather reins slip from them aliver walked hand in hand with aaden they were talking both to themselves and saying things to passersby they waved and touched peoples hands or the crowns of the heads of those who were kneeling they quietly beamed corinn had never seen a finer sight as she rushed toward them through a sudden blur of tears nothing mattered more in the world aliver smiled and aaden lit up at the sight of her when the boy pressed himself against her belly and when she remembered in that moment the first time his baby arms had hugged her and when aliver slipped his arm around them both in those few moments she knew joy more completely than ever before here was life and it was a fine thing free of fear radiant the mood held through to that evening they dined on the back terraces of corinns gardens servants brought up standing torches that ringed the diners and fought back the evenings chill they ate braised eel in a ginger sauce served over sticky rice that aaden insisted on forming into balls with his fingers corinn let him they were not on display this evening not even among the court they were alone all the family she could have near at hand when aliver pinged aaden with a long bean corinn laughed as loudly as anyone when rhrenna toasted the queens victory in teh corinn sent a charm snaking up her arm and into all the glasses as they clinked together just a further lightening of the mood a feeling like bubbles floating in the air around them popping in gentle kisses on their skin they talked of nothing pressing aaden peppered his uncle with questions about his youth aliver responded with tales of his boyhood of his journey into talay in exile of growing to manhood there after dinner he acted out his laryx hunt with a spear fetched from one of the statues in his hallway he made the whole thing seem deathly frightening and hilarious at the same time by the time he finished corinns stomach ached from laughing that was a pleasant pain she had not felt for many years is it just me or does the harbor seem busier than usual aliver asked a little later as they sat on the crescent balcony that offered a dizzying view out over the harbor corinn thought of the ridged back of some beast that she had seen cutting through the water earlier but that was not what he meant since nobody else had seen it she knew it was an imagining for her alone she was almost used to seeing things that were not real it was a small price to pay for having the song coursing through her what aliver referred to were the hundreds of very real ships that bobbed on the sea they choked the harbor and spread out into the open water itself black shapes and white and red sails rode the swells many of them torchlit like an aquatic constellation rhrenna licked lime cream off a tiny dessert spoon it appears that were being flooded by pilgrims pilgrims most are from talay but not just there they come to praise corinn to pray for aaden to spot elya on the wing but mostly because of you rumors of you have spread far and wide already corinn said to aliver considering that you strolled through the lower town this morning in broad daylight well soon be flooded with many more than what you see here i should go down to greet them aliver said setting aside his porcelain bowl and spoon as if he would do so at that moment you will corinn said but let them talk a bit longer let them all talk from here to the senate and the league great ships and beyond let them talk you into a god then well show you to the world for real and theyll be all the more amazed well soon announce your coronation it will be abrupt but well already have half the empire floating around us just then a servant girl dashed into the courtyard she drew up and stared at the group with frightened eyes your majesty pardon me thethe eggs your majesty they are cracking hatching i mean corinn would have chosen to witness this alone but there was no keeping aaden and the others from dashing through the hallways with her aliver made a show of racing aaden rhrenna asked who would get to name the young aaden himself was too giddy with excitement to do anything other than run they rushed onto the terrace balcony that had served as elyas private hatchery the creature snapped around for a moment there was something fierce in the glare of her eyes and the way her head slipped low on her subtle neck it only lasted a moment though and then she was gentle again when aaden threw himself around her neck burying his face in her plumage corinns fine mood flooded back she approached carefully touching first her sons shoulder and then elyas soft back she leaned forward and gazed into the basin and there they were elyas babies two of them were completely free of their shells they squirmed at the edge of the basin clawing at the fabric that lined it as if they wanted to climb right out and face life one still stretched and struggled with its shell and the fourth was but a small snout protruding from a crack in its egg they were tiny versions of elya in many ways plumed with a sleek coat with serpentine necks and delicate claws the feathers around their heads were a bristling confusion though and they were variously colored one was crimson at the head and fading to black while another displayed yellow stripes across a brown back the one kicking free of shell was sky blue and the last from the look of his protruding snout was all black corinn said look at them little beauties at the sound of her voice all three of the exposed heads turned toward her they blinked ones nostrils flared the red one cocked its head the one in the shell thrust its head through in one great effort it too set its gaze on corinn my smart babies she thought my little dragons she extended a hand toward them all four of them followed it with their yellow eyes when she was near enough the red one slammed the crown of her head into corinns fingers like an affectionate cat the others clamored over one another to do the same elya shifted sideways she touched her shoulder to corinns side and pressed her back when aaden tried to stroke the young as well elya slipped her own head in before him pushing against his chest so that he had to step back she exhaled an impatient breath all right elya care for your children corinn said pulling back raise them strong for me and for the empire chapter eleven are you sure mena asked perrin nodded he was redfaced from the cold and from the brisk hike that had brought him out to meet mena and the main column of the army thats tahalian it looks to be a ruin its seen better days he studied the view a moment and then added its a bit nicer inside it would have to be mena glanced back at the ragged line of troops moving like a slow river through the valley behind her realizing that her eyes were scanning them in search of melio she lifted her hand and pressed her eyes closed for a moment is it habitable yes i might not have thought so a couple of days ago but two days work can fix a lot perrin and a small corps had gone ahead on horseback to open the fortress and get the steam vents pumping hot air judging by the gaping mouth of the thing before them and the plumes of mist that billowed out of several outlets and hung above the place he had achieved that his efforts had done nothing for its forlorn appearance tahalian huddled close to the ground more like a huge pile of debris than the grand structure that had once housed the entire mein race its massive pine beams were bracketed together with iron rings the wood had been silvered by weather the whole mass was edged with ice and pocketed with early snowfall the beams canted at angles that were hard to make sense of but that seemed no work of intentional design pointing at a long low mound a little distance away perrin said thats the calathrock were having trouble opening the vents to it but well get the place heated soon its impressive mena most of it is dug down into earth itll serve us well i hope so she thought i truly hope so t hat evening she arranged for haleeven mein to be brought to her in the calathrock she stood awaiting him in the massive chamber inhaling the dank air it was sulfurous from the partially functioning vent system the beams that supported the roof fitted together in an intricate lacework that left an open space largely free of columns beneath it workers had lit several of the large lanterns though their mirrored backings cast considerable light mena could barely make out the darker edges of the space she knelt and ran her fingers over the hardwood floor worn to a smooth polish it was crisscrossed with scrapes and gashes the telltale signs of the years of martial practice that had gone on in this room hidden from the known world right here was where hanish mein had fought his maseret duels right here he had honed his army devised his plans from right here he had launched the assault that nearly ended the akaran line and that had changed menas life in so many ways perrin appeared in one of the large entranceways some distance away behind him three others mena picked out the man she was here to meet for his dress and demeanor were so different from that of her soldiers the four of them began to come forward but she motioned with her hand perrin paused studied her a moment he whispered something to the others the soldiers halted and perrin indicated that haleeven should proceed alone she had seen the man several times in the aftermath of alivers war he had escaped the slaughter that took his nephews life on acacia he had tried to rally what forces he could on the mainland but only until he had heard the news of the talay plains after that he gave up a patrol captured him on a woodland road near the methalian rim it seemed he was walking home a handful of men around him none of them put up a fight when he was brought bound for a trial in alecia mena had watched him sit stonefaced as the crimes of his people were read out to the new alecian senate he offered no rebuttal no justification nor did he plead for mercy never had she seen a man look more defeated the senate had called for his executiona fate that several of the highranking meinish survivors had sufferedbut corinn had commuted it instead she had sent him in exile back to the mein he had been there ever since living in a simple hut from which he hunted and chopped wood for the long meinish winter she had never been sure if corinns decision had been intended as a punishment or as an act of kindness watching haleeven shuffle toward her now she thought it more the former than the latter grimy furs covered him not so much like a coat and leggings as like a motley mass of different pelts formless and foul smelling the guards must have taken off his cap his thin strawcolored hair was yet pressed to his scalp quite a contrast to his beard which cascaded from his face in unruly swirls and waves this too was soiled dotted with debris and grease for a second she doubted that this was the famous brother of heberen uncle to the brothers hanish maeander and thasren but only for a second she recognized his gray eyes and strong nose haleevens gaze drifted around the chamber mouth drooping and lower lip trembling he seemed to have forgotten mena before even reaching her save that he walked in an orbit around her as if she were a fire that he did not wish to move too far away from haleeven mein mena said i am mena akaran we have met before we never spoke but i know your face well the old warrior kept circling her he said something in his tongue words that rolled out of his mouth like roughedged stones you have been too long locked out of tahalian mena said its time for you to call it home again for you and haleeven broke out of his circle and strode away mena followed indicating with a flick of her fingers that perrin and the guards should stay where they were haleeven went to a section of the wall he ran his hands over it clearing away the dust whatever he saw spurred him on he wiped in wide sweeps reaching as high as he could a cloud of dust gathered around him he coughed and spoke meinish and worked his way across the wall only when she touched a portion of the cleared area with her fingers did mena notice the inscriptions in the wood names they ran up and down it in columns they must have risen to the ceiling though most of this stretch was coated in dust thick enough to hide them mena was startled to find the old man watching her he walked back toward her slowly his gray eyes steady on her he stopped before her and said something in meinish i dont speak your language mena admitted i wish i didnt speak yours haleevens acacian was accented but clear enough i wish id never had to learn it if you are a phantom of my nightmares i am not a phantom mena said feel my touch she held out her hand he made no move to reach for it she stepped forward and hesitating for a moment grasped the fingers protruding from his furs see we are both flesh this is really true mena nodded why somehow he made the word into more of an accusation than a question because we face war once more the entire nation does things from the past need to be set aside forgotten we have to look at this wall haleeven cut in gesturing with a quick sweep of his hand mena felt the guards stiffen the chieftains tree these are chieftains names all of them all of them from the hauchmeinishs generation from the first that your people sent into exile see they are all here from hauchmeinish to hanish with all those who died challenging each chieftains given glory here in turn look at them mena raised her chin and did so you want me to forget this i cant of all the things in the world this i cant forget ive misspoken thats not what i mean i dont mean that you forget your past no its important that we remember our pasts will forever be entwined just as our role in creating the danger we face is shared between us even now my officer explained some of what is happening didnt he they told me of a nightmare that walks in daylight its our shared nightmare haleeven your people did after all first invite the numrek across the ice fields but we akarans have done our share to bring them back in an even worse form now we need you we need tahalian breathing again warm at her belly we need the calathrock to once more ring with troops in training the fate of the known world depends on it the only thing i want us to forget is the animus that caused us both so much grief let us remember the facts and learn from them but lets start by forgetting hatred haleeven guffawed his eyes again slid up along the chieftains tree two things then two things i cant ever do he walked away trailing a hand across the wall until he reached the beam that marked its edge he carried on walking into the dimmer areas of the calathrock mumbling to himself again in his own tongue perrin arrived at menas side a few moments later anything accomplished mena called loudly haleeven mein you want to remember your former glory you can do more than that you can rebuild it this can belong to the meinish race again the figure deep in shadow now paused i would not ask things of you without offering things in return she grabbed the torch that one of the guards held and walked into the shadows your sister destroyed the meinish race the shadow said he had turned to face the princess and his voice came clearer now we are no more as mena approached his features flickered into existence again my sister punished the mein she was harsh yes but dont ask me to forget what you did to us dont ask me to forget the tunishnevre what would they have done to my people no dont ask me to forget either lets forget the word forget its a useless word the other smiled with a corner of his thin lips haleeven ive known your name since i was a child and you must have known mine from the day that i was born weve spent all that time being enemies without even knowing each other our fight is over though now we will both be destroyed if we dont find a way to prevail im not sure that would be so bad haleeven said i doubt very much that the auldek deserve our world more than we do or that theyll rule it more benignly and youre wrong about one thing completely wrong corinn was in power when your people were defeated but she did the exact opposite of destroying the race she gave birth to hanishs child you know this your bloodline goes on the old man crossed his arms a difficult act with all those layers on he gave no sign of how being reminded of hanishs child affected him but mena had his full attention now what do you want of me i want you who know this place the best to help us open it i want you to train my army here in this chamber i want it to ring with singing swords and battle cries i want your help in preparing to face the numrek who better than you what will you give me in return for making me your soldier your life back tahalian acknowledgment of your race and your name you can promise me that i promise you that haleevens eyes bored into hers i would have to call all meins to me from all around the empire whether enslaved or in hiding or imprisoned i would want them all here in tahalian i will not be the only one perrin cleared his throat skeptically but mena said that will be done write a summons yourself so that your people will believe it i will pen a sealed note to accompany it we can send it tonight there are birds fed rested and ready to fly i have your word on it the man asked truly mena met perrins eyes a moment then slipped a hand down her collar she fished out a chain on it a silver pendant pinching it in her fingers she held it up for haleeven to see i found this at the base of a great tree it is the reason i fought and killed the eagle goddess maeben it was not a present or a gift or payment even its a burden it was sent so that i would remember the children sacrificed in the name of the goddess i served then abhorred and then killed i made a mistake when i realized that i did the best i could to correct it thats the way i am haleeven she pulled the chain taut letting the curves of the serpentine figure on the pendant catch the light i swear on this on the children i carry with me on the wrongs i will yet see righted fight with us haleeven mein and if we live your people will live as well i swear it haleeven drew his head back and then let his eyes drift up and around the great arched roof finally he said i am not without ideas mena nodded curt i thought as much the air is not flowing properly it should not smell of sulfur someone has opened a ventilation tube improperly send me a few capable men well survey the heat ducts before anything else we must see to that as you advise mena said not quite smiling but close enough that he responded with a not quite smile of his own chapter twelve on the night he arrived at calfa ven delivegu lemardine lingered a while over the scene rolling out beneath his private balcony the kings preserve a vast stretch of woodland deep in the mountains of senival unending crowns of trees crowded the entire view broken here and there by granite protrusions plumes of orange and brown some bursts of yellow the leaves still displayed their late autumn brilliance why he stood so long watching the night creep over the landscape he could not say perhaps it was nostalgia for some aspect of his forgotten childhood it was not that he remembered a view like this or had any particular fondness for the notion of roaming the wilderness beneath that canopy but he was senivalian by birth he had spent his first years in some village or another near here perhaps the memory was in his blood perhaps he should spend more time here not this trip though this trip had a particular purpose and would be brief that evenings banquet had a rustic charm delivegu went to it dressed in a manner he felt fit the occasion he wore a shirt of thick senivalian cloth its collar a tall ring around his neck he squeezed his private parts into tight black trousers he was particularly fond of his crimson leather boots strapped snug all the way up to the knee one should always take care with ones appearance delivegu believed even when far from court the lodges guests gathered in the winter dining room a crowded space centered around a single oval table wall lamps lit the place but something about the dark wood walls the pelts pinned there and the heads of several stags and a boar jutting from them gave the room a somber air two fires roared in large fireplaces at either side of the room that was another thing delivegu had noticed about the lodge many corridors opened to the outside air windows often sat crooked with age in their frames rattling in the wind and spilling warm air and letting in cold instead of correcting these things the servants set blazing fires in every room inefficient wasteful really but there was a certain style in this rugged excess delivegu approved he did not on the other hand much approve of his dinner company nothing wrong with them per se but not one seducible maiden among them gurta so fat with rialus neptoss pup she would have been better off rolling than waddling around as she was a senator from aos his middleaged wife and several other relations along with an old merchant and his two teenage sons the latter flushed from the days adventures adventures that featured wren dariels mistress she was pregnant with the princes child though from the story the two sons told she was not much hindered by her condition mistress wren warned us it would be a long ride in any event one of the sons said the guests stood in a loose circle sipping the mint liqueur that was customary for early winter evenings at calfa ven we rode north through the valley and then up along a ridgeline she called storneven wren knew the route well or the horses did the other son slightly younger said no she knew it shes ridden it several times during the weeks shes been caretaker here caretaker that was a clever way to describe her situation better than she who is banished until the queen decides what to do with her she rides so often delivegu asked every day gurta said keeps her from going insane with boredom there was no chance of that today the younger son piped we had a runin with a wolverbear an old wolverbear the other corrected peter the warden said so it picked up our trail about halfway around storneven spooked the horses it followed us for a good hour sometimes right out in the open it loped along as if it were just biding its time until one of us fell off our horse or something peter said thats what it was doing said if any of the horses had gotten lamedor if one of us had fallenthe thing would have been on us like a flash he got it off us by tossing down two of the squirrels he had shot when the wolverbear couldnt resist them we took off as fast as wren could ride dreadful the senators wife said those creatures are beastly they should hunt every last one of them oh you dont mean that delivegu said finding himself drawn to flirt force of habit there need to be wild things in the world things to give you chills at night thinking about them my wife has far too many chills already the senator said goes to sleep wrapped in three layers of undergarments thats a pity delivegu said a crime id say no woman should go to sleep so encumbered he flashed her a smile and sipped his liqueur then he wondered why he had bothered he had no interest in her and then he realized that without knowing it his senses had picked up on a person of interest the sudden rush of vigor he felt was not for the senators wife at all it was for one of the girls setting the table for dinner oh yes that was it he watched her bend over the table arranging cutlery what is it about youth he wondered even though her body was half hidden beneath her simple frock unadorned and meant to go unnoticed delivegu saw the contours beneath the fabric no acacian beauty this one she was of senivalian stock clear enough in her short stature with hips that would go wide in a few years breasts that stood at attention for the time being and dark hair she wore clipped at the back he decided he would see those locks flow free reconnecting with his ancestral roots thats what it would be when he caught the flow of conversation again the senators wife was saying if you ask me its just reckless why put the child in danger like that i enjoy a good brisk ride myself but theres a time for all things delivegu tried to imagine her enjoying a brisk ride it was not a pleasant imagining too full of jiggling flesh for his liking he glanced at the serving girl again and caught her watching him oh good shes noticed mistress wren she walked in with a careless air as if she had happened on the place by accident and was not entirely sure she would stay she was pretty enough small and lithe she had the body of an acrobat ready to eat she asked i could eat an entire wolverbear delivegu managed to secure a place across the table from her despite her reckless riding and adventures with wolverbears she did seem fully aware of the child growing inside her it was a small bump yet she rubbed it often making him wonder what it felt like it was sensual in a way he had not considered before as was the way she ate heartily without any courtly reticence he was not sure why dariel would invest so much in her but such things were often hard to explain to what do we owe the pleasure of your company delivegu the merchant asked yes wren asked slicing through her roasted boar why are you here i conducted business for her majesty in pelos delivegu said she asked that before i return i stop in and check on the preparations for winter shell not be able to make a last visit herself this season i know very well that the staff here has everything in hand so its an easy assignment for me a pleasing one she asked me to look in on you as wellhe nodded at wrento see how you were settling in here im so disappointed the senators wife said that the queen couldnt make it when we received the invitation oh months ago i so hoped the queen would be here enjoying calfa ven as well i love her so you know shes just magnificent id devour her if she were here somehow i think not delivegu thought wondering if corinn arranged to schedule certain visitors to the lodge when she planned not to be there this woman might qualify no doubt she complained mightily to her husband when they were alone hoping for a retreat with the queen getting one with two pregnant discards instead this horrid invasion she said im sick of hearing of it already i hope the whole business is over by the spring surely she was old enough to remember the last two wars that had ravished the empire some forget so quickly delivegu said thats my hope as well by the queens grace so it shall be the attractive servant appeared at wrens side mistress she offered an orange glass bottle half filled with a clear liquid judging by its consistency it was not water wren nodded and the girl set the glass down along with a tiny snifter of the same glass whats this delivegu asked once he had made eye contact with the servant and held it long enough to establish an intimacy wrens little poison gurta said palm wine the younger teen said its so tasty she wont let us have any see if shell let you have some delivegu he played along tilting his head questioningly wren pushed the bottle toward him the glass just after it the liquid smelled of palm nut flesh and more strongly of straight alcohol compared to the liqueur from earlier there was little tempting about this the eyes of the group were on him though he smiled saluted the room and then tossed back the glass instant regret searing heat a gag reaction so torso convulsing that he shot away from the table his chair slammed into the wall behind him and for a few horrible moments he was sure he was going to spill his dinner onto the floor a string of curses muttered all the louder because the room had erupted in laughter it wasnt just the raw alcohol content it was thatthat agh thats foul it is it is they all agreed only wren drinks it the senator said she says it reminds her of what they used to brew on the outer isles reminds her of her brigand days apparently wren did not deny it grinning she reached over and hooked the bottle back she poured and with a nod in imitation of delivegus salute she drained the tiny glass she did not so much as blink in fact she licked her lips with the tip of her tongue and looked as if she had drunk nothing stronger than sweet tea delivegu regained his seat you dont drink much of that do you its poison i doubt very much the baby is well served by it but a short glass a day the older teen said thats all ive seen her take good thats all right then i guess leaning forward he said to wren i do insist that you stop riding youre putting the child at risk is that an order from the queen no just an expression of concern from myself im confident she would say the same though you care about my baby wren asked her candovian features could have been classically beautiful had she been raised with any sense of courtly decorum she had not and her facial expressionswhen she made anywere as blunt and straightforward as a tavern owners of course why wouldnt i a royal child is a royal child a royal bastard you mean surely you dont mean that its just the pregnancy it affects womens moods ive heard mistress wren do you think me so crude of course i think you crude look neither of us was born to royalty i never planned to be mistress to a prince let alone mother of a royal bastard she speared a morsel of meat and brought it near her mouth waiting for a retort you should be overjoyed delivegu said and for the moment he said it he lost sight of the irony of the statement youve been lucky i know what thats like she jabbed the morsel in her mouth and chewed am i lucky dariel is lost probably dead my child has no father what it does have is glancing around the table she backed away from whatever she was about to say i live with uncertainty thats all i know you know what i mean she directed this pointedly at delivegu but the senator said we all do trying times test us all t he later hours of the night found delivegu entertaining the serving girl bralyn it turned out she was the wardens daughter and therefore granddaughter to the first peter the one who had overseen the lodge since king leodans youth he had died only recently and the girl spoke fondly of him it seemed to be the only thing she had ever liked about living at calfa ven will you take me back with you to acacia she asked delivegu lay on his back with his head resting against her shoulder enjoying the sweaty press of her breast against cheek oh thats a tempting possibility take me with you and you can have me whatever way you want whenever you want are there courtesans at court so many its hard to miss them theyre all better than me arent they not the sort of question delivegu would ever answer honestly he sat up and studied her to look as if he were giving the question due consideration the girl pouted as she awaited his answer in truth most of her appeal was the raw stuff of youth she kissed with a sloppy abandon that he had not been able to make sense of he had liked her best when he got behind her and did not have to duel with her tongue she was country and would remain so for the few short years of beauty she had left he said youre gorgeous by any standard a lover of infinite talents she swatted at him clearly pleased delivegu surged in on her growling the two of them wrestled a moment he found a fleshy place to press his mouth and blow skin blubbers a strange habit of his he had to admit but when he was not yet ready to perform sexually he often played in such childlike ways nobody had yet complained not really why do you want to leave he asked a little later your life is good here better than most you work is guaranteed for life you get to serve the queen many would trade places with you when the queen is here its grand bralyn said but she hardly ever is its boring most of the time somehow i doubt that you have guests of some sort here constantly men to seduce she swatted at him again you must know the queen intimately a bit the girl admitted have you seen her work magic bralyn considered him but then dropped any reticence the moment she began answering were not supposed to but its hard to miss she sings all the time when shes up here prince aaden is always on her to create things like what all sorts animals youve never seen before she created these bird things and set them flying over the archery meadow those she didnt hide in the slightest she and aaden used them for target practice and some of the staff ran about retrieving the fallen ones they were strange things birds with feathers aye but with three and four sets of wings stiff ones like dragonflies strange but beautiful too i saw her once blow life back into a slain stag my father had just come in from a hunt and had a wagon stacked with dead deer the prince didnt like the sight and got upset and the queen just went over and worked a spell and then kissed the stag on its nose a moment later it got up and looked around and then bolted from the wagon like it never had an arrow in its side she did other stuff too things she really didnt let us see delivegu considered that a moment with all the things corinn was letting the world see these days what sort of sorcery might still merit secrecy im hungry the girl said stretching back across the cot and sliding one leg over the other as if this were what one did to combat hunger of course you are how about i get you something are you serving me delivegu leaped to his feet and looked around for his robe exactly what would you like bread and cheese some of that roasted venison she puffed out her cheeks cheese gives me nightmares and venison im sick of the stuff i could never eat another deer in my life ah what then youll get me in trouble nobody in this place can say a word against me or against you if thats my pleasure what will you eat be quick i feel a stiffness coming on custard bring me custard do you know how to find it i should show you what would be the use of my serving you just lie there looking ravishing the notion did not seem nearly so romantic as he scurried down the exposed passageway toward the kitchens the wind batted his robe around thoroughly shriveling his sex in the process he paused at the kitchen door first to check that he was alone and then a moment longer to listen to a wolfs lonely call floating up from the valley hello brother he whispered and then opened the door and entered a single oil lamp burned in the center of the preparation table and by its light delivegu began his search he was not looking for custard it did not take him long for the servants had left the bottle in easy reach it stood aligned with the condiments and relishes that had earlier been cleared from the table he picked up wrens bottle of palm wine uncorked it and sniffed just as foul as before strange girl wren something about the fact that she drank this stuff without flinching brought the blood back to his groin in different circumstances he would have loved to have a drinking contest with her another life maybe he stood still a moment listening letting his eyes roam the dark corners of the room satisfied that he was alone he slipped a vial from his robes inside chest pocket he plucked out the vials little cork and measured a few drops into the mouth of the palm wine bottle wrens little poison indeed a few minutes later bottle set back in place delivegu slipped into the chill air of the corridor again he carried a large bowl of custard enough for two he would enjoy the night and be on his way in the morning the queen would want a report bralyn would alas not be going with him chapter thirteen the view over the rooftops of avina had always transfixed skylene never more so than now from where she stood on the balcony of the offices that had once belonged to the lvin herith the city looked endless it thrust up to the south in a jumbled bulk that went on for miles farther than she could see all the towers with their sunbright colors flags of the clans hung now just as they always had lines of smoke rising to a certain height at which point the wind bent each column and sent it off to the west seabirds and starlings and pigeons cut arcs through the sky and filled the morning air with their calls the only city ive ever truly known skylene said to herself a child of the eilavan woodlands she had only ever seen aos from a distance on the march that took her to the league transport that began her life in bondage her memory of that city was that it was vast but she suspected that was not true a childs perception of things this city avina truly was vast it had been too large to occupy entirely even when the auldek lived in it now with them and their chosen servants and the divine children gone the dead haunted the city as much as the living it did not have to be that way but the glory that could have been a free avina had already started to fracture out of the corner of her eye she saw a person emerge through the archway that led onto the rooftop tunnel strode toward her moving his bulk with a heavy muscular grace standing beside her he touched the metal tusks curving up from his face we should go now skylene nodded she let her gaze linger over the city a little longer and then she turned and walked back toward the arch down the slope and onward beside tunnel she was as slim as a reed a figure drawn with the smooth lines of a thin brush her skin powder white nose the elongated point customary of selected kern slaves hair tufted in a manner that made her otherwise peaceful visage look potentially savage touched with avian anger she might need some of that for the meeting they headed to the first summit of leaders of the clans of the quota slaves of ushen brae randale of the wrathic had called for a full gathering of the people dukish of the anet and maren of the kulish kra had balked saying they should decide some matters at the level of the chieftains before airing their differences in public skylene did not welcome talk of chieftains nor did she like that they already defined themselves by the clan groupings of their enslavement she agreed to attend only to buy time until mor returnedand the elders too if that was possible since mor had left her in charge of the free people of avina skylene lived a troubled life part of it was being without her lover they had slept entwined together for several years trying to find slumber by herself proved difficult and her dreams rushed unpleasantly at her when she did sleep she woke most mornings knotted in her sheets more desolate for realizing it was only linen that bound her not mors shapely limbs the avina she found on kicking off those sheets challenged her in new ways each day in the first days of freedom the citys occupants huddled nervous unsure that what appeared to have happened really had the auldek gone all of them the divine children with them and many of the other slaves as well they had all watched it happen but they stayed in the same rooms in the same buildings finding it hard to believe that the auldek would not appear again suddenly ready to punish them for even daring to think themselves free some youths rode out of the city on an antok they returned a week later with verification that the auldek carried on to the north making haste none of them looking back at skylenes suggestion the people agreed to set up watches to the north of the city to provide a warning should the thing they feared return to them with that in place they rejoiced people ran through the streets reveling in their new freedom they were as giddy as the children they had not been allowed to be laughing and dancing feasting and making love and dreaming of what they would do with a cityan entire continentall their own it was too much for them vast and filled with another races historysuch a challenge but a challenge all their own now the very thought of it made them drunk with joy skylene made speeches often during these early days she reminded the revelers that the free people had always planned for this day the council of elders had lived far from them but they had never ceased laboring for them taking in the abandoned hiding those who had run from abuse keeping alive a dream of unity once they were as free in reality as they were in moral truth soon she told them mor and yoen and the others would join them together they would build their nation it sounded wonderful it was all true and all possible but barely had the tail of the auldek migration slipped over the northern horizon before the problems started by the end of the second week one man had killed another in a dispute over who had rights to an estate the slain man was of the kulish kra his murderer an anet skylene was at the trial called to decide the matter she was one of the many who agreed to the punishment of a tattoo identifying the anet as a murderer to be stenciled across his shaved scalp before the sentence was carried out a group of anet mobbed the chamber in which the man was imprisoned they bashed their way in freed him and fought a battle in the streets to escape they claimed the trial had been unjust it was biased against anets only other anets had the right to try their kind they claimed how could they know justice was done otherwise the one who led them was a short man named dukish an anet who had once been a golden eye one of the quota slaves who handled financial affairs for the auldek he had been a man of some station but he had not been chosen to go with them declaring himself the clans chieftain he called on other anet slaves to join him in putting clan interests first saying none should govern them but themselves many flocked to him he armed them seizing a weapons cache he knew of from his former work before anyone could organize to stop them they took control of a portion of the city including a warehouse stocked with grain and beans and salt great vats of vinegar and wine it got worse after that former household slaves laid claim to their masters palaces while field workers were kept at a distance golden eyes and others who had held higher offices for the auldek claimed that those privileges should be transferred to positions of a similar rank in the new order a gang of young kulish kra men harassed kern women it began as a joke played on one avian clan by another but it grew violent sexual before long the rumors were that the kulish kra youths had taken to raping and molesting kern women the kern formed armed groups against this to which the kulish kra responded in kind and still other armed groups formed in response to the increasingly violent tension in the city further fueling it the league returned they plied the water in their ships and in the lothan akluns soul vessels it became clear that they were establishing themselves on the barrier isles and everyone wondered how long it would be before they landed on the mainland skylene tried to speak reason to them all for a time she found ears listening but as the weeks passed she was surprised at how often her perfect reason fell only on the back of peoples heads she forgot perhaps that as mors lover and as an active member of the free people she had learned to look past the clan markings more than most to many their clan members were their kin not just the arbitrarily selected other slaves it was in households and fields with others of their clan that they had labored it was to the auldek masters of those clans that they had looked with fear with eyes first of children then of clan members skylene knew this it had been her life too still she had expected to manage the peace for a few weeks instead she scrambled to prevent a riot that would ignite the entire city to hear her the people had to truly listen to understand to be brave to heed men like dukish one only had to feel fear we must be careful tunnel said as they walked the last corridor that would take them to the meeting i dont like this one i dont like dukish either but thats part of the reason we have to speak with him the chieftains and their seconds met at a ring of chairs in the center of the same massive chamber in which the auldek had slaughtered sire neens group the circle of chairs looked tiny beneath the high ceiling dwarfed by the pillars and the shafts of light that fell diagonally from openings in the ceiling the men and women milling around hardly seemed capable of making decisions for the mass of people that could have filled the entire chamber we shouldnt be meeting like this skylene muttered as she moved to take her seat we should all be here together all of us tunnel grunted his agreement from where he stood behind her chair he crossed his bulging arms over his chest and reached up with one hand to pull contemplatively on a tusk who is going to begin dukish asked before everyone was fully settled you just have plez a thin woman with the same kern features as skylene said when dukish smiled the scales on his face shifted in a manner that skylene always imagined must feel uncomfortable but i am not the one with complaints i am happy let the complainers complain than the leader of the lvin scowled at him he had only light clan marks pale white shading around his nose and eyes steel whiskers the ends of which he pressed often with his fingertips still he had a fierce demeanor akin to his snow lion totem i am no complainer he said through gritted teeth but i have much to say against you do you say it then he did than related a long list of grievances most of which skylene shared at times he could have been speaking for her randale a wrathic added to the mountain of complaints against dukish the representative of the kulish kra maren topped that mountain with a cold snowy peak she accused him of wanting to use lothan aklun relics he would use their ships ships driven by souls look at him he would find a way to steal souls and become immortal if he could he wants to live like an auldek no not that no souls should ever be taken again dukish listened to it all unimpressed all that is true skylene thought but its not the heart of the matter she readied her words and cleared her throat to speak plez beat her to it dont look so smug she said to dukish you and your people are alone you think you can hold half the city by yourself you think you can make a life without the rest of us he doesnt have to the antok spokesman haavin said speaking for the first time we antok have no grievance with him he is not so alone as you think and there are always new friends to make dukish shared a knowing look with haavin and then as if he had been pressed i might as well tell you all ive been in contact with the leaguemen the others cried out but he spoke over them yes i have why not somebody had to you want them just lurking out there i will meet with them and they have said they wish to meet with me smiling he added afterward ill tell you what came of it than was out of his seat and across to dukish in an instant the anet second nearly toppled his chieftain so hurriedly did he rush to defend dukish others rose and moved forward as well the circle of chairs became a ring hemming in a pushing shoving contingent of the new leaders you people are driving me mad skylene shouted her voice highpitched and sharp cut through the melee she looked all the more striking because she had not risen with the others her hands clutched the seat on which she sat as if she were holding herself from shooting up from it stop it stop it this is all soso unnecessary dont you see that were arguing about things we dont need to be arguing about and were losing sight of our dream your dream dukish said he plopped back into his chair crossing one leg over the other your dream skylene weve heard enough of it from you from mor from those who came before you it was fine to dream when we were slaves now were not and real things need to be done thats what i am doing you all act like im a criminal but i have not killed anyone i have not stolen from any of you i have just acted more quickly dont blame me if you did not do the same what youve done is divide us we should be the free people all of us we need to leave behind all this talk of clans its part of our history but it needs to be held within its place its our past not our future we can make more you are still dreaming dukish said how will you change all this it already is and cannot be undone the tales you free people toldof prophecy and saviors your rhuin fawhat has come of it nothing at all there was no rhuin fa the world changed and it was not your dreams that changed it thats not skylene felt tunnel grip her shoulder and knew what he was cautioning against she and the others had already debated revealing dariels presence among them when he was in the city they had kept his survival a careful secret only letting the most trusted of the free people know now that he had destroyed the soul catcher and was safely away into the interior some argued it was time to announce him the rhuin fa had come finally the old prophecies could come true what better thing to unite the people mor before leaving for the sky isle had been against revealing his presence but skylene thought that her opinion was tainted by her anger she did not yet trust dariel and did not want to offer false hope a reasonable concern really tunnel was also against it in his case he had no doubt that dariel was the leader they had been waiting for because of that he wanted him protected until the right moment until he could be announced in such a public way that nobody could deny him skylene swallowed down the words she so wanted to say instead she began can we simply agree not to do anything further until mor returns and the elders as well they should all have a say in this i have said what i needed to dukish said he stood and scanned the group dismissive even as his eyes touched on them you do what you wish i will do what i wish with that he turned and strode away the others stirred then rose grumbling the meeting clearly had broken up tunnel leaned close to skylene and said see i dont like that one chapter fourteen dariel lost track of time the moment he stepped through that doorway he answered the slim mans beckoning he went first and the others followed he could not now remember the words they had spoken or how introductions were made or any of the things customary to a meeting none of that mattered for nothing inside the sky mount was the same as outside it did not so much cling to the mountains as belong to them a part of them smooth and organic as if the rock had once been living tissue it was sparse clean with none of the everyday items of life no tables or chairs no beds or hearths or cupboards dariel had the feeling that all these things had once been here but now there was nothing but a long sweep of corridors that led to empty rooms the whole time he was there he knew that the others were also somewhere within the dizzying sprawl of the place he could feel them he could even hear faint indications of their thoughts like voices heard at a distance his hound pups were inside as well somewhere in the maze of rooms and passages all cared for all safe this was not about them though from what felt like the first moments his time in the sky mount was spent with only one person na gamen that was why he seemed to pass all his timeimmeasurable as it wasby the lothan akluns side they walked from room to room sharing thoughts conversing without opening their mouths this too was a thing dariel did not remember beginning but it soon seemed natural enough shape a thought send it hear the answer within his head never a sound except the wind that whipped through the passages and the scuffing of his feet across the smooth gray stone aliver had said he spoke to the santoth in a similar manner now dariel understood na gamen was slender in the extreme famine faced with copper skin that lay thinly across the bones of his bald skull he stood a little distance away gazing through an opening in the wall of his skytop sanctuary looking at the dizzying drop to the valleys far below he looked so lost in thought that dariel feared he was about to fall forward through the opening and plummet from the heights why dariel should care what happened to this man he could not have said yet but he did care he already believed that na gamen the watcher of the sky mount was entwined with his destiny you are an akaran na gamen said i can smell it in the oils on your skin its in your breath when you exhale i hear it when your heart beats i see it in the vibrations of the air around you do you know dariel akaran that you trail your ancestors behind you on a silver string i see them waving in the air all the living trail behind them those who came before a portion of each soul grasps the string and stays with you always i didnt always see them but i have for a long long time do you know how i know this how dariel asked because the same is true of me i trail many strings thousands tens of thousands and each of these touches a million souls sometimes i feel very heavy pulling them behind me sometimes lifting my arm is like moving a mountain as it should be for one like me an accursed one like me the notion of weight was hard to equate with the tall slight man who placed the words in dariels head how do you know me dariel asked the smell of my skin my breath how because you are of tinhadins line i see him in you you knew tinhadin you are truly from my lands na gamen turned and set his green eyes on him they were larger than normal jewels in his gaunt face his earlobes spread out in large curves shaped like butterfly wings they moved when he did when he stilled they swayed as if rocked by a gentle tide we are children of the same land yes and i did know tinhadin i know him still one does not forget the man who tried to murder him that man who helped in his way to make this accursed life you have said that before how are you accursed you would know it all yes it will come at a price dariel a gift but a dear one one that will be hard to live with do you want it whether i want it or not im here he thought sharing he answered yes na gamen gestured that they should continue walking dariel fell in step beside him again the sound of his feet stood out strangely compared to the silence with which the watcher moved if the mans feethidden beneath long gray robestouched the stone at all they gave no indication of it not even the fabric of his robes swished audibly beside him dariel felt awkward and loud every motion he made was too large and cumbersome when compared to the silent grace with which na gamen floated beside him listen see i will feed it to you dariel did not get a chance to ask what that meant before the words had faded from his head images began to scroll across his vision scenes through which he could barely see the real world behind mixed with this thoughts and emotions came to him delivered not with words not explained just given to him he felt them as if they were his emotions his thoughts and through that na gamens voice came and went moving him forward answering questions as he thought them the name lothan aklun he claimed was the auldek translation of their name given to them in this land before that they were called the dwellers in song they were a religious sect in the known world it was they who had preserved the givers tongue through the eons they long lived in cloistered seclusion respected by all the tribal powers they kept the song of elenet safe the actual book itself written in that thiefs crimped hand back then they still believed the giver would return they believed they could make amends for elenets arrogance for his crime of stealing the language of a god and using it in folly they did not use the gods song for themselvesas elenet hadbut sang it for the pure beauty of it they did not create things instead they formed the song into a hymn in praise of creation they sang it so that the giver wherever he was would hear it ring with purity and would know they were worthy of his attention that was all they wished to do make amends for elenets crime and bring the god back into the world also they worked to purify the song there were even in elenets own hand errors and impurities in the song evil or hateful flourishes the dwellers worked to find them and remove them so that the book would be pure it was an ongoing task that gave their lives meaning when new devotees were ready they journeyed across the land in small groups or singly dariel saw all this as much as heard it through na gamens words cloaked figures greeted the dawn with their heads raised and voices flowing out over the hilly talayan landscape a single man walked a mountain pass keeping time with the tapping of his walking stick on the stones women kneedeep in the tranquil waters of a blue ocean praised the sun as it burned its way into the rim of the world a circle of singers around a campfire wrapped in cloaks against the frigid wind eyes gazing at the millions of stars as their lips moved asking the giver to come back and bring harmony to the world again as he listened dariel understood the wordnotes that were that strange language so filled with longing so true and perfect somehow they carried the solidity of the substance of the world rendered in living sound for hundreds of years we lived and died and worked at this mission na gamen said he held dariel by the wrist now they walked along a narrow shelf of rock that dropped off down a steep slope on one side before them a stone staircase curved up toward the peak of the mountain they carried on toward it the world was in chaos through all that time see it and dariel did warring factions uprisings tribal betrayals atrocities the known world as it had once been flashed before dariels eyes in a torrent of images he saw things real and surreal things that made sense and things that did not an army of mailclad warriors smashed against howling tribesmen in furs and leather creatures with the lower bodies of horses and with human torsos above pounded across dry plains black skinned as balbarans they screamed war a queen bearing a narrow simple crown spoke before a gathered host of snarling monsters crammed together inside a huge chamber she showed no fear of them she just spoke on her freckled face serene before the madness na gamen explained that edifus left the dwellers alone as his conquest took shape he even visited them on occasion learning the song himself and adding his voice to theirs perhaps he still respected the god perhaps he believed as they did for a time it seemed so he convinced them that the world they were buildingonce the warfare was overwould have a beauty in the gods eyes in that way he would aid in luring the giver back to the known world we came to trust him we freely gave him the song of elenet who better than a king to protect it his sons thalaran tinhadin and praythos wanted to become students of the song but we would not teach them even edifus would not teach them he did not trust them he wanted them to wait to grow older to find wisdom through warfare first he hid the song in a place he thought nobody could find it when edifus died one of the sons showed himself to be everything edifus had feared tinhadin the middle son was a man apart from his siblings he fell into warring with them even as their wars of distribution spread the empire farther than edifus had ever dreamed he found ways to kill both his brothers still he wanted more a man with akaran eyes and a twicecrooked nose raged into a temple pushing through chairs and desks his sword slashing at any of the robed pupils near enough for him to cut down many fled from him but one man did not he stood leaning against a lectern his hands clasping it behind him holding it his face defiant the warrior swung his sword sloppy with rage it sliced through one of the priests arms and most of his torso he let loose the weapon and climbed over the gore slipping from the dying body to reach the text that the priest had been protecting the look of rapture on his face was like nothing dariel had ever witnessed we should have been prepared we should have seen it coming we did not he stole a text that should never have been read and made himself a sorcerer he used it to teach his chosen warriors together no army could stand against them warriors in orange cloaks waded into a great host an army like the entire world the sorcerer warriors hewed forward with great sweeps of their long swords they whispered words that dariel heard as if their lips were pressed against his ears he knew the meaning of the words for the space of time it took to hear them horrible words sounds that were the unmaking of the world notes that tore and destroyed phrases that twisted in dariels ears like living cancer and then he saw the man with the twicecrooked nose on a field of carnage the man ripped off his helmet and stood the only upright figure in a graveyard that stretched to the horizon on all sides bodies countless the silence terrible the santoth dariel said you are like the santoth you use the same magic no came the reply no we do not speak the same magic no we were not like them no more so than a scholar of warfare is a warrior we were scholars we kept the song we preserved it for centuries we stayed outside the worlds power struggles we kept the song alive and refined the givers tongue for the good of all you must understand that we made it even purer so that if ever the giver returned we could speak with him and show him that we were not all like elenet thats what we were the santoth what they stole was not the song of elenet it was the texts we had removed from it the parts of it that were most foul and twisted if they had been true scholars they would have known this but they were warriors they only ever wanted the things that warriors want conquest power to be feared these evil texts were aid enough and tinhadin only wanted their rage so he inflicted them with pain to plague them all the moments of their lives that were not spent fighting for him that was why they fought so mercilessly by inflicting pain they escaped it briefly themselves it was not until later that tinhadin discovered where his father had hidden the song of elenet he retrieved it and once he had it none could stand against him not the dwellers not his santoth he sent his own sorcerers into exile without sharing the true song with them they were raging evil hateful but they were powerless against him he had only to speak to destroy them so they accepted their exile dariel shook his head but i saw them on the teh plains when they thought my brother dead they marched north to search for him aliver had promised to release them once he found the song of elenet he died before he could when they confirmed that he was dead they unleashed a nightmare on the meins it was a horror but they did it for us they did not seem vengeful they won that war for us no not for you na gamen corrected for themselves if what you say is true they fought and destroyedas is dear to their hearts dont believe they did it for you though if they destroyed your enemy it was because that was the only place they could direct their anger and disappointment dariel be thankful your brother died before he released the santoth be thankful he never gave them the song of elenet if he had they would have destroyed him and taken the world as payment for their suffering thats what they want time does nothing to change men like them so that is the truth as i know it the watcher said tinhadin stole from us and created the santoth we should have fought him before that but we had no gift for prophecy we did not know what was coming how could we i ask you how could we a week away from the question out of rath batatt and back into inafeld forest dariel sat away from the others on night watch he pressed his back against the base of a large tree the group sleptor lay quiet with their thoughts like himin the small clearing just below him he still pondered na gamens question he had not answered it when asked but now he thought he knew they could have known what was coming if they had paid attention to the world if they had kept their eyes open to the struggles of nations and the ambitions and fears of man instead of believing they could ignore such things for their higher calling of course a thing that could be made into a weapon would be a made into a weapon it did not matter if it was a thing of beauty it did not matter if their mission was holy and benevolent it only mattered that the song could be twisted to serve human greed if that was so it was only a measure of time until someone grasped for it a man like tinhadin whose bloodna gamen reminded himflowed in his veins he did not let himself think also of a woman like his sister that thought lurked at the margins of his consciousness he knew it was there and that it would not likely go away but he could not face it yet there was too much else to face too many things more pressing on him as he had thought before he needed to solve the problems of this land it was here in ushen brae that he found himself and here that he had to carve a path forward the fact that na gamen looped it all back to the known world did not change that it just made everything more urgent dariel anira climbed the small rise up toward him he had not seen her until she spoke may i sit with you dariel indicated the space beside him with a crescent of root that would make a comfortable seat im no good as a watchman tonight when were you ever are you still thinking of him of course you anira sat back against the trunk her arm pressed against his i never had trouble sleeping before now was your time with him bad i mean he hesitated i dont know what i mean its still hard to talk about no my time with him wasnt bad was yours i dont know how to answer that he said an eruption of monkey calls peppered the air just then for a few moments the creatures leaped and swung through the trees above them passing like a great herd along a road of branches and limbs when they were gone into the distance both of them let the silence be anira did not seem to mind that he had not answered the question dariel was glad as he was grateful for the press of her dark skin against his anira said something in auldek why do you all sometimes speak auldek i would think you would hate it the tongue of our enslavement something like that all the tongues offered us were the tongues of our enslavement would you have us speak acacian you do speak acacian dariel said out of necessity its still the language that sold us to slavery its the language of the league we all came here with a first language not always acacian but we also spoke some acacian we had to its the language of your empire if we could have sorted ourselves we might have kept balbara alive in us or candovian or senivalian but we were thrown into a world where two languages were the only true currency auldek among the auldek acacian among ourselves at least we speak two languages what about you i speak a bit of lots of things a bit i had to i traveled all over i worked among the people in aushenia right in with them rebuilding after the war with hanish mein my noble prince anira teased she leaned her knees up over his and rested her head on his shoulder and how much of their talk can you speak you can say hello you can say my name is dariel what is yours you can ask where is the toilet and comment on the weather so long as its something you know the words for like raining am i right i never had to speak anything other than acacian i did it because i wanted to show that i cared do you know what mor would call that insulting dariel looked away i cant be accountable for what someone finds insulting no but you should try trying counts for a lot thats what i just said anira laughed you want me to teach you auldek real auldek not just polite phrases yes he said i do if its your language im learningnot the auldeks there are no auldek here anymore they are your peoples problem ill teach you if you will try to learn ill try dariel said b ack on the sky mount dariel and na gamen had stood atop a pinnacle of stone a high protrusion at the very tip of the mountain clouds flew past them at incredible speed wet against dariels skin it was terrifying each time they cleared and the entirety of the mountain heights fell away beneath them a span of time had passed since last they spoke he knew he had reached this place by walking up the stone staircase he knew that but he had not walked up it in a continuous journey from when this conversation began time or his awareness of it did not progress with such reasoned steadiness what did you do he asked how did you respond to tinhadins crimes look there and see na gamen answered following the watchers gaze dariel looked down and saw overlaid on the mountains a vast ocean at the edge of it a tiny fleet hugged an arctic shoreline colder and more forlorn than any dariel had seen they were specks on an infinity of water and waves stone and ice he swept down closer figures huddled on the decks wrapped in blankets none of them worked the sails and yet the ship moved forward among them on the deck of the last vessel a man stared directly at dariel his green eyes desolate hopeless he opened his mouth and spoke with the watchers voice cowards we fled we did not even manage to get the song of elenet back from tinhadin we tried but he attacked us with a savagery that combined the true song with the evil texts he threw a curse at our backs one that forever banished us from the known world it burned and we fled before it we were not warriors dariel akaran we were the faithful and our faith had been raped and violated the giver had truly forsaken us he was gone and would never return his abandonment of the world was complete no prayers or devotion or singing his praises would ever bring him back instead he gave the world to men like tinhadin we thought the world had ended they were years in the far north progressing slowly or not at all at times they were stuck fast in the pack ice for months on end often floating back toward the known world they survived by murmuring the words of the song they kept it going constantly passing it from ship to ship like a lantern to warm and light them they did not have the actual text of the song of elenet to guide them anymore but they had studied it hard before fleeing they knew enough and they had seen that the givers words could be twisted to serve man so they sang not to call back the giver though they sang to live to stay alive and as they did floating in a lifeless land they learned hatred when they finally sailed south along the new coastline that was ushen brae they saw the possibility of life returning to them a new nation a new people i stood on the beach the first day we made contact with them they bunched before us all threat and armor and weapons no language between us but they made themselves clear they would kill us destroy us throw our corpses back into the sea if we offended them thats all they offered us though we arrived with no heart for war we looked past them over them to the land beyond ushen brae was rich and fertile bursting with plant and animal life the auldek were fools to have turned their back on it and to have spent themselves at war instead of peace they were we thought no better than acacians dariel saw all this he felt what they had felt they could live on in the new land but not among the auldek they would live separate from them they would scrape by living on the barrier isles where the auldek feared to go so they did building at first a crude settlement it was not life as it had been they could not rekindle the love of the world they had once felt but they would survive in defiance of tinhadin they would spurn him they would be revenged on him by that very act once awakened revenge is a hunger as great any other there was a problem na gamen said already our mastery of the song had begun to lose its purity our voices warped from true like instruments losing their tuning soon it seemed we would have to abandon it entirely that was too much to bear so we learned to preserve some of the givers tongue outside ourselves knowing it would decay in our minds until it was nothing but curses we worked to put the song into things we trapped our intent inside stone wood metal we built with material and sorcery bound together for yes the song was sorcery to us now we became like elenet seeking to use it for our own means the soul vessels dariel said na gamen stared out toward the horizon his large eyes open against the buffeting wind and other devices yes these made our lives easier gave us power made it possible to trade with the auldek we thought for a time that would be all we would trade with them what we could we would survive but then a ship reached us from the known world dariel saw it a floating wreck a ship with a shredded mainsail and the smaller ones in tatters the men upon it skeletal the dead and living mixed together hard to tell apart they had not sailed to ushen brae intentionally they had floated with the currents after being battered by a savage storm and blown far from their normal waters they were suffering from illness and delusion some spoke to the sorcerers they saw as if they believed them to be keepers of the afterdeath the sorcerers nursed the sailors back to life a few of them at least it was not easy they were far gone insane from their ordeal to save them na gamen and the others fed the sailors a diet of mist threads keeping them in a chamber rank with the smoke of the stuff and using the threads to sew their festering wounds and made poultices of it to soothe their sores they bound their heads and squeezed the madness out of them bringing them back in a form that suited them then the dwellers in song developed a scheme to use them they would send them back to the known world in a new better ship one that could sail directly across the gray slopes without fear of succumbing to sea beasts they could not do this themselves for tinhadins curse would forever hold but these sailors could they would offer trade with a vast new nation we called ourselves what the auldek called us lothan aklun the dwellers in song we said nothing about our origins through these sailors we offered a deal with tinhadin though he would never know with whom he partnered or why we offered it this dariel was the birth of those you call the league of course it was dariel thought we saved them created them they have thought themselves apart from other men ever since and we made this trade into a punishment revenge on the acacians punishment for the auldek for being so like them in their love of war and destruction the auldek needed to repopulate their nation after years of war we took that ability from them made them barren with the song tinhadin the sailors told us was fighting with his own sorcerers they had turned against him or he against them he was trying to hold together an empire that denied it even was an empire he was at the verge of losing everything we had only to find a thing that each side could provide the other we did children for auldek sedated peace for the acacians so it was arranged we did not understand at the beginning how long it could last how we would prosper we harvested souls from the quota children and kept them within our own bodies we became immortal by sucking lives from acacia we gave them to the auldek so that they would live and live and live always needing more we made the quota children infertile so that the auldek would always need more of them so it has been ever since how was that a punishment dariel asked you made us prosper we ruled unbroken for twentytwo generations what greater punishment na gamen asked is there than sacrificing your morality for a delusion whats worse than living with lies woven into the fabric of your every interaction we are nothing but the lives we lead dariel akaran even poor children sold into slavery may live honest lives no akaran has done that since tinhadin became the despot he was your people have escaped death these many generations but they have lived failed lives in the process yours prince is as yet a failed life chapter fifteen the league council had been clear sire dagon needed to find out everything he could about aliver akarans being alive such a thing was unthinkable and yet here they were forced not only to think about it but to weigh just what it meant for them and decide how to respond if it was true corinn had reached into dimensions she should not have interfered with either she was more powerful than they knew or she was more foolish or both dagon had thought at the time or both finally summoned to the palace for a meeting of the queens council dagon sat impatiently through rhrennas opening remarks as always she called on the spirits of the first five akaran kings to instill the council members with wisdom what rubbish the only akaran kings to demonstrate wisdom had been covertly removed or manipulated by the league well dagon thought considering it that way yes by all means follow their examples he kept his face expressionless as rhrenna went over routine matters sigh saden sat feigning composure as well looking down his aristocratic nose vaguely bored he was neither composed nor bored though the tremulous way the index finger on his left hand tapped on the edge of the table said as much old julian was more honestly at ease dagon knew that he had actually spoken with whoever it was they all believed to be aliver obviously julian had been convinced he had been close to leodan perhaps he was one agnate who honestly wished the akarans well balneaves sharratt just looked hungry talinbeck full of questions and general andeson subdued baddel the talayan bubbled with energy he looked as giddy as a tenyearold girl on her name day dagon would have continued his examination of the councilors but happily rhrenna concluded her opening routine the queen began without further delay i know what you all want corinn said you want to see aliver weve to discuss what happened in teh and the coming war and the vintage and all manner of other things but what you want to know is if what youve heard and seen can possibly be true well judge for yourselves corinn pointed toward the far end of the table only then did dagon realize the seat facing corinn had been left vacant he must have been truly distracted not to have noticed that earlier sigh saden had been accustomed to sitting there perhaps that explained his agitation on cue rhrenna intoned something about welcoming his royal majesty brought from the dark lands to light again and so forth dagon was not listening for a man had stepped through the open door he walked toward the end of the table popping in and out of view as he passed behind the far row of seated councilors dagon did not get a clear view of him until he reached the vacant seat and turned smiling on the council aliver akaran he was older than when dagon had last seen him but aliver had only been a boy then this was a man slim and well formed his cheekbones and jawline cut stronger angles than before he held himself with a trace of his old stiff posture he was a little darker than dagon remembered with wavy hair pressed neatly to his head by the jeweled leather band that circled his forehead hello councilors he said they answered with a frayed chorus of your majesty dagon bowed his head though less from deference than from a desire to hide his face it was really true not just rumor not a clever illusion not an impostor he knew all these things with certainty already part of him wanted to fly from the chamber and seek communion with his fellows to tell and show them everything with his mind that would have to wait though he did his part in the clamor praising the queen wondering at aliver baddel even rose and ran around the table clapping his hands as he went and embraced aliver will you become king your highness oh there will be so much rejoicing all talay will celebrate this is just the thing to bring the tribes together again just as we were when you rallied us to war against hanish mein nedona a new councilor from the ou trading family of bocoum shoved baddel away then he pulled aliver close and whispered in his ear that could not go unmet soon the entire council was afoot and jostling to make contact these jackals are quick to start nibbling dagon thought staying seated and decorous it was some time before the council returned to order how saden had a question but did not seem to know how to phrase it how are you to govern now i mean he gestured to the queen then across to aliver and then he wriggled his fingers not at all a clear illustration of his question but they all understood it theres no precedent the senate will have to the senate will do what it does corinn said they have no role in this aliver and i will rule together but we cant have two monarchs talinbeck exclaimed the idea seemed to horrify him he looked to jason the most scholarly among them has that ever happened in all the generations of the empire the scholar took his time in answering but not because he needed to search for it he just seemed stunned no he said there is no precedent but i dont recall any record of the dead being returned to life its all unprecedented corinn said yes that much is confirmed so we will rule together there will be a coronation then baddel asked corinn deferred to aliver with a nod he answered yes at the winter solstice i knowthats not when its usually done but its what we have to do well be at war this spring no time for the ceremony then your first order of business corinn said will be to help rhrenna put together the guest lists quickly weve but a month send birds today aliver added shout it to the world it will be a week of festivities like none the empire has seen for years corinn continued my coronation was a bit muted so much mourning and death the aftermath of the war and all that that entailed none of us had been in a mood for a grand display this time it will be different well assure the people of the greatness of the acacian empire well show them strong leadership power beyond their imaginings and food aliver said well feed them food before the astonished eyes of the council both siblings doubled over in laughter the two of them dagon thought are like children suddenly out from under the heel of their parents gleeful at the idea of discarding the old rules he said that is truly gracious of you your majesty he looked to the queen your mastery of the song astounds us all what you did on the fields of teh i scarcely believed when i heard it now i dont doubt it aliver is evidence that you are truly heir to tinhadin himself is there a limit to your powers none that i have yet discovered but you cannot read minds can you bitch dagon thought he said wonderful may i ask you to detail how you come to these powers no corinn said im sure you have theories notions you may even have the truth but dont ask me to show my hand entirely the league would never do that correct ah dagon said leaving the expulsion of breath as a neutral response may i ask if aliver will take up the study of sorcery as well he went in search of the santoth before even brought them into the battle with hanish mein yes corinn did not defer to her brother this time aliver has other skills he works magic with the populace all talay worships him thats what he will focus on preparing the known worlds forces to fight the auldekassuming mena does not rob him of that glory good that you mention the war dagon said a great part of my joy in seeing the prince returned is knowing that hell be with us during the coming war perhaps we should consider that issue and its many faces i would very much like to hear the princes thoughts im sure we all would he tented his fingers in truth he did not care that much about discussing the war but he needed to see how aliver addressed such matters the long conversation he sat through convinced him of two things firstand he tested this several timesaliver akaran said nothing that differed from his sisters opinion the vintage not a protest he saw no problem with the common people of the empire being drugged into faithful reverence once again menas choosing mein tahalian as a base to train her army through the winter what a fine idea corinns hope that she could sing elyas children into accelerated growth and make them winged mounts by the spring a pleasing possibility strange that nobody had thought of it earlier corinn said we were thinking jason about the charge i gave you earlierabout creating a horse lore the scholar jumped at the mention of his name yes ive been working on that there are many ancient references to be expanded upon did you know that talayans once had a horse culture i didnt know until i dug deep into the archives youll be fascinated ive collected documents for you to consider he turned to hand the folder to a servant who would bring it around the table to corinn um i dont think so the queen said she indicated with curl of her lip that the servant need not bother were going to scrap that idea jason stared at her at a loss for words for a moment your majesty he eventually said scrap it an idea for yesterday aliver said picking up for his sister the notion of another life entirely no instead work on a lore of winged riders winged riders are exactly the thing to excite the masses but there have never been winged riders not until mena and there will be more than just elya corinn said there will be in the face of such dual certainty jason withered he took back his documents and mumbled that he would begin researching that very afternoon winged riders dagon wanted to laugh but the knot that formed in his stomach told him there was something to this when was the last time his agents had seen elyas young he had a sudden realization that the maid who funneled information from the palace had been silent on the subject lately he would have to check could the queen be doing something with them she must be she was confident enough in her actions to flaunt it here among her councilor enemies in everything as they talked on the royal siblings shared the same mind how bothersome even when aliver set his light brown eyes on the leagueman himself it might as well have been corinn doing so sire dagon what of the search for my brother i read the last dispatch but you must give us more than vague hopes and possibilities im afraid i cannot your highness our search continues of course but there has been no word of your brother at all aliver stared at him its our top priority in the other lands i assure you the prince made a sour face it was startling until he followed it with a gesture of his fingers as if he were opening his hand to drop seeds dagon recognized it for what it wasa talayan expression of grudging acknowledgment im sure thats so but dariel is lost in a foreign land what can be more important than finding him more likely hes dead in a foreign land dagon came very near to saying dare i say it but we may never do that your highness aliver leaned forward set both elbows on the table then the league will have me to answer to let me be clear this will happen you will find dariel everything about the empires relationship with the league depends on it do you understand that sire dagon need i detail exactly what i mean the whelp is threatening me dagon thought hes threatening the league and making sure everyone here knows it corinn looked as pleased as a proud mother the other thing it convinced him of was that queen corinn had evolved into a greater danger than the league had anticipated it was not just that every rumor about what she had achieved through sorcery appeared to be true nor was it that her demeanor was more selfsatisfied than he had ever seen it was none of the things dagon detailed about the weapons she had at her disposal it was instead that for brief moments he was sure her eyes sparked with madness he was sure nobody else noticed it was there though a quiver at their corners on occasion once it looked as if she saw something in the room that was not actually there by the late hour that the meeting concluded dagon knew he would have to send his brothers a troubling report the situation was not as chaotically tranquil as they had anticipated more was at work than they had known the league could not simply float above the bloodshed watch the shuffling of pieces and accept any outcome as beneficial not when corinn raised the dead and destroyed small armies and planned to fly men on dragons with all that she might actually triumph what a terrifying thought in his quarters in the league area of acacia dagon moved swiftly there were enough leaguemen in alecia to convene a partial council he would sail for the mainland and commune with them there he wrote a quick missive and had it sent ahead of him via the swiftest of his messenger birds he penned it in the leagues archaic script so that he could speak directly no fear of anyone decoding the message brothers aliver lives i have seen and touched him the queens power expands to danger we must meet he signed it by pressing a fingertip smeared with his own blood on the parchment chapter sixteen rialus did his best to explain that he need not be brought along calrach was going he could surely provide all the pertinent information he knew more than rialus did about the ice fields and all that rialus would just be deadweight an extra burden besidesand this was no small thingrialus was not good with heights he need not have tired his tongue devoths mind was made up rialuss objections influenced him no more than a buzzing gnat would haveif there had been any buzzing gnats in this arctic hell devoth only acknowledged his protests as if rialus were being selfdenigrating a willful misinterpretation if rialus had ever seen one it did not help matters that sabeer offered to ride with rialus between her legs for extra warmth she said devoth pointedly ignored her come rialus its no bother youre my guest rialus found himself standing in the blistering cold so weighted with furs that just staying upright was a mighty effort before him like stone statues brought to life moving with their strange regally bestial mannerisms stood the freketes rialus had learned that there were only twelve of them though furless and naked they took no notice of the cold they shifted every so often but did so as if posing before an audience flexing their muscles and stretching their wings which shone blueblack against the gray wall of the sky quota minders moved around them some climbed about on the leather harnesses strapped to the creatures backs making adjustments a few seemed to be massaging oils into their skin the massive size of the freketes was bad enough the fact that their bodies had humanoid musculaturemasculine yet somehow sexlesswas even worse but their pale faces truly made rialus want to slither away large round eyes set in apelike features proud and cocky and malicious at the same time they did not look like dumb beasts at all rather they gave the impression of intelligent creatures bored and unimpressed by life doubtfully hoping that this whole mad invasion might prove diverting that one is my mount devoth smacked rialus on the shoulder and pointed at one of the nearer freketes he named it something that rialus did not catch in the slightest it sounded like a sputtering grunt cut short by a sneeze then snapped away on the wind at that but you can call him bitten you will like him rialus not likely listen though devoth pulled him near and whispered almost as if he feared the creatures would overhear dont look them in the eyes what im telling you dont look them in the eyes they dont like it not from any but their riders theyre particular rialus take no offense at it devoth smacked him on the back an impact that nearly sent rialus sprawling other auldek arrived jolly and shouting at one another blowing plumes of mist calrach had never looked more pleased with himself herith and millwa actually sang verses of some ghastly song menteus nemre was among them also he stood with the auldek not with any of the quota slaves even with his body wrapped in furs the sculpted musculature showed through his hood was thrown back perhaps it had to be considering the way his mass of white dreadlocks jutted out from his scalp like an unruly mane of thick snakes for a while they milled around as if just enjoying the morning but at some point the auldek announced that it was time to depart the quota handlers jumped from the beasts as the auldek clambered up them with devoth climbing up after him and several slaves directing him rialus scaled their freketes back slaves pushed him into position shoving his limbs through straps buckling him down before he knew it he was spreadeagled against the creatures back immobile devoth took up a position just behind him pressing against him in a more intimate position than rialus had ever experienced with a man rialus set his cheek against the freketes warm skin closed his eyes and tried to think of the frekete bellowed rialus felt the vibrations through his cheek and chest and thighs a sound so complete it became everything for a few moments as it faded the creature shifted from leg to leg the muscles in its back quivered and then it leaped rialuss internal organs tried to slip out of him and stay earthbound they caught down around his groin and went hurdling into the air with the rest of him for a few seconds it seemed they would just rise indefinitely with the power of that first leap but then the momentum slowed they reached a zenith and the mighty wings flared they flew slanting away with a speed that this time shoved rialuss insides up against one side of his rib cage devoth howled in pleasure the frekete answered rialus clung eyes still shut miserable for a time the frekete pounded its wings vigorously the beasts called to one another and the riders on them shouted as if to top them soon they developed a slow rhythm one wingbeat followed by a long pause before the next judging by the way wind ripped at him and howled in his ears they must have been moving at great speed rialus could not know for sure though he kept his hood fastened tight and endured the passing hours and constant motion as best he could the expedition took nearly a week they flew east along the ragged icechoked coast camping on the boulderstrewn beach with a wall of stone pressing them toward the sea massive rivers of ice choked the few gaps in the mountains fissured groaning and cracking as if alive impenetrable beautiful in a way that confounded rialus the ice glistened blue clear as glass in some places touched with swirls of red in others certain formations he would have thought sculpted by artists save the scale was too massive it was a work out of proportion for human contemplation as was his view of it on the occasions he looked down from thousands of feet in the air for a few days rialus felt a bubbling of hope and fear in his chest he knew that farther south the mountains jutted right out into the sea no rolling army could pass there perhaps there was no route perhaps they would have to turn back and calrach would lose his head and rialus would well he would spend the rest of his days in ushen brae it was a shortlived notion flying on south they found the gap in the stone barricade the very one that calrach insisted existed no river of ice flowed in this one perhaps it once had but now it just lay before them the long tongue of a peaceful valley they turned inland scouting a route through the mountains and eventually out onto the ice fields the auldek became more and more pleased with everything they observed the route through the mountains was navigable the ice of the fields was solid enough for all their structures and beasts to roll over everything was as calrach had said because of it his stature among the small group grew in direct proportion to the degree to which rialuss hopes shriveled their destination before returning to the war column was tavirith the northernmost trading outpost along the candovian coast rialus himself had named the place a few days before they flew out he had been there only once while governor of the mein satrapy he had never thought he would return when bitten touched down rialus did not really believe they had made it that far they had been flying long enough that he had lost track of time and distance but at some level he could not believe these arctic wastes would ever end he did not so much feel as if they were hiking toward one world as he felt they were marching out of the world entirely into endless nothing devoth dismounted before him and was off conferring with the other auldek by the time rialus touched his feet to the icecrusted stones of the windswept beach he moved away from bitten not trusting the beast without devoth beside him he found himself too close to one of the other hulking freketes so he moved forward and a little to the side of where the auldek stood conferring he tried to make sense of the low dull light but he could not even say what time of day it was they could be anyplace anyplace at all in this forsaken barrenness he had just begun to turn and look toward the north when something caught his eye shapes huddled in the shadow of the dunes to the south a cluster of geometry just ordered enough to stand out as he stared the details became clearer and clearer a village there a second cluster of houses what looked like large stones on the shore were the hulls of beached boats and that clutter of sticks was actually an old pier smoke rose from several chimneys the moment he spotted the plumes he smelled them as well embedded in the side of one building was a square of glowing yellow light he had been inside that building he had looked out of that very window is this it howlk asked tavirith the auldek had gathered to either side of him studying the same view he was studying rialus yanked his eyes away as if he could deny that he had seen anything he did not want to answer and yet there it was a piece of the known world again rialus tell us sabeer said is that tavirith he only meant to acknowledge it to himself but the word escaped him yes yeesss howlk hissed yeesss i knew it i can smell acacians the people of tavirith were hardly acaciansmore a mix of ancestral candovians combined with some of the scav who were their own race perhaps a few of meinish stock and a motley collection of others misfits who had fled the real world and washed up here the auldek shouted something at the freketes and then pointed toward the village the creatures followed the gestures they glanced at one another as if coming to their own agreement on the order and then rose one by one into the air they flew for the village devoth had never looked happier his eyes followed them with childish amazement as if he somehow were not the architect of all this but just a witness then he marched after them without a word of direction to rialus as he strode he reached around and yanked free the long sword strapped to his back the other auldek also freed their various weapons rialus almost stayed where he was an act of protest against whatever was about to happen but as the auldek got farther away the howling emptiness at his back shifted closer his feet moved of their own accord he stumbled forward the freketes circled above the village a few of them touched down several alighted on the structures roofs the auldek lumbered forward getting faster rialus himself began to run on the one hand he hated being pulled forward on the other he wanted to shout an alarm to somehow alert the villagers to the enemy upon them and to explain that he was not one of them he did not get to do any of this instead he was in place to watch what followed one of the freketes on a roof leaped into the air and holding its wings angled up vertically slammed down on the structure the houses rialus knew were built around a framework of pinewood and whalebone layered with a latticework of beams and skins and covered with turf the house being attacked was solid enough that the frekete needed to leap several times before it punched through it half disappeared inside only its wings protruded as the rest of its body twisted and slashed around inside the others went wild one shattered another roof another punched in a door and shoved an arm in the first to break through climbed out of the wreckage a flailing body clenched in its jaws when its upper body was clear of the rooftop it grabbed the person in one hand and hurled him out toward the onrushing auldek the man screamed as he tumbled through the air and crashed down howlk slammed his spear into the mans abdomen pinning him to the ground for the moment it took before he strode over him yanking the weapon out as he did so the auldek reached the village as the inhabitants began to emerge a man burst through a door and ran roaring into the open he carried an ax in one hand raised above his head not so much in an attack as in a gesture of warning rialus could tell it was not a war ax it was one for chipping away ice devoth who was standing directly in the mans path spun to one side as the man passed him he swung his sword around angled it up and severed the mans arm at the elbow it and the ax looped away the man ran forward a few strides waving his stump as if it still held the ax devoth let him turn spraying blood in a circle around him he let him understand a portion of what was happening then he sliced his legs out from under him other men followed to variations of the same fate women and children died the same way the villagers fought as best they could or they begged for mercy the auldek were like cats playing with baby mice when the villagers stood still the auldek smiled and laughed and said incomprehensible things to them when they dropped to their knees or ran or lashed out the auldek slashed them to pieces sabeer was just as gleeful as devoth or howlk menteus nemre worked his own bloody havoc he dove into houses and chased out the inhabitants he shoved them savagely toward waiting auldek slicing to pieces any who ran in a whirling dance of butchery his face expressionless his white locks wild and living as he moved whipping about like snakes searching for victims to bite it did not last long yet it went on forever all in the settlementmen and women old and young even a few childrenwere hunted out and slaughtered all of them this could happen to gurta he thought this could be what happens to myhe did not let himself finish the thought it lingered incomplete within him the last few died within a howling circle of monsters dancing around them gleefully cutting them down one after another until they were all gone all dead the auldek held to that circle drawing in closer over the bodies their weapons finally lowered the freketes already looked bored they rummaged through the debris of the houses one began stoking a fire that had spread from a chimney the others took up the task caving in whole walls to watch them ignite rialus hovered at the margin of the carnage it was like he was standing too close to the fires the blaze of shame scorched his face even as the raging winter froze his back the people of tavirith were not warriors they had been whalers hunters traders women and children as poor and simple as any in the known world why kill them for what purpose what sense did it make didnt they see what they had done he wanted to find devoth and ask him show him how vile this all was the work of cowards an act to be ashamed of for the rest of his eternal life that was why he stepped forward across the bloodsplattered stones that was why he approached the circle of auldek backs that was why he moved around them searching for devoth that was why he was right in among them when he understood what they were doing in a crack between the huddled bodies devoth worked over a slain villager the furs and clothing had been cut from his body devoth slid the point of his short dagger up along the mans thigh slicing away a strip of flesh that he then held dangling from his fingers he stared at it the other auldek silent around him their blood joy was gone this was something else do it calrach urged believe me and do it this is not as in ushen brae this is a new world for us i tell you do this thing your soul will rejoice devoths eyes moved from face to face he had never looked so circumspect so unsure of himself but when he acted he did so decisively he held up the strip of bloody flesh and bit it he had to rip off a morsel gripped in his teeth with a slice of the knife and a sideways jerk of his head immediately he thrust the rest of the flesh up for someone else to take howlk was first the others followed for a few minutes there was no sound but their chewing that and the crackling of the fires and the screech of gulls that had suddenly materialized the crash of the waves over the stones and the wind buffeting about rialuss head and the strange calls the freketes exchanged like some language of cackling grunts and the roar of something that was not quite sound but that felt like a storm building inside his skull somehow a sort of silence contained all these things broken only when devoth began to laugh yes the auldek said i think this is yes something is here howlk cupped his groin i can feel it here i can feeeellllll it he stretched the word out and lifted it into a shout the other auldek responded in kind one after another confirming that they felt it too whatever it was calrach danced from one bloodsplattered diner to another clapping and patting them on the back i told you so i know what youre feeling now i felt it too i didnt know what was happening i didnt believe it i thought whats this im feeling whats come to life down there but i learned i learned and i brought you here to give you life back tell me you feel it they did rialus turned and ran he got only a few steps before he lurched over and vomited as he crouched there on all fours his insides escaping him he was more miserable than ever he had been in a life filled with misery he would not have thought it before but oh how he loved the people of the known world they were his people his even these villagers were his people he wanted to rise and run from body to body kissing their faces and pouring his grief over them but he couldnt he had failed them it was his fault these monsters were eating human flesh they were vile vile vile he was vile for even the brief moments he had taken pleasure in their company sabeer she was eating this flesh too he had not seen her but he knew she would she would eat him if the desire took her and what now after watching this slaughter was he to climb back on that winged beast with devoth again pressed against his back was he to sit with them as they told the tale to the others stirred their blood promised them more was coming for them all would he be beside them still when the bulk of the invasion arrived to destroy everything about the world that he had ever known no better to die right now here all he had to do was attack them he never had in all his days with them he had never fought the truth of it stunned and sickened him all he had to do was grab one of their daggers and stab they would kill him but maybe he would even take one of them with him or just take one more life out of them that would be something he straightened got his balance on his bent knees turned and looked back toward the group menteus nemre watched him the lvin warrior sat outside the carnivores circle not participating in the banquet but not perturbed by it he stared at rialus no expression that rialus could read on his thick tattooedwhite features he stared but he communicated nothing at all through the stare and then he lifted his gaze over rialuss shoulder i see you leagueman a voice beside his head whispered rialus tried to spin but a body pressed against his back and an arm clenched him immobile you think us wretched devoth said speaking close to his ear you think us animals we make you sick isnt that so rialus leagueman devoth squeezed him but did not wait for an answer this is no custom of ours it was an abomination a violation of our long laws you understand numrek were banished for eating quota we took away their totem and sent them into exile we thought them just as wretched as you think us now but that was before they came to your lands and returned to us with allek a child to prove they were fertile again everything is different now this is why devoths other hand swung into view a piece of human flesh squeezed in his fist blood seeped around his fingers and dripped to the ground coming here killing your people eating this meat these things will give us full lives again you cannot blame us for wanting that are you any different dont you want things leagueman of course you do if i said to you here eat this just one bite and you will have what you most want to have he held the flesh close to rialuss face near enough that he could smell the wet rawness of it take a bite and you can go home take a bite and you can have your woman beside you you can fly in the air to your queen and tell her the secrets of how to defeat us take a bite and i will drop dead just here ill soil myself and shake with fear and collapse in pain and die right here and you would be a hero what would you do if a bite of this meat offered you that rialus said you dont you dont know that this will cure you its what the numrek did true they were starving when they did so but who is to say that the flesh of the fertile didnt help them who is to say can you say no so if this deed will bring us what we most want well what would you do you would eat thats what tell me if i lie rialus said nothing thats right my leagueman thats right you would eat i know you would chapter seventeen aliver has returned aliver has returned aliver has since leaving bocoum kelis kept forming the sentence in his mind making it a chant the three words made him lightheaded with joy if it was true it was wonderful beyond anything he had ever dreamed possible aliver could pick up where he left off he could take the crown from corinn and shape the world back toward what he had always dreamed kelis could love him again in life not just mourn him as a memory he would deliver shen and aliver would know that kelis had cared for her from the moment he knew she lived even the santoth would bow to him a king who has walked the afterdeath and returned to the living but as he drew near the hiding place at which he had left the others a knot of doubt like an enormous knuckle root took shape low in his abdomen he paused atop a hillock not far from the ravine in which the others camped before him the plains stretched under the dark of the night behind him a copse of trees in whose star shadows he hesitated trying to shape his thoughts and decide what to say or not when questioned some small creature moved in the trees a ground bird perhaps stirring the leaves he ignored it he had been all euphoria at first yet now he could not help but wonder why corinn brought her brother back she might love him in her crooked way but she would never let go of power what did she when he realized what the sound in the trees had become it was too late the man hit him at a run smashing into his side with his shoulder the attacker was fast as they fell he jabbed his fist repeatedly into keliss abdomen by the time kelis hit the ground scraping across the dirt with the other mans weight on him the man had kelis knotted within the hard limbs of his body they came to rest panting with the attackers chin pressed like a weapon against keliss temple pinning his head to the ground all this in a few seconds fool another man said he appeared suddenly out of breath we could have followed him to her shut up the first hissed his chin ground keliss skin as he spoke gag him the other punched kelis in the jaw several times and then jammed a wad of cloth in he secured it with a leather strap that tied behind keliss head the first man changed position he squirmed across keliss back as intimate as a lover except that his movements were all sharp pressure and corded muscle for a moment kelis felt one of his wrists slip free of the mans pincer grip he slipped his hand around and tried to get purchase on the ground with it the man pressed the flat of a knife to keliss throat the backcurved point cut into the skin to touch his lower jawbone no the man whispered dont do that the man pulled kelis up to his knees the knife at his neck the whole time bind him the second man did so once keliss hands were tied the two attackers changed positions the second man slipped his own dagger into place clamping his other hand on keliss shoulder and driving one bony knee down on his calf kelis fought not to wince at the pain kelis of umae im assuming the first man said he stood tall in the starlight his black skin silvered in sharp highlights his teeth flashed when he smiled kelis wanted to make out his features but his vision blurred his eyes clogged with dirt and tears i am not impressed was such an important one really put in your hands oh but you cant answer can you we should have followed him the second said theyre near i could see it in the way he was movinga daydreamer wasting time thats why i took him down we wont have to deal with him when we grab her one less no kelis screamed into his stuffed mouth he raised his bound hands before him a begging gesture what the first man said are you not kelis of umae do you not protect a girl called shen this may all be a mistake yes just tell us so if it is there was a trick in the question kelis knew he tried to figure it out but the possibilities of it seemed as knotted as the wrestling moves that had trapped him tell us that the girl is not hidden down in the ravine just there kelis writhed as much as he dared gesturing with his eyes touching his fingertips to the gag let me talk he tried to say let me talk he did not know what he would say but he needed to try the man spat in his face ioma said i was not to kill you but i piss on that youve kept me waiting here too long this story is yours no longer bleed him for the jackals the man grinned he was still doing so the moment his teeth exploded from his mouth they flew to the side in a wet spray propelled by a black shaft that shot through his cheek and out of sight in an instant the man dropped in a howl of pain falling away down the slope of the hillock kelis planted his two hands on the dirt and bucked up against the man who held him down getting his feet under him he used the bunched strength of his bent legs and smashed his backside into the mans torso he collapsed his upper body into a roll as he did so the mans feet went flailing into the air and he fell headfirst over kelis to the ground kelis rolled got onto his two hands and popped up again he came back on the man before he could rise he shot out a low thrusting kick it caught the mans head against his heel and snapped it to the side solid contact but the man scrambled up slashing the air between them with his knife kelis circled away trying hard not to trip his hands were still bound going down again could be the end of him the second man kept the blade between them the whites of his eyes glowed in the moonlight he looked frantically between kelis and the first man who was on the ground scraping at the dirt as if he would crawl away but did not remember how to do so jos the man yelled jos what is it the high pitch that cracked his voice gave away that he knew clearly enough what it was as did the fact that he snapped around and ran two steps and a low branch of an acacia tree scratched his face he stumbled back from the thorns cursing kelis reached him he slammed his bound hands over the mans head and then hauled back with the full weight of his body he yanked the man from his feet swung him around and then twisted as the vertebrae in the mans neck snapped apart he fell in a tangle with the dead mans body he had to struggle to get free of the mans sickening lolling neck and scrabble to his feet this took longer than the act of killing him had upright kelis stood panting his eyes darting between the two men he whirled at a sound his fists clenched ready to kill again kelis brother its me naamen moved out of the shadow of a tree he held a knife low in his strong hand pinned in place with his thumb so that his fingers stretched open in a gesture that conveyed that he would drop the weapon instead of use it if attacked those fingers stilled kelis brought him back from the murderous rage coursing through him are you all right kelis looked between the two attackers one still living after naamen removed his gag he said i heard only a bird the words just came out without thought naamen studied him a moment and then he used his knife to cut the cords on keliss wrists two birds assassin birds i think they fly no more we should though we should fly fast did you do that kelis pointed at the man still writhing on the ground naamen shook his head he did not need to explain further leeka stepped out of the shadows he walked around the fallen man picked up the spear that had shattered his jaw with one swift movement he slammed the point into the mans back aimed at his heart he held it there a moment the prone man did not move anymore leekas fingers loosened around the shaft his fingertips light in their touch as if he were measuring the effect of his strike through it then his hand clamped again he yanked the weapon free and walked toward the two watching men he held out a spear that kelis realized belonged to naamen lets go the old man said kelis and naamen did so it was only later that it occurred to kelis that those two words were the most normal sounding he had heard from leeka since the day he had vanished years before running in pursuit of the santoth they roused benabe and shen just minutes after their encounter with ous men their bodies would still have been warm as kelis strapped shen to his back and loped away into the last dark hours of the night iron spear gripped in his fist this time benabe after a few questions was kind enough to leave the explanation of what had happened alone she ran with them she was stronger now kelis realized than she had been at the beginning of their journey together or perhaps like kelis himself she just wanted to see all this to a conclusion running took them there faster than walking so they ran they pushed on into the morning climbing into the rocky uplands they passed through the afternoon into a land of sheep and goats they rested only when they stopped for water at the wells the herders marked twice they drank from ponds frequented by the grazing animals themselves exhausted by the late afternoon they shared shens weight between them first one and then the other carrying her on like this into the merciful cool of the following evening through which they ran until naamen stumbled spilling shen into the dry grass beside him after that they cut the pace they waited through the next day inside a vault of granite boulders and then took to moving only at night as much as possible throughout all this the santoth hung there behind them sometimes kelis pushed their pace unconsciously trying to outrun them but nothing ever changed the sorcerers never seemed to fall behind even though their gaitan ambling rocking motionstayed steady they could not be outrun that did not stop kelis from trying aliver i know these are your chosen sorcerers but lend me your faith in them lend it to me for i have need of it chapter eighteen melio held his mouthful of water so long that at some point he lost the world probably only for a moment for when his eyes opened again his mouth was still filled with water geenas body still touched his wet ribbons of her short auburn hair striped her round face that was fun she said she planted a quick salty kiss on his lips great to be alive isnt it thanks for the grab melio realized his cheeks were ballooned out his mouth still full of seawater he spat which unleashed a fit of coughing and retching he crawled out of the compartment the fish that had crowded the hull were all gone as was anything that had not been secured the boat pitched about at the mercy of the chop geena was already checking the sail for damage all well she asked looking unaccountably chipper everyone have all their fingers and toes and wiggly bits clytus held the broken mast for support his shirt had been stripped off and he stood sending a string of curses after the league ship kartholome did not waste his breath on them he sat panting near the bow his beard canted off to the side one of his bone earrings was missing judging by the dribble of blood down his neck and the stain on his thin white shirt it had been yanked free they do that on purpose clytus said they have a betting pool the captain that runs over the most fishing vessels each moon cycle wins it the galley lumbered away looking slow and dull now hardly the mischievous creature that had nearly sunk them the league kartholome muttered nothing else like them in the world wait until you see melio wait until you see what i have to show you since the mainmast had snapped they took up oars and bent their backs to pull on them they headed west sailing lightless under a sliver of moon they kept the islands north of them bulky shadows that they ran alongside of until sunrise they pulled into a small cove managed to hide the boat in the overgrown foliage and slept under the dappled light to the everpresent sound of crabs creeping across the fallen leaves the next night they turned in to the thousands they inched forward slowly sharing the post of lookout on the bow at the tiller or on the oars the place took its name from the numberless islands that jutted up everywhere some just reefs barely parting the surface of the ocean others large outcroppings bursting with vegetation loud with birdlife and crowded with small monkeys that kartholome claimed swam between the islands regularly hunting snakes snakes yeah there are a lot of them on the small islands on the bigger ones the league has mostly killed them off they reached one of those large islands that afternoon they pulled the boat aground on a small beach hemmed on one side by a sheer rock face and on the other by a tangle of vegetation the beach dropped quickly so that only a few feet out the water fell away into deep blue this was why kartholome knew the place midsized frigates and transports could pull up to the beach leaving geena to watch the boat kartholome led the other two up a fissure in the stone that became a steep path the beach was lost from view almost immediately the climb was short and soon they walked through a forest of palm trees the fallen fronds crunched under their feet a few minutes later kartholome brought them to the edge of a slope above a large valley he indicated with a wave that this was the view he had brought melio to see melio stepped beside him wrapped a hand around a palm trunk and looked out over a compound of buildings and clearings water tanks and training fields military units marched through maneuvers in one area in another soldiers sparred with wooden swords in still another archers shot at distant targets men and women filed in and out of the buildings a line of wagons pulled in and people began to unload them passing the crates into the gaping mouth of an enormous storehouse for the second time in recent days the sigil of the league blazed out at him this time burned into the slanting roof of the warehouse the leaguemen it seemed wanted even the heavens to see their prosperity what is all this this is what the league gets up to in private this is where they train their army the ishtat no no thats on lavren this is sire els little project kartholome propped his foot up on a root and leaned on his thigh continuing to survey the scene below them the league started a breeding program years ago the idea was that they could make quota slaves themselves instead of having to collect them from around the empire the fanged rose let them take over the outer isles to do whatever they wanted sort of compensation for dariel blowing the platforms to bits the last eight years theyve been hard at it but they were breeding even before that ever wondered why the ishtat are so loyal to a bunch of coneheaded freaks the ishtat are loyal because theyre part of the family each and every one of them melio sharratt was fathered by a leagueman and a concubine herself bred for the purpose melios gaze snapped over to him you heard me kartholome said he ran his fingers down his beard and then gave it a tug its quite a regime they have set up i dont know much about itjust what some of the ishtat let slip when drunk and disgruntled with papa seems that all the leaguemen are descended from just a handful of founding members they breed children and select some of them to have their heads bound those become leaguemen others they make ishtat others become workers and all that some get discarded heard about worse things but you dont even want to know the details melio did not want to know the details the logistics the methods of such mass impregnation yet he could not help thinking about it he saw storehouses of beds leaguemen moving from one to another a woman in each babies crying beside them he hated the thought leaguemen raising children like livestock while he and mena had not made their real love into a child he still wanted nothing more than that by the giver if she had only allowed it when they had the chance i see youre thinking about it kartholome said dont like i said the ishtat are raised on another island these guys are a newer thing not the same bloodline sire els army theyre from quota stock born and raised for it if they dont show an aptitude for fighting theyre sent away as regular quota or they used to be sent as quota thats all changed now melio asked so what are they training for good question answer any eventuality to the league it doesnt really matter who wins or loses because they know that either way theyre the real winners if thats all that matters to youif you dont have a sliver of morality in your bodywell its easier to adapt no qualms and questions to wake you at night you know these soldiers may help take over the other lands they may be given something to do in the known world i think it all depends on what happens with the auldek invasion any chance theyre being trained to help protect the empire kartholome turned a withering look on melio i think the league has decided that the empires days are numbered maybe the auldek will finish it if they dont manage it sire els boys will finish whatevers left either way he slid his fingers down his beard again and let the fate he pulled from it loose on the air all three men heard the running feet at the same time geena bounded into view she slid to a halt and wiped her ginger hair back from her forehead before saying we have a problem an ishtat patrol found our boat clytus cursed gets worse they saw me the plan they came up with was simple geena smirked disapprovingly at it but she took up her post without a word using the point of kartholomes fishing knife she made a small cut in the flesh just above her knee she smeared blood up and down her leg and then she sprawled across the path as if she had fallen melio and kartholome hid behind trees off to one side clytus sank down behind a root network on the other draping a few palm fronds over him for good measure its mad to do this melio thought were not at war with the league i could approach them and explain what that the queen had sent him to spy on them would he convince them that he had not seen or would not report what was clearly in view if he named himself he would die just the same as if he did not he had not fully understood it before but he was so pressed up against the leagues private parts that nothing he could say to them would explain it away what the league was doing was deeply wrong witnessing it put him at war with them whether he declared it or not the men arrived at a jog melio heard their feet grinding the coarse sand pressing fronds flat one of them demanded that geena stand and face them she answered that she could not stand she had hurt her ankle twisted it running away from them the soldiers moved again assuring her that she was in for more hurting if she tried anything melio slid one eye out from behind the tree trunk two ishtat soldiers stood near geena they had their swords out another had stopped a little way down the path looking nervous geena clutched at her ankle in pain her face a mask of fear the expression looked absurd to melio she would never quiver that way she would never let her jaw drop like that or lean forward in that manner surely offering a view of her breasts the ishtat did not know her though melio pulled his head back behind the tree the soldiers demanded to know who she was if she was alone how she got here what she was up to geena answered their questions in a pitiful trembling voice that melio could barely recognize he was not sure if she was a terribly good actress or a terribly bad one he guessed it depended on what things one expected to come out of the mouth of a distraught young woman she was sputtering and circuitous and even sounded a little insane piecing together what she was saying was as confounding for melio as it must have been for the soldiers but it gradually took shape she had been on a fishing boat she explained she and her father and brother they were working the channel when a league galley ran them over so stupid of them of her brother she meant stupid stupid to be in the way of the big ships she told him they shouldnt taunt the big ships but he did nice use of the truth melio thought exaggerated adjusted but with a twisted kernel of fact in it she had them listening which was strange in itself ishtat did not usually let people talk much they should have pinned her to the ground beneath a savage knee and fanned out in the woods ask questions later but they didnt these soldiers werent the sharpest melio was so stupid geena wailed i hate him im glad he fell in melio glanced at kartholome hoping to share a wry smile at the use of his name the pilot did not seem to be listening he stood with his back plastered against a palm trunk one of his arms was a flat paddle at his side his other had unbuttoned his shirt and was fumbling on his abdomen as if he already feared an injury his gaze fixed on something in the distance and his lips silently mouthed something he had gone gaping as hephrona boy melio had trained withused to say of younger boys who showed their fear melio cursed himself for getting so far into danger with nothing but a dagger on him and without even men he knew he could trust stupid indeed did he drown the soldier asked melio could feel the mans gaze scanning the palm forest yes geena said he and my father both died they left me they emotion apparently overcame her one guard said something to the other that melio did not catch the one down the trail must not have heard it either he called what are we doing all those tracks on the beach dont forget that melio wanted to smack him or to smack himself on the forehead to his surprise the two nearest geena seemed to buy her explanation that she had been running back and forth when she got to the beach she had been delirious only her alive in the boat for three days drifting on the ocean waves seeing islands but not able to get to them she tried to make the sail work but she had never been good at it and it was broken i couldnt fix it of course you couldnt one of the soldiers said she got here though the farthest soldier pointed out i dont like this just grab her and lets take her back with us let finn decide no no dont let finn decide geena pleaded hell decide wrong what does finn have to do with it he didnt find me you did her voice changed slightlygrew less pleading and more certainwhen she repeated you did am i hearing this melio glanced at kartholome again but he hadnt moved ill do anything lets do anything you want lets do that first can we after a pause one of the soldiers said anything we want so much lechery in three words so much pleasure at anothers distress so little true sympathy when he said lets take a look at that lovely leg then its a nice leg i think well all like it im getting finn the far soldier said im not going to answer for this later and there it was melio had not come up with a plan as he stood behind a tree but plan or not he had to act he came from around the tree just as one of the soldiers slid his sword into its sheath and knelt near geena melio had walked forward several steps before they noticed him it was the farthest soldier who called hey theres one i told you stop sta he cut off his cries when clytus rose in a shower of palm fronds the soldier turned and ran clytus in pursuit the soldiers by geena reached to draw their swords the one closest to her should have used the moment to back away from her he did not though and because of this oversight he was perfectly positioned to receive the full force of a kick from her lovely muscular leg he doubled over clutching his groin geena snapped another kick into his face grabbed him around the neck and yanked him down that was all melio saw of them melio neared the third soldier himself though he walked with confidence and military precision he had no idea how he was going to get past that ishtat sword the dagger held out to his side had never seemed smaller like a wasps stinger the confident way the soldier moved his weapon into ready position showed that he felt the same about it his sword had a gentle curve to it similar to a marah sword it was thinner but melio knew the steel of it was unusually heavy in all likelihood im about to lose limbs he thought all these years ive kept my limbs for this for this he thought that as he closed the distance he thought it as he saw the soldier draw the blade back tense through his arms and shoulders and torso and legs thought it as the man began the step that would initiate the swinging arc the blade would cut in the face of that he knew that what his body begana spin during which he would drop low and try to kick the mans forward legwould not work he knew he would never get to use his dagger but he held the weapon white fisted and wanted nothing more than to carve it through this strangers abdomen with a fury that came upon him sudden and raw and filled with longing for the woman he was about to lose though he cried her name in his head and saw her as she had been that first day on the docks in vumulean and bare breasted suntanned and salt caked a priestess of maebenhe knew their story was over he knew she had never really been his knew it and hated it what happened next took only an instant as he began his spinning kick something small zipped over his shoulder he heard it whirring in the air though it shot straight and fast as an arrow he carried through with his kick turning his back on the swordsman as he did so in the blur when he faced away from him he saw a shape moving toward them and then he was around his tensed foot impacted the mans weighted leg with all the force he could have wished he felt one of the lower leg bones break instantly his eyes flicked up the soldiers face was fixed in an absurd expression his mouth loose cheeks flaccid eyes crossed and staring at the jagged crescent of metal protruding from his forehead melio spun with the force of his kick and then used the motion to twirl away from the sword which carried around for a moment before falling from the mans limp hands as he crumpled melio sprang up and stood gaping at the soldier kartholome strode past him he bent over the man and thrust a fish knife into his chest the soldier gasped a slow grotesque elongation of his mouth kartholome put his hands on the protruding metal disk and began tugging it it took some effort to get it free when he had it out he turned holding the bloody sharply pronged disk in front of him it was small enough to rest on the palm of a hand the prongs looked as sharp as knifepoints backs curved treacherously he met melios gaze as a child he said i was good at darts later i got good with these throwing stars with his knife hand he indicated the pouch of the disks strapped around his torso inside his shirt i am not the bravest man but i have good aim melio breathing hard said i believe you he picked up the fallen soldiers sword geena had done the same both of them began to move in the direction clytus had chased the third soldier a few steps on they saw him returning also newly armed with the mans helmet sitting tiny on the crown of his head when he reached them he spat off to the side and then grinned a bloody fatlipped grin whos got a plan then b ait again geena grumbled its somebody elses turn next time she went in the lead as they descended through the crevice to the narrow beach at the cove melio just behind her wore the black tunic stripped from the soldier she had killed helmet tight on his head he carried the ishtat sword unsheathed he smacked geena with the flat of it as they scrabbled through the stones clytus and kartholome followed likewise dressed in stolen garments the whitehulled clipper had been driven right up the beach it dwarfed their battered fishing boat in its shadow all sharp lines and glossy coating masts absurdly tall and wide a rope ladder from the bow descended to the sand three sailors sat or stood a little distance down the beach along with a single figure in ishtat black melio saw one man on the bow and another walking forward from the stern if there were more he could not see them the trick would not survive more than passing scrutiny so melio did what he could to give them a few more seconds hey finn he called infusing his voice with mirth look what we found he shoved geena sending her tumbling out the mouth of the crevasse she landed on the sand crawled forward then ran toward the group of sailors on the beach until she saw them and tried to circle them as if she would dive in the water and swim for it the men rose to the bait they spread out to intercept her trying to hem her in their hands out as if they were herding a chicken only the ishtat soldier finn most likely stood where he was he fixed melio with his gaze a question on his lips and then he noticed clytus and kartholome both of them on the beach now and closing behind melio who are you he snapped his hand shot to his sword hilt and he began to draw stop right melio ran the last few steps sword out at his side he swung cutting off the mans words as his blade sliced through his abdomen clytus and kartholome drew their weapons geena dropped flat on the sand just before kartholomes throwing stars hissed through the air above her one scorched by without hitting anyone the next slammed into one mans chest another hit the base of a seconds neck a third man caught the twirling steel in a warding palm he twisted around with the pain and force of it melio hit him with his shoulder and carved him as he tripped on his own feet clytus arrived screaming like ten men and hacking with brute force the sailors were soft sacks for the hewing kneeling a few moments later hand resting on the hilt of the sword he had sunk into the sand melio panted out the fear and exultation he was not a squeamish killer he had seen too much violence for that luxury nor was he haunted by it afterward as he knew mena was he knew it was necessary he just didnt enjoy it much and most important if he had died here mena would not have known how he died he would not have been able to explain it to her to talk it through to assess what his death meant to her that as much as the actual combat was the possibility he breathed out onto the beach clytus and geena took care of the two men on the boat still another clytus found at the stern trying to climb down into their skiff this one begged for his life and offered his services as pilot clytus seemed willing to consider it but once aboard kartholome would not hear of it he stabbed the man as he had done the first soldier turned his hunched over body around grabbed his legs and hefted him into the sea melio watched this as he hung on the ladder about to climb aboard he would have to study this kartholome closely so far he hadnt figured out what to think of him ill have to study them all closely he thought once they had checked the ship named the slipfin and confirmed there was no one else aboard they gathered at the stern they watched the sea for other vessels as they decided what to do next melio assumed they would take a few supplies and flee in the fishing boat they would sail for home with the news they had gathered perhaps bring kartholome along to be further questioned he had assumed this but not because he had actually thought it through what if we took this ship geena asked she stood on the railing balanced on the balls of her bare feet took it right now and sailed for the other lands we could find dariel you said he might be alive kartholome lets go get him how would we do it clytus asked straight across geena piped this boat is fast kartholome said and id expect some very decent winds on the slopes faster than the ballan clytus admitted fast enough to outrun sea wolves kartholome shrugged could try it i think some league captain has probably done it they do treat their clippers with the skin he slid his hand over the white coating on the railing the same that covered the hull and portions of the deck near the bow melio expelled a breath the others gave him a moment to follow up on it but he just lifted a palm to the sky and motioned vaguely melios right clytus said theres more than one way what about going up and over along the ice he cocked his head lips pursed to warn against hasty judgments might be safer but it could take months longer if we get caught in the ice it might even drift us backward or out to sea could be a slow death thats never been the way i planned to go to the afterdeath straight across geena repeated its faster to our fate no matter what wed need supplies kartholome said theres a whaling outpost north of here he pulled his beard in thought yes on a small island its called bleem the league used it as a landmark between here and the old platforms there should be supplies they outfit ships for long trips might even be men on it looking for work looking for work melio asked you want to gather up a boatful of whalers and head across the gray slopes on queen corinn akarans business a rescue mission searching for a prince the other three shared an expression does he always state the obvious like that kartholome asked clytus clytus did not answer we could use another body to crew this thing help with the watches not to mention some strong arms to throw harpoons and then again to fight if we ever get there we could send a message from bleem you could write one yes melio nodded just an answer not a commitment we send a message to nineas on the ballan and he could send a bird to the queen theyd know what we were up to at least perilous journey to foreign lands geena said she was not quite grinning but there was a mischievous tension twitching her cheeks no guarantee of return death possible in case of success riches beyond imagining it would work for me kartholome said geena grinned me too its making me tingle just thinking of it youre all mad melio said its a crazy idea its sailing off the map who knows what wed be sailing into clytus stood on his toes and scanned the sea a moment we could leave it and try to limp back to tivol in the fishing boat might not make that either though if we leave the clipper itll be found by tomorrow and wed be captured a little after no good options as i see it look melio said i know you all are chancers youd have to be to be brigands you like risk fair enough but think for a minute we sail west and die name the method theres a thousand to choose from if thats what waits for you over there would you still say go tell me truthfully i would geena said aye clytus agreed kartholome shrugged why not riches beyond imagining geena jumped off the railing she stepped close to melio took hold of his arm at the elbow i want to do this because dariel would do it dont you think he would hed do it for you for clytus id like to think hed do it for me lets do it for dariel if we die whats it matter wed die in style she was so close and so attractive in a boyish playful way that he remembered her kiss on the boat after they had both almost drowned tangled together as close as lovers and that reminded him of the pledge he had made to mena if he lived he had sworn he would do anything for her everything for her if he had the chance nothing would stop him that was what he had thought in his last moments of consciousness all right melio said but only because dariel would do the same for us well need harpoons kartholome said lots of them harpoons geena said a whaling outpost has plenty of those come melio sharratt lets get to know our new ship welcome to the order of brigands melio pulled back no no welcome you three to the proper service of the crown call it what you will geena said lets go no use waiting for a patrol to stop by im done being bait chapter nineteen the first day she arrived with baskets of fruit for elyas children corinn stepped through the corridor opening onto elyas terrace to the sight of the redheaded dragon flapping its silken wings maintaining a jolting unsteady hover a few feet above the patterned tiles po she called him he grew inches every day how much of that was natural and how much was accelerated by the givers tongue she had used on them while still in the eggs she could not measure she knew some of it was her doing but the young ones already had traits distinctly their own in hatching in reaching out to touch her in flightin everything so farpo had always been first he would be the first to take a rider also she was sure of it elya stood watching him her eyes wide and her mouth opening and snapping shut as if she were on the verge of shouting encouragement but was too nervous two of the other young ones flanked her these also had namesin corinns mind at least with mena away who else would give them names the brown one with the yellow stripes down her back was thais the skyblue male hopping from foot to foot at the moment was tij the completely black one lounged atop the balcony railing a drape of long sinewy curves she opened an eye and watched corinn kohl corinn called her it took her a while to figure out how she had identified their sexes none of them had any visible genitalia neither did elya for that matter but corinn had no doubt about her guesses they did look a little different the males were more vibrantly colored and thicker in the jaws and neck with crest feathers that bunched behind their heads and erupted out to either side down their necks the two females were more modestly hued a little longer in their limbs and more serpentine their crest feathers flared straight up when they lifted them thin and high the females had the same citrus scent in the oil on their feathers as elya did the touch of it always left corinns fingers tingling the malespo in particularhad a musky burned fragrance when touched their oils did not so much tingle the flesh as heat it still it was not unpleasant just potent in a different way hello beauties corinn called i have fruit for you she stepped forward with a jaunty enthusiasm she would never have let human eyes witness she held the basket out before her as if it contained treasures which is just how the young dragons reacted po froze midflap and fell to the stone tiles thais and tij snapped their heads around recognized her and scrabbled forward going down to all fours and slithercrawling kohl was slower to rise when she jumped from the wall her wings spread out and slowed her descent she landed gracefully retracted her wings and scurried forward to join the others they crowded around corinns legs making it hard for her to walk they dipped and bobbed and circled her they climbed over one another nipping and hissing on occasion tij clawed at her velvet skirt as if he would climb right up her corinn reprimanded him playfully and made a mental note to wear sturdier garb in the future she sank down among them setting the basket of fruit in front of her for a few moments she held herself still the center of a squirming ball of raucous attentionhungry children they fought for her touch they pressed their crowns against her outstretched palms rubbed her legs and back and leaned into her chest corinn knew this could not last she had wanted to make them love her and she had soon she would have to break them out of childhood she would need to harden them for the struggles to come soon she thought soon but not today thinking this corinn looked up at elya who had moved away a little distance to a corner of the terrace she paced several quick circuits of the space before settling her backside against the stone lowering herself with a comically avian motion a bird settling onto a nest only when she was situated did she deign to look back at corinn was that annoyance in the squint of her left eye you dont trust me corinn thought but you dont exactly think im a threat either but i am mother elya i am i want your children for my own she repeated that i want your children for my own she watched for any sign that elya heard her but the creature sat watching nothing in her demeanor changed corinn often tested elya this way she explained her desires in taunting interior language that she held within her head all the time looking for signs that elya could read her thoughts mena believed so but corinn after weeks of uncertainty had concluded that elya could not for all the ways she dilated her pupils or blinked her eyes or bobbed her head it was only the human eyes watching her that construed intelligence in her actions the gifts mena endowed elya with were menas own creations it was a relief really elya would be easier to deal with harshly if necessary they cant be both of ours corinn went on as she stroked the fine feathers along pos neck if they were yours they would eat fruit and be playthings for children they would fly circles above the palace and make people gasp with pleasure no harm in that but those are such small goods if they are mine well then they can be warriors for the empire they can be creatures for the ages new symbols of acacian power dont think me evil elya i want only the best things for my family for the empire and for the people of it thats why i want your children to be my warriors its already begun anyway they started being mine when i sang to them in their eggs ive only to sing to them again to seal them to me to help them grow into the weapons i need them to be corinn stood and looked around feeling as if somebody were watching her she turned a slow circle but saw nobody she caught a scent in the air and recognized it at some level that she was not interested in reaching down to with a few whispered notes of the song a breeze brushed past freshening the air and clearing her mind no need to give in to the illusions her use of the song stirred into the world the fruit consumed and their greeting enthusiasm spent the young dragons moved off one by one to find other distractions kohl unfurled her wings and leaped up onto the terrace wall and stretched them wide absorbing the mild winter sun thais stood on her hind legs head craned studying the nubs that housed her wings she had not as far as corinn knew spread them yet tij lifted his snout half opened as he watched condors circle high above the island only po stayed beside corinn a little longer he rested one arm against corinns thigh and pushed her other handas delicate and expressively fingered as his mothersthrough the peels and the few remaining orbs of fruit you want something more than fruit dont you corinn whispered to him the dragon slid his head toward her mouth open as if awaiting an offering the yellow of his eyes shone with a wavering intensity as if his irises were a thin foil of gold and a fire burned just behind it corinn stroked his crest feathers they rose at her touch soon ill get you something more something to make you grow strong she began to pull her hand away and rise pos head dipped his eyes on corinn and then his serpentine neck snapped up his jaws opened and when the blur of motion ended he had corinns wrist pinched in his mouth he did bite down but his teeth only dimpled her flesh the movement had been so swift that corinn jerked her arm causing the sharp tiny teeth to scratch her skin she and po both froze staring down at him unsure whether to be frightened or angry or amused corinn spoke with a sharpedged calm not me po not me she reached around with her other hand and tugged his upper jaw she slid her wrist free just a few scratches thin white lines like the tracks of kitten claws she pinched pos jaws shut with her fingers and tilted his face toward hers never put those teeth on me never if you do i wont love you with that she snapped her fingers and strode for the corridor just before she stepped into the shadows she glanced toward elya and met eyes already watching her really she thought i have to do something about her w ith that in mind she spent the next several days trying to convince elya to fly north to retrieve mena she stood before the creature and spoke simple directions to her elya puffed through her reptilian nostrils she pulled her eyelids back and then squinted she answered with a variety of bodily motions and quirks quick bouts of preening her gaze often darting away toward one of her children none of it showed any sign she comprehended corinn in the slightest or cared to recalling how mena had explained it corinn formed her directions in her mind and offered them when that did not work she stood on the balcony pointing and waving shooing elya away once she pressed her palm against the gray plumage and shoved this got her a hissed rebuke through it all elya watched her with narrowed skeptical eyes when she did finally decide to leave the event did not seem to have anything to do with corinns orders a morning several days into her efforts corinn found elya waiting for her on the terrace that had become the avian nursery her young huddled close to her for a second corinn thought they looked like children gathered around a storytelling nurserymaid but then she saw the dangerous slant of elyas head she pushed through her children jostling them behind her as she moved on corinn she lowered her head and dropped to all fours she covered the short distance in a burst of speed her shoulder joints pumping her head rose so close to corinn that the air blown from her nostrils stirred the queens hair standing tall she hissed down at corinn her neck feathers jutting out in an instant bristle corinn breathed through her mouth she moved only her fingers which she flexed out of a need to move something to steady herself somehow resolutely submissive she just stood inside however she had a spell dancing ready to be released should elya strike it would rip her apart and leave them all splattered in feathered gore she would do it if she had to she didnt the mock attack was elyas version of a parting discourse perhaps for her youngs benefit as much as a warning to corinn she curled away and returned to her agitated children a few moments spent soothing them touching them each with the soft spot below her jaw and then elya stood back from them they tried to stay with her but she huffed them back her wings unfurled from the knobby protrusions on her back they snapped into place with a rapid clacking sound the flowing motion of it almost liquid until it was complete then the fingerthin bone framework went rigid only the silky membrane hung throughout rippling before the touch of the air elya leaped backward onto the terrace railing she glanced from her young to corinn once again then twisted around and dropped out of sight corinn raced the young dragons to the wall they reached the railing together tij leaped up first kohl scaled it like a lizard thais scurried to a section with flowers carved in the stone she stuck her head through a leaf po released his wings and flew up almost overshooting the wall and having to flap back for a moment elyas widewinged shape soared beneath them she skimmed down toward the lower town wonderfully fast then shot out low across the green waters of the harbor her shadow danced on the waves below her like an aquatic companion then she turned to the north and beat her wings to rise higher her audience stayed transfixed until her shape faded into the northern horizon only then did corinn acknowledge the bubbling excitement inside her her abdomen tingled with it she had her babies all to herself she spoke to them softly at first youll be my greatest warriors kohl nipped the fabric of her sleeve in agreement youll be the weapons your mother wasnt cut out to be tij slammed the crown of his head against her left shoulder you wont be beautiful like her youll be exquisite terrors instead thais brushed against her side you want that dont you to fight for me po chirruped flapping his wings and lifting himself up off the stone of course they did corinn read it in their eyes you were only waiting for it werent you lets begin corinn undid all the venom of the spell she had woven and held loaded against elya she lured her babies down from the railing and began a new song for them she moved through them touching them lifting their chins and meeting their golden eyes she whispered out the words and notes and sounds that lay behind the fabric of the world she felt them slither in the air around her and she let the young dragons hear them too no need to hide the serpentine scaly friction the ribbons of the song sliced through air once the spell she wanted was strong she began to release it into them she stroked them as she sang one after the other as they jostled and vied for her attention each of them vibrated with a sort of pleased purring with each touch she felt the power of the song passing from her into them beneath her fingers and palms she felt the bulging pressure as they changed as they truly became her babies as they grew beneath her touch end of book one chapter twenty mena awoke knowing that something was in her room standing at the foot of her bed her thoughts flew to ghosts to angry spirits to the tunishnevre she was lying on a floor bed that had once belonged to meinish royalty in a room that may have been maeander meins she had gone to sleep thinking of the last time she had seen him as his prisoner on a ship bound for an acacia ruled by hanish mein the knotted irony of it all had slithered around her all day that was why she was sure it was the anger of the meins that stood breathing just beyond her feet she sat up faced it and gasped at what she saw perrin she knew his tall physique even in the partial light she stretched for the lantern in a stand beside the bed and opened the vent to increase the flame yes it was perrin clothed only in his underlayers his hair as ever kicked about in a small chaos atop his head what are you doing something was wrong with him his eyes were open he was awake standing but his face wore the limp flaccidity of sleep he swayed his arms hung straight down at his sides he was asleep on his feet do you think me here to warm your bed mena perrins mouth said the voice was his but not only his what would melio think are you mad mena asked perrin i am true to melio we are i wont tell him of course who you bed is your business sister then she knew the second voice the one that created the words that perrins mouth spoke corinn you cannot avoid me mena you should not try i havent mena said she put a hand to her chest a gesture that looked like modesty but that she made to quiet her heart and rate of breathing i never would you have taken perrins body you are closed to me sister dont you find that strange of all the people in the world to whom i can dreamtravel the two closest to me will not answer my call when i search i can never find you or dariel i could find finelooking perrin though he has brought me to you a pleasing form is he mena could think of no response his was a pleasing form but not like this he might as well have been a reanimated corpse why did you abandon my orders mena stop gaping like that its me corinn talking through this mans mouth now answer me why did you abandon our plan our plan did not include sacrificing the entire army before ever seeing an enemy mena said thats what would have happened you exaggerate no i dont if you had been there you would have seen to wait up there would have been a slow death we would have been weakened by cold and in no shape for when the auldek come i had to make a decision in the field i did military matters are my area corinn if you dont trust me take away my command i trust you but tahalian do you do that to taunt me suddenly feeling uncomfortable sitting up in the bed mena yanked her covers off and folded her legs under her back straight tahalian is the perfect place to settle she said we can train in frigid conditions hike the black mountains work on navigation and communication in the worst of conditions but we can also return to a warm base we can run maneuvers in the calathrock we can learn from men like haleeven who know war in the north better than anyone instead of huddling in frozen hovels struggling to survive well be fit and prepared i was sure that you would agree if you knew all the facts so i acted on that perrins eyes stared at her a moment before answering you have done well corinn said i myself could not have made that choice i could not have set foot in that place its good that you could despite the strangeness of hearing this from perrins lips it warmed mena to hear the vulnerability in her sisters voice you should know something else our brother has returned dariel did the league no not dariel he is still unaccounted for i mean aliver i sang him back to life he is here in the palace even now he played this afternoon with aaden mena you should have seen them mena asked for corinn to say again what she meant corinn did so mena asked her to speak it one more time perrins lips curved into a smile i am not insane sister i worked a spell and brought him back i can do such things you have the blade i have the song i dont understand how can how can something dead and spread as ashes on the wind live again i cant answer that but its true youll see him yourself perrins eyes closed for a long moment and then opened with a start call elya call her to you and fly back on her for the coronation i have already sent her toward you but call her to make sure she comes to you the coronation aliver will be king i will be queen we will rule together come mena be here to share the moment with us summon elya summon corinns words faded perrin sighed his body loosening swaying corinn was gone just like that the force that had animated him vanished mena began to ask if he was all right but stopped as he climbed onto her bed and fell facefirst onto her sheets perrin you cant he grasped her sheets and curled into them coming to rest on his side facing her fast asleep mena watched his sleeping face for a time she lay down next to him close enough to take warmth from his body as she tried to sort through what she had just heard t he mock battle the next day was haleevens idea after three days of steady snowfalla strangely windless storm that allowed the snow to blanket the world around mein tahalian evenlyhe proposed lets stage a battle along the slope of the mountains we did so in the old days even with hanish we trained that way on occasion when mena protested the heavy snow haleeven said that was the point this is the mein princess the old warriors face was a creviced mask he had trimmed his wild beard but it was still bushy and longer than anything seen in the empires warmer climes leather cords wove color into several braids of his thinning grayblond hair mena was not yet used to looking at him at times she marveled that the world could be so varied as to produce these hairy blond fairskinned northerners in one case and the richly dark smoothskinned people of the south on the other with her kind in between like a blending of the worlds extremes this is the mein haleeven repeated and north of here its been known to snow as well not sure what to make of his statementilltempered humor or more kindly jestshe nonetheless agreed haleeven was a hard man to read since their first conversation he had shown little emotion he had revealed nothing more of himself and seemed to regret having ever shown himself a victim of the worlds turning instead he threw himself into work he more than any single person brought mein tahalian back to life again that he did it for her benefit mena doubted but she was grateful for it as they marched out to do mock battle the sun shone blindingly bright the clouds that had pressed down upon them for weeks had vanished revealing a dome of sky impossible to look at they all squinted as they gave and received commands trying to form up on opposing sides of the slope the snow was fluffy and soft a few soldiers scooped it up in their naked fingers and ate it youd do well to keep those fingers covered perrin said he walked at menas elbow it relieved her that he occupied the role as he had before the morning after corinn had used his body to speak through it had taken mena some time to explain how he came to wake in her bed he had no memory of it and mena convinced him that he had simply walked in his sleep she had found him in a daze in the corridor she explained she directed him to the first spot to lie down that she could findher bed she had not been discomforted she just slept on the couch in the adjacent room nothing inappropriate happened nothing they needed to discuss with others such things occurred during the stress of approaching war better he believe that than know the truth including that she lay taking heat from his body for some time before crawling away some things were better kept to oneself gentling as it was on the contours of the land the snow was a misery to walk through the soldiers kicked curses into it struggled to keep their balance they paused after only a few steps breathing hard several lost their boots in the stuff and had to dig around in it with their hands one socked foot exposed to the cold they spent several hours tugging and shoving several catapults and ballistae into place by the time they were ready and the two sides faced each other across a stretch of trodden and slashed snow they were exhausted panting plumes of vapor into the air though they would not have wanted to know she heard them more than one soldier on her side grumbled at the incongruity that his face could be plastered with sweat while vapor froze into ice nuggets in his beard or that his torso could be drenched while his toes had gone beyond cold to numb or that his mouth was parched for liquid while his bladder made him stop to pee every few moments when a soldier noticed her within hearing of such a complaint his face flushed red with embarrassment she let him see the sternness of her face in truth she felt all the same things herself the problem of wanting to pee being chief among them she also noted his candovian accent he did not belong in the frozen north any more than she did not a good start she thought it got no better when the battle began the two sides roused themselves sluggishly at the horns call they slogged forward they tripped and had trouble rising their wooden swords and axes encumbered them as they toppled over one another cursing the two sides did not so much hit each other as collide stumble and fall back swinging their weapons either as an afterthought or in search of balance archers lofted blunted arrows into this melee a pathetic effort the catapults gears got stuffed with snow frozen in place only one managed to lob a weighted ball it flew over the opposing side the ballistae did not shoot at all the padded bolts had been lost somewhere mena trod the sidelines growing more dismayed the longer she watched she was on the verge of calling a halt to the whole exercise haleeven commanded the day but she had seen enough judging by the words she heard the old soldier shouting so had he whats wrong with you haleeven bellowed you look like drunken boys playing in the snow is this the best of acacias army woe to the empire if it is now fight you fools he dodged in among the troops sword in one hand mallet of a fist in the other he smacked soldiers of either side on the head jabbed with his sword knocked them off their feet with his punch he seemed to move on a different surface than the others so loud and such a fury of motion that many stopped to gape at him this is not going well perrin muttered haleeven kept up his harangue the soldiers lowered their weapons stood dejected even those facetoface with the opposing side gave up the fight and watched the old mein dance among them he shouted about the pity of it about how meins used to drink ice instead of tea and pee crystals it never bothered us a little snow he scooped a handful up in his free hand and lofted it at a soldier near him its like sugar to us we flavored our cakes with it go eat cake then a soldier grumbled haleeven stopped dead his head turned back his gaze locking on the offending soldiers he studied him as if he had never seen a creature so bizarre he sheathed his sword and then stooped and drove his gloved hands into the snow you say that to me you soldier tell haleeven mein to eat cake i should stop this mena thought the old man is haleeven roared ran toward the man and then hurled a ball of handpacked snow at him the snowball exploded on his shoulder dusting his face white haleeven shouted something in meinish pointing at the soldier he said did you understand that i told him to eat sugar you hear eathe ducked down again and hurled another clod of snow at a different soldiermeinishand still anothersugar one of the soldiers tossed snow back at haleeven with that chaos erupted a chaos of flying snow shoving kicking insults curses laughter both sides converged with an energy they had not possessed moments before the tense atmosphere shifted replaced by boisterous mirth this will not help us against the auldek mena said the next moment she got pelted across the chest with a snowball who dared haleeven himself he kicked his way through the snow toward her he looked like a madman stopping just before mena unsteady on his feet a moment hair and beard splattered with snow he said i say it will help us princess i say it will next ill teach you to make snow caves warmer than your tents theres so much to teach you and i will do it he bounded off scooping up fresh handfuls of snow and tossing them as he did mena understood it then the mock battle the snow the apparent futility of it yes there was a lesson in all that and she had learned it but also there was a joy in life to be had even in the face of absurd obstacles haleeven mein had chosen to remind them of that perrin said ill still be packing my tents when we march should i call for them to mena did not so much throw the handful of snow at him as spoon it on to his cleanshaven face stunned he lost his balance and pinwheeled backward feet stuck fast in the snow seeing the look first of surprise and then of mirth on his face mena burst into fits of laughter she was still laughing when the shouts reached her the sound had an edge to it different from anything they had done that day casting about she saw soldiers running with real alarm others stared at the sky shading their eyes and pointing the archers fumbled in their supplies they were looking she realized for real arrows a shadow passed over her and she knew just what had alarmed them all she felt the presence rush into her mind so suddenly that it overwhelmed everything else elya spotting her lean wide wingspan through eyes squinted against the glare she shouted no dont shoot at her its elya perrin picked up menas order and spread it when she was sure that the men were calm enough mena sent a welcome up to elya she envisioned her descending to the snowy battlefield landing in a space cleared just in front of mena she saw her wings spread wide and beautiful translucent with the suns light shining through them as she touched down as softly as a songbird landing on a branch though infinitely more magnificent she sent her the message that she could roll tight her wings and rest them from her long journey and she showed her in images that mena would rush to embrace her the moment she could that was exactly what happened met with a collective inhalation of breath from soldiers that had never seen her elya touched down mena buried her face in the creatures soft plumage inhaling the sweet scent of her the citrus smell flooded her with memories of their first days together in talay golden warm days spent walking the windtouched grassy hills just the two of them falling in love with each other you shouldnt be here mena whispered you shouldnt be here in answer elyas breast hummed a soft vibration that felt like nothing else in the world warmth and energy and life and love all captured in the thrum of the whole of her body mena gave herself over to it she tried not to hear perrin say that he had no idea elya was so impressive a creature she pressed her face deeper when edell said that with this mount the princess could own the sky and know exactly what the auldek were doing without them ever being the wiser she tightened her grip when bledas mentioned that the auldek may also have mounted riders and squeezed with her fingers when perrin came back with yes they might but they wont be like elya did you see her wings no mena thought this is not for her war is not for her chapter twentyone i think i have names for the hounds dariel said what birke lay beside him the two of them staring at the stars absurdly bright and numerous above them more colors flowers dariel nudged him with an elbow he held a few of the odd slimy pleeberries in his mouth rolling them around on his tongue he swallowed them and said when i was young my father used to tell us stories there was one about bashar and cashen the two cousins no brothers they were brothers birke made a skeptical noise low in his throat bashar and cashen were cousins bashar could throw lightning bolts and cashen was jealous of it he roared every time bashar showed off he pounded on the earth and grumbled dariel said thats not the way we tell it how does your way start bashar and cashen were two brothers they had a great fight over power that would make more sense i always remembered that story it scared me i didnt want to think of brothers fightingnot with the way i loved my brother anyway later aliver told me that the santoth had explained that tale differently he said bashar and cashen were not brothers they were tribes whole races of people the friction between them was that of a world turning on itself once though they had been close and they could be again thats what aliver told me birke cleared his throat so bashar and cashen brothers or tribes or cousins and now hounds thats what i was thinking better than scarlet and blue or whatever colors you were thinking of naming them dariel reached over and jabbed him in the ribs with a finger the motion brought one pups attention cashen the reddish one scurried between them plopped his butt down and sat waiting for something interesting to happen tell me your tale birke said which version both tell me both ill judge them for myself dariel did so as best he could hearing his fathers voice and taking on the cadence of it he told both stories and did not mind losing sleep that night tomorrow they would reach the sky isle he would finally meet yoen and the elders for some reason he felt he needed to be awake for as long as he could he needed to sort through all the things na gamen had told him d ariel ive been waiting for you the watcher said at first i thought it might be a short wait i thought our sins could not go long without punishment and then later i began to doubt that you would come there was no giver after all why should there be justice there isnt but all things do come to pass just never in the ways that we imagine yes dariel thought they sat side by side in a dark rectangular room now the wall in front of them was blank the floor bare smooth stone a river of air rushed from one side of the room to the other had dariel to name the purpose of the room he would have failed had they needed to speak words they would have had to yell because they spoke directly to each others minds they conversed despite the roar of the air and the flapping of their garments na gamen sat as if he did not notice it all dariel did the same and it was almost true i want you to know how i came to be here why i waited for you look a magnificent palace appeared on the wall before them dariel saw it from high above dizzying as if he were somehow a bird on the wing it lay like a lace scarf draped in serpentine curves across the high reaches of one of the barrier islands so it looked from a distance closer it was a flowing molten structure similar to the sky mount only sumptuous and alive in a way the mount was not gardens of trees sculpted by the wind into fantastic eerie shapes fishponds and waterfalls and dining terraces cut into improbable promontories with views of the sea and the other barrier isles many with similar estates see this this was my home for several hundred years i adored it i built it from nothing first by my own labor soon by the labor of others i made something of a rock that had never known human habitation i was proud and i was angry i hated tinhadin as fiercely as any among us i jumped at the opportunity to punish his people for many years it was i who sorted the spirits that eat death do you know what that means no i chose which children would go into the soul catcher not all souls are strong enough for it some have a greater force within them than others i learned to sense it that became my work i decided which children would give their lives in labor and which would give their lives through the gift of the soul energy i was good at this work and i did horrible things because of it the things he did dariel saw and felt though for a time he did not hear the watchers voice in his head it was not just that the children were scared seven and eightyearolds who had been stolen from their homes and families and taken across a vast ocean to a foreign land it was not just that he sorted through them and decided which ones would receive a fate worse than death wasnt being fed to the soul catcher worse than death they lost their bodies their identity they became the life fuel of strangers they died yet were reborn more completely as slaves to others than any that labored in the thread fields or as builders or farmers or served as fodder for military slaughter not just the fact that he was responsible for this he went further for a time he chose the children he would reserve for himself not all lothan aklun took souls into themselves but he did in his youth this was because he hungered for years and years of life in which to punish tinhadins people he did not care that one who accepts a soul inside himself loses the ability to father children that did not matter not when he could go on forever he set his hands on the shoulders of child after child he smiled in their faces and looked through their eyes and into them if he truly liked what he saw he had only to nod or gesture with his fingers and the child was his there is more with the passing of decades he aged physically no but still he aged inside his body stayed young but as he passed the normal span of a long mortal life he began to forget his own childhood the lack of it became a yawning chasm chasing him his work grew harder he felt different when he set his hands on childrens shoulders and looked into them more and more often his gaze lingered on their faces on the small curves of their muscles and the lines of their collarbones more and more he found a beauty in their small growing life one day performing his duties as selector he met a boy perhaps it would have happened with another boy or a girl the next day or the week after or in a years time it would have happened at some point he now believed but fate had it that it was this boy ebrahem a halaly boy from one of the tiny villages along the western coast of talay the boy gazed up at na gamens face with timorous hungry desperate hope he had seen this expression a thousand times all the boys hopes were there on his face all his dreams written in the lines of his lips and the bushy flares of his eyebrows and in the uneven circlets of his nostrils all the things he had left behind all that would not be for himthe loved ones lost the home he would never see again na gamen knew all these were there things that he had always thought small just punishments childish things that he recognized because in them he recognized himself he had always understood them and understanding he had found the strength to be cruel but this time written there was nothing features like he had seen before and yet this time he saw nothing but the boy himself l ater that night after telling both his stories dariel could not find sleep birke lay flat on his back snoring bashar sat beside him studying the night cashen walked the patrol he had set up from their boulder down to the hollow where the others were and back again nothing but the boy himself dariel thought he remembered the boys face as if he had seen it with his own eyes that face began to change na gamen from what he was into what he became dariel wondered if val had seen the same thing on the night he found dariel shivering and hopeless in a mountain shack in senival he had never considered the changes he created in his adopted fathers life he had shied away from thoughts of himself perhaps he had changed val maybe that was what he was telling him when he stayed behind to set the platforms ablaze ive never forgiven you for that he whispered for what aniras voice startled him she had walked up behind cashen and stood with her face shadowed her body in silhouette was muscularly feminine strong as a mans but contoured like the woman she was you like seeking me out in the night yes i do i hope youre more vigilant when youre on watch sorry my mind is elsewhere elsewhere can be a good place to be she said after studying him for a moment she added or not sometimes its better to be right here are you worried about tomorrow should i be i used to be afraid of yoen when i was a child when i grew up i learned to love him hes gentle wise deliberate hell see through you if you lie to him so dont do that i hadnt planned on it then youve nothing to fear now tonight come swim with me theres a pool just down the ravine a little its too cold dariel said we can warm each other come she stretched a hand toward him c hildren are how we return to youth na gamen had said there is no other way a span of years does not make one immortal children do that was why he selected that boy whose face told him nothing he did not take the boy to the soul catcher it took him some time to understand what was happening to him but he knew it was not the boys soul he wanted he did not want to steal his life instead he watched him the boy lived in his fabulous palace na gamen let him explore it fed him had him cared for he watched as the child lost his timidity and began to play he marveled at the sound of his laughter at the way he made stories in his head he brought another boy to him and then a girl there in secret i became the father that i couldnt be i raised child after child for years upon years i thought nothing of it it was simply my way a kindness i did to my slaves treating them as my children thats how i thought of it in truth it was more than that i had forgotten my own childhood do you understand i had forgotten part of what it means to be human without them i would have lost my humanity entirely na gamen told of how much he loved to have them near the vibrancy within them the innocence the capacity to heal and thrive no matter what the world threw at them he gave those children the happiest lives he could he gave to themfor increasingly it felt like he owed them and the other quota children a great debtbut they also gave to him he watched them grow into men and women over and over again and then grow old and die in all of it he learned and relearned the natural order of life they made me human again na gamen said after all the wrongs i did to them they made me human again why did you walk away from that dariel asked how did you end up here the watchers ears flexed and rippled in the air currents it took him some time to find the words to go on with eventually his voice resumed inside dariels head i had a network of swimming pools on the upper level of my palace i didnt swim in them myself hadnt for hundreds of years but the children did one day i was lounging near the pools at a short distance there was a barrier he divided the air in front of his face with the edge of his hand squinting one eye closed i could see the edge of the pool but not the area just next to it two boys i remember their names but ill hold them inside me if you dont mind two boys would both run to the edge as if to jump in but pull back at the last minute i would just see them appear sprinting suddenly at the edge in motion and then skidding arms wheeling around to stop them one would tease the other plead to jump the next time again and again they did this i wanted to call out to them to stop it they might slip and crack their heads the words were in my throat but i couldnt speak they were so joyfuland i so afraidthat i couldnt speak for a moment na gamens face was warm with the memory then the expression faded and that was it what do you mean what was it watching them i realized for the first time that i would die so that either of them could live thats what i thought i would trade my life for either of theirs in an instant and if that were so what sense did it make for me to steal the lives of other children what a crime it all came to me at once not understanding our crimes i had always done that but the knowing that was new the horrible knowing it was love dariel i loved those children i had loved all of them from ebrahem onward i loved them as if they were part of me knowing that i could no longer sort souls i feared what became of the stolen souls once they died would they know peace would they understand who they were or would they be trapped in between i knew the answers and i hated them images poured into dariels mind again he watched na gamen speaking before an audience of the lothan aklun they watched him with faces of sublime indifference as he implored them to stop the trade he asked them to search in their hearts they knew how wrong it was they knew that the punishment of tinhadin was hurting innocents and also making them into greater villains than the one they hated he railed at them but he could not change their course he could not stop them their hatred was too deep if they had looked into so many childrens soulsas he hadthey might have understood but they had not they did not wish to listen nor could he fight them they were his brethren he loved them more so perhaps because of the sadness of their error i did not sort souls after that instead i learned to shepherd them he traveled to rath batatt with the quota slaves he had learned to call his family he chose the peak atop which to build the sky mount and he set to work he used the song trapped in simple tools to work the stone he made it malleable and shaped it to suit him there he lived through the lives of those mortal children doing the best he could to give them joyous childhoods meaningful lives ease in the elder years and painless deaths to true release one by one he shepherded them through lives worthy of them and then let them go i have not done enough i took apart an evil castle built of stone one small block at a time much of it remains and ever will i did what i could though now i hope you will as well dariel seeing what i have done can you forgive me do you forgive me of course dariel said na gamen closed his eyes for a time opened them thank you forgiveness is a circle dariel a band that joins us thank you if you will accept it from me i will give you a blessing its the last thing i have to offer you will you accept of course t he pool was beautiful boulders hemmed it in on all sides with a large shelf of rock blocking most of the downstream end it was deep enough to dive into lit from below by some of the rockswhich glowed the same pale green as the stones of amratseer is this safe dariel asked its not the sheeven lek if thats what you mean anira said dont just stand gaping off with your clothes a few moments later naked herself anira dove her body speared the glassy water sending the clear image of the riverbed stones into sudden confusion she kicked toward the depths at the bottom she turned and stared up at dariel as if taunting him he finished stepping out of his trousers and jumped the shock of the cold water froze the air he had just pulled into his lungs he had planned to slice toward the bottom gracefully but instead his arms and legs set hooks in the water he pivoted toward the surface and broke into the air gasping had it been possible he would have clawed his way right out of the water instead he paddled in circles looking for a place to get ashore teeth chattering anira rose from underneath him she ran her hand up his abdomen her body sliding up after it her breasts slipped over his chest surfacing with her face inches from his she parted her lips dariel thought she was going to kiss him she seemed close to it but instead she exhaled her longheld breath her legs kicked rhythmically to keep her up close enough that he felt her thigh brush his no accident for she did not draw away dariel i want you to dance with me she said the green liquid shifting light was lovely on her skin droplets of water slicked the scaled plates beneath her eyes and over the bridge of her nose they highlighted her eyes i need you to do you know what i mean by dance it would have been hard not to know considering the way her hands caressed his torso they were so warm as were her legs smooth against his he felt himself stiffening despite the chill water it wouldnt be right he said i have someone back on acacia i would be surprised if you didnt have someone can i take the love you feel for her from you the image of wren that popped into his head was an unlikely one he saw her as she had been the night they blew up sire fens warship just after they dropped the pill that ignited fires inside it she had climbed over the tall ships railing and leaped into the air he remembered the way her hair rose waving at him he remembered exactly what her face had looked like and how much he had wanted her no he said you cant take my feelings for her from me good i dont want to are you sure that you will live to see her again you know the answer to that i hope you do see her again if you do its up to you to tell her of the evening you spent making love to a blackskinned snake woman or not anira smiled her teeth shone wonderfully white in the moonlight like little jewels they looked so smooth and clean and cheerful you are part of my destiny dariel akaran making love with you is part of that anyway you made your decision when you took my hand to come down here can we stop talking now he felt her hand take hold of his sex that did it he could well imagine that wren would box him bare knuckled when she found out but what anira said was true he had already consented being with her already felt necessary in a way he could not explain he pulled her closer he touched the tip of his tongue to the enamel of her teeth it was as he had thought they were smooth and clean and cheerful when her lips pressed full against his he responded with more hunger than he knew he had felt chapter twentytwo delivegu folded himself into the chair he managed to do nothing overtly indecorous and yet he pushed up close to the line with every gesture the manner in which he leaned back against the plush backrest the way his fingers brushed the open collar of his white shirt the cast of his long legs parted just enough to invite eyes toward his virility corinn watched him from the far side of her desk with his trace of a smile and the way he seemed to shift his focus from one eye to the other and back again and the way his lips stayed parted moistened by his tongue before he spoke delivegu acted as if there were no space between them at all they might have been plastered together after lovemaking such was the sensual excess that dripped from him like sweat did you do it i saw to it your majesty i timed it to cast no blame upon myself or upon you its done soon youll hear wailing coming all the way from calfa ven corinn let nothing show on her face but inside her heart caught for a moment on the thought of darielwherever he washearing that wailing perhaps he would not hear it perhaps he was dead and gone and would never know what she had done am i such a monster she asked herself that i would kill my brothers lover and his childand then look to my brothers death with relief worse things had been done by her ancestors and for less reason reading through the akaran royal archives had shown her that by comparison to the secret crimes of her ancestors corinns acts were small wrongs done for larger goals who but other monarchs could understand the decisions rulers must make not even aliver had carried such a burden not mena not dariel none but my ancestors could judge me she said delivegu dipped his head it was a small thing your majesty youre right about that corinn thought it had not seemed like a small thing when she gave him the mission but so much had changed the palace hummed now with energy for the coming coronation she had been hosting the flood of dignitaries arriving from all over the empire for several days banquets and dances speeches and parades and performances in the carmelia it was all hastily prepared a good portion of the empire also mustered for war but there was a giddy vibrancy to everything she felt like a child as if she believed again that the world could be as she wished she was not sure that she had truly felt that as a child but she knew a princess was supposed to feel that way now because of her own hard work she did rhrenna appeared in the doorway standing framed within it she reminded corinn that aliver would be along soon to escort her to the meeting corinn watched delivegu appraise the secretary as she turned on her heel and moved out of sight she was lovely in a thinfeatured meinish way under corinns critical eye rhrenna had developed a fine fashion sense wearing clothes that flattered her slim figure corinn wondered if delivegu had slept with her rhrenna was discreet in her romantic life but she had recently admitted to corinn that she could not have children she had never yet gotten pregnant by her own estimation she should have by now if it was possible for her corinn made a mental note to advise her not to be seen with delivegu not if she wanted a chance at being an acacian queen and why shouldnt she become queen rhrenna had been a more faithful servant to her than anybody hers was a disgraced people but allowing such a marriage would be seen as an act of benevolence forgiveness considering that she could not bear children well there would not be that complication to aadens inheritance to deal with it would not be so hard to weave an attraction to her into the binding spells around aliver she decided to begin to do that slowly at a pace that would bloom right around the coronation delivegu found corinns eyes still on him when he swiveled back to her with this behind us what more would you have me do you know i wish to serve you in any manner you require the queen lifted her chin enjoy it while it lasts delivegu bowed as you order all i wish is to fulfill whatever you desire delivegu you musky animal as if its my desires you concern yourself with corinn thought after he departed you will never have me nobody will nobody after me you mean the voice entered corinns ear as if the speakers lips were just beside it at first it was just a voice she recognized it though she could not have mistaken the superior tenor of it so smooth and confident the speaker as pleased with himself as a pampered cat by the giver she knew that voice because i certainly had you body completely soul almost she had heard it in so many variations giving speeches rallying crowds barking orders she had heard it jesting over a banquet table telling tales poking fun at her she had heard it panting her name in passion and had lain entwined as it spoke softly breaths against the nape of her bare neck dont tell me youve forgotten then she felt the physical presence that came with the voice he was there in the corner she did not turn to look directly at him but she saw him at the border of her vision just barely physical so near the edge that with a step he could have slipped back around the corner of her mind out of sight he leaned against the wall watching her with his gray eyes she knew they were gray beautiful and gray more at home in the face that displayed them than any eyes she had ever seen she knew when he swept a hand up over his blond hair combing it with his fingers she did not look for some reason it felt very important that she not look directly at him look at me lover you havent forgotten me how could you when i left you proof a proof that you love more than anything else in the world which in a way means i still possess you corinn thats why youll never take another man no thats not why no he shifted she imagined the curious purse of his thin lips the way he would lift his eyebrows and fix her with all his charismatic attention then why have you never been with another man because none are worthy hanish laughed so after me no other man is worthy of you i have ruined you the pity for the world of men no thats not what i mean she still did not wish to talk but the words came anyway you were not worthy either you were all weak treacherous every man i every man who loved me failed me my father died he said he would protect me instead he died there thats one igguldan oh thats right he died too he spouted love and promises and then went off and died yes who else hanish taunted your brother dont forget him aliver died dariel disappeared you cant hold that against him he may still be alive and you so youve been shaped by the failures of men no you dont understand me none of you shaped me but all of you taught me to trust only myself only myself you most of all taught me that i know hanishs tone changed just two words but they instantly filled with regret with a sincerity it was hard to doubt about me youre right i knew what i was doing was vile i hated it and yet i went forward but corinn dont pretend you dont understand the pressures of leadership didnt you just have your beloved younger brothers lover killed forgive me if i misunderstood the exchange but thats what it sounded like i know why you did it im not sure you had to but i understand that you were protecting our son i cant fault you for that i want him safe too it was so hard not to look at him it took all her control to keep her eyes pinned to a spot on the wall opposite you tried to kill us if you had a chain of undead ancestors demanding blood youd kill for them too besides i didnt know you were pregnant that would have been complicating corinn if i had known i would never have tried to go through with it you know that dont you you must believe me on that if you had only told me id have turned on the tunishnevre instead you and i would still be together still in love no let me prove it no she said again it was hard to make the word and she got no further you know its true look at me im here arent i no youre not well not completely the apparition conceded you almost brought me back it could have been me instead of aliver i was that close you wanted someone to trust someone to help you despite everything corinn it was nearly i you brought back to life think of that the pipers began to play the hour their crisp notes cut short the moment corinn stood i have another meeting she said she felt the figure move as she did he reached for her she quickened her step out into the hallway and then down it toward rhrenna who had risen from her own desk as aliver arrived she did not need to look back to know that the figure that had been hanish mein fell into vapor as she moved away chapter twentythree the summoned group awaited aliver and corinn in the assembly kitchen that the servants used to keep food warm and drinks chilled on banquet nights corinn chose it she had explained because its exterior door opened onto the terrace of first light a semienclosed space near edifuss original hold with the door to it closed none of those milling around in the room likely even knew of it aliver knew little more about what awaited them on the terrace than any of the others but corinn had thought it best that he see her work revealed at the same time as the others the members of the queens council jockeyed for position just inside the room balneaves sharratt greeted her first with baddel beside him talinbeck and general andeson bowed their heads and sigh saden received them with a thin smile meant to demonstrate the patience he was showing for her benefit no doubt they all wanted to know why she had gathered them the two akarans acknowledged the other senators and nobles in attendance they kept their exchanges clipped until they reached the cluster of men standing with jason aliver had met them for the first time only a couple of nights before ilabo a slim bethuni man wearing the long intricately stitched robe of his people and a candovian called dram who looked more meinish with his pale skin and high cheekbones and gray eyes than he did like the sloeeyed people he claimed corinn faced the crowd you may have guessed that you were not summoned here just to enjoy my company baddel piped that that was enough of an enticement by itself polite murmurs of assent theres more to it than that aliver said remembering the lines corinn had given him he grinned and lifted his slim glass of wine these two are the best horsemen to be found in the empire or so weve been told is it true neither of them boasted but drams involuntary chin lift could have spoken for both of them dram of candovia is so skilled he rides without reins he talks to his horse through his legs while above he launches arrows with a masters speed and accuracy and we have ilabo of the bethuni aliver released the imaginary bow he had used to demonstrate drams prowess he set a hand on the young mans shoulder im sure everyone here knows that the bethuni have kept up a horseback riding tradition that faded in most of talay ilabo has since his early teens been his nations champion at the games those games mind you can be deadly having named them both aliver stood smiling corinn brushed past a servant offering her a drink from a silver tray heavy with wineglasses she asked the two men do you know why youre here to ride dram said youre correct corinn said you will ride im offering a way for you to carve a place in history for yourselves i want for you to be the arms and legs and wings of the empire as aliver is the heart and i the head do you wish to know what im inviting you to ride she walked briskly out the door a servant opened it just in time the others followed looking at one another and then squinting as they emerged into the bright afternoon light they came through singly or in pairs so it took some time for the entire party to emerge especially as some paused in the doorway stunned by what they saw they had to be pushed forward by the weight of curiosity behind them aliver felt it as much as any of them there they stood elyas children preening within the high walls that hemmed in most of the terrace the young were not as they had been only days ago all four of them lifted heads bigger than river crocodiles with snouts as long as those reptiles frightening in their length their eyes were each the size of a mans fist pos golden orbs studied the group with cold indifference what had once been softfeathered plumage now looked more like spiny plates they still held the shape of feathers but when tijs crests flared they rose like blue sword blades thais stretched her head up high and chirruped a greeting to corinn it was no longer the high light sound it had been now it thrummed out with bass notes that aliver felt as vibrations tossed through the air he nearly rushed forward to pull his sister away and shout the beasts back but he knew that corinn would not want that his mouth only opened enough to inhale his legs only moved forward a few steps behold my winged children corinn said she descended the stone stairway that brought her down to their level mine not elyas not menas these children belong to me and to the empire mena may have been the first to ride a flying mount but these are not feathered lizards as you can see she reached tij the dragon lowered her head toward corinn causing gasps from watchers po growled in response his crest plumes spread corinn rubbed tij under her snout they are war mounts fit for the bravest men the empire has to offer they will be your mounts if you are men enough to strap yourselves on them and fly doesnt that sound enticing your majesty dram said they have no wings of course they do corinn said po show them your wings as if knowing that he was to make the most impressive show he could the dragon stretched its neck toward the sky and roared he shook his black scaled torso furiously his shoulders gyrated for a few awful seconds until the protrusions on his back audibly cracked open wings erupted out of either side each section snapped into place with concussions of sound like tree trunks breaking kohl followed pos lead with tij and thais just behind her in jolting sinuous waves of motion each dragon bellowed wings into existence where there had been nothing moments before mighty frameworks of bone suddenly blocked out the sky they hung glistening moist from their creation with flaps of skin the same various hues as their bristly plumage now you may have noticed that there are two of you and four mounts corinn shouted above the dragon cries and the peoples gasps and confused babbling two of these mountstij and thaisare for you the other two are for aliver and me so that we may join mena in the skies perhaps one day dariel will fly with us as well i pray that will be so but now if you are ready to be legends i offer you the reins to ride into them she grasped for the leather cord attached to tijs harness the slim length of hide hung from her fingers swaying waiting for someone to step forward and take it aliver felt tremors ripple across his cheeks the precursors to an expression that could not manage to form itself he was not sure what the expression would be he could not make up his mind this was wrong for a moment he knew it whatever corinn had done to elyas children was a mistake a crime whatever goodness there had been in themand there had been muchhad been twisted that could not be good just like elenet corinn was creating things that should not be created he knew this with a burning intensity that he almost pushed past his lips into words but when corinn turned to him and smiled and dipped her eyes toward kohl aliver felt his chest swell yes he thought why not fly above the world it seemed a wonderful idea chapter twentyfour midmorning of the day on which he would first see the sky isle dariel dropped behind the others and stood ankledeep in a narrow little brook one of many that flowed toward the sky lake he welcomed the cool touch of it on his feet he was here those were stones beneath his feet the water brought an icy chill cleansing bashar and cashen both crashed through the underbrush nearby filled with exuberant energy he was here and in just a few minutes he would see the man he had come all this way to meet would their interaction be as profound as the days he spent with na gamen that hardly seemed possible dariel anira came toward him are you ready you can see it over the next rise the others are waiting come the sky isle awaits take my hand she stretched out her hand he grasped it without a second thought content to feel the strength and gentleness of her grip here was another thing they had not spoken of their intimacy beside the pool but it was there between them he was sure it would happen again and he wanted it to it felt right he did not think too often of wren as he feared he might he promised himself he would later but really he felt no shame in what he had done with anira that had to mean something they joined the others on the grassy slope of a hill that tumbled down toward a horizonwide lake they all watched as he and anira approached they must know dariel thought he could not tell if it mattered by birkes smile and tams indifferent expression and mors impatience he surmised that it did not something about this disappointed him mor at least should have shown some emotion jealousy was too much to hope for he would have settled for derision it would only have been fair considering the effort it took for him to turn his thoughts from her and that made no sense either he had done nothing with her never would why did his thoughts about mor feel like betrayal of wren while his actual intimacy with anira did not he would never understand matters of his heart best to stop trying looking at the vista beyond them he said i can see where the name came from the sky isle appeared to hover above the earth its peak was the smooth pointed cone of a volcano partway down its slopes disappeared into a narrow circlet of clouds beneath them ran a hazy band colorless and vague above the sparkling green waters of the lake it looked as if they would be able to sail across the waters and pass beneath the mountain gazing up into the clouds upon which it floated the hike down took an hour as they dropped out of the heights dariel lost sight of the lake they picked up a path and wound through a forest of slim silverskinned trees their bark came away in delicate peels that crunched underfoot the leaves of the trees formed triangular points tiny kites that quivered when the breeze brushed their boughs they had a touch of red mixed with the green dariel could not tell if this was their regular coloring or if it was a sign of the winter season it should be winter but this land gave so little sign of it behind them came a commotion of limbs snapping dariel spun to see the tree crowns near one side of the path behind them swaying and trembling something large pushed through them and stepped out onto the path with a sickening lumbering grace a kwedeir a man stood attached to its back high behind its wolfish head bashar and cashen bristled and growled dariel clawed for the dagger strapped to his leg but before he got it loosened mor had raised an arm in greeting she called something to the rider in auldek and snapped at birke birke squatted between bashar and cashen pulling them to his side and soothing them the mount came forward it walked on its wing limbs all angles and joints flaps of skin like oilblack leather the rider answered and then found dariel with his eyes stared no more was said birke nudged dariel back into motion by handing him cashen to carry he hefted bashar himself the kwedeir and rider followed them the rest of the way dariel would have looked back more if the hounds had not done so for him between them they passed their growling displeasure back and forth a little farther on they passed guards posted on either side of the path before long they had an escort flanking them two older men with short swords sheathed at the thigh a youth who walked with a limp a tall rangy woman with a bow and arrow pinched between the fingers of one hand a group of a dozen old men and women awaited them on the shore behind them a pier crooked out into the lake a barge secured to it motionless on the clear mirrorlike water in the distance the volcanic peak of the sky isle thrust up into view again still growing from an island of cloud the air was moist with the smell of the lake it was strangely saltless its not the sea dariel thought he glanced at mor she looked breathless with relief and joy for a moment her guise of control and detachment fell from her face by following her gaze dariel picked out yoen that was who the look was for the look of a daughter seeing a father yoen stood at the center of the elders a short fraillooking man he favored one leg over the other leaning on a cane of carved wood his hair was disheveled unruly like a childs that had been tousled his skin was acacian brown a complexion just like dariels he smiled briefly at mor they stopped in front of the waiting elders for a moment no one spoke dariel remembered the squirming burden in his arms he set cashen down the pup stood unsure of the moments protocol the woman to one side of yoen wore a circlet woven of leaves it looked like it could be dismantled by a light breeze her features had more solidity and her voice was talayan dariel could tell from the timbre of it even though she first spoke auldek mor answered her bowing her head as she did so the two spoke for a moment and then the woman turned toward him are you the one they call dariel akaran she asked speaking acacian i am did you speak with na gamen the watcher of the sky mount yes the man whom dariel already thought of as yoen asked did he tell you to come here yes dariel looked at him realizing that he wore no signs of belonging no tattoo or piercing or any other enhancement what did he tell you of the circle that it could be closed dariel said it can be though the way is hard the man lifted his left arm crooked in an invitation to an embrace i am yoen come to me dariel stepped forward he raised his arms thinking that he would set them lightly on the mans thin shoulders so as not to harm him he was completely unprepared for what happened next it was not that the old man was fast but just that the action did not make sense until it was completed yoens lowered hand snatched the hilt of dariels dagger he slipped the blade free from the sheath and thrust it upward into dariels gut with a force that should not have been possible from such a fraillooking arm the impact doubled dariel over on top of yoen the pain did not stop it stayed the moment of impact sustained and unrelenting it was so great that the burning sensation on his forehead barely registered when yoen pulled back dariel looked down at the shaft of the dagger the blade deep in his abdomen i am sorry the old man said this had to be done you had to be killed so that that was all dariel heard before he toppled to the ground chapter twentyfive have a drink brother sire grau said motioning toward the servant entering with a tray of tall thin glasses another servant set down a display of cheese parcels wrapped in edible leaves a third hovered nearby an intricate mist pipe in his hands or a pipe if you wish it no thank you dagon waved the servant away he lowered himself to the floor cushions in graus plush quarters why a man as elderly as grau would choose to sit on the floor baffled dagon but he sighed and patted the pillow beside him as if he liked nothing more than to lie about in the middle of the day you really should have a drink grau said he selected a glass from the tray and handed it to dagon if you insist dagon said i do the older man said his glossed lips smiled though the expression was limited to the mouth his cheeks and eyes and forehead did nothing in support he waved the servant away having not taken anything for himself dagon held his frown hidden deep below the surface of his face he sipped smiled and made an audible indication of pleasure he was certain that grau knew he did not like liqueurs especially pungent ones redolent of fennel as this one was at least he thought he knew perhaps there was nothing sinister in it grau was past his hundredth year he could be forgiven for misplacing specific likes and dislikes of the myriad leaguemen he communed with though the room was deeply shadowed one wall featured a long balcony from his reclined position dagon could see only a featureless swath of sky if he stood on the balcony he knew he would take in one of the grander views of the teeming city of alecia to the right the akaran palace sprouted from a hillock a rambling estate with large gardens it went unused by the royal family to the left he would have seen the white stone estates of the richer nobles with those of agnate families flying their lineages crest just beyond them the green dome of the senate building itself straight out from the balcony the view stretched over the city proper business and trading districts markets residential quarters areas rich and poor all thronging with their own heartbeats dagon had sometimes imagined stripping himself of his league regalia and wandering into the citys alleys and lanes what world would he discover there how different from the existence he had always known and worked so hard to maintain he even wondered on occasion if he might lose himself within the anonymity of the urban vastness and take on a new identity the thought never lasted long with the distinctive cone shape of his head everyone would know him for what he was he was sire dagon of the league why would he ever wish to be anyone else i wanted to discuss a few things with you the senior leagueman said did you find our council meeting as unsatisfactory as i did having no idea just how unsatisfactory grau had found it dagon dipped his head something that was balanced between a nod and a shake better not to offer anything more committing just yet most frustrating grau went on were too spread apart with faleen and lethel in the other lands and half the council on the outer isles seems that some of us believe the center of the world has shifted west no longer alecia its those islands now you and i dagon are on the margins it seems our socalled official council most unsatisfactory hardly a trust of mighty thinkers not enough of us to truly meld didnt you find it so he had very much found it so the emergency council had been called at his urging after witnessing the queens growing power he had needed to meld his mind with his fellow leaguemen in so many ways that was the basis of their success over the generations one of the first things they were taught as children was to blend their minds to take solace in one another to share fears and doubts and ambitions and lusts and everything else that ordinary people had to handle while locked inside the solitude of their skulls as a child dagon had found the melding more soothing than anything else in life the fact that it had always been augmented by copious quantities of highgrade mist helped but there was something comforting about sharing with others that had not happened during this last council they had gathered in the chamber in alecia it was the largest of their council halls rank upon rank of reclining chairs rising from the center it could hold a couple hundred leaguemen but this time only twentysix attended most of these were not even senior enough to sit within the first three circles their thoughts reached dagon muffled by the distance between them never before had he noticed how often others held opposing thoughts on the same issue and never before had he noticed the noise of minds trying to hide the very things they were there to share perhaps it was the particular individuals involved he did not think so though he had never noticed it before precisely because a chamber filled with minds made it easier to hide to join to share to remain a single fish within a shoal of similar fish without the great collective motion and comfort it brought dagon had felt more dissonance than he wished to coming from his brothers they were more separate individuals than he had acknowledged the disquiet of the experience lingered with him as apparently it lingered with grau as you say dagon said there were not enough of us in attendance we grew no clearer on how to proceed its the issues we face as well mustnt forget that let us discuss it now just you and me grau picked up a cheese parcel pinched between the curved talons that were his long painted fingernails when last we met in a proper council it had seemed likely the auldek would inflict great damage on the akarans either side might win both would suffer at this last attempt at a council you expressed doubts about this a few weeks ago i would have said the outcome was a toss of the bones going either way as chance blesses now i fear corinn has made herself a new tinhadin that old bastard grau said the worst of the lot and she is not alone dagon continued aliver is beside her i do not think his mind is entirely his own but if corinn has shaped it he may be worse than the old idealist he had been dagon pressed the sour truth of this between his lips shes powerful raising the dead and making dragons dont forget that she did destroy the numrek at what was that place called in teh the thumb i find it unsettling that there are almost no rumors of discontent among the populace what with barad the lesser singing her praises and the vintage putting a shiny new gleam on the entire world there are no voices fomenting against her none that ive heard of recently at least that vintage was our own fault shrugging dagon said it seemed like a good idea at the time she even gets credit for ending the quota trade as if she had any choice in the matter you think she could defeat the auldek i fear thats a possibility grau seemed to have something else to say on this matter but instead he swallowed it along with a cheese parcel think about our situation without the lothan aklun for us to trade with without an enemy they fear like the auldek how long before the queen aims her ire at us sire el may think his army will be a match for her but do we really want to become just another petty power settling matters with the sword and spear i find that distasteful and far too uncertain our success has never come from martial prowess it never truly will i once thought we could float through any change i am no longer sure of that nor am i we could try to remove corinn weve done such things in the past i myself helped shorten gridulans life that old bastard ive come to feel we must kill her and her brother as well grau made an expression as if he had burped and found the taste unpleasant for the first time since they had begun graus eyes fixed on dagons we are in agreement on that there was something about the directness of graus eyes that unnerved dagon yes he said we are in agreement grau held him pinned to his yellowish eyes for a little longer then relaxed again he puckered his lips and made a kissing sound dagon might have been unnerved yet again had not the pipeholding servant peeled away from the wall in answer he brought the delicate instrument to his master he lit it by snapping the flame strips glued to his thumb and forefinger it took him several tries to get the resulting tiny burst of flame to catch the threads in the bowl once they did the young man darted away he returned a moment later and lit a second pipe for dagon who did not refuse this time grau held the tubing of the mouthpiece and smelled the pungent scent a moment the threads were potent pure as the rich aroma of them attested to dagon i wish to send you back to acacia with a charge one outside the unsatisfactory proceedings of the last council council speaker sire faleen should be here but he isnt sire el should be here but he isnt many others should be here but they arent it falls to us to take action when the council cannot are you prepared to do that before dagon could answer grau added soon i will step down from all council matters i am ready for rapture of course you are dagon thought it made perfect sense and it perplexed him that he had not anticipated it grau was old his body no longer took the physical pleasure in living that it once had why wouldnt he be ready to join his predecessors in perpetual bliss that was what awaited every leagueman who lived long enoughand who earned enough for the league over that long life rapture it was the tunishnevre in reverse instead of undead ageless suffering rapture offered continuous life unending bliss through a process that drained ones body of blood replacing it very gradually with the purest distillation of mist it was a process that took the better part of a long life to prepare and then several years of slow transition dagon had been tithing toward his own rapture for decades but it was still a faraway goal such a gift was incredibly expensive grau must have finally paid his dues you have served many years dagon said realizing he had not responded yet when i am gone i would like to believe sire faleen wont hold the reins of power he may be council speaker but id be remiss if i left it up to him to appoint his successor i want a bold man in the position one who will keep the league powerful forever what use is going to rapture if it all comes crashing down in a few years dagon nodded i see several prospects for this role im sure you know those i mean of course he did boldor at least ambitiousleaguemen were as numerous as pimples and as hard to scrub away sire nathos with his vintage sire el creating his ishtat army even the upstart sire lethel had the scent of blood in his nose dagon had damned them all more than once in moments of ill temper but he said there are none like you but many worthy men who aspire to be well there are one or two individuals that i would rather not see ascend lethel if you must know dagon almost spilled his drink had grau justjust spoken ill of another leagueman i am going to take you into my confidence the next council speaker could well be you dagon why not youve served us right from within the wolves den all these years youve done a great deal more than youve received credit for havent you answering that in the affirmative felt like a trap dagon tried his diagonal headshakenod combination again now comes the time when you can truly earn it the old leagueman studied him a moment lips squinched together in a contemplative pucker i have in mind a coronation of death he pointed with his jaw take the pipe ease yourself and we will discuss it chapter twentysix on the morning she was to depart for the coronation mena left elya in the care of gentle handlers and went to say goodbye to her troops she paused in the hallway just outside an open doorway in the calathrock the chamber was still musty damp stained with the mold and decay it would take more than a few weeks to undo the years of neglect but it had been a corpse before now soldiers feet pounded its floor the air clanged with the clash of weapons and shouts of orders and it smelled of men and women training volleys of arrows flew like singleminded birds once a dead ruin of a defeated people now the building lived and breathed she had worked as hard as anyone to bring about the transformation she had lifted new timbers with her own hands pulled on the rustytoothed saw to cut them and leaned her weight to push them up into place shoulder to shoulder with her soldiers she had filled buckets with snow and brought them inside to melt and then scrubbed the floor clean like a servant she had held the safety ropes as climbers scrabbled into the chambers higher reaches shoring up the ancient beams and repairing broken panes of glass and she was among the first on the scene when a blockage in the vents caused an explosion that killed three and steamed the skin half off several more it was hasty work done mostly so the chamber could function once more for its most basic purpose to train an army sheltered from the winter that raged above it this too she did in among her troops she walked the calathrock as perrin shouted the soldiers through drills none of them had fought more recently against the numrek than she so she taught what she knew she lectured as she sparred with the strongest tallest and most skilled of her warriors hoping that things learned from fighting numrek would apply to the auldek as well she was there to correct missteps adjust weapons her eyes on the young men and women pushed them harder than they would have worked otherwise she knew she had this effect on them she used it not for herself but so they would become stronger faster more skillful than they thought themselves capable of perhaps one or two of them would learn just the extra bit he or she would need to survive the auldek much has changed hasnt it perrins shoulder brushed hers as he came to stand beside her just a few weeks but youd barely recognize the place its you who did that they did it mena corrected one person can do little only together i know only together is great work accomplished but i dont know where wed be without you you mena kept us marching and working and training ive never known anyone more suited to lead others youre she glanced at him the easy confidence on his face fell away he went suddenly shy as if the touch of her eyes was a rebuke i was going to say that youre an inspiration but that doesnt sound like something a soldier should say to the princess he serves no it doesnt i should probably quit while im ahead i think so captain looking back into the calathrock mena smiled despite the interest she had always seen in perrins eyes she thought melio would like him id love to see them spar together melio would win but this young man would give him a good contest she stepped through the portal and into the massive chamber a visiting dignitary or senator from alecia would not have recognized her dressed as she was in simple garments meant for function mobility and warmth her soldiers recognized her they were what mattered their survival in the face of the coming onslaught mattered that was the main thing she hated about commandthat the one thing she wanted to spare them from was the exact thing she was sending them toward aliver had warned her that leadership was like this she rejoiced when new arrivals swelled their numbers knowing at the same time that many of them would likely die a unit of new troops arrived from candovia as well as a team of laborers and young recruits from the eilavan woodlands the former had acted on corinns orders the latter on their own initiative barely enough to make up for those taken by the hazards of trekking and working in a meinish winter as yet they did not fill even half the chamber but it heartened them all to know that some were willing to join their cause the trickle of arriving meins had especially lifted menas spirits and had done wonders for haleevens she could see as much when she passed where haleeven was talking with several of his clansmen the meinish men wore rags their hair hung in matted golden knots that were somehow attractive on them despite the bits and pieces of debris that clung to them they were fresh faced and sharp featured and each of them was sprinkled with peeling curls of pink skin on his or her nose and cheeks it still amazed mena that they had answered haleevens call they had appeared out of the frigid nothingness surrounding mein tahalian as if they had been camped just over the horizon she stopped among them long enough to learn their names and to welcome them just the previous morning they had rolled out wagons meant to imitate the wheeled structures the numrek had arrived with too bad i wont be here to see you get squashed by these things she said patting a young woman on the back she wanted to work through the problems posed by antoks and to see the other beasts the auldek might arrive with and form strategies against them im sorry to miss you all fighting that as well she pointed to where someone had mounted the head of a woolly rhinoceros on a wheelbarrow the efficacy of training against such a comical imitation was questionable at best she welcomed the laughter it was already invoking though ill miss the lot of you gandrels booming voice called for quiet in the chamber you began this campaign with me a few months ago mena began most of you did not know me i did not know you we know one another now we were called upon by the nation as the first line of defense against invaders none of us have even seen my sister queen corinn asked for bravery you arrived wearing it on your chests didnt you apparently so judging by the shouts of affirmation i thank the giver for it every day i cannot tell you how proud i am of the army weve become i know none of you would have expected to be training here in mein tahalian but i thank you for accepting the task of rebuilding this ancient chamber with me our time grows near i wont keep you from your training but a minute i know you want to get to it she grinned at the groans they responded with her eyes touched on perrin who was watching her with undisguised admiration all right so she did have a way with her troops she wondered if he understood how much they all gave her how much she needed them to need her her soldiers a different sort of family from the one she was about to fly to but one she loved just as much i leave you only briefly ill fly on my dragon youve heard of her right the great dragon elya i fly on her to be at the coronation of aliver reborn you see my sister raises the dead she slays numrek with the words out of her mouth you think im scary with a bladeyou should hear her sing a great noise greeted this mock horror and praise mixed together when i return well march north and defend our nation when i return i will hold out my hand for you all to touch i will bring a blessing from aliver reborn to you walking through the crowd as she exited nodding and shaking hands and continuing her flow of humorous remarks mena wondered why she was so capable of appearing certain about things that she was not at all certain about she had just stepped into the hallway when the man threw open the reinforced doors at the end of it princess mena come please a scav come from tavirith something has happened the jog back to tahalian was short and brisk but it exposed her enough that winters fury ripped and snarled at her for a few ferocious moments it always did that but this time it felt much more sentient intentional personal it poured out of the gap in the mountains that led toward tavirith with a physical violence made no less by the fact that it was only air and tiny ice crystals she had no idea what message awaited her but it already felt like a punishment for the certainty she had feigned before her soldiers in an anteroom just inside the inner doors of the fortress mena found edell her military secretary standing beside a seated man she recognized the scav as soon as his blue eyes lifted and met hers kant the same man who had shown them the route the numrek had taken since gandrel had to be fetched to translate she stood looking at the man unable to communicate with him for several minutes more get it from him mena said as soon as gandrel and perrin stepped inside flushed from the rabid cold for a few moments the two men talked the guttural confusion that was the scav tongue and then gandrel stopped the man midsentence he touched the scar on his nose as if it were a talisman against what he was about to say a massacre in tavirith the rest came out in the maddening stutter stop of translation kants words were unhurried he stared at one object after another as if talking to the chair and the wall and the door not the people in the room he had returned to tavirith to winter he said he did not usually do so but with the bounty mena had paid him for his earlier information he had much to trade and gamble he arrived to find the place sacked houses had been smashed and gutted ash blackened the snow frozen bodies littered the ground hacked defiled bodies limbs chopped off a few had lost their heads some had been half eaten he says it was not animals that did it not all of it at least flesh was cut away by knives do the scav make war this way mena asked gandrel passed her question on the look kant turned toward her was so full of derision she felt suddenly ashamed no scav would do this it was the auldek thats madness perrin said how could they its too soon they couldnt have marched this far already by his own testimony they couldnt edell asked is he after more booty we gave him too much before now he thinks well pay for any fool story this got no translation but the scav must have read his tone he says if you dont wish to believe him you dont have to gandrel translated he saw what he saw and he heard what the dead had to say with his own eyes he saw there were no tracks of marchers a small party perhaps a dozen of the invaders touched down a little distance from the village and walked toward it no tracks brought them to that point they just dropped from the sky they flew flew atop beasts with large footprints like a mans print but massive this is foolishness edell said how much does he want to go away ill pay him myself the marah captain bledas and the senivalian perceven had just arrived but they paused inside the door haleeven shouldered between them he spoke to the scav haleeven is greeting him with respect gandrel narrated they seem to know each other kants telling him what he has told us now kant says that he did not come for himself he did not come for the acacians he came for the dead they want vengeance they howl for it gandrel paused a moment before finishing there is another thing we should know he says the invaders have made the turn inland the bulk of the main force that is he saw this no but his ancestors did gandrel said he speaks to their ghosts remember he smirked but the expression quickly faded the auldek are making good time he says they move despite the weather day and night slowly and steadily that means fast in the north and that was over irregular terrain perrin said they may be able to move faster when they reach the ice fields gandrel said something to kant heard his answer and nodded he thinks the invaders will be out of the ice fields before the spring edell began but do we believe him what proof he needs none haleeven said i know this man i know his people they saw the numrek come through back when you knew nothing of them we did the scav did he had relatives in the town of vedus the first to be slaughtered and left flaming with that vile pitch the numrek brought with them if he says this about tavirith its true about the war columnits true how do we know that edell asked it was you who invited the numrek down in the first place you lit the torch on the pitch that burned vedus haleeven looked at the young soldier secretary with a measure of the disdain kant had shown earlier we never meant for that to happen i have reckoned with kant on the past already thats between us do you doubt my word when your word is based on stories of ghosts yes id say so the dead dont lie and they dont speak without having something to say thats a trait of the living edells mouth twisted into a snarl but his voice kept an official precision the acacian military cannot move on the word of a scav who claims hes been talking to the dead you may have sucked from the same mothers teat as this scav but i didnt i think we need confirmation before we do anything mena cut in before haleeven could respond peace haleeven peace edell i want no arguing between you especially not now perrin said mena leaves this afternoon lets give her no cause to doubt our leadership when shes gone will you still go bledas asked this changes everything it doesnt change anything perrin said well be here doing the things mena would want us to well start for the ice fields earlier if the enemy can travel in winter well find a way to travel in winter too no matter what well still meet them on the fields and defeat them edell touched his temple wincing he was prone to headaches we should send a party to tavirith to check the scavs story in these conditions haleeven asked swinging an arm as if asking them to take in the view the howling wind from tavirith is well known to my people it may not stop for weeks marching into it would eat men alive you both speak wisdom mena said we should step away from this regroup in a moment lets go to the conference room its warmer there and there are the old meinish maps to consult well plan while we can bledas pushed his unanswered question your highness the royal coronationwill you leave to attend it the room hushed as mena considered her answer yes ill go i meant what i saidi have faith in you all well plan what we can before i fly but i will fly she looked at kant who sat motionless a bland look on his face as if he had already forgotten the confusion he had just brought with him haleeven stay with us a moment translate for me i would speak with kant about some things just the three of us w ith the scavs promises still in her ears a few hours later mena climbed atop elya her head cleared as they rose into the frigid angry skies mena leaned into elya her cheek on the scented feathers breathing them in she smelled and felt so good that mena almost could not ask of her the thing she had decided to ask what part did elya own in all this anyway none of it perhaps in a perfect world she would be home with her babies raising them but this was not a perfect world mena was not perfection herself so she had to rely on someone fair or not it was to be her winged companion they slid down along the eastern edge of the black mountains the raging torrent of air funneled through the pass from tavirith shoved them forward they could not have fought it if they tried mena let elya ride it instead over scatevith and the woodlands rimming the sinks they scattered herds of woolly oxen beneath them from there they traced the meandering line that was the frozen river ask ironic mena knew that she was flying the same route hanish mein had attacked by first on sleds and then on boats she wondered what the landscape had looked like to him to her despite the cold despite the coming war and the many things that roiled in her stomach to her the frozen land beneath her was beautiful all acacia all the known world was filled with wonders worth fighting for she had long ago decided she would die for it before this was all over she would die it seemed the only possibility the only way through it for the people and the nation and the land she loved the certainty of this belief made what she did next easier back when bledas asked if she would go her answer had not been as certain as it sounded now on the wing and with the world cold beneath her she decided upon another course she turned elya toward candovia from there she would keep flying all the way to tavirith and then beyond she and elya would see these auldek with their own eyes chapter twentyseven kelis jogged up from the town at a steady pace he told himself to be calm to move efficiently but not in a hurry he had just enough time it wouldnt do to attract attention with too much haste or to trip and twist an ankle or something foolish like that he had come too farand brought shen and benabe too farto spoil it with a careless mistake since the night kelis was attacked they had traveled with all the stealth they could manage it never felt like stealth though considering the crowd of santoth that trailed them every step of the way he had still not gotten used to them he could still not quite believe that nobody outside their group saw them but as he had no choice in the matter he did the best he could and the best he could do he decided was to ignore them it seemed to work they crossed through balbara territory heading toward the trading city of falik it was exposed country flat as a plate and spread like a clear night sky with a constellation of settlements villages and farms the entire time kelis felt like any eye within twenty miles could see them gone was the solitude of the south daylong from whatever scant shelter they found under acacia trees or beneath a geometry of cloth propped by keliss iron spear they watched movement on the horizon near or far there was always somebody herd boys switching droopeared goats teni root farmers piercing the ground with their pronged spears groups of women attending to some work kelis could not imagine who seemed to communicate mainly in bursts of laughter once an entire caravan of merchants trudged by not thirty feet from the cluster of rocks they huddled beside person after person waved at them in passing singing a story in song that they passed from one person to another kelis did not catch all their balbara words but he knew enough of their traditions to know that their travel songs tended to incorporate whatever things they saw along the way likely the group huddled beside the rocks had been documented in the song so much for stealth they kept to their night travel but it was harder here with village or camp dogs always ready to wake the world to announce their passing he had never seen such moisture on the plains in the late hours of the night a kneehigh layer of mist flowed across the ground like slow liquid leaving their lower legs dripping wet it was as if the land were dreaming itself into an ocean making water phantoms in among the stew of races and cultures of falik their progress changed no running through these choked streets the only hiding they could do was to walk in plain sight to be invisible by being visible kelis had known many balbara he had fought with them during alivers war and had hunted foulthings with a few of them under menas command now though he made eye contact with no one he knew that faces marked with the dotted lines and swirls that the balbara found beautiful turned and followed his progress but he did not look that would invite interaction make a certainty out of what might only be a question he just kept moving busy distracted like so many others they made a point of never walking together as a group of five when they divided the santoth always stayed near shen kelis tried to take comfort in this they were there to protect her as well right they knew aliver loved him kelis said the words he knew them by heart he took a measure of comfort in them but only a tiny sliver a moment later he returned to fearing them more than sinper ous spies more even than corinn whose reaction to the girl he could not predict no matter how many times he tried to run through the moment in his mind once while walking with leeka through a market at the edge of the city kelis lost the old warrior he cast about for a moment and spotted him at a stall a ways back bent over a table studying something he turned the other way and watched the santoths backs as they followed the others out along the road that would take them away from the city he retraced his steps drawing up beside leeka he started to urge him on the warrior said an acacian blade look kelis this was my weapon once the balbara stall keeper standing just on the other side of the narrow table said nah nah this one was fair trade not yours he was a short man with eyes that were set at irregular angles it was hard to know what he was looking at though he did not seem troubled by it how much is it leeka asked the stall keeper appeared to size him up before answering with one eye or the other he took in leekas tattered robe the leather cord at his waist and the small satchel of supplies draped over his shoulder then studied his weathered face too much for you old tortoise too much coin too much blade what would you join alivers war alivers war alivers war the stall keeper imitated leekas mainland accent he looked to kelis to share the absurdity of the question with him kelis returned nothing the coming war the war with the invaders the snow kings new war leeka blinked his green eyes the snow king i know what you want you want to dress fancy for the coronation is that so you want to impress the king make him think youre an old warrior coronation do you know nothing or is it age too much wine in your young days the balbara found leekas confusion hilarious in what must have been a local dialect he called something over his shoulder to a group of men playing stones a little distance away they looked up and one of them said something back all of them laughed turning back to leeka the man grew suddenly friendly see if you remember this tomorrow aliver akaran is reborn he is to become king finally he will be king hell fight a war and well get on with it its good for talay good for balbara the man reached out and squeezed leekas shoulder with one hand even as he made a show of guarding the sword from him with the other but no old tortoise i cant sell you this steel at any price this sword needs a warrior not a grandfather walk on tension trembled on leekas forehead his eyes moved away from the mans face and focused on the hand resting on his shoulder for an awful moment kelis was sure the old warrior was going to break the mans arm the balbara smiled undeterred but kelis knew things about leeka the leeka who had greeted them alone in a vast plain had been unreadable and strange this leeka was different though kelis had not noticed the change until now come brother he said to leeka you do not need this sword he slipped the wedge of his hand under the balbaras wrist and lifted it from there at least their journey north up the coast and then along the trade roads that ran along the western edge of the teheen hills proved easier without knowing they were doing so they had joined a river of pilgrims flowing north toward the shore toward the isle of acacia and the wonders it now purported to offer all who could drop what they were doing to make the journey it seemed had done just that among them the five travelers with their escort of sorcerers were just some of the many i found a boat kelis said on meeting benabe out a little way from their camp did you yes kelis moved to pass her but benabe stopped him she looked into his eyes for a long moment perhaps we should go without them he knew what she meant instantly he had chewed on the same thought himself many times i did not book passage for them but i dont imagine that will stop them from coming we could go ourselves benabe said bending urgency into her words leave them here could we kelis wondered had they power to had they the right it wasnt to benabe or naamen or kelis that the santoth spoke it was to alivers daughter and it had been aliver himself who first sought out the santoth found them and came back even stronger and more driven for his time with them wiser benabe aliver wanted nothing more than to bring the santoth back into the world he would have done what we are doing now if he had lived and found the way how can you ask me not to do a thing he thought was so important benabe did not have an answer we should have discussed this more we have discussed it plenty kelis said all of us in our heads naamen jogged over to them what i found a boat kelis said again an acacian ship naamen asked do they know who you are no nobody knows and its not an acacian ship he glanced at shen she lay sleeping on a narrow blanket cast on the hard ground you all will probably not like it much but its the best i could do come wake shen we must go now naamen approached him as he gathered up their scant supplies and them the young man asked kelis did not need to look up to know what he meant he slipped their bowls and foodstuffs into his sack then stood slinging it onto his back as he did so just the five of us he said thats all i can account for we will do what we do they will do what they will do what the santoth did was shadow them as they came down from the toes of the teheen hills in which they had spent the last few nights before them ran the thin line of white sand that marked the northern shore of talay the inner sea stretched north toward the isle of acacia unseen but there surely just a little over the horizon though not a city or town the entire area crawled with life flat transports crowded the long stretch of beach pilgrims like themselves converged from all landward directions a network of wooden pens described ragged geometries from the beach up through the sea grass inside them herds of creatures grazed they were fat things hairless and pinkand not just from the early sun pigs youre joking benabe said in a tone that indicated she knew he was not those are pig barges where is our ship she did not look directly at kelis choosing instead to scan the scene as if she had somehow overlooked a nice stout galley with their names emblazoned on its side kelis slowed because she had but he tried to keep them moving forward its the best way ive found theyre taking pigs to sell on the raft of boats floating around acacia they asked no questions and theyre not sinper ous people well be safe on them they will get us as far as the flotilla surrounding the island then well have to make our way as best we can we he cleared his throat hesitated a moment and then decided he might as well get it all out at once we will have disguises what disguises as pig keepers the look of derision benabe set on him made him feel like a naughty child facing a grandmothers disapproval she must have practiced the look for she was too young to be so skilled at it i am no pig keeper today you are kelis said if you want to reach acacia i thought you knew people i thought you were connected to the royal family i thought pigs shen said she and naamen had just caught up with them look mother pigs are there piglets she grabbed her mothers hand and tugged her back into motion fighting her reluctance with pure childish enthusiasm as kelis watched them relieved shen glanced back and winked the hundreds of human feet and the thousands of hoofed ones had torn and slashed and gouged the white sand the smell pushed straight for the backs of their throats it fought against the fresh breeze blowing in from the water and seemed to be winning the battle as was the sound warring with the peaceful lapping of the waves oinks and grunts squeals and shouts voices raised in entreaty booming with directions announcing bargains on foodstuffs and fresh water for the journey kelis in the lead once more kept them moving until he had retraced his route to the livestock merchant who controlled a small fleet of bargesonly one of several such along the beach he had agreed to carry them across but it was no act of charity he required both the coins kelis had left in the sack and their labor divided up and set to different tasks they worked the frantic loading of the barges opening and closing pens prodding animals to get them moving luring them forward or kicking them onward making human barriers to block one herd from mingling with another loading slops into troughs that were then tugged onto the barges a few minutes into the squealing chaos of it and all of them were splattered with filth leeka went to work with awkward solemnity naamen kelis noticed kept his weak arm hidden beneath the shoulder wrap of his robe he eschewed the shoveling duty a boy half his age directed him toward he was adept at appearing both deaf and stricken with blind spots in his vision much to the younger boys annoyance benabe wore an evil expression one corner of her lip curling whenever she caught keliss eye for shen however the work looked more akin to play she ran around with her arms outstretched darting and shooing as if she were herding chickens instead of barrelshaped swine several times her own weight the pigs rushed from her with a wideeyed intensity that stayed just this side of panic it would have been comical except for the animals agitation behind the girl the santoth fanned out in wings they changed nothing of their demeanor or silence they simply shadowed her and the pigswhether seeing or sensing themlooked for escape that they found by rushing up the gangplanks onto the barges ive never seen the like of that the merchant said coming up and nudging kelis with an elbow he wore a perplexed grimace as his eyes followed shen taking no notice of the santoth at all you ever want rid of her i have work that girl could do replace the whole lot of my boys be happy to see the back of them kelis did not answer a few chaotic hours later the pigs were loaded kelis stood ankledeep in the water watching as the others having finished their tasks joined him the incoming tide had begun to lift the barges free of the bottom they moved now with the undulation of the waves much to the consternation of the passengers pigs crowded each barge so tightly that they stood shoulder to shoulder haunch to haunch sliding against one another with grunts of protest boys climbed into the rigging dangling above the animals backs they worked on the sails that would catch the evening breeze and pull them from the shore is this safe naamen asked i know we need to go but kelis was not at all sure but he said you saw the merchant does he look like a man who lets his pigs sink to the bottom of the sea acacia is close come just a walk across a sea of swine naamen said he hoisted his sack up over his head and motioned for shen to walk beside him she began to but then spun around the santoth stood as if rooted to the shore away from the waterline in the dry sand arent you coming shen asked one of the santoth said may we before kelis could consider the question and the possible answers he would offer shen gave hers of course nualo youve come all this way this is the easy part we may come with you i just said so the santoth lifted his foot and set it down a few inches farther on the smooth wet sand another of them spoke his voice tremulous more solidly of this world than kelis had imagined possible of them we may go to acacia you allow us thats where weve been heading all this time yes come on a tremble passed through them that was different from the usual ripples and disturbances around them they are afraid kelis thought shen still another santoth said do you lift the banishment upon us will you come if i do yes they all answered kelis splashed forward toward the girl he reached for her arm he suddenly wanted to stop her easy answer shen wait i lift it then shen waved her hand in the air to indicate something vanishing just like that theres no banishment now come ouch kelis youre hurting me kelis let go of her arm he had not even realized he had grabbed it shen massaged the arm with her other hand you are odd sometimes she turned and walked up the gangplank onto the barge the santoth followed her they dispersed across the raft causing no more disturbance to the pigs than would a breeze touching them as he splashed through the ankledeep water and stepped onto the gangplank kelis thought aliver i pray this be right chapter twentyeight the man had hairy nostrils sire lethel could not help but imagine tweezing the hairs out one by one quite distracting more so than the scaly plates on his forehead and cheeks more so than the fact that the tip of his tongue was split presumably in imitation of the hooded snake that was his clans totem lethel did not look away as the man spoke his rough choppy acacian lethel ridged his forehead and pursed his lips appearing to respect this dukish the selfproclaimed headman of the anet slaves of avina the two men sat across from each other in the center of a marble courtyard open to the clear sky a wedge of advisers flanked the leagueman with ishtat soldiers among them archers lined the last row and fanned out to either side the slaves were not the threat the auldek had been but it paid to come prepared for trouble behind dukish stood a crowd of quota slaves they were well dressed and looked healthy enough but lethel could not help but think of them as a motley horde they were slaves after all had been raised as servants victims to whatever whims the auldekbeasts themselvescould conceive their very bodies were testament to that he did not know or want to know what their lives had been like dukish did not know this of course hence his long diatribe on just this subject as he sat pretending empathy sire lethels mind journeyed elsewhere there were a million more important things to consider than the woes of slaves he had arrived in ushen brae only five days ago he sailed in along with sire faleen both of them with full blessing of the league council with authority between them to handle affairs in ushen brae on the leagues behalf he had spent most of that time on the barrier isles where he had fed ravenously on all the information he could gather about this place about the details of the quota trade about the auldek tribes and most crucially about the lothan aklun the few nights he had stayed in the lothan akluns estates those strange dwellings hung from cliffs and almost otherworldly had left him dizzy most pleasantly so most of the things he saw were indecipherable but the small things that he could see functiontabletops that floated in midair glass that darkened or lightened beneath the touch of his fingers grooves in the hallways that when stepped into propelled one forward as if sliding slowly downhill the soul vessels that surged over the water without any obvious power source propelled by the will of whoever held its wheeltantalizingly hinted at further possibilities they certainly had other vessels sire faleen had mentioned finding enormous transports capable of carrying thousands of troops as well as numerous smaller vessels some tiny enough that they held only a single person what other wonders might be uncovered weapons other soul catchers had it been possible he would have stayed out there or sailed to lithram len to see the ruins of the soul catcher for himselfas faleen was doing at this very moment it was not within his purview to pursue such things yet that went to sire faleen he being of higher rank within the league lethel had volunteered to handle matters on the mainland this mostly entailed sorting things out with the emancipated slaves later he would explore inland seeing what use could be made of the abandoned auldek cities there might be benefits from that as well but lethel hoped to find some way to take over faleens duties perhaps he would fall off a boat stumble after having inhaled a bit too much of the sweet red mist he so enjoyed uncharitable thought yes but faleen had always been a windbag politely incompetent in the manner that assured his political rise among the league council lethel was sure he would find the real world more challenging dukish droned on lethel would have raised his eyebrows except that the tweezed slashes that were his eyebrows had been shaped to mimic a finelined version of that expression already it amazed him that foolish men so often took silence and a concerned expression as an invitation to blather small price to pay for this dukish had just made his life considerably easier just three days in ushen brae lethel had received word that dukish wanted to meet and come to peaceful terms he should not have been surprised though these people had been slaves they were freed by the actions of others of course freedom would scare them of course they would seek a new master the league would oblige not as holders of whips and chains of course they did not need such things to enslave dukish offered sire neens ashes as a special gift the unfortunate mans parts had been gathered up and put through some cremation ritual and this dukish had come into possession of them a strange offering but lethel accepted the urn with a rather specific idea of what he would do with its contents i hear all and am saddened lethel said once he could bear sitting through no more these things you say are grave they twist my heart they fill me with shame you must know that the league was an innocent accomplice in all this for all these years we served the will of the akarans we sailed the gray slopes at their bidding and here in ushen brae we were mistreated ourselves by the lothan aklun the haughty arrogant vicious lothan aklun in our own way we have also been duped by both of them someone in the slave crowd grumbled and a few others responded lethel wished he could have the grumbler killed but that would not do he looked past dukish and brought his entreaties to the entire party i hear that this is a surprising revelation to you he said but ask yourselves how could we know what became of you as far as we knew we delivered orphaned children into the hands of a nation that welcomed them we were but the middlemen search your mind look back was it a man like mea true leaguemanthat took you from your homes no thewhat did you call them the red shirts they did that on akaran orders did any leagueman set foot on ushen brae in your memory did we stand in that chamber as some of you were robbed of your very souls no consider everything from this perspective and you will hear the truth of it ringing in your ears i am certain dukish turned his head to one side and drew back his long hair to reveal mangled tissue where his ear should have been a leagueman did this to me for no reason other than that it amused him ah lethel thought likely thats sire fens work he was rumored to take pleasure from such things in his day before dariel akaran slit his belly too bad lethel had always rather liked the old codger if that is true you have my deepest apologies even within the league there are reprobates we do our best to weed them out changing tack he said let us look to the future the game board that is the world has been overturned now that its righted what came before is gone what you see are new players new rules new possibilities the league is willing to deal with you as equals look im here before you speaking to you as an equal you and your people are the new masters of ushen brae likewise the league will in the future not be pawns for the akarans we have broken with them because of what we learned here if we trade with them again it will be on your behalf i do say if though for as you know the auldek will destroy them i very much hope they succeed grumbles again lethel realized he was speaking too quickly what i mean is that i hope they succeed in reaching the known world i hope they do battle with the akarans friends what better punishment for them than that they spill their own blood in a massive slaughter this did not get quite the enthusiastic response he had expected where are they a grayfaced woman behind dukish asked where are who the auldek oh i dont know far far away lethel indicated vaguely with his fingers are you not tracking their progress what were doing or not is hardly your concern lethel thought but he said the ishtat had birds following them for a time quite easy to really as theyre an entire nation on the move a fortnight back an early storm blew the birds off course and so began winter in earnest it happens that way in the north youve lost them your man before said the league was tracking them said you rule the seas see everything now you say youve lost them already i wouldnt say that lethel ran a finger over the jagged line of one of his eyebrows he felt the first twinge of a headache coming on he got them all too regularly he thought it a result of some mistake with his head binding when he was a child we know where they arein a hell of ice and snow no need to journey there with them the auldek are queen corinns concern anyway they are a problem for the akarans not for you or me dukish stood abruptly and turned into the group behind him a tad erratic lethel thought they spoke in a fast murmur auldek by the sound of it lethel crossed his legs and bobbed his foot up and down noticing a spot of dirt on the red satin of his boots he pursed his lips a punishment was in order for his body servant he might have had nothing to do with the stain but still how else would he wash the filth from his memory but to make someone pay for it when dukish resumed his seat he said they were ready to talk about a treaty lethel tented his fingers sagely i am here to extend a hand of friendship tohe almost said you slaves but recalled the name he had been instructed to use with themthe anet people and to all the people of ushen brae but i must know something before we can proceed any further as im sure you know somebody destroyed a facility on lithram len i cannot say what foolishness drove them but i can say that our displeasure over this is beyond measure thats no way to begin a new partnership were you responsible by dukishs emphatic response it was clear that he was not who was i know not dukish glanced around behind him seeking confirmation of his ignorance from his peers they gave it have you heard anything about survivors from the group that sire neen brought to meet the auldek any acacians one leagueman dukish said thats all thats not possible we accounted for all our leaguemen do you mean a soldier dukish laughed not this one he was no soldier this one was a weakling devoth imprisoned him took him away and there were no others no lethel eased the tension of this line of questioning out of his fingers it was silly really but he could not help thinking of dariel akaran if the prince had some how survived and managed to get up to his old tricks unlikely though highly unlikely one you will find the criminal and deliver himor themto me lethel said that you must do and two there can be no more destruction of lothan aklun artifacts they are all henceforth league possessions any act against them is an act against us that thing was evil a voice from dukishs entourage said perhaps it was or perhaps it was a device that the lothan aklun turned to evil is a knife evil because it can kill a man no it can also do a thousand useful things we of the league have scholars among us physicians and men of learning it may be that for every way the lothan aklun used their tools to make your lives misery we could use them for good this is not negotiable you will leave such artifacts to us indeed you will alert us to any that we have yet to discover the anet do not seek these lothan aklun things dukish said we have no interest in them i cannot speak for the other clans but you have my faith on this now let me have your faith your man the one who spoke to us before you said you could provide us with settlers with women who are fertile and can breed is that so thats easily enough done lethel thought we have whole breeding islands for just that purpose that is within our capacity have i your faith then lethel did not correct the mans usage of the word in all things sir it will take some time but it can be done in addition to the barrier isles we would need to base some operations here in avina if we are truly to he lies the shout was loud sharp enough to cause sire lethel to start he craned around looking for the source for it was not among the two groups in the courtyard leagueman he is lying who speaks the grayfaced woman said show yourself the voice said dukish does not speak for the free people who does then lethel asked promise me that your soldiers will not shoot us give us no reason and we wont i have your faith then lethel rolled his eyes certainly a woman rose to standing on the bridge lethels party had passed under to enter the courtyard several others to either side and a few more on roofs nearby also rose or stepped from behind the stones that had hidden them they did not appear to be armed except for knives that were as yet sheathed dukish barked something at the woman in auldek gesturing profanely as he did so the woman gave it back other anet added their voices and for a moment it seemed the entire meeting would erupt into chaos the ishtat reacted they enveloped lethel within a bristling wedge of bodies they pressed so tight against him that as they pulled him back he was not sure if his feet touched the ground or if they lifted him bodily the bowmen readied their weaponsaiming both at the anet and at the newcomersand the captain shouted the clanspeople to stillness lethel sighed the difficulties of dealing with primitives one never knew where the power resided always upstarts and bickering to contend with though in this case he doubted it truly rested with this woman her face was pale blue and she wore a headdress that sprang up from her hairline did she hope to pass that off as a crown she was slim though limber looking just lethels type actually except for the feathers thats what they were not a headdress exactly but plumes of feathers instead of hair these people the woman said we dont come to fight youjust to tell you the truth before you err dukish does not speak for us for those who were once quota and are now free citizens of a new nation the anet raged at this and it took the ishtat a moment to quiet them do you then speak for these people dukish tried to say something but the ishtat captain punched him in the jaw it was a quick jab just a warning as was the way he drew his short sword from its scabbard for dukish to see a tense moment but it went no further lethel repeated his question for the moment i do the woman answered and whats your name then skylene ah lethel said fully in control of his composure once more well skylene this news surprises me i found dukish to be quite convincing you cant say that he does not control a considerable portion of the city that he does not speak for many ive seen the evidence of it with my own eyes dont ask me to disbelieve them perhaps you should come down from there and talk with me here i will speak from here thats hardly the way to hold council really you leagueman i cannot hold council with you i simply want you to know that dukish does not speak for the people who does then our council of elders yoen mor there are many who speak faith they are away gathering the people in the westlands to return here they will come soon the anet have just grabbed for power in their absence careful leagueman some among the kulish kra and the lvin scheme to do the same do not make any pacts with them they will not be valid the council speaks for all the people not just for one clan or another dukish is a fool who would make chaos out of what could be peace dont listen to him lethel wished he could express on his face the full measure of his displeasure at being given commands he did not he showed nothing but troubled interest most disturbing to hear this come down and lets ushen brae is for the people you have no place here nor can you divide us we are stronger together and we will hold ah lethel said he made a face as if he had burped up an unpleasant taste holding up the palm of his hand he asked for a moment to consider a response on the one hand a council of elders who speak for all the people high ideals a loathing for the league grandiose notions of this as a free land on the other hand several fool clans who would fracture ushen brae into small powers squabbling among themselves all wanting nothing more than to buy league wares it was an easy decision to make glancing at his ishtat captain lethel said shoot the bird chapter twentynine shirtless and sweating melio faced the massive warrior his marah sword sliced the air he backed and parried the warrior stepped toward him on legs like tree trunks his blade hissing in the air with each massive swing several times melio dodged to the right or left as his foes sword struck the frozen ground sending up splinters of ice he felt the giants anger growing possessing him driving him to more and more furious attacks he bellowed and swung his blade around melio ducked and spun and leaped with a swirling aerial attack of his own it would have been a wonderful move he would have soon followed it with a headhewing attack except that the timing of his landing was off the ground moved beneath him in such a way that he landed on the edge of his foot his ankle twisted and he yanked it into the air hopping on the other leg cursing his sword hung limp and his foe for that matter went forgotten forgetting the slickness of the surface on which he stood melios good foot suddenly took off in a horizontal direction bringing the rest of his body crashing down a moment later what exactly was all that about the voice was geenas she sat suspended from the rigging of the league clipper the slipfin she had one leg wrapped around the rope ladder that was all she needed to feel secure even though the vessel rose and fell at a rapid windwhipped clip as melio had fought his battle she had munched dates and spit the pits out over the water sometimes upright sometimes hanging upside down she had watched the entire scene with barely contained mirth it had taken melio an extra measure of focus to block her out he lay prone for a moment as if he had decided to make a close inspection of the deck planks like everything else on the outside of the vessel the deck was coated in white skin slicker for it it was not the first time melio had found himself studying it things had gotten a bit better since kartholome had found a supply of gripping deck socks but even these only seemed to work when he remembered that he was wearing them a revised version of the eighth form he said pushing up the eighth form is the combat routine that reenacts gerimuss battle with the guards of tullucks hold when he fought the giants that guarded the whos gerimus you dont know who gerimus was not everyone sucks at the tit of acacian lore kartholome called though from where was not immediately obvious a king from the second candovian kingdom when this did not seem to register with her melio wiped the sweat from his brow with his shirt which he had taken off before he began it was actually quite chilly but he liked the feel of air on his skin when he trained they were eighteen days out of bleem heading west with a slight edge toward the south clytus made that small adjustment for his own reasons which he did not share around them stretched the gray slopes as far as the eye could see waves sky it was bleak the sky a lighter version of the water it hung over he took a swig from his waterskin feeling her eyes on him all the while geena flipped upside down again her shirt began to fall with gravity but she pinned it to her abdomen wheres tullucks hold its melio set the waterskins spout in his mouth again but pulled it away without drinking i dont know really candovia i believe geena unwrapped her leg and climbed down the ladder managing to do so without actually putting her hands or feet on the rungs very often he had seen her do that before but could not for the life of him figure out the technique she landed on one of the horizontal stacks of harpoons they had bought at bleem balanced at the topmost of them geena walked along it youre guessing you were there werent you it was a long time ago melio said theres not a tullucks hold anymore she just looked at him eyes expectant i mean a really long time ago before my time and yet you remember every move this gerimus made anyway thats only part of it what i was doing was the revision created by leeka alain an officer of the northern guard its partly the traditional form and partly the way he modified it when he killed the first numrek geena began to speak but melio carried on and this leeka i actually knew he detailed the battle and i even worked some of it through with him so he toasted her with the skin and took a drink not sure he had won the point but keeping up appearances clytus climbed down from the bridge sharratt enough playing with your sword he said on to your evening round of duties might as well start melio grabbed for his shirt oh dont do that geena tossed a date pit at him geena clytus said a warning in it what i just like to watch melio sharratt my private performer performance over clytus said up to the nest girl or ill get the strap out dont you wish she scaled the swaying ladder effortlessly clytus stood beside melio the two of them watched her ascend and then tip herself into the tiny basket of the crows nest how old is she melio asked once he was confident geena was well out of talking earshot acts just like a girl doesnt she youd think she was sixteen and had never seen an obstacle she couldnt leap shes always been like that all thirtysome years ive known her giver bless her the brigand set somber eyes on melio its not true though shes seen hard times especially when she was a girl she likes you but dont get the wrong idea shed not roll with you its the dance she likes not the wrestling i i never thought you know why in your case its because of mena for a certain type of woman the princess is well a person to aspire to like a hero if she were a man you understand me melio thought a moment and then said yes i do i know the feeling about geena though i wouldnt have tried anything good clytus said shed go off you in a minute if she thought you would youre a fine lad but if you slighted mena shed likely introduce your stiffy to a blood eels teeth shes done it before before melio could configure his face in response to this clytus slapped his shoulder now to chores this ship runs clean in many ways ive not figured out yet but theres still work to do as he always did melio went to his chores without complaint since leaving tivol he had learned more than he had ever wished to about nautical matters four was not nearly enough to crew a vessel like the slipfin but clytus and geena had enough brigand tricks up their sleeves to make hard things easier to finesse the impossible into only improbable he had to respect them for it and do his part if these were to be his last days melio could not complain that they were being spent poorly he had seen wonders at sea before in the time before he found mena on the docks of ruinat he had worked for a feeble living among the floating merchants the inner sea was beautiful but its teeming life had not prepared him for the things he saw riding the gray slopes o ne afternoon a week from land geena had shouted from high in the rigging he did not catch what she said except that it was an alarm melio turned he saw the movement low on the horizon he could not make sense of it at first low clouds a storm brewing neither it came on fast with a speed and swarming quality that set it apart from some phenomenon of the weather but it did not ride the water like a fleet of boats nor was it in the water as aquatic life should be it was above the surface skimming the crests of the waves geena slid down the rope at a speed akin to just plain falling she hit the deck and sprang up with purpose what is that melio shouted dinner or death she said as she passed him she flipped open one of the wooden deck crates and hit him in the chest with a wad of netting she bolted away climbed the stairs to the bridge and disappeared inside or make it both kartholome slid up to them with an uncanny grace on the skin looking like a performer skating on ice dinner and death he grabbed one of the nets and careened away standing where geena instructed him to netting loose in his fingers melio stared at the rocking view of a seething sea atop which a great mass of something approached thousands of them hundreds of thousands they were innumerable large enough to see at a distance they flew but something told him they were not birds there were no birds out here not so far from land not lowflying birds like that geena back again grabbed him by the elbow dont get skewered love stay near the cabin door it was not until they were upon them that melio understood what they were a massive flock of flying fish with flipper wings so wide and nimble that individuals wheeled like starlings within a vast unstoppable torrent of momentum the front wall of them broke over the ship motion engulfed them that of the sailing ship and of the fish flying across it sound that textured the air with scales a seadeep stench of salt and life and moisture splattered melios face the air became liquid enough to swim in of course melio thought thats how they fly they swim the air the fish careened over the deck they slipped between the sails most flew with amazing precision even snapping their wings against their sides to cut through narrow gaps their bodies were slim splinters thick around as a mans leg and fins included a little longer they were as dangerous in flight as javelins striped down the side with one slash of violet one sliced kartholomes shoulder through his shirt several smashed so hard against structures on the boat that they skidded across the deck broken a hundred it seemed tried to cut strands of melios curly hair as they passed melio would never forget the mad way he and kartholome and geena dashed around on deck fishing they tossed nets up over their heads and then fell to the deck clutching the ropes as the fishs force pulled them he would never forget that try as he might he could not say he saw even one of them jump from the water or fall into it they just flew nor would he forget the taste of them afterward when the crew gathered snug in the cabin getting stupid on ale roasted over an open flame the fish needed nothing but salt to flavor them like tuna he declared and geena had added if tunas could fly and were a white fish that tasted like sea air after a storm on an island of lemon trees she had it right he had to admit a nd then there was the morning two weeks from land nothing around them but endless ocean when the sails suddenly appeared twenty or thirty of them diaphanous white triangles blown by the same steady wind the slipfin hitched they came over the horizon behind them midmorning and by the midafternoon they cruised right by the league clipper but the sails were nothing human made they trailed beneath them long tendrils of aquatic life ribbons of yellow and blue splattered with sparkles along the entire long length of them melio could not shake the feeling that each shimmer was an individual creature attached to the tendrils passengers that watched him as they flapped in the current as casual as so many agnates passing them in their pleasure crafts there was the doubled sky at night above the constellations he knew below beneath the undulations of the waves another universe of glowing orbs they were not reflections from the sky as he thought at first but shone with their light from somewhere far below he knew that the stars below were living creatures which made him wonder if the stars in the sky might be likewise creatures of some vast ocean he could not comprehend and there were the deep whales he had heard tales of them but seeing them was another thing they appeared in a pod off a way to starboard they looked from the middle distance like a series of rounded granite boulders save that they bobbed with the seas one broke off from the rest dipped below the surface a moment and then rose and came toward them the enormous wedge of its head pushed a billow of water before it just before its nose would have hit the slipfin the whale dove its tailfins stretched wider than the slipfin was long when it submerged the surge of water it pulled down tilted the boat with it the upsurge of water from the fin sent a wave over the boat drenching all on board melio clutched a safety rope laughing uncontrollably at the bizarre beauty of it he was starting to understand the way geena lived the way dariel must have lived when he grew to adulthood among these people the trials to come should have daunted him but for some reason they did not it was not that he thought they would pass through the range survive a runin with the sea wolves or possibly find one young prince in a foreign land that he knew nothing of just the opposite it was the fact these things seemed so out of the reach for four small people in a relatively small boat that heartened him they should fail they would fail there was no way they could not fail with that established he could go forward without struggling with expectations d ead calm the third week in just as far from land as was possible near where the range might well have begun instead of that roaring tumultstillness it just came upon them while nobody was paying attention melio did not feel the boats constant rocking stop he just realized that it had when he awoke that morning it was not even the lack of movement that woke him it was the silence no creaking of boards no murmuring off somewhere in the ships innards no whistle of wind or slop of water against the hull no tinkling from the bells high up on the mainmast they all gathered on deck and stared at the breezeless sky and the mirrorflat surface of the water and the ghosts of limp cloths where the sails should have been the slipfin sat as if stuck in a sea of glass when did this happen clytus asked didnt you notice geena responded nah i was deciphering what i could from league manuals in the bridge back room i set the course and stepped away from the wheel stuck my nose in the books dont know how long for but when i looked up this calm was on us couldnt have been more than a few minutes he said but none of the confidence of the statement was in the voice making it geena jumped up onto the port railing she stood there balanced above the water for a moment she looked like she was going to leap down onto the hard surface of the oncewaswater and go running across it playing a few seconds standing there however took the jauntiness out of her posture passing strange she whispered as she climbed back down to the deck kartholome had heard of a league fleet becalmed for nearly a month during an early crossing but that had happened so long ago the tale had the feel of legend he seemed more disbelieving than any of them ive never seen a stillness like this he said it isnt possible were supposed to be in the range now the range of the gray slopes for the love of light this isnt possible shhhh geena said and melio was glad she did a voice should not he felt speak loudly into such stillness for two days the impossible continued no wind stirred no ripples moved on the surface no fish darted in the water or flew above it or sailed across it no motions or sounds in all the world other than the ones they themselves made the silence in particular grew in intensity melio had never experienced a silence like this one before the lack of noise made them all shy of making any sounds each scuffing of a foot on the deck or the thrumming of fingers on the railing a cough at night or a clearing of a throat they all seemed like an affront to the emptiness that was the world a sign that would betray their existence to something that should not know of their existence they spoke only when they had to and then only in whispers melio always felt ill at ease afterward on the third morning a fin broke the surfacethe dorsal of a gapmouthed shark it moved with an eerie slowness as if it worked at a different pace from the rest of the world it seemed to carve not through water but through the thick syrup the water had congealed into watching the shark for the better part of an afternoon melio felt the slipfin to be akin to whatever tiny creatures that behemoth sucked into its gaping maw just as vulnerable just as still in the water waiting for the mouth that would engulf them boat and all by the third night they had had enough of it gathered together in the captains cabin they ate their fill from the rich stores more to the point they got drunk they filled the small room with more noise than they had heard in days awkward forced humor boisterousness with a slightly mad edge kartholome drank his warm ale from a languid stretch of glass that no doubt was intended for finer things geena raided the leagues stores she shared around a flask of something with an aniseed tang none of them could name the liquor in it but it went down if it keeps on like this clytus said were not going to get to die fighting sea wolves itll be boredom that takes us kartholome quipped geena drank from the flask closed her eyes as she processed the taste and potency of it still doing so she said ill not abide that i made a pact a long time ago with the afterdeath im not going to it quietly a howling death ill have none other she slapped a hand on the polished wood of the table kartholome rose abruptly and went outside they could hear him shouting out across the water damning the calm and insulting the wind for cowardice calling the waves craven he returned and commenced to drink more melios gaze drifted up from the ring of familiar faces and moved across the walls leagueman walls decorated with their sparse sense of nautical gentility he could not see it well from where he sat but there was a mural at the far end of the room painted right onto the smooth wood panels he had studied it before a league brig plied a sea filled with carnage the bodies of leviathans thick in water stained crimson sea wolves kartholome had confirmed the painting brimmed with details individual leaguemen and ishtat on the deck of the brig harpoons caught in midair a sea wolf pierced through a grasping tentacle just one of many seabirds circling in the air above melio knew that detail to be true the biggest brigs had their own contingents of birds that made the ocean crossing with them despite the details melio could not quite believe the scene the sea wolves themselves had no shape that he could credit they looked like whales and squids and sharks all cut into pieces and floating in a waveheavy stew together what do they want anyway melio asked the sea wolves i mean why attack ships nothing else does that not even deep whales nah they just come and take a look near to sinking in the process clytus said you know how much wed have made if we were whalers if wed taken that big bastard and dragged him back to tivol the four of us not possible clytus guffawed there was a comment to go with it melio could see but clytus kept it in so do they have a taste for man flesh or what melio asked kartholome warmed to the question leagueman flesh id say the league and they are enemies always have been just like in the painting youve been eyeing before they had the skin the league lost a lot of ships to them even a brig went down once disappeared none lived but everyone believes it was sea wolves that took her long time ago this is but the leaguemen know how to hold a grudge once they came up with the skin they what is the skin do you know how its made melio accepted the flask from geena he drank with the help of her finger which tilted the flask up to lengthen his measure if i knew id not be here kartholome said id be sipping lemon liqueur from a cliffside estate in manil with two redheaded whores named benda and fenda hes partial to redheaded whores geena explained an experience he had as a lad see give him enough drink and youll hear more about it than you want to know anyway kartholome continued what im saying is that id be rich is what nobody knows how they make it could be a process the lothan aklun clued them to wouldnt surprise me its the only thing that made the mist trade possible the mist trade melio mused he never calls it the quota trade so melio asked should we ever get moving again and come up against these sea wolves will the skin protect us or wont it thats right kartholome said which it will and wont you were there when we bought and loaded the harpoons you didnt think we were going whaling did you he held up a hand to stop melios response let me finish you asked a question let me answer it once the league had the skin their big ships were safe little ones not so much but the big ones could sail as they pleased the sea wolves just cant grasp the stuff they slip off it tentacles and beak and teeth and everything so the brigs just slid on by thats all right if youre two hundred feet above the water but when youre down low like we are thats a different story theyll jump clear out of the water and smash down on the deck theyve got these tentacles with grippers all up and down them they get one of those around your leg and youre heading for their mouth beaklike the mouth is ugly thing so sharp it serrates the flesh like two curved knives angled just so you maybe should have asked more about them before you signed on for this trip melio remembering that he did not always like this man met his gaze without humor you knew all that and you still came theres more he said after a long draft of ale the league wasnt satisfied with just being able to get across untroubled spiteful bunch they are they took to slaughtering the beasts whenever they could harpoons those big crossbow bolts of theirs they even threw out barrels of pitch and set seas full of the wolves alight they still do that on occasion i suppose did it for generations never did any good though kartholome dabbed at the moisture at the edges of his lips for some reason this prompted him to flash a sly smile at geena she responded with a finger gesture threatening his manhood with an unfortunate break they did that every now and then a game melio assumed i havent made a scientific study of it the pilot continued but i dont think so what i heard is it never changed things in the slightest the league got tired of the effort now they just sail through them as well do as well clytus said might have to tack a bit but tack a bit the brigand thickly muscled masculinefeatured in a blocky weathered way tried to shape his large hands into a demonstration of the maneuvering he had planned he looked like a bear trying to explain the use of a pottery wheel kartholome chuckled he started to say something but found it too amusing to put into words geena flicked a spoon at him he found that hilarious as well he got up coughing out an overflow of humor as he headed back on deck geena reached across the table and patted clytuss hand with a solemnity thaton hercould only be in jest im sure the wolves have never seen the likes of how an outer isle brigand tacks theyll wet themselves this sat a moment in the room before the dubious humor of it got melio wagging his head geena slid her chair toward his and leaned into his shoulder clytus began to explain that it was not just tacking he had in mind there was he stopped midsentence melio turned ready to nudge him back into it and feeling it best he get geenas head off his shoulder he caught sight of kartholome the man stood framed in the door the blood in his face had drained out of him right along with the good humor he had stepped out choking over his eyes searched the room without actually focusing on anyone geena started to say something stopped it was clytus who asked what kartholome said very softly come outside stepping from the dim passageway onto the deck melio thought a full moon must have risen so boneblue was the light a pungent scent invaded his nose it flared his nostrils as it pushed inside a sea stink so heavy he could barely breathe it as he stepped on the slick deck he heard the sound not silence anymore but a hushed slithering a moist friction of something all around the boat a wet sound like an enormous tongue licking his ear all of these at once then he saw what made the noise and the light and the smell the sea was in motion around them again only it was not the water that was moving chapter thirty when he learned what the task would entail tunnel chose his tools accordingly two mallets each of them rectangular blocks of solid steel with thick hardwood shafts wrapped with black leather leaving avina he carried one of them in each hand a feat that few could have managed and that strained even his brawny arms and shoulders he did not care he was in a bad mood and did not mind if it showed he did not like being sent away from skylene sick as she was nor did he plan to be away from the worsening turmoil of the city any longer than he had to but the lothan aklun relics were part of the dance of power at play in ushen brae now the league wanted them dukish wanted them they all wanted to use them to gain lothan aklun powers all except the free people who knew better if the messenger had found what he claimed to have found it needed to be dealt with fast before it fell into the wrong hands outside the gates of the southern end of the city a small party waited for him the vessel messenger himself three youths true to the free people and a man who had recently left the antok clans service this latter was the only one of questionable loyalty but he brought with him a prize that could not be ignoredone of this clans totem animals the antok was young half the size of an adult but it still stood a hulking bulk of muscle and hide and tusks the harness on its back was not the standard issueas usually younger antoks were not riddenbut was a crosshatch of thick leather cords and even thicker lengths of rope tunnel was not at all sure just how to mount it the antoks tender potemp convinced tunnel to secure his mallets along the beasts side so they dont brain anybody he said then he had each of them climb into the weight arrangement he thought best this put tunnel right atop the beasts shoulders if he had not been in such ill humor he might almost have enjoyed the vantage point it provided him as they set out at a canter tunnelwho was still a member of the antok clan even though he had broadened his allegiance to include all the free peoplehad never ridden one of the beasts upon whose form his own gray skin and prominent tusks were fashioned he rather liked the feel of it looking forward over the mounts coarse hide he watched the creatures tusk jut into and out of view as his head swayed back and forth with his strides he is strong like me he thought but young just a young one they made good time the first day seeing nobody on the road what a land this is tunnel observed so much of it empty of people we should change that it was not however empty of reminders of the civilization that had once thrived there the second day they traveled a section of old track called the bleeding road on each side erected at regular intervals stood the decrepit remains of the stakes the fumel clan had been impaled upon all of them every auldek of that clan for the crime of altering their quota slaves to look like them to be children instead of slaves the crime was a hard one for tunnel to wrap his mind around and the sight of stout spikes and the small piles of bones still at the bases of some of them half hidden among the weeds did not help auldek bones lasted a very long time strong as iron none of the small company chose to comment on the sights or the history behind them they reached the bank of the sheeven lek on the third morning a little farther downstream the river broke into the main channels of the delta but here it stretched wide before them at the full breadth of its single channel they turned upstream and reached the site by the middle of the day it was a lothan aklun structure all right that much was clear from the strangely organic shape of it the melding of the recognizable and the bizarre the building stood near the bank of the river shaded by trees but with a clear stretch of beach and a series of ramps leading from the water up to its riverfront side the beams of the frame looked to be thick tree trunks irregularly shaped and even knobbed at the base of choppedoff limbs all this was clear on the framework atop which the walls and roof of the place draped like a loose skin or so it looked from a distance as they stood warily contemplating it from up close the skinlike material was as solid as stone as smooth as glass and inside inside brought back memories that tunnel had not turned over in his mind for some time the white walls the slick floors the strange unnatural scent in the air the instrument panels levers and all manner of devices manylimbed things that stood like spiders dead spiders but ones that could spring to life at the touch of a lothan aklun hand tunnel tried to see only what was here unused and abandoned and powerless this was not a place he had ever been to it was larger with different instruments but the memories came anyway visions of that other place and of the things done to him with tools somehow kin to the ones here young tunnel having his tusks fused right into his skull the pain of it the utter calm in the face of the lothan aklun woman who worked over him nothing had ever frightened him more than that calm fortunately he was not a child anymore he slammed his two mallets down on their heads their shafts standing upright this is it then not so much to see the vessel messenger had widespaced eyes and the tattoos of the fru nithexek the sky bear he seemed nervous inside the building looking around as if he feared the old inhabitants might return at any moment it wasnt that id never heard of this place before i had you can see it from the river once i floated by in a shell from the sky isle but that was at night and the lothan aklun still worked the place with them around it was a place to avoid when i saw it this time though i knew things were different cant just leave it here for anybody to find anybody other than us you mean tunnel said he studied the panels and levers closely without touching them what does this place do as simple a question as it was none had a ready answer you dont know what it does the messenger walked in a nervous circle if you mean exactly what does it do i cant say but over therehe pointed toward the riverfront side of the structureare bays that open onto ramps that lead into the water a deep cove i think they built the soul vessels here or built them elsewhere and brought them here for servicing of some sort maybe they put the souls inside them here one of the youths said the rest let that sit untouched one of the other youths rubbed his nose potemp cleared his throat and looked at his feet yeah tunnel said sniffing the air this place doesnt smell good back up he bent his legs slightly gripped the shafts of the upright mallets his gray arms bulged as he raised them the striations of his forearms twitching with the effort back back the others retreated and he went to work he swung the mallets in wild arcs smashing the panels snapping levers clean off bits of the stonelike material flew in all directions twirling in the air and skittering across the floor like shards of glass the twoarmed attack was not easy but he kept at it for a time knowing the others were watching him in awe tunnel liked being strong might as well show it when the strain started to pain his shoulders he flung one of the mallets away he took the remaining one up in a twohanded grip just as impressive really as each blow now carried double the force the whole of his arms and massive back and stout legs combining to drive the steel where his mind willed it sometime later he paused he balanced the mallet upright and stood with his hand propped on the end of the shaft glistening with sweat heaving in great breaths he surveyed the damage he had done pretty good damage he thought to the watchers he said lets have a fire l ate the next day a league vessel made its appearance it slid silently atop the water cutting the current with its sleek lines effortless unnatural potemp had warning enough to move the antok well back into the woods out of hearing and sight and smell tunnel and the others watched the ship from the woods behind the burnedout shell of the demolished structure the ruins still smoked hot with glowing coals ishtat soldiers came ashore too many for them to confront staying hidden tunnel watched them kick through the ashes later a leaguemancone headed robed and unarmedcame across on a skiff and inspected the site it was not the same one who had ordered skylene shot if it had been nothing would have stopped tunnel from rushing him mallets swinging until he bashed the man to pulp he almost did so anyway but skylene had not sent him out to die hes a lucky one today that one tunnel thought we were just in time the messenger whispered just in time they stayed in hiding throughout the day watching by the time the last skiff had returned to the anchored vessel it was clear the leagueman had gained nothing after sunset tunnel and the others came down into the ruins carrying armfuls of branches they collected driftwood from the shore using a coal from the ruins they got a new fire going on the beach they fed it until it blazed and then proceeded to dance around it they shouted out toward the vessel seeing its deck brimming with onlookers they yelled taunts across the water at them declaring that this ruin was the work of the free people of ushen brae saying that this was their land and would be forever more the league would gain no footing here the people would not allow it and then with a flash of inspiration tunnel turned around shoved his thumbs inside the waist of his trousers and pulled them to his knees he waggled his bare bottom in the torchlight shouting over his shoulder instructions for what the leagueman could do with his ass the others did the same all of them offering their buttocks with rebellious glee leagueman tunnel yelled heres my ass heres tunnels ass i pinch it for you so saying he did so the others added their own takes on the theme they all howled with laughter so caught up in the moment that they retreated from the shore grudgingly and only after the rain of ishtat arrows shot from the boat became too heavy to chance further t unnel arrived back at the free peoples compound in the middle of the night without pausing to rest or even to wash the grime of his work and travel from his face he went to skylene her caretakers greeted him grimly at the door then stepped aside to let him visit her in solitude she lay as he had left her propped up on pillows with a blanket pulled up to her shoulders lowering himself softly to the edge of the bed he could smell the sickness on her it was there in the tang of her sweat in the spoiled scent of her sheets and in the fetid stench of the festering wound in her chest the crossbow bolt that sire lethel had so casually set in motion had punched right through her left breast ripping apart tissue fracturing a rib and leaving a dirty oilsmeared puncture wound that quickly turned bad he had looked upon it before he left he did not want to do so again skylene opened her eyes she smiled at him warmly enough that tunnel wondered if she was getting better but when her lips released the curve her face looked even more drawn lined and thin than before she asked did you destroy it her voice sounded dry tunnel poured from a pitcher of mint water on the bedside table he moved the glass toward her saying nah nah when she tried to take hold of it big armed and shouldered as he was with largeknuckled hands that made the glass seem a childs toy he touched the rim to her lips with delicacy he did not answer her question until after she had taken a few sips we did smashed it up good built a fire it was a fine show he detailed what they thought the relic was and told of their encounter with the league ship by the end he was on his feet his bottom pointed toward her as he repeated the taunts he had shouted over his shoulder it hurt skylene to laugh but she did so anyway are you getting better tunnel asked sitting beside her again skylene set a hand on top of his her touch was hot dry she meant it to be comforting but it felt wrong he felt the fever burning in her he almost pulled his hand away the others are looking after me they brought a healer from the kern clan she was very kind but her poultice had fennel seeds in them you know i cant stand the smell of it i wore it for a day but then she lifted her hand and gestured a vague motion that erased the very thing she was describing we should send a messenger to the elders he said to mor she would want to rush here to my side skylene shook her head no tunnel send no message none of them can help me either way why add to their distress mor left meand youto hold the city until she returned with the rhuin fa tunnel said nodding in acknowledgment of the fact that he had finished her sentence just as she had finished his a moment earlier but we have not done that here have we not our fault i know but dukish he is just a fool going to mess with everything that could be so simple and good how we going to know that before he show us it stupid man should have squashed him the first time skylene did not dispute it if you get another chance do squash him do it for me but otherwise stay alive for dariel be here when he arrives that should be within a fortnight what you know this nodding skylene said the vessel messenger who took you to the relic he came here with a message for me a message from yoen you didnt tell tunnel tunnel said managing to convey a depth of hurt in the short sentence no skylene smiled if i had you might not have taken those mallets to the relic you might not have shown the good sire your backside i needed you to act without distraction without waiting for your rhuin fa i was right wasnt i even a days delay would have whats the message then mor and the others are returning via the sheeven lek dariel is with them tunnel smiled this is news theres more the journey has been a success in many ways they all still live for one for another they visited the sky watcher na gamen blessed them all especially dariel thats right yoen said to expect dariel to look different he wears a sign on his forehead a spirit mark that combines his name with na gamens he is the rhuin fa tunnel leaned in close and whispered with passion he is i always told it didnt i skylene started to laugh but it pained her she choked it down of course you did tunnel you are the smartest of all of us the truest should we tell everyone no not yet skylene closed her eyes a moment her breathing shallow not yet he is not the rhuin fa until the people name him so we have all to do it understand not just na gamen the elders not just you and me everyone must do it and none who dont want to believe him are going to want to change not without seeing him for themselves we need to hold this news as long as we can until they are nearly here understand we use it to call a gathering but only at the last moment we dont want dukish or any of the others to have time to work against him all right yeah thats all right tunnelshe softened her voice rounded it and weighted it with importive told no body else about this if i that wont happen but if it does you shaking his head tunnel stood up nah wont happen you love mor too much to die youll still be lying here waiting for a kiss when she comes tunnel knows he glanced around you hungry he asked it casually tugging on a tusk as if he had nothing more on his mind than his stomach it was not true but he kept it up until he heard skylene breathe out the rest of the things she thought she needed to say to him once she did he pretended to wander away foraging in truth he stood at the far end of the room leaning against the wall and watching thinking youll still be here tunnel knows of course he does chapter thirtyone when asked to describe it dariel said he did not remember anything in truth he remembered his return from death with a clarity not of an experience passed but of one yet to come it went something like this for a time he was not a man at all he was a single bubbleone of infinite millions that pressed softly against himdislodged from the depths of an abyssal floor and rising through the black fathoms in which nothing at all lived he knew the entire time that he might pop at any moment might cease to be or be swallowed by some unliving mouth driven by unliving hunger suddenly roaring out of the black he would not have been able to explain that he became more and more terrified the closer he got to life nor would he ever try to describe that passing into life did not feel like surfacing or birth or waking it felt like smashing against a ceiling of black obsidian and vanishing and then he was a man he moaned the air out of his lungs lay empty for a moment and remembered to suck air back inside himself dariel a voice said he had a name he opened his eyes aniras brown visage looked down on him she ran her hands over his face and neck and chest dariel by anet and her young i thought you were dead they said you would come back but i feared she leaned over him and kissed him and then as if sensing that her relief may have been premature she grasped him by the shoulders can you hear me are you all right he was not ready to commit just yet his eyes darted about the small tidy room they were alone he lay on a cot anira sat on a stool beside it an intricate openwork band ran around the wall at eye level through it came the sounds of the village people talking a dog barking chickens clucking their singsong rumination on the world he could have stepped to the screen and looked through but the sound made him hesitate it was too mundane to be trusted what happened you dont remember no but saying it he did he had come to meet the elders he had gone to embrace yoen and he propped himself on one elbow and clawed his tunic up with his other hand he ran a palm over his abdomen searching for the wound he knew should be there his skin was smooth ridged with his muscles and curled with light hairs there was a knife he said but there was no knife not anymore not sticking out of his belly nor leaving any trace that one ever had he tried to kill me you saw it no he didnt anira said he stabbed me he clutched his abdomen for proof but again his body denied him i mean he tried to what happened hell explain anira stood and stepped back from him looking him up and down first get ahold of yourself were on the sky isle in elder yoens village youre not dead not even hurt tell me you dont feel stronger than ever before you look it and you have this she reached for his forehead her touch felt strange he felt the pressure of her fingers but not the sensation of her skin against his pulling back she indicated that he should feel for himself reluctantly he did so a section of his flesh was rough beneath his fingertips raised and hard like a scab is there a mirror anira looked around a moment twisted away and came back rubbing the curve of a metal saucer the image dariel saw reflected in it was distorted and blurry he squinted one eye and studied what he saw there for a long time a rune of some sort a character in a language he could not read drawn in short assured swipes as if by an ink brush black against his beige skin a black so solid that the shivith spots underneath the symbol did not show through it what in the givers name is that he demanded feeling curiosity more than rage but letting anger drive his words anyway your destiny your name come meet yoen again hell explain everything to you yoen said to not him dariel sat up he swung his legs over the cot and drove his feet down against the floor standing upright so quickly made his head swim not though his eyes did not close the world went black t he second time dariel awoke he took care to sit up slowly this time there was more than one face to take in anira perched on the edge of the cot down near his knees her hands clasped around one of his tam and birke stood against the wall the latter flashed his canine smile when dariels eyes passed over him mor was saying something to a whitehaired matron with shivith clan spots on her face like mors like his he remembered even as his gaze moved he knew that they had yet to settle on the person they must he felt the presence beside him sitting where anira had sat before he wished for anger as he shifted his gaze to the old man wished for anger and prepared for fear and felt neither yoens expression of sad joy was etched in every crevice of his features his eyelids drooped at the outer edges giving his face an almost puppylike softness he said something his voice kind as he leaned forward dariel did not understand it and the old man realized as much forgive me he said when i forget myself i speak auldek mor teases me for it dont you dearest what she doesnt know is that it embarrasses me that the language of my enslavers comes faster to my mouth than the one of my native land but were not here to speak about me i should explain to you what happened do you want to hear it now or should we wait until you feel stronger lying there feeling weak and yet refreshed at the same time with the memory of death so near him still dariel knew there were a variety of things he could say in response angry things defiant and accusatory and indignant ones he just could not remember what they might be instead he said i want to know now of course you do yoen smiled a quick grin full of large teeth so healthy that they seemed mismatched with his elderly face all right ill tell you a brief version of it we can talk more later but you should understand this much you died he did not smile again though the pronouncement had the ring of a jokes revelation and then again you didnt dariel just stared at him the sky watcher na gamen did something to you didnt he he told you things and showed you things and he did something else what was it you mean the blessing is that how you think of it the old man said something else which at first dariel did not catch and then he did yes tell me of the blessing yoen had said he dariel stopped realizing that he wanted to know where the sentence was going before he began it what was the blessing a small thing compared to the wonders that na gamen had showed him yet it was this that came to mind he could think of nothing else in answer to the question he and he had to pause again the thing on his forehead the rune raised out of his skin he felt like he should understand before he spoke but it was not working that way it was hard to get his tongue around the words he wrote upon my forehead with a stylus of sorts a lothan aklun thing yes he did yoen said dariel reached as if to touch it again but let his fingers just hover near it it wasnt like this he wrote but there was nothing no ink or he was not writing with ink dariel akaran he was writing with his life soul he wrote with the energy that was his true being his first the soul he was born with he put that into you through that stylus he asked something very precious of you dariel he asked that you carry him here to be killed so that in dying he might join with you thats what he did it was something different from what they did with the soul catcher this time it wasnt really you who died and it wasnt really na gamen it was a little bit of both of you you are now both yourself and him he gave you the knowledge that you will need to fulfill the destiny written in this character i imagine his soul is very strong older and larger than a normal persons you have more than a normal measure of life within you the old man reached out and touched the raised symbol this will be hard to understand so dont try to there is more to it i believe but thats for you to figure out in time right now well you already know more than you realize listen to the words i am speaking do you hear them you do yes dariel nodded without breaking eye contact with him yoen asked mor what language have i been speaking since i began explaining the blessing auldek and what language did he speak in response auldek dariel looked at her she stood straight and beautiful her face as astonished as he had ever seen it the others as well they all stared at him with gravity enough that he almost believed them but i dont know auldek he said considering that you are speaking it yoen said i think you do i think you will come to realize you know many things that you did not before nowhe looked around squinteyed as if he had forgotten his spectacles someplace and was looking for themi should show you the village and show the village you come walk with me as improbable as it seemed even as it happened dariel rose he set his feet more carefully this time and stood with aniras aid she led him past the others and out into a humid overcast morning it looked just as it had sounded from inside the small room a village among the trees with the peak of the volcano rising to the west small cabins simply made from the slim purpleskinned trees of the area hardpacked dirt lanes running through them as they stepped into the light a gaggle of hens scattered from the cluster they had formed at the door eavesdroppers the people in the street stopped what they were doing as if their labors had been but an excuse to position themselves to see dariel step out among them they wore peasant clothes brighter hued than what he would have expected in the known world but similar in their simple functional construction two old men a woman with gray hair tied back another who wore lvin whiskers tattooed on her cheeks several others of middle age with varying clan markings a boy of twelve or so stood entrapped within the wooden framework of some tool he had been carrying it but he froze and just stood gaping just like the rest just like dariel himself cashen came bounding into view his nose held high and his tail whirling in circles he caught sight of dariel dropped the stick he was carrying and sprinted toward him bashar was not far behind t hat was what four five days ago dariel was not sure he was not yet free of the vision of death he had awoken with so that each time he burst back into consciousness he was unsure for a time whether he was truly alive he knew he had slept and woken several times but the waking hours of each day were something of a blur a strange blur quiet instead of noisy a blur of faces seeking out his face touching his forehead and speaking their names to him a blur of conversations questions asked and answered which led to new questions to be asked and answered the days passed as if disconnected from normal time dariel knew that was not really so it was wishful thinking he was not with na gamen anymore behind the peaceful workings of his days in the village he knew the world went on this reprieve was to be brief so on whatever day this wasthe fourth or fifth among the free people hidden on the sky isle deep within ushen braedariel stood sharing a long silence with yoen they had climbed out of the village and were taking in the settlement from a bend on the path that led up to the pear and apple orchards do you see that tree there in the center of that clearing yoen asked dariel saw it not as tall as the trees that grew around the base of the volcanos rich slopes it had a gnarled aged quality to its twisting limbs which stretched wider than it was tall it looks like an acacia tree except that they dont grow that large here they do yoen said its a very ancient tree its sacred to us na gamen himself planted it there from a cutting taken from the original it is as you say an acacia tree another transplant to this land yes he lifted his cane he speared the ground ahead of him and began his slow ascent again dariel knew him well enough to know that was all he had to say on the subject of the tree he walked taking in the view the village was such a small part of it dwarfed by the trees that hung over it and the volcano and the rolling landscape that hulked off to the west the peaks of rath batatt were hazy shapes in the distance id expected there to be more of you dariel said he spoke auldek he believed it now he could switch between it and acacian with complete fluency the word structures and grammatical rules were vastly different but both languages were equally clear to him neither one more or less foreign than the other mor made it seem like like id find a paradise of free people thriving out here is that not what you see in a manner of speaking i guess mor sees not just what is but what she hopes will be the two live in her at once give her purpose you must consider this when you speak with her but no we are not numerous dariel if we were the auldek might have had cause to destroy us that was why we split into smaller villages spread out along the rim of the mountains did they attack you often years ago they hunted us for sport but they grew tired of that over the centuries many of us were unwanted anyway to beings enslaved by their immortality the aged are no welcome sight we make them uneasy we remind them of themselves you saw all the gray hairs in the company and fewer teeth than our numbers might suggest in contradiction to this yoen smiled what immortally young person would want us around youre not all old oh not all no no some of the young ones the auldek deemed defective for some reason not many but occasionally the aklun missed a frailty of mind or body and some suffered injuries not easily healed ones like that the auldek did not concern themselves with if they disappeared ive lived these many years not sure what the auldek think of us look at these here the elder exclaimed he careened off the path at what seemed a dangerous burst of speed into an orchard of manicured trees that hung heavy with fruit the size of these arent they beauties dariel admitted to never having seen pears so large he had to cup one in a twohanded grip to tug it free yoen was more selective dariel watched him sort through the branches testing different fruit beneath the pressure of his thumb the season is perfect for them mor will like these i think she could have walked with us dariel said except that she cant stand to be around me i thought she had softened after i helped destroy the soul catcher she seems to have forgotten all about that yoen looked at him for a long moment its not a matter of hatred she fears you she wants desperately to believe you are the rhuin fa she wants you to help us make this nation of ours and she hates it that she wants that so much she has waited all her life for this never knowing if change would come in her lifetime now it has and part of it arrives bearing the name akaran a prince of the very family that enslaved us you can see her point i trust it would have been easier for many of us to recognize the rhuin fa if he arrived with akaran blood on his hands finding a pear that suited him yoen grasped it in his palms and gave a quick tug the fruit held on stubbornly but the shaking of the branch dropped another one softly into the grass yoen smiled down at it this one doesnt want me that one does i can take a hint dariel moved as he began to bend retrieving the fallen fruit for him thank you yoen said taking it a little farther up the hill the two men moved off the trail and sat down on simple stools with a treestump table between them yoen sliced the fruit with agile motions of a slim knife the skin of the fruit was brilliant yellow smooth to the touch and the flesh inside had a pinkish hue dariel its a miracle that any of the people remain whole they were taken as children you know that of course but can you imagine what it means for an entire nation to share a common trauma all of us whether we are now young or old all of us were made orphans all of us were taught we were slaves to the whims of the world it may be that all people are that but most dont learn it at seven eight years old birke and anira came up the trail dariel nodded to them they saw him but did not return the gesture they stayed near the path yoen went on so what would happen to a nation of people deprived of the love of their parents if nobody taught them morality what sort of adults would they become what if their captors told them time and again that they deserved their slaverythat they caused it somehow or that their parents sold them or simply gave them away a child can believe great lies especially the ones that hurt him you see the problem yes dariel conceded he felt sick to his stomach unable to eat the fruit yoen had sectioned for him yes tam and several of the elders also came into view behind them mor walked by herself her head averted as if she did not want to make eye contact with anyone dariel almost said something but from the determined way yoen managed not to acknowledge them he knew he should not as the elder talked on several more of the villagers and a few elders just arrived from fartherflung settlements joined the procession each of us had to reckon with the fate the giver abandoned us to so iand many generations before medid what we could to remain whole we had to invent a semblance of a nurturing culture by trial and error we treat one another with compassion we teach the young that they are loved that the world has done them a great wrong but they own no fault for it we tell them stories dream with them of a better world we ask them to believe in the possibility of a hero a champion mor and the others think that the elders have organized resistance and prepared them for the fight facing us we have helped with that yes but the young own that more than we no our true work for many generations has been in teaching the young how to grow into human beings it hasnt been easy we havent always succeeded we can only do so much from here but weve done our best i want you to understand that do you dariel nodded following yoens example he did not watch as the others moved from the path and proceeded toward them i think so i in my own way i was an orphan too i had to learn how to be a man from people other than my family or siblings i understand the gift that is im glad to hear you say so im afraid i dont have any more time to explain it even if i needed to the other elders think ive taken too long with you already has anyone spoken to you about the news from avina the last messenger brought much news none of it good confusion the people breaking into factions the league crawling over lothan aklun sites like scavengers the unity that kept us tight around a single cause broke apart when the auldek left we out here are not powerful enough to control the people in avina we need them united with us not as enemies but you knew that already didnt you we are walking on the sand when the tide has drawn out the moment wont last the wave will come crashing in soon dont you agree he did even though he had not spent as much time thinking of avina as he should he did agree he had seen enough of war and of power struggles to know that the paradise mor so wanted would not come easily he could not help glancing at her she stood a little distance away one of the loose circle that surrounded yoen and him her gaze was on him frank and at the same time unreadable yes he said answering yoens question good yoen said then you will understand that we must move swiftly now dariel had i my way you and i would spend many more days talking and walking in these orchards seeing as how i killed you i feel some obligation to explain more about what youve become after that death i cannot have my way on that i cant explain more because i dont know any more what you are to be to yourselfand to usyou must figure out yourself and as time is short i must put all other things aside to ask you a question more than just a question really ask it dariel thought ask it he had his answer ready yoen straightened and looked around at the gathered company finally taking them all in i dont just ask for me of course its for all of us yes dariel said but i have not asked it yet my answer is yes dariel looked from face to face around the circle at friends he felt he knew well and others he had only just met it didnt matter that he had not known any of them a few months ago or that he didnt know exactly what yoen was going to ask it didnt even matter that yoen had thrust a knife into his belly if anything that act had just brought dariel closer to them he had already decided for each of them he had the same answer yes and then a question of his own when do we start chapter thirtytwo h igh high above looking down at the patchy view allowed through the layers of clouds mena and elya flew the length of the invading army the auldek force crawled across the frozen world a slowmoving stain on the white landscape with wheeled structures the size of large buildings dots that were people and numerous animals of varying sizes beasts she feared would be entirely new to the known world the trail of trodden snow and debris that marked their progress stretched behind them in a wavering line that had no end she and elya turned and circled back i didnt want to believe it mena said more to herself than to elya who sailed on her wingbeats a steady rhythm all the time and training the work of opening tahalian hearing the scavs story beneath it all i still hoped it was for nothing that possibility had just ended the tiny figures below her which were as small as ants from her height confirmed this she felt uneasy above them it was unlikely that any would see her hidden as she was among the banks of cloud the gray sky dull above her still she felt watched each time she passed through a clear patch she remembered to keep her eyes scanning the air around her if the auldek really did have flying creatures she saw no sign of them she tried to estimate their numbers she could not do so with precision thousands tens of thousands enough to fill the calathrock with more to spare enough to fill all mein tahalian she wondered how many of them were auldek and if it was true as the league had claimed that they carried extra lives within them making them almost impossible to kill she circled a third time aware that she was delaying but also using the extra moments to plan her next move and what might that be what if she flew down and landed in the middle of the war column announcing herself with one of maebens screams or she could touch down before the army and brew a pot of tea as she waited for them to draw up to her she rather liked that idea let them see she had a sense of humor let them know that acacia was not afraid of them only that would not be true and she was not confident she could pull the deception off no she would do no more than spy on them and then turn south bearing news of them lets make this quick she said patting elya on the shoulder lets go lower we might as well get a good look corinn will complain if we dont elya adjusted the tilt of her wings they dropped through the bank of cloud mena was still not used to the sensation the material of the clouds looked so tangible thick and almost solid as if they should be able to land atop it instead it turned to wet vapor before their touch mena licked it from her lips and tried to ignore the chill bite it was so near to freezing that for a few moments she leaned her face against elyas neck feeling her warmth coating her cheeks with the lemony scent of elyas oils mena had just straightened to check their position when without warning elya corkscrewed in the air it was so fast that menas head snapped to the side elya she called from upside down her hands grasping for purchase as she slipped partway out of the harness elya what the thing hit them with incredible force it impacted from above driving elya downward she and elya twirled as they plummeted the air a roar around them each cloud hit them with physical force as if they were smashing again and again through a body of water mena thought i knew it the clouds are firm they have substance but it was the briefest of thoughts gone in an instant something fell with them some sort of beast that mena only caught glimpses of it bellowed and grunted elya hissed in response the two of them struggled clasped together and fighting it was larger than elya hairless and thickly muscled with enormous wings it had a flat face that looked vaguely like an apes and a mouth of incisors that once came close enough to snap at the princess it was all bulk and weight compared to elyas sinewy length it wore a chain about its neck thick and decorative with a large amulet dangling from it elya kicked the beast away it came back a moment later lashing with a closed fist that smashed the side of elyas head all three of them somersaulted wildly mena caught a glimpse of the invading army below them so near then she lost all sense of direction dizzied by the spinning confused by the flapping of wings and the roars of the attacking creature she knew the ground rushed up to them she tried to connect with elya but her fight was too frantic all mena could do was hang on then the monster released them it broke free at the last moment using the force of their tumbling to send mena and elya hurtling for the icy ground elya flared her wings enough to slow them a little but still they landed hard just missing the rear of one rolling structure and crashing down on the trodden tundra the impact snapped one of the buckles on elyas harness mena twisted off to one side one leg loose in the straps and the other pinched painfully by them the flying monster roared in just behind them touching the ground for a second and then leaping up it thrashed its massive arms in threat gnashed the air with its teeth grinned at them bugeyed and crazed mena tried to keep an eye on it as she scrabbled to get her seat back but she was so tangled and elya was moving and hissing so fiercely that she could not keep track of the creature beyond it another of the rolling structures moved toward them coming on like a fortress on wheels mena clamped down as best she could half in her harness a clump of elyas skin and feathers gripped savagely in one hand fly she thought just then another beast announced itself it slashed at elya before crashing to the ground it danced away a few steps then skirted them drawing up opposite the other of its kind it came back toward them snarling crouched on its hind legs like the first it was naked except for a thick chain and medallion on its neck snug against the muscled flesh fly mena commanded another skimmed elyas head as it landed and another each time elyas muscles tensed to leap a beast dropped from above others now beat the air above them in among the bestial cries came a human voice it spoke guttural words that mena could not understand then she picked him out an auldek rode strapped to the back of one of the hovering monsters he was directing the others perhaps his commands were the only thing stopping the beasts from ripping into them his mount landed among the others shouldering its way savagely to clear a space for itself a moment later the rider sprang to the ground he shouted something and gestured as he walked toward mena and elya the monsters rose bellowed and stomped and then leaped one after another into the air as the creatures lifted the view they had hidden snapped into place mena saw soldiers coming in from all directions the war column slowed fitfully to a halt armed furcovered shapes poured out of hastily thrownopen hatches steam billowing as they emerged still others flowed between the structures mena half thought the fly command but the winged monsters circled above she stroked elyas neck and soothed her the mount did not settle her crest feathers made a jagged crown her serpentine neck coiled and vicious mena kept whispering to elya as she pulled free of her buckles and slid down to the ground her left leg throbbed but she did not betray it she took a few steps forward stood straight with her shoulders back she tugged the mitten from her sword hand and took hold of the hilt of the kings trust she waited like that as the enemy army crowded around her steady elya she said to the invaders she called i am princess mena akaran of acacia i speak for the queen who speaks for you they barely acknowledged that she had said anything they inched closer pushed in as more arrived they spoke among themselves in their own guttural tongue the sounds were like threats and accusations animal and wild spoken from furred tall beings most hooded against the cold their faces hidden from the dull winter light they were not all auldek mena could see humans among themmany in factbut they spoke and gestured with a fierceness akin to their masters elya spread her wings the crowd only swayed back a moment and the flying beasts nipped from above forcing her to fold in the uproar died down when several new arrivals pushed to the edge of the circle a man stepped out in front of the others followed by a woman nearly his height he was tall like most numrek but when he pushed back his hood mena saw that his hair was auburn thick and long he ran his fingers through it to loosen it and then set his intense gaze on mena he carried a sheathed long sword in one bigknuckled hand but he showed not the slightest intention of drawing it the woman wore no headgear her dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail her cheekbones high and distinctive their features were not so physically dissimilar from that of the numrek mena had known but the demeanor behind them was different calmly intelligent at ease in a manner no numreks had ever been auldek mena thought not numrek as if to verify this calrach appeared behind the man the numreks face was a blunt twist of angry surprise akaran he said his accent thick with disgust you stupid bitch mena shifted her posture ready to draw her sword princess mena another voice said in clear acacian this time a man squirmed between the two warriors and stood beside the auldeks shoulder despite the fantastic strangeness of it mena recognized him immediately rialus neptos is it really you by the giver the auldek snapped at him in his language yes yes rialus sputtered he switched to the foreign tongue mena understood none of it save when he said her name the auldeks eyes widened at it his interest gaining substance the womans in contrast narrowed princess rialus said what are you doing here elya hissed and snapped at one of the flying creatures looking up mena said tell them to call those things off i cant talk with them above us oh yes the freketes rialus said they are vile ill ask howlk to call them back he spoke auldek to the man who had been riding one of the creatures the auldek man looked up bemused as if he had not noticed the circling monsters it was the woman who barked a command several others picked it up noisy moments passed but eventually the freketes flew away most came to rest at vantage points on the now still carriage buildings attention back on her mena cleared her throat she released her sword hilt considering how outnumbered she was gripping it could show weakness instead of strength she tried to find a different place for her hand to settle she kept the focus of her eyes deliberate her gaze on rialus on the auldek directly in front of her rialus neptos she said we must do this correctly introduce me to them and them to meif these be their monarchs oh they dont have monarchs rialus said clan chieftains yes but thats not the same as the auldek man nudged him if mena had not been so tense she might have been amused even if he could not understand acacian the auldek knew a neptos ramble gaining speed when he heard one rialus spoke numrekauldek mena correctedagain a few moments later he turned back to mena they understand who you are this man is devoth of the clan lvin this woman is sabeer his wife they are like monarchs in a way there are chieftains from other clans as well though its complicated you see there are devoth clicked his tongue rialus spoke rapidly yes yes you can speak to them there are no higher among them what of you mena asked can i trust you to speak my words as i say them you have betrayed your country after all rialus looked stricken no never i am a prisoner among them he said this last with his voice slightly lowered a strange action for it was still easy enough for the others to hear i am faithful the queen can be assured of it tell her that if you get back to her ii always work to deter them its not easy though no i dont imagine so mena pursed her lips what choice did she have but to use this man as her translator tell him i speak for the empire of acacia and for all the known world by queen corinns charge i demand to know their purpose here isnt it obvious calrach said gesturing around him see with your eyes rialus mena asked jutting her chin at the numrek chieftain has this one any status here rialus considered shrugged not much good then tell him to shut his mouth he has no status in acacia either no status no kin they are all dead you lie mena crossed her arms as he spoke i killed the assassins sent to slay prince aaden myself we butchered greduc and codeth in the carmelia my marah and i cut them to pieces i wish you had been there to see do not believe her devoth calrach said my clan is in a fortress that cannot be taken they await word of us to begin a new slaughter he seemed to catch late that he was speaking acacian he switched to his own tongue that plug of stone in teh that was no protection corinn called crannag to the field and used her sorcery against them they all died calrach your clan is no more you lie calrach spat he stepped toward her mena backed up her hand on her sword devoth slammed an arm against the numreks chest stopping him he demanded a translation from rialus after it he responded through rialus if what you say is true i am filled with happiness he misunderstands me mena said queen corinns powers are unmatched she killed all the numrek and she will do the same to you if you continue into our lands she sent me to tell you to turn around she sent me so you know her conviction tell him so that he understands before rialus could begin devoth said this time speaking heavily accented acacian i understand rialus turned and gazed at him stunned i know your tongue i once had thoughts to know your country i learned your talking from the divine children i asked them about your people they could tell little though they were children only always children i grew bored and forgot much years long back he grinned as you can see i have found interest again for the first time the crowd was hushed to real silence i understand what you say devoth said its good what you say calrach tried to speak devoth ignored him the numrek are the numrek he gestured with his fingers trying to find the words to explain himself his fingers opened as if they were dropping something inconsequential dust that could be blown away on the breeze it is good to hear that your queen defeats them a better foe for us then mena was speechless unsure how to respond it was not just what he said that unnerved her it was the undisguised confidence with which he said it not bravado not arrogance not foolery just what else do you want to say to us rialus translate so that all can hear i she hesitated and then had an idea she spoke so that her voice would carry i see you have humans among you the queen wants them to know that we have no quarrel with them we would welcome them back to acacia free citizens of wherever they choose to live they need not fight for their enslavers anymore devoth listened both to mena and to the conclusion of rialuss translation he looked around content to let the offer sink in to all who heard it that is a clever idea but you have it wrong your queen may have no quarrel with them but they have a quarrel with her you sold them as children we raised them as slaves what do you know about it we raised them we gave them clans to belong to we taught them a way to belong you made them slaves no you made them slaves we made them our children as fast as devoths temper flared he reined it in with a calm assured voice he said we have already made a pledge to them after they help us defeat you they will all be free to do as they wish they will be slaves no longer and wenot youwill be the ones who freed them if what i have said is not true anyone may say so now the silence that followed was interrupted only by the grunts and chatter from the freketes no one spoke eventually mena said i have said what i came to say you will find no numrek waiting for you if you fight us we will destroy you just as we did them and we will not make these offers again if you turn now we will not pursue you turn now let us forget each other devoth shrugged if you are done would you stay long enough to eat with us what to eat the auldek scooped imaginary food into his mouth you are safe with us come eat have a drink rest before you go home mena realized that sometime in the last few minutes fear had drained out of her confidence with it and purpose she tried to pull it back into her voice i will not offer you peace like this again good devoth answered your peace is nothing to talk about vapor its talking about the wind you can hear it you can see that it shakes the trees but you can never grasp hold of it better to leave it you will not stay with us mena shook her head dine with them no that seemed a horrible idea worse than fighting them all she could not have said why the prospect chilled her so completely thats not what i came for you came to spy devoth said cocking an eyebrow at her isnt that so you didnt come to threaten us if you did you did not come well prepared the auldek woman sabeer muttered something in her tongue a few grunted agreement some laughed what did she say mena asked rialus sputtered a moment before saying i had told her of your life previouslythat you were a great warrior sheshe finds that hard to believe now that she sees you if she wishes a test she may have it mena said rialus frowned i wont tell her that why not tell her princess youve not seen how they fight ive killed numrek tell her that these are not numrek sabeer is enough devoth said do not be women dont die on sabeers point he paused a hand raised in mock concession to menas snarl or dont kill my dear wife no use in that be a messenger for us princess mena akaran you will yes take this message the auldek come for your lands we come for slaughter he broke out of acacian and shouted something in his own tongue by the way the throng yelled in response mena knew he was translating his words he turned back to her this has been amusing but if you will not eat and drink with us go go now fly home tell your queen our nations are at war again he turned and barked his translation again the crowd exploded in enthusiasm mena felt elya at her back for the first time she realized how much the creature had surrounded her her wings tented in a protective manner i would speak to rialus neptos in private she was not sure what she had to say to him but thought she should try perhaps he would have something to offer the chieftain weighed this you can but i would have to cut his tongue out first he gestured toward the dagger on his belt and waggled his tongue and then grew serious he would be of little use empty of words if you wish though he pulled the blade free and made to grab rialus with his other hand no mena said i will take your message back do i have safe leave from here she indicated the flying beasts perched on the wagons devoth grinned shoving the dagger home and nudging rialus playfully you do calrach growled something close to the chieftains ear devoth flicked him away with his fingers he said something softly in auldek rialus translated it as fly safe princess fly true make your world ready for us turning from him mena slipped under the canopy of elyas upraised wing she climbed into the saddle slipped her legs into the harness and fastened it the auldek waited in near silence the freketes cried out holding some fragmented conversation among themselves eyes on elya sabeer said something to her pointing a long finger at her as she did so she says she will see you in battle devoth said acting as translator tell her i will kill her then they spoke a moment and then devoth guffawed she says which of her souls will you kill she has many within her as elya rose on her bunched hind legs mena said all of them ill take all of them elya leaped her wings flared and they were in flight beating hard to rise above the raucous freketes who trailed snarling behind them for a time chapter thirtythree t he morning of his coronation aliver was up before the dawn he watched the coming day lighten into a dull drizzly morning not an auspicious start a little later the day remembered color the rain slowed stopped and patches of sky broke up the cloud cover for a midwinter day it was quite mild corinn no doubt would call the weather perfect what better way to welcome a new monarch than with a world glistening wet beneath shafts of eager sunlight without even talking to herwithout needing to hear her say ithe would think of it that way too that was how it was between them two minds one mind he knew he had not always felt that way about her but he could not remember what it was he had felt instead this must be a good thing though it certainly seemed like it they were doing right acting bravely making decisions for the empire there were coming trials to face yes a foul invasion that they would have to meet with force but how could any ragtag group of brutes stumble out of the ice fields and expect to defeat corinns magic menas sword alivers joyful masses there was the fact that dariel had been lost in a distant land but he might be found corinn would remind him of that nothing was certain yet until it was live with hope remember corinn had told him that only he had walked through death and returned only he she and he had done that together and now they would rule together the nation was on the cusp of a mighty change they were creating it and it was good though he could not remember the exact details he knew that in his earlier life leadership had sat much more heavily on him no longer now he had only to think of a fear to have it swept away by confidence reason purpose when a servant opened his door and slipped inside to wake him aliver stood from the window seat and waved at the young man you wouldnt expect me to sleep late on my coronation day would you your highness the servant said by way of answering a quick bow as he did so eyes pinned to the floor he asked are you ready for your bath its all prepared with all the special oils and fragrances for the day aliver watched him a hint of frustration rising at the sight of his deferential posture he almost instructed the man to raise his head and stand straight what had this man ever seen him do that had instilled such subservience in him nothing and in that case the respect was not true it was an act a delusion in talay when he was a young man he had no servants men and women and children old and young alike could talk to him as an equal and yet somehow honor him by doing so in talay he had slain a laryx and earned his tuvey band he could run from sunrise to sunrise without pause he had been a warrior and an entire army had watched him slip beneath the belly of a raging antok and slice it end to end many had real reasons to honor him what reason did this man have before the question was completed he already heard corinns inevitable answer rising in him all those things were still true she would say for all those deeds and many more he had earned the reverence of the entire empire this man need not have stood beside him in battle to believe him a warrior or have witnessed any of the things for which he was famed that would be impossible and it would deny this man the prize of serving a king for him that was a great boon his bowed head said as much a good king lets a servant be a servant as quickly as she spokeor as he spoke to himself with her confident voicehe was reassured yes ill bathe now he said to the obvious relief of the waiting servant so he set off for his first official duty that morning with the servant trailing him through the hallways he stripped naked before attendants who acted as if he were not naked or as if his nakedness were nothing to take notice of he submerged himself up to the neck in hot water and sat there as sachets of oilsoaked herbs bobbed around him his toenails and fingernails were snipped the soles of his feet scrubbed his entire body massaged with warm oil that was kneaded into his skin by skilled fingers he stood swaying as several towels dried him and stayed standing as another contingent of servants swept in with his apparel for the first half of the day thus the king to be acted like the king to be when he emerged in the central courtyard of the royal residential grounds aaden ran to meet him aliver look at all the boats its unbelievable how many there are more than yesterday come look aliver let himself be tugged toward the terrace railing smiling at a contingent of agnates fresh in from alecia they would want to greet him he knew but he had made so much small talk with so many vacuous aristocrats the last week that he welcomed any excuse to put them off he grasped the weathered stone aaden beside him pointing the boy need not have for the sight could not be missed the sea around the isle of acacia did not sparkle glassy blue or green under the shafts of sunlight instead an enormous undulating blanket had been cast over the water a quilt sewn of boats all sizes and shapes flying flags from every portion of the known world it was amazing beautiful not just in appearance but in terms of what it meant have they all come for you aaden asked i didnt know there were that many boats in the whole world there are more than this even aliver said as youll see on your coronation if they keep coming one will be able to walk from here right across the sea to the mainland hopping from boat to boat that would be fun aliver agreed that it would be today will be good wont it aaden he said turning his full smile on the boy today is the beginning of a new age thats what mother says shes right as if to demonstrate this a shadow passed over them with it a whoosh of air that ripped exclamations from everyone on the terraces thais flew by the creatures wings beat once and then she glided in a curve out over the bay her rider dram sat small on her back a few moments later kohlflying riderlesssailed into view from the other direction cries echoed up from the lower town climbing the terraced levels as others joined in aliver could not make out words in the chanting but he knew the tenor of it euphoria joy awe when pos black form surged up from below the railing having skimmed so close to the cliffside that he only appeared at the last moment aliver turned his gasp into a shout as well they were mighty elyas children they were mighty but when he turned to aaden he drew back unsure how to read the boys face there was a tremor of excitement in it yes but it edged more toward fear than joy aaden are you all right the boy looked sheepish do you think they are good good that they are good things before i knew they were when they were elyas children he glanced behind him he leaned toward his uncle and whispered i dont like them as i did before mother made them dragons but they werent dragons before they were something else something wonderful i havent told mother but i dont like them now dont tell her please dont she is so proud of them while the boy spoke aliver agreed with him completely he was saying things that aliver himself had thought but had forgotten hearing them brought it all back hadnt he said the same before hadnt he cautioned corinn about squeezing the gentleness out of them no he realized he hadnt he would have to take the matter up with corinn these thoughts were clear in his head only for as long as his nephew spoke after that they vanished when aliver went to respond he said aaden people will remember this day for ages that was true wasnt it they would and that was wonderful for ages aaden and you were here to see it but the boy began dragons over acacia as he swept his arm through the air he caught sight of rhrenna and several of her assistants who had just mounted the main staircase she stood looking around for a moment until she saw him she gave some direction to her assistants and then to his delight left them and started toward him she looked luminescent her dress was slimfitting yellow velvet cuffed high on the arms and cut low in the front it had very few frills and yet it managed to look elegantly formal her golden hair flowed in wavy locks below her shoulders he had not seen her wear it down before hed had no idea it was so long and thick really he was not sure he had ever truly studied her before here you are she said grasping him by the arm as if he might dash away youre not to be out of my sight a minute more the queens orders rhrenna you look lovely has anyone told you that today color instantly flushed her cheeks drawing two curves that traced from her cheeks to her jawline that was fetching too and why had he not noticed how delicately drawn the lines of her lips were they sparkled with some cosmetic but like her dress this only highlighted what was already there not yet today she answered youre the first thank you aliver she told aaden his mother would be arriving in just a moment she asked him to give aliver and her a minute alone in the meantime the boy hardly noticed transfixed by the sight of the dragons skimming above the masts of the largest ships a few steps down the terrace rhrenna said i have foul tidings and i would like to say them quickly its word from calfa ven about wren shes taken ill aliver pulled out of her grasp but rhrenna moved with him as quick as a dance partner he felt the press of her small breasts against his upper arm he tried not to be distracted by them is it serious im afraid so the physician doesnt know whats wrong for sure but it may be the return of a contagion she caught in her youth something tropical you see from when she was a brigand thats not unheard of im afraid it puts the baby in jeopardy as well who is caring for her we should send physicians from here the queen has seen to it that wren has the best care possible have no fear on that count and dont for yourself let it spoil this day thats why corinn asked me to tell you quickly and assure you that if she can be saved she will be we however have to proceed with the day its all tightly scheduled as you know oh theres corinn now his sister strode before a buzzing swarm of attendants senators and guests surprisingly barad the lesser walked at her elbow his large head tilted to hear whatever the queen was saying aliver parted his lips as they drew near intending to ask corinn about wren but she spoke first doesnt rhrenna look charming aliver aliver could not help but turn and study the woman again very much so rhrenna said something about being a stray dog beside a fox in corinns company but aliver could see no reason for her modesty and said so one of the agnates behind corinn piped up in agreement just a different sort of canine if you dont mind me saying so an arctic fox thats it though not so fluffy no need to compare us the queen said rhrenna is a beauty in her own right aliver sees it dont you yes aliver said i do corinn beckoned aaden to her side she touched barad on the shoulder dragging her fingers down his arm languidly as if stroking a cat barad just gave the most rousing speech in the lower town didnt you barad smiled i am most pleased by the reception youre an asset to us aliver said meaning it convinced of it nobody understands the people as you do thank you your majesty barad closed his stone eyes for a moment those eyes aliver thought those horrid eyes he liked the man who saw through them but he found it hard to meet that stone gaze expressionless that was what they were lifeless though they moved and saw aliver shifted his gaze from him as something else occurred to him is mena still not here no it seems shes been delayed how so i wish i knew corinn said reaching out to touch aaden on the neck rhrenna answered something must have kept her she is on the mein plateau in midwinter the weather may be foul i know it well arctic fox that i am its sure to be foul corinn said a wrinkle of frustration creased her brow but only for a moment she touched her index finger to aadens nose then intoned the wind over the mein is always keen the snow likes to blow and the frost will toss if you like to freeze youll be terribly pleased aaden finished because the wind over the mein is always keen aliver acknowledged the childish verses with a nod thats fine but perhaps we should what corinn asked wait postpone the coronation dont suggest that the ceremony is set for today everything is arranged aliver do understand that weve pushed as much as we can on the coronation date we may be monarchs but i still had to court the high priestess of the vadayan like a silly lover she tutted and glanced back at the sycophantic choir gathered behind him they jumped at the inclusion affirming how correct she was laughing as if she had told a joke private to them all mena will come when she comes ive all but given up on expecting her to follow my instructions aliver frowned he did not want to let it go but forming words of protest felt like trying to swim against a strong current but what if something has happened to her this is mena akaran were talking about maeben on earth vanquisher of the foulthings tamer of dragons the choir loved that shes fine shell probably fly in and make a show of herself shell be here in her sweet time time rhrenna said is not a luxury we have today the nobles are already gathering in the carmelia and so should we for a moment aliver burned with annoyance he could barely finish a thought without are you ready to become king corinn asked she stepped closer to him her tone intimate in a way that made the onlookers dip their eyes alivers annoyance fell away replaced by the pleasant glow corinns question created yes he was ready to become king of course he was it had been so long so much longer than it should have taken he should have been king years ago now finally he was just hours away from it yes he said i am ready chapter thirtyfour t he journey north from teh was uneventful slow for most of that first day but faster that night as the saltheavy breeze picked up in the early morning hours the second day they rode the current in its swirl toward the west that evening the barges rowed out of it near enough to acacia to see the glow of lights throughout the night around them the sea bobbed with life crafts of all sorts hitched to the breeze or scooped the surface with oars or even dipped paddles to propel themselves people called to one another unusually festive some tossed foodstuffs across the water bottles and skins of wine when they fell into the waves young men dove for them coming up dripping wet their teeth shining white it seemed that to everyone but kelis and his party this passage was the beginning of a grand celebration if anyone noticed that immobile figures stood in among the closepacked swine they did not voice it in keliss hearing the santoth took up posts throughout the barges once positioned they went as still as standing stones the other passengers and crew avoided them but they did so without being sensible of it a boy picking his way toward a santoth on some errand would choose a route that took him around the sorcerers once two men cast their bedrolls in a clear spot at a santoths feet instead of lying down they stood shuffling talking ill at ease they fell to arguing both of them moved away in a huff one slept awkwardly wedged between two pinkskinned swine the other sat forlorn near the area used as the latrine staring into the night as far as kelis could tell the man slept very little for his own part kelis did not sleep at all swollen sacks drooped from his eyes and when he blinked his eyelids hesitated before rising again he had never been so tired in his life but sleep was not a comfort he could visit since boyhood when his ability to find visions of the future in his dreams had emerged sleep had been a troublesome thing for him back then he had dreamed the future he had walked in other worlds and conversed with animals and commanded tongues that he had never learned during his waking hours a gift to the boy but not to his father his father beat sleep out of him he wanted his son to be a warrior like him not a dreamer a man of spear and sword a lion and laryx slayer not a man of visions and words no dealer in things he could not see with his own eyes his father had succeeded in molding him but kelis never forgot the visions he had seen and the way they made him feel it was not power that he felt but a sense of rightness he thought of it sometimes when he watched fish in water that was where they belonged they breathed what men could not and thrived he had once briefly been a fish in the ocean of dreams for the first time in many years kelis wished he could regain the gift he had abandoned as a child would that he could sleep now and see what the future held for them he could not when he closed his eyes he just saw more clearly the scene around him some gifts once neglected can never be reclaimed t he next morningthat of the actual coronationfound them one of hundreds in a logjam of vessels that surrounded the isle of acacia the crafts bumped and jostled one another whether a barge or a sloop or a fishing rig or a rowboat tall or short long or narrow or widenone could move any farther those that had small enough skiffs inched them through what gaps they could find but as the numbers of ships joining the raft grew such pathways were squeezed out look at this mess benabe stood atop a crate and squinted against the glare of the sun which had just cut its way through clouds that had left them sodden with rain during the night well never get anywhere near the island kelis climbed up onto the crates acacia was there to be seen he could make out the higher reaches of the palace the spires adorned with long silken ribbons that wafted on the breeze to the south the promontory of havens rock was also visible he knew the contours of the place but it looked different squinting he realized it was as crowded with tents and people as were the seas below it shen must have noticed them too will it sink shen asked because of all those people i mean i saw a raft sink once when too many climbed on no benabe mussed her curly hair an island cant sink not unless the pillar that holds it in place breaks and the giver made those to last forever shen considered this with one eye narrowed instead of responding she asked what are those the adults studied the view again what naamen asked i saw something flying a giant bird one of the queens dragons no doubt benabe pursed her lips sourly some boys last night were talking of them they bear riders they say ill believe that when i see it i saw one just for a moment and then it dipped out of sight i want to see it closer one day benabe said if we ever get through this mess naamen rubbed the elbow of his stunted arm they have to clear a way for us were with the pigs theyll want pigs there must be a way through a lane kept clear for for pigs benabe huffed youre seeing what i am yes look at that were stuck and theres the island right there but the pigs benabe cut him off people who want pigs will come here not the other way around no were stuck she had it right kelis knew he had just come from unsuccessfully trying to speak with the captain he overheard him making arrangements with an empty whaling ship stuck just as fast nearby they had ovens on it that could be used to roast pork a smokehouse to cure bacon large decks for slaughter storage in the hull for the offal the captain had decided he need go no nearer to sell his product indeed he thought he could double his money we could leave the barge naamen proposed and move from boat to boat others are doing so kelis had noticed that too men and women and children moved from vessel to vessel clambering up the sides sometimes with the help of ropes thrown down to them some swam between the ships flopping wet onto the decks a few captains balked at strangers climbing across their vessels but most were oddly cheerful about it with the shouted greetings and bursts of laughter and occasional impromptu songs the festive atmosphere grew kelis wished he could feel some of that himself but he had only to catch sight of a santoth to feel his insides knot with worry he could not imagine them passing from boat to jovial boat nor was that what they intended the sound at first was like the start of some holy mans prayer to the giver kelis heard it but did not turn his head immediately it was not until a second and then third and then more voices merged with the first that he snapped around he was stunned twice by what he saw the santoth were singing they had gathered in one group standing as still as a choir and each of them intoned the same song if song it could be called it was a mixture of foreign words and sounds that were like notes these had an almost physical presence the air around them rippled with it it was transfixing but there was no beauty in it there was a garbled undertune something that gurgled and squirmed within the music an evil thing like a snake slithering quicksilver fast through and around and over the notes the santoth looked different their robes were not the colorless garments they had been now they bloomed with a rich orange like dye seeping into the fabric even as he watched for the first time kelis could see their faces the roiling emptiness that had obscured their features was all but gone instead he saw them for the men they were with cavernous cheeks and eyes that seemed absurdly bulbous ancient and weathered their skin had been burned by the talayan sun brutally creviced and parched as desert soil stretched over the bones beneath they looked every bit their great age like dead things standing and walking and singing kelis jumped from the crates and waded through a pen full of pigs to where leeka stood staring openmouthed at the sorcerers leeka what are they saying the old warrior was still for a long moment staring at one of the figures in particular instead of answering he approached the sorcerer nualo aged one what work is this what do you the santoth swept his hand in the mans direction his fingers flicking whiplike leeka staggered nualos mouth still contoured around the song but anger burned in the sorcerers eyes he flicked his fingers again and leeka flew back lifting into the air so that only his toes dragged on the deck a pen railing clipped his ankles and he spilled over on the backs of several startled pigs he was up from beneath the squealing swine a moment later his face a carved exaggeration of fear then the barge began to move it jerked forward once throwing people off balance and sending panic through the pigs and then it began a more steady progress in seconds the linked barges collided with the nearest vessels a skiff overturned tossing the youths onboard into the water and was promptly run over by the barge itself the barge pressed the shell down and smashed into the side of a larger ship beyond it this one leaned toward them as though the masts would crash down atop the santoth but it only came so far before stopping abruptly as if colliding with an invisible barrier the ship slid to one side and around the barge which carried on with increasing speed kelis heard naamen exclaim half hopefully that the santoth were clearing a way for them it was true they were heading toward acacia but this was all wrong kelis knew it without doubt whatever the santoth intended had evil slithering within it they were wrong and kelis could not let them continue he had made an enormous mistake in letting them come this far any doubt he had about it was gone now he struggled toward them his eyes on the one leeka had named nualo stop he said you must stop nualo did not answer closer to him now kelis could see that his skin still crawled with tremors and crevasses but the face they distorted was emerging the jagged peaks of his hairline the strong hook of his nose eyes the color of an overcast winter sky his features were that of one man flesh and bone born of a woman for the first time to keliss eyes one of the santoth looked like a human not a phantom in the guise of a man stop kelis roared he realized he had his spear in hand though he did not remember snatching it up he held it now in his right hand gripped to throw nualos gray eyes found him his mouth kept at the song in chaotic time with the others but he spoke directly into keliss mind soundlessly he said you are nothing you know nothing you will learn i will not let you pass the girl released us nualo thoughtspoke you already have let us pass kelis raised his spear balanced it on his strong dark fingers the santoth were flesh now he could pierce them they always had been but now he knew it we are again we are again and the world is ours again the sorcerer extended one arm toward kelis and squeezed his hand into a fist saying something different from the others for just a moment the spear in keliss hand went suddenly molten not hot but as soft as melting wax the shaft and point drooped as if they would drip to the deck then instead they curved back in time with the twisting motion of nualos fist kelis cried out and tried to release the spear but it would not come loose the shaft wrapped around and around his hand until it and his wrist were encased in ribbons of soft metal then it went hard forming a cage of iron trouble me no more nualo told him with that his attention moved away he rejoined the others fully kelis forgotten kelis stared at his hand expecting pain but feeling none it felt different trapped immobile but not in any way he had experienced before he knew that the song continued he had not stopped anything he felt the impact of the barge against other vessels grinding through or over them people cried out some in anger and some in fear and many in confusion benabe and naamen reached him naamen pulled him back while benabe tried to get her fingers under the metal gauntlet she couldnt there was no separation between it and his flesh as she tugged and scratched kelis could feel her fingernails through the metal not on it but through it it was part of him now in that instant he knew that it forever would be shen started toward the santoth who had carried on with their song as if nothing else mattered to them kelis grabbed her with his unchanged hand he was surprised at how steady his voice was no dont they are not your friends anymore you can see that cant you he expected the girl to protest but she did not she stayed silent her face for the first time was stricken with doubt kelis knew from it that she had heard what nualo thought to him it was written there in the skin around her eyes and in the slight tremble of her lower lip his heart rushed out to her he searched for the words to convince her that whatever was happening was not her fault the barge smashed against the bow of the whaling ship the jolt sent them all reeling the bow of the whaler rose above them as the ships stern jammed against something else it crashed off to one side of the barge just beside the santoth crushing a pen of pigs and grinding them across the deck in squealing confusion kelis yelled for them to move they rushed toward the rear of the barge it picked up speed as they stumbled over the railings and shoved through the increasingly frantic swine kelis managed to swing shen onto his back she clung there as he kicked savagely at pigs fearing they would bite one tried to and he smashed it across the snout with his metalclad hand kelis clustered with several others at the rear they hunkered down and watched as the barge crashed its way forward propelled by sounds mightier than any wind the chaos of the smashed and overturned boats and the screaming people was so overwhelming that kelis did not see acacia until they were upon it their barge splintered through the last few vessels tightly packed and firmly secured to the docks of the main harbor when they could go no farther because of the sheer bulk of compressed debris and wood and iron the santoth ended the song it dropped into nothingness instantly the next moment kelis realized he had already forgotten what it sounded like he would never be able to describe it it had been horrible but he would not be able to explain how in any detail look naamen said theyre going kelis shot to his feet come with me he said to naamen to benabe and shen he added stay here right here do not move until one of us comes back agreed benabe nodded shen for her part stayed curled in a ball trapped within her mothers arms leeka was already at the barges railing when kelis and naamen joined him for a moment they all watched the backs of the receding sorcerers the santoth had already cleared most of the packed ships and debris they climbed over the ships in some places they scrabbled over obstructions like excited children in others they leaped gaps as if finding purchase on the air itself kelis still had no idea what their intention was but there was no doubting the eager fervor with which they pursued it the sorcerers leaped onto the dock and began shoving their way furiously into the crowd the people were too closely packed to flee but they drew back before the figures as best they could the impact of their progress pushed through the multitude in waves those who saw them pressed back to avoid them causing still more confusion naamen said kelis theyre madmen i see them now really see them what should we kelis did not hear the rest of his sentence his mind stuttering over the realization those who saw them for people did see them it was clear in the way they cringed in surprise the way confusion melted into fear as soon as their eyes touched on them the santoth were visible now and horrible revealed here right in the heart of the empire they now looked taller than normal men seven eight feet perhapstowering over the gathered crowd their long arms swung in great arcs like scythes attacking wheat they headed for the gates of the lower town the entry point for everything else on the island brother go back to benabe and shen kelis said to naamen he turned away from the sorcerers long enough to draw his gaze thats what you should do if anything happenshe paused snapping his head around to watch the disappearing santoth then met naamens eyes fiercelyprotect them with your life if this goes badly hide them dont hesitate hide in the lower town do what you must but protect them do not try to go to the palace stay in the lower town if things are calm come at sunrise to the inner gatethe lion gate that opens to the second ring i will come for you there that was all he had time for he peeled himself away from naamens entreating eyes and looked at leeka instead he called the man by name and when he had his attention said are you with me or with them leeka answered ive been deceived weve all been deceived kelis said he raised his ironclad hand as much for himself to note as for leeka yes but i for many years now he stared after them thoughts clearly racing behind his eyes they used me when i thought they were teaching things they were really pulling knowledge from my mind learning about the world without even knowing it i helped them find shen i cant explain it but i feel it they worked to win her trust from a distance when they felt shen was within their reach they sent me out to bring her in they couldnt do it themselves so they used me now my eyes are open i know things about them as well to keliss surprise leeka jumped the gap to the pier and began shoving his way through the roiling agitated crowd behind the sorcerers he moved not with their speed but as if he were grabbing hold of the energy in their wake and heaving himself forward kelis made the same jump and ran in pursuit chapter thirtyfive t hough aspects of acacian royal culture had always been strictly formalized one thing had remained variable akaran monarchs had never been required to wear a specific insignia of their rank they had to wear something for official state functions but just how they chose to mark their status was left to their personal inclination edifus had stayed a warrior choosing to display his status purely through the deference strong men showed him tinhadin was often pictured with a narrow crown but others over the years had necklaces fashioned for their coronations earrings even brooches like the one corinns mother worea turquoise acacia tree set against a silver background corinn had worn that piece at many a state function she did not wear it today she had a choice from her ancestors jewelry but when her servants had offered to bring her the familys heirlooms she had said that it was not necessary that she examine them she knew what she wanted ill wear tinhadins crown that was what she wore as she entered the carmelia via the same tunnel through which she had run in panic just a few months earlier she walked along the causeway at the slow ceremonial pace the priestess of vada inflicted upon them from the front of the processional corinns eyes flew around joyfully taking everything in how different this entry was from last time back then she stumbled in with her garments shredded she had been stained with her own blood her lungs heaving and every fiber of her body twisted in fear a scene of carnage greeted her dead marah on the field numrek swinging their massive swords mena fighting the monsters with a sword so large she looked like a child holding it aaden nowhere to be seen oh yes things were different now joyous onlookers filled the massive stadium thousands upon thousands of them agnates and other acacian aristocrats senators from alecia who sported that citys latest fashions aushenian royalty and chieftains from all the talayan tribes all the generals and officers near enough to attend merchants from all the provinces in their respective garb colorful bejeweled grinning they all stood up and applauded the royal partys entry corinn adored the colors of peoples garments and the various hues of their skins and idiosyncrasies of their cultures think of the breadth of rule they symbolized the floor of the stadium thronged with marah officers each of them stationed before units of troops adorned in all their finery they were but a fragment of the army she could call on and everyone admiring them knew as much in the sky above elyas children circled their wings stretched wide and glorious beating with strength the world had never seen savagely beautiful aweinspiring the queen controlled the skies and the land it would not be long before the seas were hers as well she imagined that the leaguemen in their plush viewing boxes sensed as much she loved it all even the way the sky had cleared to a marvelous blue a mild winter day with enough of a breeze that the long banners attached at high points all around the stadium rippled with serpentine grace she had filled the acacian air with a mild euphoria for several days now and she knew that the prios vintage flowed freely still the bliss that she felt came from satisfaction with what she had achieved there was an irritation somewhere beyond the euphoria some other song out in the world beyond the carmelia but she ignored at as she ignored the visions she had of things that nobody else saw it would not ruin this day the tunnel gates slammed shut heavily they would stay that way for the duration of the ceremony the procession turned and began to ascend a series of five flights of stone steps toward the ceremonial dais corinn studied her brother he would be king in just a few short hours he looked marvelous it was impossible to imagine that he had ever been removed from life the energy in him shone from his tan face as if a sun heated him from the inside his smile was a gift he gave out freely as he walked he greeted people by name nodded at others occasionally taking a hand offered to him he blessed them with his touch his flowing blue robe hung perfectly on his slim frame the rich hue of the satin fabric radiating kingly calm depth and even an air of wisdom corinn had been skeptical of the emblem he chose to wear as the embodiment of his royal rank but she had to concede that there was a bit of flair in the simplicity of the gold tuvey band he wore around his right bicep all talay would love him for thatand fight to the death for him perhaps as the years passed she would loosen the grip she held on him no not perhaps she would absolutely she would she would restrain only the parts of him driven to dreaming ideals the people were not ready for that rash side of his nature which had cost him his life needed to be starved out of him at her side all his strengths would shine his weaknesses would atrophy and fall away he would learn the rightness of her rule and take it into his heart then they really would do fine things together they would fight off the attacking horde the auldek could not stand against her command of the song any more than the numrek could after that who knew the extent of what she and aliver could do wash the sin of the quota away from reality and from memory put the league in its place humbled and obedient extend the empire right across the gray slopes to ushen brae of course that was why a double monarchy was so perfect aliver would eventually rule in the west as she would rule in acacia the possibilities were endless after them aaden would be there to inherit it all he walked just behind her beaming bubbling with excitement already she found herself concocting the wonders that would mark his coronation by then she would speak the givers tongue as if it were her first language and he will too aaden will too the queen sat with all this humming within her as the priestess opened the ceremony she watched as elyas children dropped out of sight to rest until after the coronation she listened without listening as the sects purplerobed scholars read through the entire chronology of monarchs since edifus she greeted the procession of representatives offering gifts from around the empire a pair of mating cranes from the aushenian marshes dining bowls of blue glass from the ou family of bocoum a silver and turquoise necklace from teh a clutch of large crimson ostrich eggs some delicacy of the bethuni that the chieftain claimed made them more valuable by weight than gold the leagues offering was elegant and understated sire grau himself presented it to them both he and dagon with their heads bowed it looked like a marble bowl wide based with a goldframed glass dome over it closer inspection revealed a specially constructed version of one of their navigational instruments inside the dome a carved metal serpent floated in a clear liquid beneath it a map of the known world at dagons urging corinn cupped the bowl and moved it the serpent rotated it always dagon said stays faithful to the one direction it loves above all others aliver too tested it grew pleased joked that he would have the royal scholars make a study of it the engraving across the gold rim read whether my world be large i always know my place in it corinn smiled her acceptance of it the gifts went on a suit of armor in the senivalian style a heavily bejeweled diadem from the creggs of manil after the gift giving a poet from aushenia recited long grandiose verses from one of the aushenians rhyming epics modified at key points to make it all a tribute to acacia it took hours to get to the actual moment of coronation but corinn did not mind she was not the girl who had hated sitting through state functions anymore no she thought im not that girl at all the priestess of vada was not the old crone that corinn remembered from her own coronation youthful she was almost attractive even with the sides of her head shaved to the skull and the hair on her crown bound into a large knot she took far too much satisfaction in her brief role of importance intoning with the same ostentation as her predecessor cutting others with her dark eyes as they brought her the ritual items she washed and blessed she submerged an old tunicsaid to have belonged to credulas the fourth kingin soapy water squeezed it and then hung it on a frame to dry there was a story in that corinn knew but she had never learned what it was nor was she entirely sure what the vadayan sects function was other than as scholars of akaran lineage they had once had a more defined religious practice although it was dead now when all is settled again corinn thought ill make a study of them and of other things there is so much to know and then finally it was time the priestess called aliver before her corinn did not really register the words she was saying or the replies that aliver was giving she knew them by heart and had been through the same oath herself what she focused on was the way alivers handsome face managed the perfect balance of deference to the priestesss duties and ultimate authority he already was a monarch that was what his visage and upright bearing said he knew his authority but he had the patience and confidence to see through the customs into which he had been born youve trained him well hanishs voice said corinn stopped the inhalation of breath that the voice caused before the air had passed her tongue she fought the instinct to turn toward it look at him hes playing his role perfectly and doesnt even know it you may have chosen correctly hanish said in bringing him back instead of me you could have your way with me in bed but i wouldnt have been so easy to control in other matters he stood beside her in the small space in front of a marah guard and beside sigh saden she could feel the brush of him against her shoulder the touch of his skin when he nudged her she did not glance at him or acknowledge him in any way none around her did either he was a figment of her powers over life and death that was all nothing more she blew the breath out again how can you be sure though perhaps hes playing you for a fool hanish laughed and stepped toward aliver he is about to become king he did come back from the dead one wonders corinns gaze darted around trying to see if anybody else noticed him no one seemed to the priestess slid the tuvey band down alivers bicep around his elbow and off hanish had to draw his head back as she swung around with the band lifting it high so that the audience could see it he stood at alivers shoulder now looked at from another perspective he said our dear aliver has pulled off an amazing correction of his misfortune you think it all a gift you gave him but what if hes outmaneuvered you just consider it a moment thats all you have left anyway the fact that only she could see or hear hanish should have been a relief of sorts but it was more an aggravation she had a thousand retorts for each of his comments but could offer none of them he seemed to know this and to take pleasure from it she tried to find a spell within the song something with which she could erase him it was not easy for she had first to explain to the magic just what he was only then could she find the necessary spell as she was not sure what he was her mind drew circles in the song the head of the spell chasing a tail it could not catch what if he learns what youve done to him hanish asked do you imagine he would still love you then he rested a hand on alivers shoulder thrummed his fingers aliver extended his arm as the priestess slid onto it the tuvey bandadorned with a blessing in the form of a short length of crimson ribbon hanish acted as an aide would touching the band when it was in place and then smoothing the fabric of the monarchs upper sleeve the ceremony was almost complete all that was left was the recital of the final sanction corinn had a part in this which the touch of the priestesss eyes reminded her hanish made a show of stepping out of her way when she took her place beside aliver at a signal given by touching alivers hand the two siblings began hear us acacia empire of the four horizons of the tree of akaran of the six provinces they spoke loudly but as the carmelia was far too large for everyone to hear designated speakers took up their words and repeated them the speech cascaded down from the dais and around the high ranks of benches like a song in the round edifus was the founder both akarans said repeating words that had first been drummed into them as children working with their tutor you know this to be true he was born into suffering and darkness in the lakes but he prevailed in a bloody war that engulfed the whole world he met the untrue king tathe at galaral and crushed his forces with the aid of santoth speakers edifus was the first in an unbroken line of twentyone akaran kings hanish said unbroken until i came around dont forget that you havent written me out of the histories already have you corinn fumbled the words of the sanction she tripped over them for a moment trying to remember them and to match her timing to alivers she felt him glance at her a bead of sweat broke loose from her forehead and ran down her left temple and cheek are the living con we are the continuation of those who came before akaran all you probably have hanish said youre capable of anything two monarchs what a strange idea corinn i hope you are half as crafty as you think yourself i really do for the sake of our son i do he is nothing but a distraction corinn told herself control yourself divide your thoughts make them whole but doubled she did her lips found the words of the sanction her face maintained its calm her mind danced with the spell that would wipe this phantom hanish from the world forever she thought she had the substance of it she bunched up her malice toward him into one seething ball of song she held it in the back of her mouth needing only a break in the sanction to release it because of all these things corinn was as jolted as any of the others by the sound perhaps more so though at first she kept on as if she had not noticed a bang echoed across the stadium a sound like a battering ram against a mighty door another oh something is knocking hanish said aliver stopped speaking he turned toward the tunnel through which they had entered corinn kept on speaking for a moment but with alivers gaze went the turning heads of the crowd a third boom rocked the place with a force that shook the foundations of the stadium something broke she realized what the sound was the iron gates through which she had entered had been bashed open the rush of air was palpable from where she stood it tore at the hats and garments of those near it thats impossible she thought the gates could not be flung open they were always locked for the ceremony no one in her service would even think of it and if they did it would not be possible not as heavy and secure as they were the words finally fell from corinns lipsand the song dissolved in her mouthas figures strode through the tunnel and into the stadium take the prince away she said rhrenna do it now not just knocking hanish whispered suddenly at her ear again theyve let themselves in chapter thirtysix b arad had thought that the presence of a ghost made physical was to be the most disturbing thing he would witness that day from his box below the dais he watched the figure appear at corinns shoulder he nearly called out but the fact that nobody else did stopped him or not just that whatever sorcery corinn had bound him with stopped him he feared the man was an assassin and then wondered why he feared that let the queen die that would be a fine thing let his inability to warn her be the death of her as ever in his life since the queen had captured him his mind rocked like a boat atop choppy waters first leaning one way and then the next all the time making him sick to the stomach because he could only watch he did through watching he saw the queen could hear the words the dead man whispered in her ears she fought not to show any sign that she acknowledged the phantoms sudden appearance but to barads eyes it was obvious her jaw clenched when the mans lips moved she shifted away from the touch he gave her elbow her eyes darted around checking to see if others saw the man at whom she would not herself look not an assassin then barad stared harder the mans hair was long and golden with a few thin strips of colored leather woven into its braids meinish his face looked odd beside corinns his features did not show the contrast of light and dark that hers did no touch of the sun on them he seemed to stand in the dull light of another place entirely he did stand in another place barad realized he was dead as soon as he had the thought he knew it to be true a ghost was whispering in the queens ear why could he see the dead man when nobody else seemed to his stone eyes surely they were works of sorcery after all and they were corinns doing through them he watched as the man moved around the dais unseen talking much of the time more than that barad knew every word the man spoke intimate playful teasing even his whispers reached him he did not follow the intricacies of the ceremony at all just watched the queen and the ghost hearing his onesided conversation wondering what was going to happen he had no better understanding of it when the gates to the carmelia crashed open he rolled his stone eyes away from the dais and watched the figures march through the tunnel and into the crowded stadium they were not ghosts these ones for a moment barad thought them monsters with elongated heads like eaters of ants but that image faded as the light touched them they were men larger than normal but men they cast shadows and had about them a solidity that was even more tangible than the crowd who drew back in horror from them they must have been heavier than normal men for their feet split the stones across which they trod even the tattered robes they wore swung with a martial weight as if the fabric were woven of metal and as likely to cut as a blade they drove a wedge through the people standing on the entry causeway the crowd cringed away from them some pressing back so hard that those along the inner railing went toppling over onto the lower benches the intruders took no notice of the people at all until the guards remembered their duty with a lieutenant shouting them into motion they snapped into ranks and began marching toward the intruders the front rank thrust before them a treacherous bristle of halberds the foremost of the intruders raised their arms in unison and roared out something the soldiers flesh went liquid their clothes and armor dropped to the stones sodden with blood their weapons clattered down among the filth all of which was trodden over by the intruders feet a second later sorcerers barad named them they are sorcerers the sorcerers turned and ascended the stairs toward the dais general andeson barked a command archersbarad had not even known there were archerson the ledge up beyond the dais let loose a volley of arrows they should have fallen a hundred or so right on top of the intruders but the sorcerers tilted their heads and blew at them the motion was like shooing away a bothersome fly the arrows skidded away from them they careened through the stadium looking suddenly like sleek black birds erratic fliers that impacted randomly among the crowd puncturing chests and throats and embedding in skulls people sprang away from the injured sending waves of panic through the tightly packed audience andeson did not repeat the order to shoot he stood with his mouth hanging open aliver asked something and in answer the marah shifted around the dais they bunched tightly together on the stairs below the royal party swords drawn the intruders climbed one flight of stairs before slowing they paused and looked around taking in the view from the landing the action was so casual that the marah held their positions no new orders came for them the sorcerers gazes roamed over the assembled crowd both the ranks above and below them both the motion of those trying to flee and the awed stillness of most of the crowd just like that by stopping their raging forward progress the men looked almost normal their faces though mature and weatherworn were not animal or massive or even particularly fierce they contained two expressions at war with each other on the surface they conveyed disdain as if they owned all the people they surveyed and found them lacking beneath their condescension a terrible eagerness squirmed that was the main thing barad saw behind their features and in their eyes were passions at odds with the aged facades they occupied there were twentytwo of them barad did the math on his lips twentytwo the same number of generations as the prophecies had predicted would pass before a time of great change one by one they completed their survey began slowly up the next set of stairs and set their gazes on corinn and aliver barad did the same he had forgotten about her for those few moments of chaos corinn was there at the same spot on the dais prince aaden was nowhere to be seen but marah were all around the queen and aliver like living armor even the priestess had been bustled away as the guards closed in she was pressed uncomfortably between a soldier and the stone pedestal behind her the ghost was still at corinns elbow even then whispering in her ear friends of your brothers or friends of yours late arrivals im hoping its one or the other hanish of course it was hanish mein barad had never met him but what other meinish ghost would haunt the queen who else would say the things he was saying seeing that knowing it barad knew as well that the number twentytwo was not random they were still living within the same generation hanish had not been the change at all this was whatever these had come for that was what he was whispering in the queens ear by the pallor of her face she believed him the priestess of vada aghast at the interruption began a babbling reprimand several officers and a senator added their ire sigh sadens wife screeched something about the ghastliness of it compared to them the intruders seemed tranquil where is the song of elenet the voice that said this was almost too genteel to be believed it carried to every corner of the carmelia with a softspoken lilt tinged with an accent barad could not place the crowd near and far fell silent tell us where it is our time to have it is now more courtly than the tunishnevre thats clear hanish said his eyes just happened to touch barads he paused surprised to see the man staring at him he nodded and looking straight at him he said still i dont like their tone barad did not return his greeting but even that was a form of communication between them it was all he had time for how does one speak to madmen corinn asked no one hearing it would have known she had just watched these men slaughter soldiers with a gesture of their arms or had turned falling arrows to flying dart birds i wish i knew for surely you are madmen you seem not to know that you are speaking to the queen of the acacian empire you seem to not know that youve interrupted we know another of the sorcerers said he stood at the second landing now again having paused there his voice dripped sickly sweetness as if he were answering the question of a toddling child give us the song and we will bless your reign with wizardry you have not yet even imagined corinns mouth hardened madman what name do you claim i am nualo the first man said he gestured to the others we are the santoth we are tinhadins chosen warriors we are the exiled returned we who have been imprisoned are free and then proudly you both know us we called to you but you would not listen you cant be the santoth are exiled corinn snapped a quick glance at aliver do you know these intruders the prince mouthed somethingthe name the man had given barad thoughtbut did not say it out loud turning to her he said ifif this is them they have changed are they the santoth corinn pressed aliver hesitated was what he wanted to say at odds with what corinn wished him to say or was the hesitation something else barad could not tell they were not like this before they were wise men peaceful men we still are another santoth said why did you kill aliver asked nobody here deserved death the santoth abhorred killing they wouldnt we defended ourselves nualo said that is all it is not our fault that the givers tongue has curdled within us we abhorred corruption in the song we want it cleansed and sweet in us again as he spoke he unfastened the clasp that secured his cloak he shrugged it from his shoulders and let it drop in a heap on the stones beneath it he wore a breastplate snug trousers and thick warriors boots we are just men like you but we have been in torment for so long in exile with corruption roiling in our heads you cannot understand this another of them turned as he spoke letting his words sweep across the crowd when the song is corrupt there is no joy in it let us have it true again and we will serve you shaking his head aliver said you are not the men i knew i dont care what they were corinn said say it simply are these the santoth though she looked focused on the exchange barad could sense something happening around her he could partially see ita blurring disturbance in the air around her he could partially hear itsomething like music almost too far in the distance for him to hear staring at the one who had last spoken aliver said yes i see you dural you are not the quiet one i met in talay but i can see you he glanced at another and you abernis tenith all of you i can see you all nualo i see you most of all you have living eyes then nualo said it is good that we have come if you see us true corinn gathered her answer around her like comfortable armor she spoke impatiently as if she would spare them only a few more words before returning to the interrupted ceremony no it is not good as santoth you breathe by our leave you should not be here without our permission you were exiled this is no place for you unless we ask for you we do not go back to exile at the same time as she said these acacian words something else came out with them woven through them the givers tongue that was what he could almost see and hear a spell barad heard it writhing through the words so too did the santoth for a moment the order seemed to have power over them as a group they were pushed back on their heels off balance as if hit by a gust of wind that no one else felt but they came back to flat on their feet fast enough abernis smiled and said we are free from the curse the girl released us we will not go back what girl this ones daughter he pointed at aliver shen an akaran she released us barad heard hanish make a sound low in his throat lies corinn said she might have been refuting either abernis or hanish he has no daughter you wish to trick us into truly letting you free i dont acknowledge it go back to exile this time both the spoken words and the spell imbedded in them flew propelled by anger barad watched it leap not from corinns mouth but from her shoulders a coiled thing that struck like a snake secured around her neck the santoth flicked it away just as they had the arrows the spell skimmed across the air above them transformed from something nearly invisible into writhing wormlike shadows that splattered across portions of the crowd where it touched people died the liquid shadow cut through them like molten steel thrown against bare flesh barad was not sure if the others saw it as he did but they certainly saw the ghastly result panic rose again people near the shattered doors started pushing and shoving rushing out even as they craned their heads back to see what other horrors might come some in the upper tiers climbed over the back wall even though there was nothing there but cliffs and rocks and the sea below your song is pure corinn but you are not powerful nualo said ignoring the confusion below him we are powerful but our song is not pure where is the song of elenet tell us give it to us if you do we will make the world beautiful for you all of it for you tenith said nualo nodded as if he had just been about to broach that topic he hooked his thumbs through the cord at his waist that is so we owe you much corinn the girl released us but you taught us much of the givers tongue again i did not corinn said this time her words were tentative a trace of doubt trailed them you sang it did you not abernis asked that is my right as tinhadins heir nualo brushed that away by singing it you released it into the world again we had only to listen to hear and we did listen you are foolish queen corinn foolish for reaching into death foolish for spinning trinkets for your child foolish for taking creatures already warped by unpure magic and making them all the greater foolish for taking from one place and giving to another with no understanding of balance you have no control over any of the things youve done you see your world needs us to correct your errors give us the song and we will help you no give us the song another santoth said several others said the same then they all spoke at once a bombardment of entreating voices all asking for the song all promising to serve her swearing to do only her bidding trying to explain the torment they lived in it was too much all at once corinn stopped it by asking what would you do with it if you had it whatever you wish hanish said i dont trust that answer make them be more specific will they destroy the world in flaming retribution enslave us as punishment for shut up corinn snapped turning to spit in the mans face be gone you fool let me think hanish blinked his dreamy gray eyes closed as you wish my love he bent his head and disappeared those around corinn looked at her with troubled eyes the charlatan delivegu wrinkled his face in a manner that made him look momentarily absurd it was so hard for barad to remember that only he saw and heard hanish to the santoth corinn said would you destroy the auldek in our name of course the sorcerers answered in your name we would no dont believe them barad thought would you defend tinhadins line and protect me and accept my heir yes came back all twentytwo voices i dont have it corinn said you have it nualos voice boomed nothing about his gestures or expression changed but in the moments he spoke it was as if there were no other sound in the world his voice was everything inside barads ears inside his head when nualo spoke it felt as if the beat of his heart hitched itself to the rhythm of his words we know it we can feel it singing around you we knew when you read it we know it is not here corinn said but if you return to the south i will retrieve it do not anger me nualo said aliver and i will consider your request as king and queen we will not with you here in violation of exile not with you demanding what you have no right to demand we will treat with you fairly but not like this you lie i am the queen of acacia if i say a thing its the truth you see i cannot lie now go back to exile again the words flew tethered to magical commands this time nualo raked them out of the air with his hands screaming as he did so he took the stuff that was her spell and blew foulness into it and sent it ripping across the crowd a swath of people went down beginning not far from the queen herself jason the scholar barad had often seen tutoring aaden was among them the curse splashed out in a crimson curve the color splattered over the crowd starting wide and thinning as it went whipping all the way around and snapping out high on the bleachers above the royal dais the people touched by it writhed they clutched at themselves and reached out for others most of whom pulled back in horror it took barad a moment for his eyes to understand what had happened they had not been covered in something the color had been revealed because they had been stripped of their skin flayed alive hundreds of them nualo glared at the royal siblings with narrowed eyes you did that not i you did that you make us defend ourselves you see that dont you we will defend ourselves every time give us the song and stop this queen corinn stared at the raw corpse that was jason and let her eyes follow the bloody path away from him her face pale her expression bleak and naked she and those directly around her were the only ones standing still the rest of the crowd became a shrieking maddened mob clawing to escape ripping and tearing at one another the other santoth moved to form a ring around nualo they began to sing they built their garbled version of the song and let it loose in the air around them barad could not understand a word of it but it was horrible he hated it and he pushed into it with his eyes it was pain and suffering it was hunger and rage and spite it was venom and fire the breath of monsters and the claws of demons disease and rot and there was something else something he could almost taste with his eyes something he could almost grasp it was something in the disparity between what they claimed and what was in their sorcery their song was corrupted yes even barad could tell that he did not need to understand the language to know how wrong it was how warped and cancerous if you send the song against us we will throw it like seeds atop your people corrupted seeds are you such fools we would give you the entire world but you scorn us you want us to return to exile why should we do that nualos voice slowed his words gnawed their way through the spellthick air we only ever did what tinhadin asked of us no barad thought he was certain the answer should be no he wanted to shout it but he had no language we were only ever faithful for that we were exiled not again i say it one last time after this we will not ask again and then barad had it language that was what was different between corinns song and the santoths they were not speaking the same language their sorcery was the night to corinns day it was not a corrupted version of the same it was fundamentally different they spoke a different sorcerers language one that was by its very nature warped and horrible they had power yes but nothing like what they would have if they studied the true song will you give us the song of elenet another one of them said if you will not we will ask the same question of your son we will ask it of aliver of shen we will ask until we get our answer she is defeated barad thought i cant give it to you she whispered its not here where is it dont tell them barad shouted but only inside himself he could not move his tongue not open his mouth or push forward toward her he desperately tried to make his body do this but he could not in senival she answered noooo barad wailed silently motionless at calfa ven chapter thirtyseven delivegu had never been a soldier he considered himself a dangerous individual good in a brawl quick with a knife capable of staring down the most belligerent of drunken louts with a sharp enough mind to outwit even an alecian senatorial whore he was his own man and he rather liked things that way what use was the discipline of the military taking orders chain of command subservience to officers blind meaningless courage in the face of danger none of that suited him but standing near the santoth sorcerers throughout their exchange with corinn jostled by the nobles around him who were bolting for the exit he would happily have folded himself under the wing of a commanding officer he would have run away himself but his scrotum packed up and climbed inside him when nualo swept corinns spell out across the crowd ripping peoples skin from them and when they stood in that terrible circle nualo at the center demanding that corinn give them some book delivegu had wanted to shout at the queen to hand it over whatever it was give them the damn thing he knew there must be some reason not to but he just wanted them gone relief then when she named the place calfa ven having been there so recently he remembered it well he thought for a moment of bralyn but only for a moment nualo stared hard at the queen calfa ven you know the place surely corinn responded derision twisting around her words we do then go leave my sight delivegu had to acknowledge it if she had looked at him with such complete scorn he would have withered and skulked away the sorcerers did not even notice instead they flashed glances at one another nualo scowled and others scowled back more like animals that communicated through growls and bared teeth than like men whatever they had said with those grimaces they reached consensus quickly no the voice boomed up from at the entry causeway the place was in turmoil people still trying to flee trampling one another but few of them actually getting anywhere the one who spoke worked against this for a moment delivegu thought he was another santoth he dressed similarly and he moved with inhuman speed he seemed to run on top of peoples shoulders and heads light and nimble his robes flapping behind him noooo nualo hear me i can get you what you want nualo just barely held in whatever foulness he was prepared to scream down on the man letting him come until the man stood on one of the torch pillars near enough to be seen clearly his features were normal battered and aged those of a man who had seen most of his living days already and who exactly are you old man delivegu wondered what leeka nualo asked what knowledge have you speak quickly leeka it was aliver looking more stunned than ever yes your majesty he said bowing low i have been with these ones all these years i know them well even if they hid the truth from me they did do that they hid what nualo roared speak only to me leeka held out a moment longer he did not speak but he kept his eyes on the two monarchs looking grave and mournful and strong all at once then he turned to the sorcerers my knowledge is this you cannot kill any of tinhadins line they have only to know that they are safe from death at your hands for it to be true and now they know he looked back at aliver and they cannot whatever he was going to add he did not get to finish the sorcerers spat fury at him when the spell hit it tore his body to pieces and sprayed him in chunks and splatters across a great swath of people you people nualo yelled you see what you make us do nualo swung back toward corinn his hand rose behind him and hurtled over his head as if he were a hunter wielding a throwing stick he roared as he did so a sound that was simultaneously earsplitting and indistinct sharp but muffled by the echoes of time and space delivegu was certain that the rapidity of nualos throw altered as he released whatever he snapped from the ends of his fingers blinding speed one moment a blurred slow tortured syrup of a long moment just after corinns head reared back her mouth open and speaking and then something happened around her mouth she turned away and fell back into her soldiers too quickly for delivegu to see he knew that something had been done to her he just could not say what stupid woman nualo said his features jagged and cruel andfor the first timemirthful its true that i cant kill you now that you know it but i have not killed you have i ive done something better the next instant delivegu watched the santoth bound up the staircase driven with sudden purpose they passed near the royal dais bunched as it was with warriors with weapons drawn the sorcerers took four and five steps at a time leaped over railings and scaled one section of wall that blocked their way they shoved through any people trapped or fool enough not to get out of their way right up into the highest ranks they went they mounted the carmelias barrier wall one by one their cloaks flapping behind them in a manner that for some reason made delivegu think of rats tails they leaped out of sight delivegu did not rush to the edge to stare after them he did not need to see them what he imagined was vivid enough in his mind he saw them careening down the cliffs toward the rocky beach from there they roared through the revelers on the sand and jumped first onto skiffs pulled up on the beach and then from them to other ships across barges and transports and onward using the collection of ships as one enormous bridge hurrying them toward the mainland toward calfa ven and whatever prize awaited them there they were gone a brief wave of relief washed over him he turned to catch sight of the queen but the shove and tumult all around him was too confusing he could not find her the exodus through the one open gate was a full flood now the entire stadium drained toward it they were mad frenzied and clawing over one another delivegu jumped away just in time as a man rolled head over heels down the stairs past him what you fools theyre gone find your senses no one around him seemed willing to do that he shouted that the sorcerers were gone and that with calm they could open the other exits as well nobody listened instead they shoved and cursed and scratched him as they rushed past he got a hand on his dagger and kept it there ready to slash out with it he began pushing back toward the royal dais he reached it but the royal party was gone the priestess and her entourage took flight as he arrived carrying what they could of the ceremonys accoutrements corinn and aliver were down in the mass of people although heading for a different passageway from the mob marah were tight around them forming a protective human rectangle that moved with a mind of its own following some evacuation plan no doubt some plan devised just in case just in case what in case some ancient sorcerers stepped out of the centuries in time to disrupt the coronation of a new king they say the marah consider all possibilities delivegu muttered did you ever imagine this one i think not friends i think not he watched the wedge of soldiers disappear through the exit opened for them then slammed closed behind them well he had to admit the exit was efficiently done he wished he was with them if he could rush there now he might just get inside before the palace slammed shut within minutes the place would be locked down bristling and stupid with fear he stood on the deserted platform considering diving in with the mob but just look at them people were being trampled and suffocated needlessly the thought of joining them rankled his sense of scoundrels dignity no he would not be one of them resolving himself to a long delay before he could gain his quarters again his eyes drew themselves to a person moving against the mobs crazed men he was only one person in the mass of bodies he did run above them as leeka had but still stood out because he was moving against the outflow the black mans arms lashed forward as if he were trying to swim through the torrent of fleeing people as frantically as he struggled he made no progress indeed as the exodus gained momentum he began to be dragged back by the surge of them delivegu muttered about their sanity but then caught himself insanity was driving people out of the stadium that man was fighting against the madness the talayan he thought looked more and more familiar whatever the man was thinking he had purpose the others did not grabbing a passing soldier by the shoulder delivegu yanked him close the young man wore a glazed expression soldier soldier delivegu smacked him and stared in his face waiting for eye contact from him as he used to do with his dogs as a boy only when he had his full attention did he continue recognize me im delivegu lemardine im the queens man listen to me the soldier could hardly have done otherwise delivegu was roaring in his face that man see him the talayan there he stabbed the air with his finger trying to shoot a straight line between the guards eyes and the mans chest get him bring him to me he knows something get him and bring him to me alive the soldier began sputtering excuses but delivegu sent him on his way with a kick to his backside the young man went wobbly legged down the steps for a while then carried on like a good soldier they like their orders dont they delivegu smiled and sat down to wait right there on the dais letting his legs dangle over the edge all right he was feeling a bit better sorcerers made him queasy regular folk he could handle just fine chaotic situations he preferred to think of them as opportunities one of the dragons kohl he thought it was flapped up over the far stadium wall black as tar and just as glistening under the now bright sun another one slid along the rim for a moment before catching an updraft and lifting into full view thais the brown one with yellow stripes she was rather plain looking but delivegu always got a thrill saying her name thais it would be forever a sexy name to him recalling the face of a young woman in alecia who simply would not succumb to him throughout a long night of cunning and chivalrous advances why was it always the ones who eluded him that he remembered the most vividly for that matter why was he capable of thinking of a browneyed beauty from a decade ago right after meeting mad wizards who were likely going to plunge the world into chaos and darkness he shrugged anyway two other dragons hove into view as well long necked and angry looking a bit late delivegu said he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder they went that way if you care they could not of course hear him by the time the soldier returned to him with the talayan man in tow the confusion had mostly passed soldiers were establishing some rough semblance of order a few people goodhearted or desperate for their loved ones had even begun to trickle back into the carmelia to help the injured and deal with the dead the soldier handed the man off awkwardly looking around at his fellows and only then seeming to question why he had taken orders from someone so obviously not an officer delivegu dismissed him with a shooing motion of his fingers he turned his attention to the man he had seen less bedraggled men laboring as life prisoners in the kidnaban mines the talayans tunic was a thin tattered garment hung across a wiry frame muscles lean and taut beneath his skin his thighlength skirt looked to have been dragged across the ground all the way from central talay leaving a tattered fringe he was coated in a layer of dust lighter in tone than his skin with a crackly film of salt around his hairline most bizarrely his right hand and wrist were completely encased in a metal cage delivegu considered the possibility that he had escaped imprisonment but he had never seen anything like that gauntlet besides that he knew who the man was no criminal he youve seen some miles kelis of umae delivegu said the hard way by the looks of it the man looked surprised but whether the surprise was at delivegu knowing his name or at the fact that he was that person delivegu was not sure kelis said i must see the queen youll not get near her looking as you do kelis agitated scanned the stadium the queen i thought she was here delivegu caught him by the elbow as he tried to move away listen ive got sense enough to recognize you but i doubt any marah would see anything but a cushion to pin an arrow in realizing he had grabbed the arm with the steel fist of a hand he let it go what happened to your hand the queen kelis repeated and aliver if he truly lives and where is leeka he came this way before me ah he was with you huh delivegu asked hes around here all over the place really he gestured vaguely anyway whats your message for the monarchs ill tell the queen the talayan snapped youll tell me first delivegu said and then maybe if i say so youll tell the queen youll not get near her without me and youll not find anyone else to help you youre lucky to have found me he stopped and studied him again i shouldnt even waste my time with you but im thinking youve had a part in all this kelis looked down and that you have things to tell the queen things she really ought to hear the talayan nodded i can probably arrange that youll have to start by telling me though have a seat lets do this like reasonable men i by the way am delivegu lemardine the best friend you have at this moment chapter thirtyeight by the time sire dagon reached his compound in the league quarters his clothes were so disheveled he could barely walk without tripping over portions of his flowing garments the sole of one of his shoes flapped maddeningly and he had lost his ceremonial skullcap his lip was fat from having been punched by a commoner and dark liquid soiled his front his own vomit several layers of it had been squeezed out of him by more than one sight but mostly by the glimpse he caught of the things that had writhed in and around and over queen corinns face what were they he asked but he did not want to know there could be nothing good in knowing the name of such things he plowed through the servants waiting to greet him and went straight to his office ignoring their exclamations of concern he could think of nothing save the horror of what he had seen and the dread at what he had done never before had his timing been so disastrous absurdly fantastically disastrous what have we done he asked himself once seated and panting in his office chair he really was not sure he knew what he had done yes but not what the effects of it would be now nor what the santoth had done to corinn nor what they would do to the world he could not get his mind around it but the terror squeezing every fiber of his body told him he had to and quickly sire his secretary peeked in the open door youre upset i see should i send for teeneth she would want to no this is no time for concubines youyou no insult came readily enough so dagon let the sentence hang unfinished of course sire the man began again his voice simpering from the first word do you need anger rose in dagon like alcohol tossed onto a fire he suddenly hated that this man was talking to him distracting him making it harder to get a grasp of his thoughts whats more the room was full of people they were his people but he loathed them get out he shouted all of you spies and leeches out he tossed a paperweight at the secretary it missed him but grazed a servant across the temple in a flutter of motion the servants abandoned their posts and dashed for the door one knocked over an end table another caught it before it hit the floor wait come back they all hesitated secretary and servants unsure whom he meant send for grau and the others dagon said to the secretary all of them bring them here seeing the man scurry away at the task gave dagon a moments comfort yes he needed his brothers that was why he had no control of his emotions he should not be without his brothers at a time like this in the chaos of exiting the carmelia everyone in such a mad frenzy dagon had lost sight of the other leaguemen one minute he was among them the next some ruffian yanked the silver chain from his neck as he pushed him down to be trampled by the time he gained his feet againmuch abused in the processhe found himself alone within a mob he tried to put the dreadfulness of that out of his mind like him the other sires would just now be arriving back at their guest quarters they had to meet that very night they had to decide what to do and how to do it dagon knew that the arrival of the santoth changed everything he did not know how it changed everything but that it had was a certainty he was sure the others would see it the same way none of them had planned for this what he had planned forand just executedwas something very different and that was what made things worse you fool grau your stupid plan your bloody compass the compass the very gift that the queen had lifted with her bare hands just a few hours ago he found something almost sexual in the positioning of her palms as they cupped the polished gold and aliver he had run his fingers over it tracing the words of the inscription as he read them out dagon could barely grasp that such a beautiful piece of science and artistry had become a tool of death but he knew it had those brief touches grau had assured him were all it would take i t had all seemed so perfect when sire grau first shared his scheme with him the queen and the new king eliminated in one untraceable action no bloodstained knife no arrow in the breast no assassins to employ and then in turn have assassinated no it was as simple as league chemistry was complex we have a poison grau had said through the mistfilled air in his quarters that afternoon in alecia we have always had poisons dagon replied yes but this one our chemist can paint onto whatever object we request the old man demonstrated this with an imaginary brush it goes on as an invisible film it dries there leaving no trace to the eye or to touch no smell at all when they first showed me they pointed at an apple that had been coated in the stuff i almost picked it up despite myself such was the illusion that nothing was there at all if i had touched it though you and i would not be speaking now all those who handled an object thus treated died not immediately their deaths were delayed the poison needed to work its way into their systems from the tests the league had doneand they were nothing if not thorough with testingthose who were so poisoned died within a cycle of the moon sometimes a little longer or shorter the end when it came was swift they would drop to sleep and not wake they would be found glassyeyed their tongues green their fingers mottled with spots in short they will look to have overmeasured a concoction of the mist sire dagon had finished grau showed his pleasure by exposing the filed points of his teeth oh the vices of royalty we all know leodan was an addict why not his children as well the crown sits heavy doesnt it on a brow as delicate as corinns whats most charming about this poison is that it doesnt overstay its welcome all traces of it fade away from the treated object after the first few days the poisoni dont knowit evaporates or something the longnailed fingers of his hand drew the process vaguely in the smoky air anyone trying to find traces of it after the unfortunate death will find nothing whatsoever so no fingers can be pointed at us fingers can point grau said shrugging but thats all theyll be able to do and how would we guarantee that the akarans will touch a particular object with all their servants and the coronation grau had cut in we will put it in their hands ourselves at the coronation s o they had and now it was done the siblingsand a good number of servants and any guests unfortunate enough to have handled the compasswould be dead within a month they were walking corpses dagon had been so pleased sitting in his box as the ceremony continued he even began wording his condolences to young prince aaden dear noble lad he had mouthed in his head i can scarcely fathom the cruel hand fate has stricken you with he had to stop himself remembering it it no longer amused him that he had planned to claim to the boy that he would gladly exchange his own life if it would spare corinns or that he imagined sitting with the boy as they studied the compass together both he and the young prince touching the then harmless instrument no he need not think back on that what mattered was thinking forward how have things changed dagon asked himself he did not notice that he spoke his thoughts out loud or that most of his servants had crept back into the room and resumed the regular posts he did not even flinch when a servant handed him a lit pipe he just took it he sucked on the mouthpiece the gurgle of the water loud in the room he held it for a long time and exhaled the greenish vapors along with his words we have sorcerers living in the world thats how things have changed the santoth he inhaled again it felt good to do so the mist was in him now with it came the possibility of calm the tension that had crawled across his skin grew coy flirtatious he thought briefly of teenith his concubine but this was no time for seeking solace in her arms after a few more inhalations he said now what do i know of these santoth with the mists aid his mind picked up the question he knew what he had seen just an hour ago they lived they commanded some foul magic they killed without remorse they had redirected corinns attacks to horrible effect and they wanted something the song of elenet he repeated the name as he rose and pipe in hand shuffled to his library his loose sole smacked the floor the entire way setting his pipe on a reading table dagon flipped through volumes so rare that the vadayan scholars had they known of them would have put down their parchment and quills and trained as assassins to get their hands on them one by one he tossed them on the floor behind him at first he was not even sure what he was looking for but he remembered having read about the santoth before just after they came out of exile and destroyed hanish meins army on the teh plains dagon had searched for information about them a shortlived course of study it was the sorcerers had gone back into exile seemingly just as trapped there as they ever had been other matters had pulled his attention away sire the secretarys voice was barely audible dagon yanked around how much time had passed measuring by the clutter on the floor it could have been hours are they here all gathered no the man said he stood with one foot out of the room seeming to slide farther out as he spoke they are all gone sire grau and sire peneth sire flann all their attendants gone dagon let his arms droop gone how they sail even as we speak through the channel the ishtat kept open im sorry sire but i could not reach them the ishtat withdrew the channel closed a folder slipped from dagons hand all of them are gone all of them the secretary said and then stepping a little closer were alone trapped normally dagon would have slapped the man for being overdramatic instead he cast around found his simmering pipe and sucked on it like a pup on his mothers tit t he dark hours of the middle of the night found dagon still in the library having picked himself up from the floor and again rummaging through what volumes had not already been strewn across the stones when he found the book it was obvious he could have done so all along had his mind been calm enough to organize a more orderly search it stood on a shelf among some of the oldest books jeflen the reds account of the wars of distribution that was what he had been looking for even if he had not been clearheaded enough to know it dagon tipped it down he placed it in the stand on a round table the one best situated beneath the reading lamps and he stared at the cover jeflen had been tinhadins official chronicler as such his account of things was suspect but it was the most complete single volume of the times that dagon knew of and it was also vivid dagon remembered that now he felt it in the pit of his stomach and in his fingers which trembled despite the mists sedative effects he got up flapped across to the other table and worshipped at the pipe until he killed it opening well into jeflens account and flipping forward dagon skimmed the pages that documented the wars themselves his eyes stuck on descriptions of battle on numerical equations that measured the massive death tolls of the time it described scenes of incredible carnage in numbers that made the santoths destruction of the meins seem a minor skirmish in comparison it was horrible made more stunning because dagon had images of his own to compare them to that ribbon of red torn flesh it had taken him a long time to understand what he had seen and when he had he had vomited all down his front this book though told of such things on a massive scale entire wars fought that way between allpowerful sorcerers and armies that could do nothing but march forward to their ghastly deaths the santoth had never been defeated by any army of men never even close so there was that moving forward he read of the growing friction between the king and his sorcerer knights they each of them were ambitious greedy men ravenous for greater portions of the world were they not gods walking the earth did not the very words from their mouths destroy or create according to jeflen tinhadin came to believe the santoth would soon turn against him against each other as well but first against him as he sat as king over them all it was in reading his fathers journals for guidance on how to handle them that he discovered something his father had not intended him to discover it was there in the journal hinted at suggested promised he came to believe that he and the santoth had learned only a portion of the givers tongue the first text he acquired from the dwellers was incomplete it was only much later after his father died and he began to piece together clues from his journal that he realized there was an even more complete volume the song of elenet it was not as dagon had dimly remembered an old epic poem it was not a lament or a dirge or a eulogy it was the first thiefsorcerers manual for speaking the language of a god dagon had known that come to think of it he just had not credited it it had never mattered he doubted it ever existed doubted such a language ever existed or elenet to overhear it he had doubted really that there had ever been a giver you believe now dont you he asked himself even when the santoth proved themselves real on the teh plains he had not truly had to face the ramifications of their existence and when corinn had begun to work sorcery dagon had thought it a nuisance peculiar to her alone if she was removed the nuisance would be as well how foolish that seemed now he read on tinhadin had gone in search of the song of elenet jelfen wrote at length about the epic journey tinhadin had undergone to find it but dagon skipped that what mattered was that tinhadin had found it studied it and returned as a more powerful sorcerer than all the santoth combined the song lived in him it coursed through him he breathed it and sweated it he dreamed in the language of creation and sometimes woke to find the world changed when tinhadin returned to acaciafor his search had taken him far awayhis sorcerers came against him he threw them back he would have destroyed them but a moment of compassion stayed him they had been his companions from youth like brothers to him soldiers beside him for so many years he hated their betrayal but he did not want to sing them out of existence as he could have instead he banished them to the far south the santoth went for they could not disobey their master they could not stand against him not when he was so much more a god than they the sorcerers vented their rage on the land and up into the skies and upon any who got in their way as they moved south only one nation massed to stand against them a race of centaurs from the far south of talay the anniben dur anniben these horsemen had for eons roamed rich southern grasslands that teemed with life they were among the givers first creations and they had always scorned humans the spawn of the betrayer as they named edifus they had stayed outside the affairs of the known world and tinhadin had not risked battle with them before in his act of banishment though he sent his sorcerers against them behind burithben they ranked to face the raging sorcerers they stood side by side in one great herd and said the santoth could not pass into their lands the santoth destroyed them with fire with worms that dropped from the sky and rolled across the plains flattening the grasses and leaving them charred with diseases that blistered their skin and split their hooves and ignited their hides and dagon stopped reading the words burned his eyes it was all as horrible as he had feared before if he had read descriptions like this he would have thought them the fancies of imaginative if twisted minds now he read them as truths that might as well have been written in the paving cement the queen had recently had spread across the streets of the lower town the santoth were loose in the world again soon to have the book that would grant them even greater power they would each of them be as strong as tinhadin ever was and much more twisted how would they punish the world then how long before they turned one against the other theyll destroy us all dagon said only corinn could possibly fight their sorcery but she regardless of what had happened to her in the carmelia the clock of her life was winding down and she didnt know it if she didnt act quickly theyll destroy us all he said again dagon heard graus voice what use is going to rapture if it all comes crashing down in a few years he tried to laugh but he only managed to blow air through his nose it is the end of rapture he called for his secretary the man stepped into the room before the sound of his voice had faded he glanced around for a moment looking as aghast at the state of the place and then found dagon with his eyes sire i will visit the palace he said send a messenger to alert them prepare an escort ishtat to go as far as the royal grounds do it just now i must see no not the queen i shouldnt want to see her or tell her what i have to make it the king aliver i mean ill tell him arrange it the secretary nodded but did not set to it he worked his nervousness with fingers curling them over each other like spider legs you will have to change sire your clothing dagon looked down yes im filthy this is not my blood i dont know if it is blood its filth its well run a bath the man said ill get fresh clothes well burn those do not concern yourself with them he darted away into the silence after his departure dagon said he thinks youre mad you fool he ran his fingers over the crackly yellowed pages of jeflens account he flipped the pages absently lost not in thought but in the absence of it so much to think through and yet he felt empty his gaze drifted down to the pages of their own account his eyes began to move across the words there with an interest not really matched by the mind seeing through them monsters the words described monsters wolves leviathans a great worm at the black bottom of the ocean he tore his eyes away what am i thinking i cant go to the queen and tell her shes dead on her feet that would be madness dont make yourself a fool dagon he called his secretary back and retracted the message to the palace fortunately it had not yet been sent bring me parchment and a pen oh and the fading ink ill write a note much better idea and then alert all the staffeveryone essentialthat we are leaving leaving sire yes we will take everything we can and go for how long sire assume that we will not be returning at all end of book two chapter thirtynine mena arrived back at mein tahalian partially snowblind with the tips of her fingers and toes frozen twigs yellow patches on her nose and cheeks despite the protests of perrin and the other officers she did not go to the physician she slept right there in the relative warmth of the stables curled against elyas exhausted body mena let attendants pull off her boots and gloves and then ordered them to step back when her hands and feet were free she pressed them up against her mounts plumage she slept like that the two of them dead to the world and nearly dead outright it was the best thing she could have done when she awoke hours later she lay for a time without moving knowing that any motion would stir the interest of the people watching over her she could tell that life had tingled back into her limbs and facial skin stimulated by that amazing healing power that elyas feathers had she was whole again she would still be able to grip a sword to run into battle though she very much wished that she could roll over and return to sleep she knew she could not images of mornings she had lain wrapped in her sheets in the palace rose up to haunt her as a girl as a woman with the heat of melios body just a fingers breadth away days spent stretched naked on her pallet in vumu or times she had watched the morning chase the stars from a bedroll in talay she hated that those moments were forever in the past they taunted they teased her they would not let her go but she could not have them back either they were moments of peace that seemed impossible luxuries now had life ever been so carefree she did not trust that those moments had ever been as she imagined but she wanted them so badly for those first few waking moments that she bled tears as her body healed and then she rose and called her officers for a briefing in which she explained what she had seen and done instead of flying to the coronation after that she sent several letters via messenger bird to acacia detailing everything she had learned from her meeting with the auldek and everything she now planned she wrote things in fact that she had not disclosed to her own captains she askedmore openly than she ever had more like a younger sister than ever beforefor any guidance corinn could offer that done she kept moving she did all the things she had to as she waited for a response all the tasks and problems and duties that kept her from being too much with herself she mustered the troops she sent horsemen riding for all the remote northern settlements they could safely reach warning that war was upon them they should evacuate for the south if possible or come to see out the winter in tahalian if they could not with her officers she went over battle plans and studied charts and calculated the probable toll in human lives it was not an arithmetic she could live with though she betrayed no sign of it secretly she met alone with haleeven and the scav kant talking late into the night the work of each day kept her busy every minute she hoped to hear back from corinn from aliver for that matter though she could not yet really believe he lived part of her clung to a hope that corinn would find some way to fix it all a solution only her cunning mind could manage something that would save the troops mena had grown to love she slept little and when she did she often woke in the pitchblack of the meinish night her mind a cacophony of concerns problems calculations doubts on occasion she started awake in the hope that corinn was there in the room with her or a dreamtravel version of her moving in perrins body but that did not happen nothing came back from the south nothing at all behind it all she chastised herself for not having done better when she spoke to the auldek she should have found a way to make peace with them instead she had let anxious bravado snap her tongue puff out her chest like some adolescent boys because of it they would have war because of it many would die that had always been the purpose of her missionnot so much to defeat the auldek but to blunt their attack so that a second army led by the queen could finish them what sort of plan was that a desperate one a cruel one one with a cold calculating efficiency that she did her best to sharpen even while she did not secretly accept it as the only way at the last meeting she was to have with her officers before some of them went into the field she asked them to attend her after all the other business had been concluded the troops were again gathering inside the calathrock to hear their orders as a group one last time within that chamber before you go to them she said i have two things to ask of you im sure you have all thought much about why we were sent here weve had even more time since coming here to tahalian but things will unfold quickly from now on i think it best that we are honest about it we are not marching to defeat the auldek ive seen them we cant do that not with the troops we have they control the air so we cannot surprise them or flank them or any such thing when we fight them it will be in the open our cunning against their might bledas the marah captain began to tout the training they had put in recently mena quieted him just by touching him with her eyes all that aside bledas we dont march to defeat them i need us all to acknowledge this our task is to die fighting them to die to kill as many of them as possible and to hurt and delay them as much as we can to fall so that our bodies trip their feet and slow them that way they will enter the known world battered and frozen weakened it will then fall upon the next army to destroy them if we do our work theyll be able to but none of us should think that we will see that victory i want to ask two things of you first i ask you to decide today that you are going to die in this fight i need each of you to do that if you cannot you may leave my service letting this sit with them she glanced around the room at each mans face offering him the opportunity to respond talkative edell said nothing bledas worked his finger into a crack in the old wooden table percevens senivalian mouth narrow and full pursed accentuating the two mountain peaks of his upper lip mena read thought behind the gesture kissing life goodbye thats what he was doing haleeven was a comfort to look upon his face was solid untroubled as if he welcomed this conversation and thought it right perrin watched her with his lovers eyes despite herself she had often wondered if melio would mind if she sought solace in the soldiers arms she would not do it but at times she wished to all right mena said now the second thing i want you to go before me to your troops tell them what i have just told you make them the same offer princess mena edell started we cant offer them i have to mena said i wont order soldiers to die ill lead them to it but not command them ive thought about this a long time edell you will not change my mind i will command an army only of willing soldiers thats what i want for acacia after this war if we are to win it we must start now so thats all if you wish to leave my service do so now if not go and speak to your soldiers she said this with all the calm resolution she could muster and then she stood as the men filed out she wondered that she could manage to show so little emotion on her face and then she realized it was because she felt so little emotion she was just saying what was true what she believed and had to say and to do a nd yet an hour later she could not pretend as she approached the doors behind which the entire army was gathered in the calathrock that her insides werent knotted and her palms sweaty and her jaw muscles sore from being locked in a clench she was not even aware of she was supposed to be returning with a blessing from aliver reborn instead she had returned with a choice of life or death what would she do if each and every one of them took her up on her offer to leave she had no plan for that no speech to change their minds no heart to keep them against their will if it comes to that she thought the auldek will truly witness a sight to laugh at a lone princess with a sword come to vanquish the lot of them all by herself a soldier pulled the door open for her she stepped into the underground chamber and knew that she never had anything to fear not with soldiers like hers not with free hearts like theirs men who knew why they fought and did so out of their own convictions that she thought is what acacia should be it was what it could be and it was the reason she would not be standing all by herself before the auldek not by a long shot t he next day the first contingents of scouts and supply trains began the march that would prepare the way northeast along the perimeter of the black mountains around them and north into the ice fields where she intended to meet the invading auldek not one of her soldiers had abandoned her they playfully shamed her for even thinking any of them might they joked perrin told her that she had been mistaken if she thought she commanded them against their will perhaps in the first few weeks yes but after that they were with her because they wanted to be she was one of them and they would be proud to die with her soldier after soldier told her this each speaking it low like a secret like a declaration of love morbid as it was it was good very good to hear the body of the army left the steaming warmth of mein tahalian in a long narrow column they traveled mostly on foot draped in layers of furs and woolens and oiltreated outer skins hoods pulled tight around their faces with glass shields to protect their eyes they carried packs on their backs necessary for they did not have enough sleds or dogs to pull all their supplies it would be slow tortuous progress but they had all known that the day never fully lightened instead the sun skimmed the rim of the world sending slanting rays of light over the land for several hours before disappearing they traveled on in the dark sighting on fires the scouts had prepared for them mena would have marched right along beside them but haleeven convinced her that was a selfindulgent gesture the troops know you would suffer beside them and that means you dont have to prove it you mean more to us in the sky princess thats what the men need to see so she had taken to the sky on elya mena soared above them riding down the long column from end to end marveling both at how small it was on the landscape and at how much it filled her with pride the first week out she flew back from the marching column to tahalian as often as she could knowing that any correspondence from acacia would not easily get beyond the fortress no bird could be trained to seek out a moving army in a hostile landscape and any messenger sent after them from tahalian would have to travel slowly in pursuit of a target that was moving away from them eventually she had to give up hope of receiving any correspondence she did not even have a bird left to send with a final message she did write two missives though and left them with the villagers gathered to shelter in the fortress when a bird did reach them from the south they would forward her letters for her one addressed to her sister and brother one to her husband and then she left she circled above tahalian for a time looking down at the scruffy snowcovered wildness of it for what she thought was likely her last time strange how a place that she had once thought of as an enemys lair had come to feel so quickly like a second home is all the world like that she wondered perhaps if we take the time and give our enemies a chance o ne morning a week later gandrel requested mena join him on a glacierscoured hillside as perrin was briefing her for the day he went as well the hillside afforded a view of the passing army and well out toward the terrain ahead of them the black mountains gnawed at the sky off to the west but they were no obstacle to them it was the jumble of frozen debris out on the northern horizon that was mena had seen it from above yesterday but had planned on getting a better look today the low light made the shapes mysterious hard to make sense of all shadow and highlight the stuff seemed to change shape and color even as she stared at it those are slabs of sea ice gandrel said he handed her his spyglass beautiful stuff to look at like green and blue glass when the light hits it right but its treacherous its been getting pushed up against the shore since elenet threw the givers world into chaos crossing it will be miserable rife with fissures crevices and weak spots its always moving see breathing as the season changesbelieve it or not itll be a few days of allout scrambling id say feet and hands ropes hauling and praying to the giver itll be hard to camp in there might need to divide up at night to find decent spots well lose some men animals too only good news is that beyond it once were well out away from where the ice buckles against the shore it goes smooth good place to have a battle id say theres no other way perrin asked i never came this far north so i dont know but are you sure there isnt some alternative no theres no other way from what the scav told me and from where mena met them the auldek will come this way take elya out and scout just in case princess but im as sure as i can be i dont doubt you mena said lowering the spyglass we could wait for them here perrin said let them do the work of crossing the stuff gandrel pursed his thick lips released them wont be the obstacle for them that it is for us not if theyve come this far already mena thought for a while no we cant sit here waiting for them wed lose more than wed gain the auldek wouldnt do it if we do theyll see it as a sign of cowardice plus they have many flying creatures to our one those alone could make life miserable for us and she thought our men might start to think they can flee south if things go bad i dont want them thinking that not yet at least it was an uncharitable thought out of keeping with the brave mood of the men she could not help having it but she did not choose to voice it id rather we meet them boldly all at once both men seemed to accept this gandrel moved on i called you because i wanted to show you something else here he motioned for her to lift the spyglass again waited for her to squint an eye and pressed the open one against it he adjusted its direction a little way before the ice begins just west of due north do you see them she would not have unless he had directed her to them and still it took a moment to see the moving figures antlike even within the warped view of the glass a line of people worked their way toward the ice slabs they were not numerous who are they perrin asked those arent auldek soldiers and theyre not ours no gandrel agreed theyre scav what are they doing here they want to join us if so somebody should tell them to wait not join us no thats not the scav way he squinted out toward them though mena could not imagine he could see them with his naked eye theyve got something planned though perrin motioned for the spyglass looking through it he asked how do we know its not treachery against us to aid the auldek gandrel scoffed no chance they hate them with every stringy muscle in their bodies and theyre not hiding even at this distance theyll know exactly where we are the scav want us to know theyre with us but i dont imagine theyll want any official welcome when they want to become invisible they do if i know them well not see much of them however if theyre going to help us theyll follow no ones orders but their own smiling mena said they sound like trouble for the auldek lets hope wave to them and wish them well i say mena happily did so t hey crossed the edge of the ice fields as soon as the light allowed the next morning from ground level it was hard to measure what faced them from above mena could see the width of the jumble but it was still hard to make sense of the shifting colors and shadows the glasslike shadings and hidden crevices it was not a territory meant for humans a landscape that in no way acknowledged the possibility of people traversing it elya despised the place she did not even like landing among it when mena forced her to touch down her feet slid skittish and unwilling to settle her wings flapping mena had to resign herself to shouting her encouragement from the air throughout her flights mena saw no sign of the scav group at all but on one flight north she spotted the coming army rolling and marching torches burning against the coming night their flying beasts saw her as well several of the winged creatures flew toward her in response she and elya rose high circled away in a manner just leisurely enough to show no fear of course mena did feel fear for the first time in weeks she realized she had not thought of protecting elya from all this hadnt she always said elya would never see war what happened to the resolve with which she had spoken to corinn she had meant it but instead of staying true to it she had taken elya into danger far from acacia a world away from the talayan grassland on which mena had found her what right did she have to do that the worst of it was that she had taken elya away from her children she did not even know what elya thought of that if she thought anything of them she kept it hidden no trace of what emotion she might feel in her mind that more than anything made mena believe that elya was hiding her thoughts from her selfish mistress she who was too afraid to face death alone mena thought all these things but she did nothing to change it this is how we are with the ones we love she thought too afraid to set them free she hovered at the edge of the flat ice waiting for her army to join her watching the enemy emerge into reality they rose out of the ice on feet and hooves and wheels leaping into the air winged she whispered a prayer to the giver hoping that the plan she had come up with might work might even save some of her soldiers lives that evening once the army was through the ice maze and settling in to camp mena called her officers to council inside a tent flapping and loud from the wind that had kicked up she said this i thought it necessary that each soldier come here of his own free will and that each of them face death as a foregone conclusion i will never be able to explain how proud i am of every one of our soldiers you dont have to explain it perrin said we feel it too then you wont be surprised that i am not willing to send them all to their deaths she let that sink in her eyes drifted from one face to the next the candlelight they huddled around made them look like somber participants at some arcane ritual it will not she thought be a blood sacrifice ive been trying hard to find a way that some of them might live while also doing what we can to hurt the auldek i think i have such a plan it will require treachery deceit it will not be entirely honorable certainly not in keeping with the old codes im liking the sound of this gandrel said his creviced face was one of the most frightening in the light no less because he was smiling never had much use for the codes anyway and treachery and deceit are underrated the others laughed it will also require you to trust the scav mena said this was not met with quite the same joviality haleeven explain to them what weve worked out with kant and his people as the old warrior began to speak mena withdrew to watch the unsteady light play across the mens faces it was a lot to ask of them she knew to hear the scheme from the mouth of one of the empires recent enemies and to learn that it involved depending on a ragged people that scrounged a living out of frozen waste so far to the edge of the world that they lived on unmapped terrain strange indeed but it felt right necessary if they were to win this war they would have to remake how their society worked in the process that might as well begin here she thought with us chapter forty as they came down from the mountainous wave peaks of the range when they caught their first glimpse of the barrier islands of the other lands and when shore birds darted out to greet them melio decided that he might not die on this voyage after all it would not make sense to die now not after getting this far not after seeing so much and especially not after what happened that night on the slipfin one doesnt have such moments without reason the night that kartholome called them out of the cabin into the glowing slithering motion was the strangest melio had ever experienced all around themwhere there had been calm water for daysshapes rose and fell and rolled like enormous chunks of luminous writhing and somehow living ice the ocean was these creatures they pressed so thick around them that the boat shimmied and rocked with the pressure of their bodies brushing against the ships hull they were silent save the wet sounds of their motions and an occasional expulsion of saltrich vapor from slits along their bodies for all the terrified beating of his heart melio could not move none of them could we shouldnt have spoken of them clytus whispered these are sea wolves be calm lads calm for the moment theyre nothing like wolves melio said they did not look as they were depicted on the mural inside but then again in all the slurping seething of their bodies melio could make no sense of their forms whitish hulks yes tentacles and rippling ridges and flat circular eyes yes but he had no feeling for the whole of any one of them it just felt that the sea had been revealed for what it really wasa mass tangle of slippery sentient life geena brushed his shoulder i dont think youre the first to notice that stop joking kartholome said theyll swarm us in a moment he moved over to a pile of spears he began untying the ropes that held them in place clytus seeing what he was about joined him they moved on tiptoe with stealth that melio thought absurd considering the massive round eyes that watched every move as they rose and fell and slid along above the railing melio still did not move it was not fear that held him immobile though fear did pump through him with every pulse of his heart something else froze him and kept him staring he could not help but notice that the creatures seemed to be caressing the slipfin searching it learning its contours he could not shake the feeling that the eyes paid even more attention to him than they did the men lifting weapons to hurl into them a tentacle slipped over the railing slid across the deck and then withdrew he knew what he should think that was a probe searching for victims there would be another and then another and then they would tear the ship apart and consume them in a savage swarm of course they would kartholome said something and jerked at his arm melio looked down to find a harpoon in his hands it was old worn a discard bought cheaply in bleem kartholome had spent days sharpening the blade the iron barb of its point was deadly enough when melio raised his head he was eye to eye with one of the creatures its orb rose above the railing as the leviathan slipped along the ships side plastered by the pressure of the wolves behind it the lid closed a strange circular motion to it nothing like the workings of a human eyelid melio lifted the harpoon into throwing position there was a target if ever he saw one he watched the vague outline of himself and his companions reflected in the eye warped by its shape and the moisture dripping down it instead of sinking the harpoon into itas he knew the others were preparing to dohe wondered just what the creature saw looking at him he had never questioned such things when looking into the eyes of the foulthings he had felt only their abhorrence the awful war with life that raged within them this eye contained none of that this eye saw him it knew him and it he found his tongue just when kartholome pulled back his arm harpoon high in it no he whispered he wanted to scream it but feared raising his voice no kartholome heard him weapon still raised he snapped his head toward him his face savage with questions impatient dont was all melio could say in answer how could he begin to explain what he himself could not believe that the creatures meant them no harm and that they would do harm only if they were attacked dont if he had not shared the experience that followed with the others he would have thought it a dream a vision conjured up from the eerie stillness he bent over and set his harpoon on the deck stepping forward he raised a hand and held it near the creatures slick skin its eye watched him completely still now he touched just beside it the eyelid opened and shut with its bizarre circular motion but that was all a moment later melio turned as geena let out a gasp a tentacle had stretched across the deck and touched her leg it drew back and rose mobile and lithe and completely inhuman it touched geenas hand she responded by raising it and the tentacle moved with her by the giver clytus said what is this melio did not know but he knew not to fight it he knew he had discovered something and that it was huge that it was important in this was something that nobody living knew if he did not make a misstep he might someday find out what and then it ended the creatures pulled back their tentacles and slipped away from the ship they became seething motion again the slipfin rocked as they released their grip on it the bell high on the mainmast tinkled first with the swaying and then to announce the wind that filled the sails a moment later melio glanced up just for a moment when he turned his eyes to the sea it was water once more not a creature to be seen whats more it was water in waving rippling motion waves building right before his eyes come on then clytus said his captains eyes already scanning the swells the wind pushed them toward theres a range of waves between us and spratling lets ride it they were blown right into them and spent the next two days rising and falling over peaks incredible to behold clytus and kartholome took turns at the wheel together they steered them through coming out on the other side was a relief only shortly for there on the horizon were new peaks of stone this time also they caught glimpses of ships sails no time to rest or be pleased with themselves they were in as much danger now as ever kartholomes systematic rummaging through the captains library paid off at least in bits and pieces of knowledge that they put to use their vessel had clearly not been assigned to the other lands but there was still information about the place to be found they studied a chart detailing the barrier islands at length determining the best route to the mainland which the map called ushen brae melio had never heard the name before but he liked the feel of it on his tongue of course he thought the lands would have their own name they werent the other to themselves were they to avoid the angerwallwhich kartholome was not sure how to navigatethey decided to sail north around the islands then come down along the coast the islands up that way appeared to be less developed than the ones to the south they would put ashore north of avina and travel toward the city on foot the plan was simple if incomplete while avoiding the league and ishtat patrols they would search for the quota slaves with their help they would learn what they could about dariels fate before they had seen any trace of the quota slaves however they came upon a bounty of league vessels the galleys appeared behind them as they cut between a large island that the map named eigg and the small skerries that trickled away to the north first three ships and then two more in the distance they stretched many stories tall but had a sleek appearance different from the bulky brigs with more sails than melio could count from their viewpoint on the slipfin the league ships looked carnivorous sawing through the waves behind them what are they up to kartholome said there was a tenor of dread in his voice similar to when he called them out to see the sea wolves i know those ships never set eyes on them but id heard talk they were building them five war galleys thats them all right they can each carry eight hundred soldiers not counting the ships crew theres tons of storage capacity in them but theyre fast with keels that barracudas would envy steel reinforced with turrets baskets for crossbowmen he looked at melio if the league sent these here its because they mean to take over the place clytus kept the slipfin moving north at a steady clip and the others did their best to stay visible on deck and up in the rigging if anyone on the galleys studied them through a spyglass it would be obvious the boat was undercrewed kartholome ran up a flag that he said was a greeting to the other boats acknowledging them but also indicating that they were on a mission they could not interrupt the ruse may not even have been necessary once the first galleys rounded a long isthmus at the tip of eigg they looped around and lowered some sails they were apparently going to anchor there yeah theyre all pulling in kartholome confirmed some time later one eye stuck to a spyglass as the slipfin sailed away from them should wei dont knowspy on them circle back after dark and get a better look no clytus said we didnt come to get caught by the league lets get out of here they caught sight of avina at dusk the citys stone walls pressed right up against the sea the sky behind them scalloped with crimsonhighlighted clouds they sailed northwest along the coast not daring to get too close to the city in the slipfin the land changed to stretches of agricultural fields by dark they were past those skimming cautiously along a maze of wooded coves and inlets pulling in to one of these they spent the night at anchor the next morning they left the slipfin in as secluded a cove as they could disembarked and set out toward avina on foot i t was kartholome who first realized what the plants were they had walked through them from late in the afternoon through the better part of the night rows and rows of low shrubs with long green leaves that silvered in the moonlight they stretched on for miles though the fields were deserted as far as they could tell it had not been long since they had been tended they were uniform in height recently pruned and the ground between them weeded the plants bore no fruit but they did have fuzzy clusters of flowers that gathered around a long somewhat phallic protuberance melio acknowledged that it might have been his imagination but they seemed to grow longer after nightfall as if they were growing aroused at the sight of the moons round glow kartholome walking at the front of their line paused when geena called for a break to relieve herself as she went off he stood fingering one of the plants erections melio felt inclined to make a joke but he could not think of one fast enough these are thread fields kartholome said he pulled his hand away stared at it a moment and then wiped his palm on his trouser legs he looked at the others mist this is where they grow the mist cant you smell it the moment he said it melio knew he was right he could smell it a pungent scent musky and almost animal it had been there when they entered the fields but it grew thicker in the air as he breathed the realization somehow made the ranks upon ranks of shrubs look suddenly ominous he could almost see the scent the flowers pollen released to their lover the night wafting on the air searching for victims clytus called geena lets get out of these fields before we all see visions she did not answer they all cast around she was nowhere to be seen there was nothing around them but miles of the plants geena you squatting in the bushes mind you dont touch them too much the silence was solid around them geena what are you up to girl when the first figure rose there was no possibility that it was geena he appeared a few feet past kartholome a tall tusked being lit by the moon wide shouldered and for a horrible second not even human he looked gray skinned but that may have been a trick of the light before the shout of alarm was all the way out of melios mouth the thing dashed toward kartholome it struck him hard on the head with some sort of club shoved his limp body into the bushes and came on toward melio out of the corners of his eyes he saw other figures emerging from the plants converging on them in a sudden savage attack clytus cried out in pain melio did not get to turn around to see the tusked thing was before him his bent arm raised to strike again melio dodged under it he brushed past the man under his arm slamming a fist into a rockhard abdomen as he did he spun fast drawing his dagger he hoped to kick his attackers knee from the back and send him sprawling but the man was already facing him melio went for him knife flashing as he struck the man slipped beneath his attack kicked one of his legs from under him and swept back around on him he accomplished exactly the move melio had intended melio had just enough time to acknowledge that the horned man was fast for someone so bulky and to appreciate that he had misjudged him then the mans weight fell on him hard the impact blew all the air out of him melio dropped his knife as his face smashed into the dirt he might even have lost consciousness for a second the next thing he knew a fist yanked his head back by the hair and his own blade pricked his throat chapter fortyone not for the first time aliver broke away from the councils ongoing sessionwith its various arms and offshoots crowded with dignitaries and senators and military personal all of them baffled and accusatory fearful and more angry for their fear selfrighteous because of it speaking in sureties because they were unsure of anything and mourning some of them were in mourning so much noise reports had come in about the santoth raging their way across prios across to danos on the mainland and inland toward calfa ven panic spread throughout the empire faster than messenger birds could fly aliver needed to get away just for a while to clear his head and of course to check on his sister he stopped before he reached her quarters he stood in the open air in the courtyard between corinns wing and aadens he knew what he would find if he entered her inner doors would still be shut her guards and maids still huddled nervously outside she had pushed them all out herself locked herself in she even beat back her own guards with a masked fury they said that blackened one marahs eye and scratched channels in anothers chin as much as aliver wanted to believe she would be there welcoming him he knew nothing would have changed not yet if it had he would have known already the night was noisy with muted life with whispers and coughs and the hushed conversations of servants without work to turn to and nobles without the promised festivities no one slept every torch and lamp burned the very stones of the palace seemed uneasy confused shifting these were meant to be days of rejoicing of pipes and drums and fiddles through to the dawn of food and wine hope and pride there was none of that aliver stood his head tilted and his eyes drifting over a mudbrown sky there was not a star to be seen behind the oppressive murk that seemed as clear a sign as any that what he remembered of the day had really happened no stars mud in the sky misery in a stadium filled for rejoicing and corinn aliver had a vision of what he had seen as corinns head snapped back but he could not credit it it was a mistake of his eyes in a blurred moment of confusion something had happened to her but surely not what he thought he had seen corinn had hidden her face she fell down among her guards and twisted away clawing at her mouth aliver had seen her from the back it looked in one instant as if she had pulled her hands away from her face and screamed her neck and shoulders shuddered with the effort but there was no sound such a scream as her body appeared to be issuing would have been vast rending but there was nothing so it could not have been a scream he had been jostled away from her as the marah pressed them to flee next time he saw corinn she was on her feet with the shawl that had been over her shoulders wrapped tightly around her face clamped in place with a whiteknuckled hand her eyes caught his a moment in them he saw the scream he could not hear it was more terrible for the utter silence of it all this because the santoth had appeared from nowhere they had stepped out of a void out of memories that he had within him but that he had not explored since his return to life why had he not asked about them he had never said a word about them for that matter he had not questioned corinns use of sorcery again he knew that he had always knownreally knownthat so much was wrong about what she was doing yet he had never said a word against her because of it these sorcerers were free in the world bent on things he could not yet imagine why didnt i know aliver asked himself why didnt i know it before a passing maid started at his voice she stood stockstill with bed linens pinned to her chest aliver turned away waving that he had not meant to address her he walked down the shallow stairs to the upper courtyard across it to one of the railings it was the same one at which he had stood beside aaden the previous morning to the east the indication of the coming sun just barely lightened the horizon faint only nibbling at the dark slugthick sky the sea of boats still surrounded the island alight with torches and small fires it looked like a living thing something breathing but pocked with flaming fumaroles would it have looked any different if the events of the day had not turned so foul or was it just the eyes of the watcher that gave character to the world aliver realized he had not asked a question like that in some time it felt familiar though the melancholia of it the leaning toward doubt yes his mind felt more his own than it had since he had awoken to life again there was a burden in this but truth as well for the first time a thought rose in him he could not grasp it yet he just knew it was there he could smell it could hunt it his thoughts turned to the santoth again the others had wanted to know why he had never warned them of their evil he had lived with them hadnt he didnt he know them better than anyone living there was accusation in the questions an edge that grew as the nights hours curled toward dawn he could not answer them what they said was true deep in the desert south he had shared a strange halfstone existence with them thoughts had flown silently between them messages floated on a spectral tide that ebbed and flowed with a rhythm outside the worlds turning time he had been so sure that the santoth were what they said they were that they held themselves in exile for the good of the world they had helped so much in so many ways during his war with hanish mein they had destroyed maeanders forces in one afternoon could that all really have been in service to a goal of greater evil of course it was he understood it now the thinness of the lies they had told were so transparent now he had always felt it but just not known he felt it he had wanted to believe them so he had their language may have been corrupted by time but that was not what made it foul it had always been foul time had just eaten away at it further he grew up believing tinhadin was a noble man tinhadin he who built a mighty empire and then banished the sorcerers who would in their greed have destroyed it he who gave up sorcery himself because he knew it was too chaotic a tool for humans to wield that in alivers youth had been the truth of the past and then it wasnt the santoth said the truth was something else tinhadin had banished them not as an act of good for the world but because he wanted the world all to himself he was like an eagle chick the strongest of the brood that kicked his siblings out of the nest so that only he could live and thrive and grow the santoth faithful servants had been betrayed thats what they told him speaking right into his mind making the thought his if brought back into the world they would again be his faithful servants how badly aliver had wanted to believe that how clever of them to discover that he wanted to believe it for thats what they had done in his communion with them they had explored every memory of his life every desire and ambition and fear he knew that at the time but thought it a good thing he wanted them to know him how good it felt to be completely understood without judgment he had thought now he was certain that they had used what they learned to shape the lies they told him something else troubled him though as yet he only nibbled the edges of it in defeating maeander on the plains of teh the santoth had saved the acacian empire they had kept the akaran line in power what if the true reason they did that was so that they might have still other chances of a future generation of akarans freeing them thats what they had said a child of his freed them and freed them into a world still ruled by akarans a world in which the song of elenet had not been entirely forgotten a child of his a child of his somehow he knew that to be right there was a child of his but where in the world was this child your majesty a marah guard approached nervously he snapped to attention as soon as aliver turned to look at him what is it we received a message from sire dagon his messenger said a marah should bring it to you and that you had to read it without delay is that what he said it was more a statement than a question aliver raised a hand and the soldier slipped the folded square of paper into it he unfolded the paper beneath the light of one of the oil torches set atop a pillar the note was written in brown ink the letters a little tremulous like those shaped by the hand of an elderly person prince aliver this is quite awkward to write i hope youll forgive my lack of grace i have to inform you that you and the people of the empire have been killed he stopped exhaled through his nose and then read over the lines again to make sure he had not misread i have to inform you that you and the people of the empire have been killed poisoned i need not explain to you how i know this but it is a certainty i am in part responsible for it both you and the queen are quite dead its only a matter of weeks until your bodies realize it as for the people of empire they have been addicted once again to a distillation of the mist that will kill them when they are denied it its in the wine you see the very vintage they have been toasting you with this was the queens doing though she did not know the deadliness of it if ever you hated and despised the league and thought us treacherous villains well then let that ire rise in you again now accept that what i say is the truth why do i tell you this i thought it important that you know and ive come to believe that your death is unfortunately timed i believe that you are a decent man and that you and the queen want in your peculiar way what is best for the empire i acknowledge that it may only be the queen who can save the known world from destruction that is why ive made this admission aliver please encourage corinn to be quick in finding a way to defeat the santoth neither of you have much time if you love your nation be quick if you are its possible the league will continue to supply the vintage thereby keeping the empire alive yours fondly sire dagon of the league of vessels a liver still sat there on the balcony some time later the coming day was clearly visible in the east now the oil in the torch beside him had burned low the flame wavered now sending up more black smoke than before he had been watching the changing appearance of the ships in the harbor as the light increased the patchwork of vessels looked more and more like a ragged scab on the skin of the ocean it was smaller than it had been the day before fraying around the edges people are leaving he thought i cannot blame them for that he opened the note again thinking he had it backward he flipped the page over there was nothing there he held it to the uncertain light of the torch he could just make out the tracing of the words that had once been there even as he watched they faded further right before his eyes they vanished completely for a long moment aliver entertained the possibility that the paper had always been blank he had imagined the words he read wouldnt that make more sense than that they were true as soon as he raised his eyes and saw the sun had just broken from the horizon he let that idea go fading ink thats all it was the words may have disappeared but they had been chiseled in his consciousness and remained with him uncle turning he saw aaden the boy had stopped some distance away near a torch that lit him in rippling orange waves shadowshis maids guardshung behind him is it all destroyed his voice edged away from its usual calm he captured the pitch of it but it was tremulous ready to turn no aaden aliver began but he could not find the words to continue the boy moved forward slowly i had a dream once i told mother i said i had a dream that the world ended she said that was silly that it could never happen but i knew it could do you know why because in the dream she died she died and the moment she did the world did as well i was left but the world had ended thats what i meant but she didnt ask me she never asked me about it maybe she never will now is that the truth aliver closed the space between them he gripped aaden to his chest thankful that the boy had not witnessed most of what happened in the carmelia and relieved that he would never be able to read the words of dagons note those were things to be grateful for corinn had whispered a spell that spirited him away at the first sign of trouble one moment he was there the next he was gone she loves you he said she loves you she took care of you first thats the truth aaden shifted against him trying to break the embrace aliver kept his arms knotted wanting to hold him like that forever to keep him a child forever to protect him from a world that constantly made a mockery of those who struggled to live in it if somebody had just held him forever when he was a child just held him and never let life twist on wheres mother the boy asked his words muffled what happened to her nobody will tell me its something bad i know that already i know what happened with the santoth i know they killed people and want the song of elenet i heard that already but nobody will tell me anything about my mother youll see her soon i want to see her now aaden writhed he shoved his uncle back slapping his arms and chest in sudden fury aliver took the blows without flinching trying to soothe him by being there to be scratched and hit he spoke nonsense just sounds just meaningless words he tried to bring aaden back into his embrace tearing away aaden glared at his uncle he had never looked more savage his features twisted with anger wrung through with the fatigue of fear shes dead he shouted spittle flying from his mouth shes dead and you wont tell me no no shes not i swear it why wont you let me see her then you will aaden give her time im not stopping you she just needs a little time to herself ah but that sounded daft insulting simple it sounded just as stupid as the things adults had said to him after his father had been stabbed by thasren mein just as vapid and untrue something happened he said quickly i dont know what aaden she fought with the santoth and something happened she is here though in the palace she walked here on her own two feet she went to her quarters thats all i know aaden please lets wait together lets find out more together the boy kept the glare on his features turning it down just slightly stop squeezing me like im a baby treat me like an adult like a prince aliver let his arms drop like a prince will you stop yes aaden studied him a moment skeptical and then said his tone growing surer if shes not dead stop acting like she is whatever has happened shell fix it he did not say it but aliver thought certainty such as that marked the boy as yet a child he had never found certainty to be a hallmark of wisdom let him have certainty though for as long as he can carry it if anyone can he said your mother can rhrenna emerged out of the shadows though she wore the same garment as at the coronation the sparkle that had danced around her was gone she looked tense frail as if her sharp features might shatter if there was too loud a noise aliver remembered the infatuation he felt for her before the ceremony where had that gone im sorry she said im sorry to disturb you does corinn want us no she still hasnt spoken to anyone she wont answer my knocking i dont know what shes doing in there she glanced at aaden hesitated im sure though that shes fine she was strong enough to push out her guards dont comfort me like a child aaden said i am a prince rhrenna wilted a little but kept her chin high and spoke i know that your highness i know that bad things happen aaden said he looked sulky for a moment and then added i know that much is expected of me mother told me so i know it already stop both of you acting like im weak make me strong instead i will aliver said if you help me rhrenna what have you come for then the priestess of vada sent a messenger they consider the ceremony to be complete you are the king i dont feel like one was alivers flat response anything else the council wants you back more senators have joined them they say there is still more to discuss ive talked with them enough theyre just going in circles let them talk to themselves if they want to keep at it ill wait for corinn we go no further without her tell them that rhrenna nodded theyre asking after her what would you have me tell them to wait tell them im working with her tell them to look toward tomorrow and plan what they can we still have the auldek to consider remind them not to forget that aaden cleared his throat you cant put everything off until tomorrow whatever is wrong with mother we must do what we have to aaden i wont sleep for a moment until i know just whats happened and just what were to do about it im not putting anything off talking in circles with the likes of sigh saden will not help anything what will lets figure that out and lets do it aliver wanted to hug the boy again all right aaden i think we should find out more about who the santoth really are if were going to fight them we must know them i thought i did but i was wrong and we should have friends with us aaden said ones we trust ones we can listen to and who will listen to us dont you think thats important yes mother didnt she didnt trust people he paused challenging him to disagree she didnt even trust you do you know that she brought you back to life but not all the way i could tell from the first day i saw you its because i know her magic shes always shown me things she brought you partly but not all the way do you know what i mean the thought that had been shapeless inside aliver took a step closer im beginning to he said just having the boy name the thing he had always suspected helped him yes his mind had been his own but constrained molded in ways he had not recognized it still was he knew lets go to the library i want books around me it will be our sanctuary do you promise me that you will be truthful to me about everything looking at the boys determined face he heard the words come out of his mouth of course ill tell you everything he realized that they escaped him so easily because the spells that bound his thoughts did not recognize them as truth such lies are so easy because they are so completely the fabric of life yet now though he said the same words that a liar would he meant them he said everything i think i will do aaden everything that is true i will say because nothing matters now but the truth and if my lips hesitate i will trick them i will say such truths as can only be mistaken for lies how about that thats how it should always have been aaden said chapter fortytwo the day of his departure arrived so quickly that dariel felt he had barely rested at all he had not gotten to visit any but the nearest other village though over the week he was in residenceon display reallyat the elders village a steady stream of pilgrims from the lose network of settlements stopped by to gawk at him he had not learned a fraction of the things he had hoped to but he did not imagine that another week or two or a month or more would be enough the peoples history was too tied with auldek history with the lothan aklun and with aspects of his own kind that he was yet coming to grips with i dont like leaving you unprotected here dariel said to yoen as they strolled toward the edge of the village and the path that the others had already taken down to the river a tributary of the sheeven lek and the fastest method for returning to the coast i know the auldek are gone but i wouldnt put it past the league to cause you grief i dont think so the league is going to cause you grief that i believe yoen touched him on the shoulder with a gentle pressure he turned him toward the path to the river we will be fine dariel nobody will attack us here we have nothing to fear but the cathounds and freketes and dou worms he clicked his tongue truly dariel do not think us weak just do what you have to for the people thats what matters go now you have many miles to travel and you must be quick if youre going to be there for the gathering the clans have called it is your only chance to address them all at once dont be late are you coming down to see us off of course now go he caught sight of something that drew his gaze anira is there waiting for you go to her she was she appeared from around a wall her sack slung over her shoulder dariel acknowledged her with a wave and started toward her a few steps on he turned to say something to yoen a nonparting that promised a proper one down by the water the old man had turned away already he did not hurry his back was not unkind yet dariel felt emotion pour into him a sadness like he had not felt since he was a boy the crafts they were to travel in were oval boats about twenty feet long deep in the hull with good storage space within a frame of the whitebark trees crosshatched their centers strapped in place by cords that wrapped down around the hull the lines of the hulls had an ornate elegance the keel was a gentle ridge from which smooth organic contours flowed upward something about them reminded him of something though dariel had never seen a craft even remotely like them it was only when he saw one overturned on the rocky beach that it occurred to him what they reminded him of they look like turtle shells very observant anira quipped she hefted a bundle and moved to load it into one of the boats dariel did the same doubletime to keep up with her you dont mean that they are turtle shells do you anira tossed the bundle in and turned to face him showing him the full measure of her amusement what did birke tell you about the sheeven lek not to swim in it why did he do that because other things swim in it bigger things exactly things like turtles there are turtles this size in the river no she tossed a leg over the gunwale and began to shove and wiggle the new bundle into place theyre no more died out a long time ago before dariel could expel the relieved breath he had at the ready she added the scale leeches killed them off scale leeches dariel thought it sounded like something she had made up on the spot he said so much to her amusement t hey floated free of the riverbank by midmorning yoen did not come down to see them off but it seemed as if the rest of the village did they crowded on the beach down onto rock outcroppings some of the children tossed flowers to them from a tree house high on a branch overhanging the water he barely knew these people but watching and waving to them touching the rune on his forehead he felt a weight of responsibility to them he had agreed to help them to try to secure this land for them to prosper peacefully in he had agreed to try to become the hero they all hoped for it felt right that he did so but as he floated toward it he feared he faced an enormous task that he still did not understand the shape of the seven shells were to carry the party of five back toward the coast from which they had so recently come and to take with them the young and hardy from the nearby villages any who could help in the fight they all knew awaited them each boat went captained by a rower skilled at handling it perched on the thwart the rowers moved the crafts with a quiet efficiency of effort in the quiet pools of still waterof which there were many the first daythey drove the vessels forward by leaning their backs into timed pulls on the oars when the current picked up when pressed through rocks or down steeper sections they turned the boats with a touch of an oar on the green water or spun them like tops with a crosscross pull there was an elegance to it that dariel admired from where he lay among the bundles of supplies in the afternoon he took a turn at the oars he had rowed skiffs on enough occasions to be confident and he figured the study he had made of it from a few hours watching had taught him what he needed to know wrong he spent all his efforts on just moving the absurdly long oars just landing the blades in the water the right way proved difficult and the right way never stayed right for long because the vessel was always in motion when he lifted one oar to reposition it he invariably pulled against the other swinging the boat one direction or another when he tried to correct on the other side he found the water as immovable as setting concrete if he managed to press down on an oarthereby lifting its other end out of the waterthe freed end flailed in the air with a life of its own anticipate dariel birke called anticipate feel the momentum starting to would you shut up dariel shouted jerking his oars in frustration listening to the jibes the others tossed around him dariel wondered if he needed to harden his demeanor he imagined returning the taunts with fierce expressions of disapproval or sharp reprimands invocations of his name no not his name of his status as the rhuin fa thats what mattered here just look at his forehead of course he got that status because of who he was in the known world not in this one he had not done much worthy of a title yet he still had no idea just how he would lead the people other than that he could speak languages he had never learned he could not say he felt any different having part of na gamens true soul in him he knew that he was heading toward a clan gathering in which he would be presented to all the people of avina but nobody asked him what he would say or told him what he should say perhaps because of that he had dreams each night in which he held long conversations with different people in them he listened to them learned about their fears and worries in them he argued against the leagues vision for ushen brae he encouraged the people to unite to find strength together and to reject the leagues enticements maybe if he dreamed about it long enough he would find the right words by the time he gave up on rowing his face was wet with sweat and his shirt plastered to his chest the other shells were far ahead a few out of sight around a distant river bend he nearly voiced a suspicion that the basic dynamics covering rowing were somehow reversed in ushen brae but he knew a lame excuse when he heard one he kept it to himself he handed the oars back to harlen the captain of his shell who had watched the entire show while chewing on a twig of sweet branch he took the oars without comment and made up the time dariel had lost in a few minutes humming as he rowed when this brought new bursts of taunts from the distant shells dariel flipped his frustration over and gave in to it himself why not he could not change who he was to them even if he was mostly a walking invitation for mirth he did not even want to when it came down to it if he was to be the hero these people needed it could not be shaped by pretense it had to flow from who he was who they were and what they could do together as odd as it was to feel himself a constant source of humor there was something he actually liked about it a playfulness a camaraderie that felt close to what he had experienced as an outer isle brigand that cant be a bad thing he said he decided to build on it to let it grow the rowing the dou worms and tales of frekete nightmares gagging on pleeberry juice tripping in the whirling chaos that was bashar and cashen at play on the riverbank each evening these were not the only things that kept the group laughing at the rhuin fas expense during the trip downstream o n the first day they confronted whitewater he fell out of the boat at the very top of a long rapid he had stood to take in the view and a sudden rocking of the vessel threw him off balance the minute he hit the water he knew he was going to swim the entire long tumult of the rapid he did had there not been a calm pool at the end of it he might have drowned instead he was able to crawl up on a rock in the slack current panting exhausted fearful to the last moment that some creature was going to clamp its jaws down on his ankle and pull him back in he was the butt of jokes for the rest of that day did he really dislike the shells that much would he swim all the rapids or was it only the largest ones that tempted him just what was it that he had dropped that made him so keen to go river diving by the time he reached camp that evening he was sure he had heard every variation of the earnest perplexed questions his companions could possibly think of he hadnt they were still at it the next morning was it true that the little people with gills lived in tiny houses along the river bottom one section of the canyon was so narrow and the gradient so steep that the shells ran a gauntlet of whitewater rapids dariel sprawled atop the supplies and clung to the web of ropes that secured them as harlen made the shell do things that defied reason near the end of the torrent a flume of water collided with a solid stone wall at a sudden turn in the river it created a raging maw of a whirlpool that dariel was certain would gnaw them to death and then spit them out in pieces he screamed the madness of it when harlen steered the shell right down the flume catching the water feeding into the upstream edge of the whirlpool the shell rode upon the pillow of water plastered vertically along the stone instead of dropping down into the whitewater just below them and being devoured the craft rode the pillow of frothing water it skimmed along above the growling mouth of the whirlpool to be deposited on the other side of it downstream the maneuver seemed so improbable that dariel turned to share his amazement with harlen but the other man just smiled and stuffed a mint leaf in his mouth as if there had been nothing remotely dramatic about the moment at least he could say he had not squealed at any point during the rapids the same could not be said of the first time he saw the slick side of a scaleleech he did not actually notice when it happened for the writhing in the water all around the shells drew all his attention long thick eellike things slithered beneath them bumping against the shell and almost tipping dariel in their heads when he saw one gnawing along the rim of the shell were entirely mouth teeth and sucking lips that were instantly the most horrible sight dariel ever recalled having seen the others jumped into motion the rowers took up oars and went to work passengers stayed low harlen shouted for dariel to draw the river knife sheathed on the wooden rowing frame dariel twisted one wrist painfully in the rigging ropes he had no intention of falling into the water now clutching the weapon with his free hand the prince snapped his head from side to side each time one of the creatures appeared awkwardly off balance because of the rhythmic surging of the rowing he fought to see past bashar and cashen who darted around him barking madly he stabbed several of the leeches they squirmed away all the faster when cut thats the only problem with the shells harlen said panting hard as he pulled the scale leeches remember how tasty their old owners were when the creatures finally left off their thrashing harlen explained that they lived in territorial groups they had only to row through their territory to gain a reprieve before they passed into another groups region and then the same again despite the real danger of them after that first encounter it was his squeal that the group most focused on not the creatures themselves he was not at all sure he had made any alarmed sound at all and would not accept birkes effeminate imitation as accurate but it was no use protesting nor could he get any traction out of pointing out that tam and anira both took unintentional underwater excursions nor that two shells flipped over during the voyage nor that one of the young men passed too close to a flowering plant that made him break out in hives that with his wolfish shivith spots made him look truly bizarre nor that a couple unfortunate in the spot they chose for their clandestine lovemaking sprouted fullbody rashes caused by the weeds they had bedded down in none of that carried the humor of the frightened squeal dariel doubted had ever escaped him through it all dariel came to laugh more easily at himself with others at the bizarreness of the world and with a joy of discovery that shoved aside the burden of responsibility every now and then he knew even as the days passed that the things he saw along the river would be lasting memories in his mind ever after and he knew that the time spent with that small company would someday be just as precious to him as his days at palishdock and sailing the outer isles so he laughed his way down the sheeven lek to the coast he kept it up right until the river split into myriad channels of its delta they floated through water growing brackish patrolled by armored crabs and leaping with prawns they landed at a point not far from where he had watched the soul vessel go up in flames they pulled the shells well up the bank and stripped down their supplies for overland travel and flipped them over they hiked into the undulating ridgeline of sand dunes that hid the ocean reaching one of the heights birke who was in the lead stopped and crouched down he motioned that there was something to see dariel sprinted with the others he dropped flat on the sand as the wind coming over the peak mussed his hair and smacked blood into his cheeks he saw then what birke had seen out there past the breakers which curled in long massive waves stretched a rough sea dotted with vessels league brigs fast clippers several of the sleek soul vessels there went his enemy against them his war was about to resume chapter fortythree corinn stared eaters she thought thats what they were flesh eaters little monsters with teeth ringed around a circular mouth they had flown as fast as angry hornets when they attacked her propelled on an inundation of song a malignant spell cast from nualos mouth to hers they ate through corinns flesh for as long as the curse that gave them life rang in the air several frantic moments in which they swarmed her lower face their chewing and writhing had been such a loud garble frantic and horrible that for those moments they were her entire world by the time she wrapped her face in her shawl to hide it from others in the carmelia the eaters had already completed their work they died inside her flesh there they remained she could feel them she ran her fingers over the segmented ridges of their bodies they were part of her dead husks that she could feel half submerged in her tissue their corpses hued the same chestnut brown as her skin staring at her reflection in her dressing table mirror she could see them she sat there straightbacked on the stool looking into the glass as she had a hundred thousand times before the room was still true silence empty she had made everyone leave even the servants who would normally have plastered themselves invisible and forgotten against the walls and behind drapes she was alone the long thin sliver of a knife rested within arms reach on the dresser but she only had eyes for the mirror what looked back at her this time was impossible to look at and yet she did if she could have screamed she would have she would have given in to panic and ripped her fear into the world with shrieks but she couldnt one thing she would never again be able to do was scream the fact of it was more horrible still enough so that she could only stare stunned to a place on the other side of terror the eaters had not consumed her flesh they had processed it they had curdled its substance they swallowed it in from one end and expelled it out the other turning her flesh into a thick paste that congealed in such a manner that where her mouth had been there was no mouth tough doughylooking flesh covered her lips making her lower face a stretch of mottled skin all this in a few frantic seconds and there it was she would never be able to eat or drink again she knew this but she also knew that it did not matter she would not die from hunger or thirst she could feel it hunger was something she would not face again she would waste away yes but it would happen very slowly the santoth wanted her alive until they got what they wanted it would be an unbearable wait she ran her fingers over her damaged flesh there that was it she could not speak she could not say a word of explanation to anyone she could not even hide behind a veil and issue orders she could not use the song it was in her head just as before it hummed and thrummed and banged against the sides of consciousness but she could do nothing about it without a mouth to speak it all her knowledge was useless it raged like a cyclone confined to the dimensions of her skull just like that with one malignant spell nualo had trapped all her weapons inside her you are hideous she thought there was something freeing in acknowledging it it was a proclamation she could almost wrap around herself and be encased within her funereal shawl it was a tempting notion silent death leaving all this you are hideous best to turn inward and cease to be how could you have been so stupid you stupid bitch stupid ugly fool of a dont say those things hanish appeared behind her he stood at her shoulder studying her reflection corinns eyes snapped to him he was so close solid just there behind her looking too much like a living man theyre not true she felt the weight of his hand on her shoulder this ghost version of him had never touched her she had thought he could not but she felt the weight of his four fingers his thumb moving in a circle for a moment she was glad of him didnt hate him didnt want him gone the moment did not last what could he offer her that was more soothing than death leave me she ordered no i wont hanish said leave me hanish shook his head i cant banish me if you can but i dont think you can do that you are stuck with me and i with you leave me after a time hanish said corinn have you forgotten that you imagined this before in your dreams you did you knew this would happen you just didnt understand your own vision do you remember she had not until he asked and then she did it came back as a set of images leering at her through a haze of forgotten dreams for a time she had lived through the same nightmare over and over again it began with aliver returning to life just as she wanted just as she later sang him into reality with joy at all the fine things this meant she had dashed through the halls of the palace that was how she came to find him the figure with his back turned to her all the joy vanished the man turned and it was i hanish said yes it had been he the same beautiful man lean and golden haired with his dreamers eyes he had worn a black thalba snug around the torso that she had so loved to wrap herself around he wore the same now but then in the dream his mouth had been sewn shut on her orders needle and dark thread through the lips she had kissed pinching the soft tissue she had placed a mass of jagged fishhooks in his mouth before sewing it shut so that he would swallow them and be shredded from the inside you wanted me to suffer i remember it now its your dream but i remember it and the worst part he stopped pulling back from it the worst part corinn acknowledged was that i changed my mind i tried to run to you to undo it but then you were not you you were our son i became aaden he smiled dreams are frustrating devils arent they how could she have forgotten that it was not even so long ago that this dream had tormented her just a few months back did she forget because she had set in motion the things that would make this version of that dream a reality she had woken aliver and aaden he had slept and been awoken as well and before all that she had killed her lovers tunishnevre ancestors with blood from her palm and then she had ordered him killed as well corinn placed her hand over the dagger no not that hanish said reaching forward and pinning her hand down on top of the weapon you dont get off as easily as that you killed me and im still here with you death is not the balm it seems right now i swear it what do you want are you here to gloat no to relish this no you want to humiliate me look at me then stare get your eyes full of me and then leave im here because i love you hanish said no one has ever been more beautiful this thing that was done to you does not change that it just makes it even more obvious corinn yanked her hand from his grip she spun around on him blade out before her in threat hating him wanting to cut him down again for real this time you cant cut me corinn hanish said so sadly it looked like he wished she could no she thought but i can do this she lifted the knife and raked the blade across the mutated flesh that had been her mouth screaming as she did so silently inside her mind she screamed and cut l ater some hour in the deep dark of the night corinn lay on the floor with her head in hanishs lap her hand touching her mouth hiding it the knife was on the floor a little distance away under the edge of her bed where it had fallen when she did despite the force with which she cut the blade had done nothing but slide across her skin for a moment she thought she felt the dead worms writhe but that was all no searing pain no bloody slit to yell through no death nothing changed when she could not carve herself a new mouth she had tried to turn the knife elsewhere to cut her wrists or to find the artery in her neck or to sink the blade to the hilt in her abdomen hanish prevented each attempt she fought against him but he was stronger faster he toyed with her even turning their whirling struggle into a playful maseret humming a tune that he kept time to as if that dance of death had ever been performed to music what would a servant think if she saw corinn at this crazy dance he asked they would see only her knife in hand swirling in choreography they could not fathom that was before she gave up she let the knife drop and herself and came to rest partially on the smooth cool stones of her room partially on the lap of her dead lover crying she wanted to move her head the wetness from her tears pressed against her face but so did the warmth of his skin true living warmth she was sure of it even though she doubted it each time she felt the pulse beat against her temple was that hanish or herself his life or hers his voice measured the passing of time for her he talked she did not listen to everything he said she faded in and out as other thoughts tried to carry her away he kept on and at some point she realized she had been listening to him talk his way through his life that was good to hear about him instead of her he claimed to have loved his boyhood it had been a time of such promise his father and brothers alive so much to do what dreams they had the future gleamed with righteous promise everyone he loved intact around him back then he had yet to come under the service of the tunishnevre i was innocent and hungry for war i was a boy like aaden that changed though he told of the time just before his manhood rites when he had danced a maseret with maeander he was eleven his brother just a little younger it was the last time hanish would ever perform the duel without it being to the death they fought before the veterans in the calathrock a great honor accorded both of them but mostly for him as his fathers firstborn and chosen what he remembered about it was that he realized during the dance that maeander was better than hefaster and stronger and more focused he pressed hanish to the edge of his ability and stopped there he nicked hanishs nostril yes leaving a small scar for all the rest of his days but he did not embarrass him as he could have i dont think anyone knew hanish said not even my father i left there wondering why i had been born first maeander was more a meinish warrior than i ever was thasren knew it thats why he did what he did to secure his name in another way he paused a moment and they both listened as someone moved about one of the adjoining rooms making noise enough corinn knew to remind her that the living world went on outside her room she did not need to be reminded do you know what i did that night i stole into his room and woke him from sleep with a knife to his back i made him swear to never betray me i made him swear on pain of death he did swear and he never betrayed me in the years we had together he was my strongest ally part of me always expected a knife in the back from him but he stayed true i wish i had thanked him for that i couldnt say it to him though i could not say brother i know that you consider killing me every day and taking over in my place thank you for not doing it i wish i could have now in death honesty like that seems such an obvious good in life its not as clear but thats only because in life you always think you have more time you always believe that things that dont matter do matter he stroked corinns hair drew it back from her face with his fingers another thing i wish is that i hadnt put that blade to his back that night what if i didnt need to what if he would never have betrayed me of his own accord i cant know not after id told him i would rather kill him than have him best me there hanish said raising his voice a little youve had my confession more than one i could go on but my tales are of the dead its the living that matter are you ready to discuss the living corinn thought of jason she had killed jason the spell that ripped the flesh from his body began in her mouth jason who had never been anything but loyal jason who had taught her to read to know the map of the world jason who had made her recite the names of acacias monarchs from edifus onward jason whom she had set on the fools errand of creating a horse lore for a people who had never truly had such a lore jason who was going to write the mythology of her winged riders he was dead as were so many others all from a spell that began at her lips no corinn thought tell me more things about the dead and so he did he talked on t he light had changed enough to foretell the coming dawn when hanish said its time corinn sat at her dressing table again staring at herself hanish stood behind her both his hands resting on her shoulders now i know its not enough time but its all we have there are people waiting for you people you love aaden corinn thought yes he needs you to go to him i cant of course you can you must hes your son think of it as if you were he would you rather see your mother aliveno matter the curse set upon herthan be kept from her the knock on the door was gentle as it had been every hour of the long night as she had done on each previous occasion corinn ignored it she did not even turn her head hanish did though they want you he whispered she shook her head whoever it was moved away after a moment aaden wants you look at what hell see she drew her fingers across her notmouth elegant gracefully for a few seconds before she snapped her hand closed im repellent if this had happened to your mother would you find her repellent you saw your mother in death you saw the bones of her dying hands and knew that they were yours remember that can you imagine not having that memory and not knowing that about yourself what if she had forbidden you from sitting with her in her final days that silenced her excuses how did he know about that her mothers hands her hands the same the memory of that had always haunted her no she could not imagine having lived without that knowledge as sad a memory as it was nothing else had made it as clear to her who she was her mothers daughter its not the same corinn thought my mother fell ill a sickness took her she had no part in creating it this though i brought on she paused there waiting for what for hanish to refute that statement for him to say it was not her fault that she was blameless a victim she wanted all those things but hanish did not offer them she knew he would not and that if he had he would be lying the curse that was her face and the horror that was the santoth free in the world were part of the song she had been singing the moment she felt nualos spell burrow into her flesh she knew it the spell itself she recognized it it was a part of the music that swirled inside her head it was as akin to her as her hand had been to her mothers i brought the song back and with it came evil hanish leaned down his gray eyes meeting her reflections gaze tell him that it is a bitter lesson but its the one you have to tell he will need to hear it and only you can explain it there is a way to speak to him corinn there is and not just to him you have to speak to everyone to aliver and mena to the world i cant you can listen believe me on this you have to be stronger now than you ever were before and you were strong before love you were i know that better than anyone he tried a smile but it slipped away almost before it had started i would not have loved you so much if you hadnt been nor would i have died as i did remember who you became when i betrayed you you didnt fold in on yourself you fought you struck you outmaneuvered a world of ambitious men who wanted things from you you can do that again and even more in the days that we have left you must become the queen you were destined to be not the queen you envisioned but the queen you are fated to become the two things are never the same trust me on that as well you wont get another chance thats all there is to it her eyes brimmed with moisture she twisted away and rose hanish moved with her toward the center of the room where she stopped unsure where she meant to go i thought i thought that i would meet the auldek before my gathered army i would fly out to face them my people would watch as i flew on po singing hurling down spells that would destroy them all i was going to save acacia it was to be legend it would have been magnificent yes it wouldve been that hanish said now ive failed them youll have to find some other way to be magnificent you have a choice to make you can take this curse that youve received and you can give it life you can let it eat at you until it destroys you and all you love and hate with you at the same time that outcome is within your power i hope you turn from it there is another way the way that acknowledges that you have a boy to be a mother to you have siblings to be a sister to you have a nation that needs leadership and you have a band of sorcerers to deal with why are you doing this this time the smile formed and held i told you already hanish said its the same as i said on the day you had me killed i love you too much to ever leave you i am a ghost but i dont haunt a place i haunt a person you corinn you see i also have a different destiny than i imagined it wasnt an accident that i came back i didnt just slip in randomly on the spell you brought aliver back with i had never left you corinn id been haunting you watching you loving you you didnt know it but from the day i died ive been with you chapter fortyfour its finally come to it rialus thought he stood atop an auldek station in a buffeting wind taking in the view south toward menas army in the dwindling light the acacians were visible as a stain a dark slash across the pale expanse of snow war another war for the second time in my life im helping an enemy invade my own country he hated the words but could not shake them out of his head he believed more fervently than ever that he was not a traitor none of it was as it seemed he loved the known world and all its people in his dreams he replayed his recent exchange with princess mena again and again in his dreaming version he leaped across the few strides that had separated them he joined her and rebelled against the auldek he flew up into the heavens on her dragons back snug behind the princess so elated that he crashed into consciousness on the swell of it if he could dream that there had to be the possibility of truth in it his dream self did not know it was only a dream self was not the point of such imaginings to prove that he was somewhere inside himself the man who could act like that he could feel the pride and euphoria of decisive righteous action for once in his life of course he could it was not too late he still believed that the giver rewarded his worthies the fact that his waking hours contradicted that truth frustrated him more than he could bear it was not a new feeling but he was getting very very tired of it he climbed down from the station after only a few minutes already feeling his fingers and toes stiffening as ever he was absurdly bundled in layers of fur no warmer for it though howlk had joked that furs only kept a living body warm because of the heat within it perhaps you are dead already he had said poking him just a shell of a man who doesnt know it yet though rialus climbed down with all the slow caution he could his feet slipped off the rungs several times on the lower landing he fell flat on his backside at least the station was not moving it had stopped the evening before at the first sighting of the acacian force rialus knew that the auldek had wanted to reach solid ground before meeting the acacians but they did not seem too troubled to be out in frozen arctic sea the ice was so thick and constant it might as well have been stone it did not creak beneath the weight of the stations the acacian force had pushed their camp forward early the next day staking out ground a couple miles from the jumbled shoreline the battle would commence the next day because of it rialus scurried across the frozen ground between the steaming stations and spent several hours sitting beside devoth during his war council with the other chieftains rialus was there to answer any lastminute questions about acacian tactics he had long since given up explaining that he did not really know anything about military matters when pressed on details he sat dumbly he refused to answer despite the chuffs about the ears and the threats directed at him it did not matter anymore the chieftains were more intent on figuring out their positions in the line of battle than anything else the lvin took the center front of coursethe honor of the spearpoint which menteus nemre had won for them in such bloody fashion back in avina the kulish kra got the left flank for some ancestral reason that rialus could not fathom the antok it seemed won the right flank based on the toss of a handful of colorful bone dice millwa the antok chieftain grinned his pleasure the rest squabbled for positions behind them rialus sat through it all miserable his head pounding he might as well have been surrounded by a mob of jostling children did none of them understand that they were arguing over which of them was lucky enough to get them and their slaves killed first it was almost like they did not know what the morrow really held for them yes they would overrun menas forces how could they not when each of the auldek had lives to spare imbedded in him or her but it would still be a horror of pain and slaughter and the divine children had only their one life to risk just when rialus thought the meeting might be drawing to a close skahill the head of the anet clan offered to trade positions with the antoks arguing that the dice toss was not strong enough to override their seniority he made some argument about their performance in a footrace they had held on a stony beach earlier in the invasion rialus wanted to smack him instead rialus took off his inner gloves and pinched a mist pellet in his fingers nobody took any notice he stuffed it up his nostril with his thumb and inhaled the first time he had seen howlk do this he had been horrified now he was quite used to it the ball disintegrated almost immediately and the euphoria of the mist came fast afterward rialus closed his eyes and tried to relax remembering what sabeer had confessed to him he realized that the auldek did not personally remember the wars they had fought in more than a hundred years ago they may have done battle themselves but their knowledge of the events would be no more real to them than things they read in books the actions they attributed to themselves would be like those of characters in the old tales how do they even know their own records are accurate he wondered acacian histories were full of rubbish he opened one eye and scanned the faces gathered around the table you sad people you dont even know who you are anymore when the meeting ended howlk steered rialus into the frigid dark with an arm clamped over his shoulder following sabeer rialus did not protest within a few minutes he was stripping off again inside the station that the lvin used for martial exercises it was as hot as a steam room despite the cold outside rialus was sweaty from the moment he entered he tried to cling to the mists sedative effects but doing so just pushed him further away from the mild bliss he had managed during the meeting rialus im going to show you our secrets sabeer said let me hear your opinion come she stood in the center of a sparring ring marked out on the floor a small gathering of auldek and sublime motion around her she held one of the curving auldek swords and stepped deliberately through a choreographed routine of strikes parries and footwork at first rialus thought she was wearing a black training suit of some sort it clung as snug as leather shrunk to fit her contours with a patterning to it something like fish scales as ever sabeer wore it with a deadly sensual grace devoth doesnt like it that youve decided to shut your mouth to us she said i dont either perhaps you are having pangs of doubt now perhaps youre dreaming that your princess will defeat us for your own sake you should forget such hopes she has no chance against us when howlk took up a sword and slashed at the back of her leg rialus thought he had finally gone mad from his lust for her the strike was hard and fast rialus expected it to take her leg off at the thigh and send her sprawling blood spurting horribly he went instantly lightheaded a cry of no escaped his lips instead sabeer spun on howlk and came back at him in a playful attack the sword had done no damage at all they carried on for a time sabeer obviously letting howlk strike her she even tossed her sword to menteus nemre who stood watching and went at howlk with a sudden barrage of kicks and punches she blocked his sword strikes with her forearms and she kicked his blade free with a sudden roundhouse kick the move was lightning fast the first that howlk responded to with true surprise the two of them were all grins as they turned to rialus our battle skin rialus sabeer said raising her arms and twisting to display her suit you see in this i will be very hard to kill they wont be able to chop off an arm or a leg believe me thats something we worry about the souls inside us can do nothing about a missing limb she paused a moment looking as if she were wistfully disappointed in the souls for not being more diligent in their service to her but i wont lose any the amusing thing is that the princess and her soldiers wont even know were wearing it its against the skin as you see ill have all my clothing on over it for this battle at least down in acacia in the warmth of spring ill fight just like this itll be a sight wont it its armor rialus asked unable to twin the concept with the way the fabric showed the curve of sabeers hips and the contours of her muscles of a sort its flexible but it cant be cut it even absorbs the impact of a blow you may come away bruised but thats better than limbless the records say that lothan aklun bestowed it on us so that we would have a harder time killing each other off it worked she lit up with an idea do you want to try to cut me he didnt but she would not leave off the idea until he had tried several times with an auldek dagger it was as she described he could not cut her when he tried to stab her square in the sculpted abdomen he did no more than twist his wrist she went back on her heels but that might have been in amusement as much as from the force of his thrust has princess mena anything like this rialus shook his head the mists effects were long gone fatigue and depression seeped up inside him again no nothing like it did she really fight an eagle god what was its name maeben rialus murmured hoping she did not ask him to retell the tale yet again she folded her arms and stood beside him close enough to touch him with her hip they watched howlk work through some technique with menteus nemre all the things you have told me about her she mused i almost dont want to kill her perhaps i wont not straightaway at least ill cut her legs out from under her well stop the bleeding somehow and then she and i can talk if youre going to cut anything off you should start with her sword arm rialus said he regretted saying it immediately sabeer grinned and ran a finger up his arm there rialus youre talking again good its proof that you love me you think you want me dead and buried i see it in your eyes but youre not only eyes are you other parts of you like me very much she pretended to reach for his groin she let him squirm away have you decided where you want to live yet this was one of sabeers favorite topics through the many long nights of the trip she had made rialus detail every locale in the known world that he could remember when he grew bored she had always pressed him to think about where he would want to live once the war was over and he was allowed to live a life of leisure he had placed himself in a cliffside villa in manil he had walked the estates of bocoum or lived in a stacked tower surrounded by the teeming life of alecia he had taken in the view from calfa ven he had imagined a rustic lodge somewhere in talay from which he could watch the sun set into the grasslands and sip cool beverages with his feet up served for all the rest of his days by a staff composed entirely of brownskinned women he had even to his surprise found himself thinking of cathgergen he could not understand why he had been so unhappy there the idea of being cocooned from the cold locked inside an immobile fortress of stone far away from the worlds machinations seemed a sort of bliss back then he had compromised nothing he was just himself rialus a governor with very little actual work to do he had not yet become a traitor to the realm two times over a pawn for maeander mein a joke in hanishs eyes slave to the numrek now a guide for the auldek what a journey his life had been so full of improbable twists and turns would that he wasnt knotted in the center of it all now trapped and being dragged forward to a resolution that no matter what sabeer claimed could only be another type of disgrace for him he answered sabeers question no i havent decided where to live yet he thought i havent decided if i want to live yet this tendency toward morbidity was new to rialus he had always valued his life highly increasingly he mused on just giving up that thought brought him back to gurta it seemed important that she and the child he had never met mourn him but he was no longer sure they would gurta could know nothing of his fate at this point when she found out it seemed to him she would reject him out of hand a traitor how could he ever have thought she would take him back after he arrived as the mascot of an invading army her temperament would never allow her to see beyond appearances he could describe his heroic dreams all he wanted but what did you do she would ask but what did you do to have her back he would have to do something to deserve her rialus had just decided that he had stood around long enough to be able to depart when the first explosion shook the station he thought for a moment that the vehicle was starting to move again but that was not it it did not move forward at all just boomed and then trembled it reminded him of an earthquake he had once experienced in aos everyone stopped as the stillness stretched rialus could almost believe that they had all imagined the sensation then another boom came more distinct this time followed by shouts and the bellowing of some animals and the long low groan that was a warning horn sounding the room erupted with motion the auldek and the sublime motion grabbed garments tossed one another weapons and then careened down the stairs and out into the night sabeer pulled up just before descending rialus come the night smacked him as he stumbled into it still tugging his outer coat on the scene that greeted him was utter confusion shapes darted around him nearly knocking him from his feet an antok roared by the thick chain that was supposed to bind it skittering across the ice the sky glowed a strange yellow when the top of a station a little distance away exploded into flames rialus wondered why there were several such fires blazing up into the night how such an accident could occur in not one but two threeboomfour different places it couldnt could it were being attacked he concluded sabeer yanked him into motion they ran between two stations and along a line of frantic oxen all the creatures pulling at the ropes that bound them kicking and biting one another rialus thought he heard the clash of steel off in one direction but he could not be sure they came around a sledge piled high with supplies and stepped into the heat and glare of one station the entire structure was aflame it crackled and combusted seemed to breathe air in and then roar it back out like the embodiment of some fire god figures ran around lit by the blaze trying to organize some way to fight it devoth shouted orders pointing and gesturing half giving directions and half dancing through fits of rage my amulet bring it to me he shouted his frekete mount bitten seemed just as angry as he was he clawed the ice shooting weary glances at the fire his wings cast evil shadows the veins in them glowing red when they caught the firelight right through all this a snow lioness trotted a corpse dangling from her jaws the cat seemed at ease amid the chaos strolling almost sabeer pulled rialus after it the bodys hands and feet dragged on the ice he was not auldek that was obvious but it was not until the lion dropped the body at devoths stomping feet that rialus got close enough to see more devoth gripped him by the shoulder and pressed him closer kicking others back so that light from the fire illuminated him who is this who is this he snarled beastlike himself in his rage on his hands and kneeswith the lioness and her bloody jaws just inches awayrialus peered at the man he was a stranger his face was pale with lean features scarred by frostbite who is he devoth asked answer me i dodont rialus pulled off a mitten reached out with trembling fingers and drew the mans stringy golden hair back behind his ear there was a tattoo on his cheek a crescent slashed like a tear escaping the corner of his eye he had seen it once before a scav hes a scav you know him then no no no i knew some of his people before rialus started to explain that he had only met a few prisoners brought to him at cathgergen for petty crimes and poaching devoth was not listening a slave ran up with the amulet and thick chain he had been shouting for devoth wrenched it from him rounding on rialus he seized him by the collar of his coat with his free hand you didnt tell me she would do this how could i rialus asked i didnt know your princess is a coward who sneaks in the night she has just made it worse for your people the auldek flung rialus away and then strode toward bitten the creature bent to accept the chain and amulet that devoth slung around his neck and fastened a moment later bitten surged upward one deadstart jump that took him and devoth up above the height of the flames where his wings fanned out and lifted them higher rialus stood there a moment forgotten even by sabeer who had joined the fight against the fire he knew he should check on his station to make sure his room and all his documents were safe but he was frozen in place he had just discovered something he was sure of it but he could not quite place what it was another station exploded with a concussion of sound and flame rialus almost did not notice so transfixed was he the auldek shouted curseladen orders divine children rushed toward the new fires as if they had anything prepared to fight them and then he had it rialus knew he had it because the thought began like a centipede at the base of his spine and ran up his back with a hundred legs and having the revelation he knew what he had to do with it chapter fortyfive barad was not familiar with this wing of the palace he followed the slim shoulders of the young woman who showed him the way feeling awkwardly massive behind her how was it that he could live in his body for so many years and still feel an impostor within it perhaps corinn had recognized that in him when she set her curse on him she made his feeling into a real thing turned him into a puppet even now she controlled his heart she must why else would he be so driven to learn of her welfare why else would he be so hard on the heels of this woman like a dog running to answer his masters summons the servant did not look him in the face when she indicated that he should wait in the alcove outside the library door she pointed at the two couches the chairs and even at the tree that grew from a circlet cut in the stone she left before he could thank her barad stood arms drooping unsure what to do he reached for one of the trees long silvergreen leaves running his finger down it he wondered how deep the soil in the circlet was did the roots run deep or were they balled in a tiny knot as he had seen before in potted plants someone approached from down the hall just one person quick strides of some hardsoled boots the charlatan delivegu lemardine clipped his way into view ah barad thought what is with my luck today one of my least favorite people in the world and im waiting here to speak to my enslaver delivegu took in barad without a hitch in his step he did not even seem troubled by barads eyes as almost everyone was nodding he slid right past him to the door which he promptly rapped on with his knuckles the door opened aliver leaned out his gaze touched on barad acknowledging him and then settling finally on delivegu the man leaned in and whispered something to him alivers face went slack as he absorbed whatever he had said without a word he beckoned delivegu inside the door closed barad took his seat again the door to the room opened again a few minutes later delivegu strode through he strode away aliver stepped into view he watched delivegu recede lost in thought everyone it seems has messages for me aliver only noticed the seated man long after the charlatans footfalls had faded i hope some of them prove true barad do have you a message for me as well no youryour highness the queen summoned me he looked surprised did she and you were brought here when barad nodded aliver expelled a surprised breath of air he stepped back and motioned for him to enter the library smelled strongly of its primary inhabitants old books ancient papers stained sandalwood shelves tall windows cast elongated rectangles of redgold sunrise light but the rooms candles still burned thick ones that jutted through the tables like tree trunks and burned with flames the size of spearheads prince aaden sat at one of the long tables in the sunken center of the space a large book opened before him the prince looked tiny in comparison what must he be going through barad descended the steps toward him on reaching his level barad hovered near knowing that despite his kind wishes there was little he could do to comfort him not with his stone gaze and his bulk and his mouth that he was never sure would speak his mind he tried just to be near to fill the space around him with compassion protection is the queen not here no not here i have not spoken to my sister since the coronation not many people know that but i guess i can tell you you cant after all say anything the queen would not want you to can you barad felt his pulse quicken why that should alarm him he could not say it was not his doing after all he tested his lips they seemed to obey him no i cannot aliver stood over aaden he looked down at the open pages of the book as he said i didnt think so aaden here was sure of it it must have been hard for you these past months i can only imagine that your heart has not been behind the words your mouth has spoken was yours barad asked by the way that aliver twisted his mouth before answering barad knew he was not yet free to speak his mind as if to prove this he said my name is aliver akaran my sister is the queen the greatest queen the nation has ever known barad blinked unsure what to say could they manage to speak in coded messages how convoluted that would be how easy to misunderstand each other he was glad that the princes mind seemed intent on other things were trying to understand the santoth aliver said thats why were here studying these old books they are not proving helpful though i wish that i could help barad said i know nothing of these things rhrenna arrived she stepped inside the door but did not descend toward them your highness she said brittle voiced corinn has sent word shes on her way here youve spoken with her aliver asked she told you she was coming no she wrote a note a note aliver looked like he had never heard of such a thing and it said that she is coming yes right now i believe barad watched the mix of emotions move across alivers face in waves relief and then worry happiness and then trepidation and then hope when he turned to his nephew it was that emotion that he clung to good he said testing the word and then getting more forceful with it this is good aaden your mother is coming here the boy finished im sitting right here aliver i can hear too a person appeared in the open door corinn she walked in with a formal posture with her hands clasped together at her waist she wore a dress of light blue she was shapely as ever distinctive as ever a knit cowl wrapped around her neck and up over the lower portion of her face just touching her nose the ensemble was elegant she might almost have been dressed to step outside on a breezy winter day but barad knew that cowl was not there as a defense against the weather hanish mein stepped into view he slid up beside the queen he took her by the arm and whispering in her ear drew her forward into the room for a long moment the gathered company stared at the queen not at the ghost that stood with her it was only when corinn turned her back to them and withdrew toward the farthest alcove among the stacks that aaden ran toward her he dashed through tables bounded up the steps to the higher landing and cried for her with his arms outstretched corinn spun around one hand kept the cowl in place and the other palm slammed out toward the others freezing any movement in the room other than her sons aaden impacted with her at full speed knocking her back a few steps his arms slammed around her and cinched tight she bent over him whether with pain or emotion barad could not tell both most likely hanish stood with a hand on corinns back with his other he wrapped both mother and son into a protective embrace father mother and son a triumvirate that only barad could see hanish looked up and sought out barads gaze you can hear me cant you barad moved his stone eyes around the room everyone stared at corinn and aaden none of them he could tell had any inkling of hanish being there they were all silent you can hear me yes barad nodded good we need your mouth barad the lesser the queen needs it she cannot speak to anyone but me and i cannot speak to anyone but you thats why you were summoned to be the voice that speaks for we who cannot first you must know that you are freed the queen releases you right now as i speak she is wishing for the ties that bind you to fall away this is an easy spell for you to break simply understand that you are free and you will be you can feel it cant you it was true barad did feel it it might have just been because of the way hanish described it but invisible cords did loosen around his neck and jaw and the crown of his head they had been there so long unseen and unfelt that his skin prickled as it remembered the true touch of the air i can see that you can feel it now please in your own words tell them that you can hear the queens voice and that she will speak through you you need not say anything about me please speak now barad but he gestured toward the others just speak the truth theyll hear it in your voice though he did know his mouth was his own again it was very hard to make it shape sounds he moved his lips and jaws as if unsure of how to use them ah no one even turned it had been but an incomplete whisper aliver still a whisper prince aliver i have something to tell you he said the queen wishes to speak through me she asks me to be her voice for she cannot be her own hanish said tell them that the santoth took her voice but that she is still herself barad did the others were looking between him and the queen now confused they all noticed when she raised a hand and drew circles in the air with her fingers the gesture conveyed agreement with barads words they all saw that except aaden who was still clinging to her what are you saying barad aliver asked are you deceiving us barad had no idea what to say no he tried but it was not enough he looked to hanish pleading through his stone eyes hanish turned his head slightly to the side seemed to listen to something he nodded say this to aliver tell him that you can hear his sisters thoughts that she is speaking through you ask him to remember the time that she and he and mena and dariel rode horseback with their father down to the beach where he threw seashells into the waves and mena walked holding leodans hand and dariel chased crabs and corinn say that she stood on the trunk of a tree and imagined that she was a queen of an ocean empire say those things to him barad did tell him that he is free from any of corinns control just as you are barad explained this and watched as the truth of it dawned on aliver he saw him become free beneath his skin it was as if a ghost skin had covered him until that moment as it vanished the man beneath came into sharper view now come to us hanish said moving through the others barad climbed up toward the threesome when he reached them hanish said speak quietly to the prince after this we will speak of other things but for now tell aaden what i tell you tell him his mother loves him more than anything else in the world the old mine worker the large man with a voice that had often boomed before throngs to whom he had preached both for and against the monarchy was some time whispering closely into the young princes ear the words he repeated were hanishs only for a few sentences after that he knew them to be the queens intimate things that he spoke with reverence these things were between a mother and a son he let them slide from his memory a vessel that for once served the queen with all his heart chapter fortysix where is he naamen asked he said he would be back by now how long must we wait kelis did not answer he had heard the query enough times already he knew it was not a real question it was a nervous tic an expression of agitation his answeri dont knowwas the same he saw no use in giving it again he knew no more than naamen himself did kelis stood pressed against a wall behind a tavern his weight hard on the rough stones and his eyes heavy lidded with fatigue behind him naamen and benabe and shen sat against the wall hidden behind debris and shadowed from the structures all around them rats moved through the rubbish growing bolder the longer the humans remained in their territory it was a foul place but in the chaos that the lower town had become it was at least a safe one when was the last time he had slept weeks it seemed he was functioning without sleep he was more than ever before afraid of sleep he did not want to take his eyes off the waking world for even a moment nor did he wish to dream for he felt certain that his dreams would be horrible prophetic and horrible i t was days ago that he had left the carmelia with delivegu lemardine the man who had clamped his hand to keliss elbow half an escort half a jailer moving through the opulent upper terraces of the city had been difficult people rushed about scared and confused and unkind because of it some wished to lock themselves away in their homes others were intent on fleeing the island marah and regular soldiers and private guards ran rough through the streets calling for order and stirring turmoil in the process it was hard to know what had happened kelis saw and heard enough to know that all his vague fears had just been shown to be real and worse than he had imagined none of it fazed delivegu he walked with deliberate strides cutting through the crowds as if he barely noticed them in the quiet of his sitting room a little later he made kelis tell his tale a servant brought them a pot of strong tea kelis did not touch it but delivegu sat sipping from a cup as he listened the truth came out the story as kelis knew it each step of just how he had brought destruction right to acacias shores if he was going to have to tell it to the queen he had better practice first that was part of his thinking another which never got near the front of his mind was that maybe he would never have to tell it maybe this man would somehow do that for him if he died before he had to stand before her it would be no bad thing he blinked his eyes open without ever knowing he had shut them had he been sleeping no for the room was as before he had only a second before stopped talking that was all a second of time lost no more look at you delivegu said with a sigh played like a puppet dancing a jig because of you we have a great problem on our hands how great i dont know but im thinking we may all be leaned over a barrel and magically shafted before this is all through it gives me no joy to be the bird that conveys this to the queen but to me it falls kelis could not help thinking delivegu did not look nearly as joyless as he claimed now this girl you say is with you is she really alivers daughter you have no doubt about this no there is no doubt well thats something then we can use that kelis looked askance at him ill have food brought for you sleep here on the floor i trust you wont rob me at sunrise lets go find them i hope they come to where you told them to delivegu did not trust quite so much as that though as kelis lay flat on the woven rug in the center of the floor he could hear the scuffling sounds of the servant left outside the door to guard him the servant fell asleep before long but did so pressed up against the door his snores slid under it and crawled across the floor to where kelis lay he wondered if he should leave but he could not see a better way in to the queen he sat up thinking how strange it was that a man who had fought so much for the empire and been so close to the akarans could feel so powerless before the palaces gates he thought about this all through the long night unsleeping despite his exhaustion i n the faint light of the dawning day they found naamen at the inner gate he stood half hidden behind one of the lion statues staring out like a frightened child it only took a few minutes more walking to reach benabe and shen they were hidden tucked around a corner and in an alley that saw no light even in the day delivegu had to beg them to come forward into the weak light this is the girl this is aliver akarans daughter he squatted closer as benabe said that she was kelis hated the way he touched shen on the chin and moved her face from side to side he almost smacked his hand away he saw that benabe was on the verge of doing the same thing so he did not his inspection of benabe was no less insulting delivegu studied her lascivious eyes weighing whether she was or had been enough of a beauty to seduce an akaran prince he did not share his verdict with them but he did say he would go and try to arrange a meeting with the monarchs he told them to wait right there in the alley amid the debris just stay hidden he said ill be back a nd then days passed kelis blinking more and more often fought to stay awake his body was so tired but his mind still reeled he was starting to hope that delivegu would not come back if he did not they could flee they could join the outflow of people escaping the island why not do that whatever the santoth were doing was beyond them they could do nothing to help worse they would be blamed for releasing them why step up and show themselves to have been the evil sorcerers guides it had all gone horribly wrong but nobody would believe that they had acted innocently not when they had walked beside the sorcerers every step of the way from the far south they were either traitors or fools and neither freed him of responsibility if it were only him he would have cast himself on the stones of the carmelia yesterday and called for the marah to arrest him he did not care about himself he sought out shen with his eyes and willed her into focus she sat wrapped in her mothers arms face hidden against her breast shen was what mattered this seemed no way for her to enter her fathers life not that he yet believed aliver was truly alive and truly aliver more likely it was some sorcery of the queens a walking and talking mirage of a man this was one of the things he feared seeing in his dreams he did not want to have it confirmed or to have that confirmation make it true more than likely the queen still held power as firmly as ever she would punish them for releasing the santoth and shen she might punish for simply being who she was a sudden intensity of fear gripped him what if bringing shen here was as enormous a mistake as bringing the santoth the desire to flee was so strong in him that delivegus sudden return hit him like a kick in the abdomen the man smiled as if he had just come from an amorous conquest and said okay my friends true to my word ive gotten you an audience with the king sorry for the delay follow me and stay close the streets are still wild kelis did not remember the walk to the palace at all suddenly they were there inside the grounds soldiers escorting them and then they were walking through a long hallway and then they stood before a wooden door when it opened the scent of aged knowledge wafted out over them books old papers delivegu ushered them inside rhrenna corinns secretary stood on the other side of the door for kelis the scene he watched for the next few minutes was as warped and unreal as a dream he rubbed his eyes to clear his vision but it did no good he saw the people in the room as if through a goldhued liquid that blurred their features and muffled their words his eyes met alivers it was he a single look was enough to prove that he saw the queen with a cowl around her neck and aaden at her side and a man with stone eyes and the others he saw their mouths move and he heard the sounds but the words seemed to pass through him and vanish before he could get ahold of them though he did not like delivegu he saw that the man was speaking for him and he was glad he did not know what he was saying but whatever it was aliver listened to him looking often to kelis for a long moment the scene went dark and then the golden muted room came back he had closed and opened his eyes he was so tired he wanted this to be over he wanted to remember the things he knew he needed to but could not anymore he wanted to sleep benabe spoke for a time aliver embraced her and went on one knee before shen he asked her something and she answered darkness pressed down upon kelis again he realized that if he stayed in this dark place he would not dream after all it was tempting to stay in the dark enough so that he was not sure why he opened his eyes despite himself aliver had turned from benabe and was moving toward him kelis had no idea how to read the determination in his strides nor the urgency that moved him so fast he upset a chair as he came forward he thought the twisted expression on the princes face was anger anger for releasing the end of the world and for being too late in finding shen all the years of her life and he had never once looked for her never knew she was alive never searched his dreams for her kelis began to close his eyes aliver grabbed him he pulled him into an embrace crushing keliss head into his chest and wrapping his arms around him kelis stood his arms limp at his sides aliver spoke to him at first kelis could not hear him the world was too deadened and the blackness that was his fatigue wanted so badly to drop on him aliver seemed to understand this he held keliss face in his hands and mouthed his words still it took some time for kelis to understand that aliver was calling him by his name he was naming him his brother and thanking him he put his lips to his ears and said listen to me kelis can you he could do you understand what you have done youve brought me the future thank you thank you for knowing it all along stand with me as i tell them what youve done with those words the film before keliss eyes vanished the muffled sounds became sharp and the black wall withdrew the prince propped him up and turned to face the queen with a formality that seemed at odds with the surroundings and the privacy of the chamber sister aliver said forget the other things for a moment and listen to me this man has brought us a wonder a ray of light to break through all this darkness you see inside this misery are the seeds of the future aaden is one this girl is one corinn had watched it all from the higher landing she said nothing just stood there straightbacked with the cowl covering her neck and lower face kelis thought it must be there to hide her emotions but then he decided that was not all there was to it the wonder is my daughter aliver went on she was given the name larashen before her birth but she prefers just shen this is too bad because it was kelis who gave her this name kelis started turned to look in his face yes its true aliver said to him and then continued speaking to his sister kelis he who taught me to run in talay he who was at my side when we killed the laryx when i became a man he who is a brother to me he may not even know this but i remember something now one time when he and i were alone in talay searching for the santoth i awoke to hear him speaking in his sleep i listened and i heard him say a name the name he said was larashen i did not know what it meant then i do now i know because he is a dreamer with the gift of prophecy he tried to deny it but it came up through him and i know it because you are my sister with a gift to restore life only with both of you is this possible do you hear me the queen nodded then sister come and meet your niece love her as i already do as i always have alivers voice wavered choked with emotion that he fought to contain it escaped him though in sobs that made him hesitate before finishing will you do that will you love her the queens head turned slightly the man with the stone eyes said i dont deserve to love her if you knew all the things ive done you would not ask for my love i did not rule like you i am not the same as you aliver kept his eyes on the queen i do know you i ask you to love her now love her now and earn that love with what you do from here you can do that sister i know you you are the princess who dreamed of ruling an undersea kingdom ive always known you after a moment barad said for her when i tell you the things you need to know will you turn against me then never corinns face went ugly for a moment distorted with a sudden misery barad said you dont know you cant say that aliver inhaled a long breath he lifted an arm and shen moved under it he looked back at the queen and said but i do say it i have no anger in me corinn theres not room for it im too filled with other emotions come meet my daughter aaden come meet shen we have lost too much time already and we have only a short time here lets not waste it chapter fortyseven the nighttime attack was kants idea the scav did most of the work themselves it went better than mena could have imagined it amazed her that they had snuck into the auldek camp found the vehicles that housed the pitch and then set charges delayed to explode as they retreated they destroyed four of the rolling stations cost the auldek some lives in slaves and came away with several vats of the flammable pitch hitched to a sled and pulled by dogs that were uncannily silent the scav lost only two of their number in the process and they had not asked anything of the acacians mena her captains and her troops watched from a distance as the night sky bloomed with beautiful bursts of flame a strange show of light in the arctic night no one could blame them for the causalities suffered when one unfortunate group of soldiers was pounced upon by a crazed frekete the creature dropped right into their camp a rider shouting from its back the animal ripped ten soldiers apart before being forced to withdraw those creatures were going to be deadly troublesome mena might have wings because of elya but her beauty could not prevail against such brawn thinking this mena went to her tent more troubled about tomorrow than elated about the nights successes she closed her eyes in the dark and opened them in the dark knowing that hours had passed and that she had not slipped into sleep during any of them how many will die today she wondered how many will i kill though she might have she did not mean kill with her own blade or with her soldiers blades it was her own peoples lives that she felt responsible for she hated that even the more recent plans she had come up with were not sufficient for what faced them mena found her first officer waiting in the anteroom of her tent a small space just enclosed enough to be a shelter perrin how long have you been here not long why didnt you call for me she grumbled pulling her outer layers on in front of him her breath clouding the air you deserved sleep and you dont she asked i got some yesterday he said i have someone youll want to talk to a patrol picked him up at first light this morning he was stumbling around like a drunken man he says he was looking for us though he was off to the north if the patrol hadnt spotted him hed likely have wandered off to freeze unless he was up to something more cunning if i hear him right he says his name is rialus neptos mena and perrin arrived at the command tent a few minutes later the room was just a little above freezing the air clouded with steam and heavy with smoke from the oil lamps the light was imperfect flickering but it revealed a pitiful version of the traitor he stood trembling in the center of a circle of glaring officers what are you doing here mena asked slipping into the ring to face him rialuss body jerked as if she had smacked him his arms were crossed across his chest clutching a book within the clumsy embrace of all his layers instead of answering he tightened his embrace speak fast mena said a moment later she knew that was too much to ask of the man he had a hard time getting his words out through his chattering teeth iive cacacome to hehelp acacia my nation too late for that dont you think bledas asked not too late just late mena watched the man tremble for a time rialus neptos youve walked from our enemys camp after having guided them here from the other side of the world if you have something to say say it and then go back to die along with them rialuss eyes widened in terror no i cant go back theyd kill me theyll know by now they know already edell said because they sent you what lie did they send you to tell no lies he fumbled to get the book in his hands and then thrust it toward her here read my journal read its me in there edell shoved the book back at him you expect us to believe you you no lies rialus said once he was steady on his feet again i came to you to tell you thththings edell seemed ready to shove rialus again but mena stayed him if you have something to say do so the beasts they cacannot fly on their own they need the amulets they have amulets chains that lift them what is he on about bledas said speak sense man the freketes need magic to fly rialus said getting out the first complete sentence that captured the companys attention the effort seemed to exhaust him the freketes need magic to fly mena chewed that a moment and then said lets get him food and hot water give him a hot water bottle and bring him a chair i want him talking without chattering and take that book from him a s the troops assembled for battle a couple of hours later mena stood exhaling the irony of what she was about to do in perplexed plumes of mist watching the enemy amass on the ice in front of them was she really reordering the days battle plans based on testimony she had just received from a babbling mouse of a man who had betrayed her nation twice apparently so because of the rest of the information she had pulled from between rialuss chattering teeth she had altered the arrangement of their battle lines perrins company would hold the center along with haleeven and his mein but mena spaced them loosely and behind their core troops she stationed the newest arrivals to the army praying that they never saw an auldek face that day bledas and edell would take the left flank perceven and gandrel the right archers would stay to the rear of both flanks able to shoot over their companions and into the enemy ranks nothing would look remarkable about the formation to the enemy facing it but there was a reasoning behind it that was entirely different from what she had planned just hours before for herself the battle would begin from the air she stood stroking elyas feathers as her attendant finished tightening her rigging perrin trudged over to her he carried a helmet stuffed under one arm and wore a breastplate emblazoned with his familys insigniathe profile of a wolf black against a backdrop of gold he asked after any last orders and she said there were none rialus got away all right mena asked i think so kants people helped him get back he should be fine the hard part was living through the shock of your sending him back to the auldek he wont buy forgiveness cheaply i need more than what he gave us the officer nodded his agreement but looked uncomfortable doing so perrin i know weve changed this around at the last moment its decided now we have to trust it i trust you princess i just wish we didnt have to rely on that rat maybe the auldek had enough of him and kicked him out for the ice to finish possibly i wouldnt blame them she took in the scene a moment mostly just the soldiers marching into formation she could not actually see the enemy from there but perrin this plan feels right its awful and unjust perhaps but if it saves our soldiers lives its worth it he finished im with you dont think im not are the others they dont like how the information came to us but theyre not foolish enough not to see the logic in it he pulled his helmet down around his head a snug fit with the fur padding that lined it if i die today he said id regret not telling you that im in love with you i hope you dont mind my saying so tugging on her gloves and pulling the wrist straps tight mena asked and if you live ill die of shame mena nudged him away she climbed up into position on elya so im loved elya i dont think melio would approve but its good to know you are too girl you are too lets stay alive all right fly now the ice fell away beneath them the frigid air bit at her cheeks a little way up the wind buffeted them they flew higher and found calmer air from there she flew forward to take in what they faced the auldek forces were arrayed across the ice in a patchwork a martial geometry laid out in a manner she had never seen before not from on high squares and rectangles of troops divided by clan affiliations status and all manner of distinctions mena had little grasp of she knew the strongest clans were in the center front with others to either side at each flank went contingents of animals antoks with harnesses brimming with archers kwedeir with their awkward gait wings tented around them woolly rhinoceroses with riders carrying lances atop them she saw white lions slinking through the lines spotted cats like those from talay wolves the size of horses a few bears tethered to chains roared as if they had not been fed in a week and smelled the banquet awaiting them as she watched a black swell of birds flowed up into the air crows theyve brought their own crows mena said is this a war or a traveling circus at the edge of each flank went the other troops the slaves they stretched all along either side and well back eventually wrapping around to make up the mass that brought up the rear of the host there were so many of them that the front of the line looked wider than the rear it wasnt though it was just that the ranks went back so far that they faded toward their distant camp in dwindling perspective mena tried to do the math she had not managed before but got lost when estimates went beyond fifty thousand elya dipped a wing and swung them around bringing menas army into view as she did so the sight of them was not a surprise but her heart sank her stomach knotted there were not enough of them four thousand at the most they were spread too thin they were simply humans no beasts of war to bellow for them their defeat was not even in question it was as inevitable as the fate of a hill of ants with a booted foot about to crush it mena flew low over them shouting encouragement she touched down on the ice before them and told them not to fear the numbers coming against them this was not about numbers she said it was about heart and right and cunning and freedom she and elya flew up and danced before the line spreading the message as best she could without fail they roared back their affirmation perrin blew the horn that signaled them forward and the two armies marched toward each other though the message was simple and she doubted that many of the men and women in the ranks fully believed it mena was not lying the vastness of the auldek force actually gave her hope rialus had said the auldekthough hundreds of years oldcould only remember eighty years or sos worth of memories they had not fought battles this size in hundreds of years they knew of them only what they had read in books they may be tremendous individual warriors but that did not mean they would know how to fight a largescale engagement this army now marching toward her troops was frightening but it was also absurd it was a little boys fantasy of an army it was brawn and numbers and bellowing creatures and an anvil of might and it made no sense at all if mena had these resources she would never have arrayed them all against an army as paltry as the one she presented with such vast numbers most of them would never come anywhere near the soldiers they were meant to fight they would be useless standing with weapons at hand among a throng of themselves it would only make communication impossible orders unmanageable strategy lost to the dull mind of the mob it had taken them hours of precious daylight just to assemble meaning mena had had time to speak with rialus nor would she have chopped the ranks up by a hierarchy that had nothing to do with an actual battle plan it was vanity it was foolish if mena had devoths army she would have left the bulk of them back in camp eating a hearty breakfast and preparing the evenings victory celebration but im not fighting myself mena said once they were aloft again im fighting them the freketes rose then one after another from the auldek camp as they flew over the invading army the troops erupted in cries booming shouts as loud as the explosions of the night before the beasts flew in dips and rises slipping side to side among one another their wings were massive the heavy weight of their bodies swayed beneath them almost like a separate load being carried by the span the riders on their backs clung to them like young bats to their mothers mena had not thought it through before but now she knew she had never accepted these creatures as they appeared they were too dense too thick with muscle too large and bulky for even those great stretches of wings to lift them thanks to rialus she understood why now it was not that he could confirm it with certainty but he had bet his life on bringing her the intelligence that the amulets that the freketes wore around their necks helped them fly he had seen them without them only a few times only when they were on the ground at leisure being tended and fed when aloft they always had them on the night of the scav attack devoth had waited for bittens amulet to be brought to him and placed on the beast before he flew what if this was not vanity not just a custom or an idiosyncrasy what if the freketes needed the amulets to fly the moment he asked the question he knew the answer to it devoth once mentioned a handful of relics the lothan aklun had given them rialus had said the amulets are some of these relics they were things to trap lothan aklun spells and keep their power mena had to end the meeting before she could question him any further now aloft above her marching soldiers she hoped he had spoken the truth she had not told the others this part of her plan the first clash of the day should be hers it had to be hers she felt the eyes of her troops watching her and she tried to forget them so that she could do what she needed to for them she drew the kings trust and urged elya forward to meet them which one which one mena could not tell the riders or the beasts apart they came on in a swarm the freketes grunted and bellowed to one another carrying on some bestial conversation they all wore chains around their necks amulets heavy on them just as rialus had said all their eyes stayed fixed on her at least ive got their attention she pulled up and hovered elyas wings feathering the air pointing with the kings trust she picked out a frekete and rider you she shouted your name what is your name this set the swarm of them into confusion for a moment they were in the air above and below and before her out on either side now too but they did not attack eventually the rider atop the mount she had pointed at turned it sideways and yelled back howlk he slapped his mount hard on the shoulder nawth nawth mena shouted howlk and nawth i challenge you to make sure he understood she scowled and pumped her sword hand in the air then pointed to them and to herself howlk understood they all did and for a few raucous moments they argued about it as she and elya hovered the freketes and their riders converged on one another like squabbling youths mena sheathed her sword reached down and checked her crossbow memorizing just where the stock of it lay behind her hip the debate did not last long despite whatever protocol mena had usurped with her challenge the others drew back howlk and his mount came forward looking very pleased its you and me now elya first we test them they surged toward them darting to the side at the last minute the freketes howled as nawth pumped his wings in pursuit elya flew higher cut side to side folded her wings in and dove nawth followed her after the first few moves mena reined her back elya was faster much more maneuverable no need to flaunt it though she needed to use it instead on her mental order elya twisted her wings she spun them around flaring out to either side the membranes of her wings filled with the air she grabbed stopping them dead in the air mena pulled out her crossbow she stood in her stirrups and brought the weapon to sight over elyas shoulder she held it onehanded something she could only do for a moment as the weapon was one of the heavy powerful ones her soldiers had used against the foulthings nawth came toward them with wings flapping his body convulsed and clawed at the air as if he were swimming as desperate to get to them as a drowning man is for the surface mena pulled the trigger and shot for the center of that writhing mass the bolt thwacked away scorching the line between them faster than her eye could see nawth caught it in his forearm it was not an intentional block just the result of his thrashing it went in at an angle and hit bone punched through and then pinned his forearm into his chest he howled and dropped elya hovered the two of them watching the frekete fall the other freketes did the same all of them hovering nearby stunned to silence for once the descent did not last long nawth flexed his wings he rose beating them steadily looking up at mena and elya teeth gritted and eyes simmering with new depths of hatred he tore the prongs of the bolt head from his chest and then tugged at it until he had it free of his shattered arm he tossed the bolt to the side it fell toward the ground spinning over and over howlk ripped free the sword he had sheathed diagonally across his back as nawth reached their height mena drew the kings trust she adjusted herself in the saddle blended her mind with elyas readying her nawth moved first he surged forward turning at the last moment and dropping his shoulder so that howlk could swing his sword elya slipped down and to the side howlk cut only air nawth turned and rose elya danced away she spun darted mena kept her close to the frekete but used her speed to dodge nawths lunges avoiding his kicks and howlks sword attacks the two grew more frustrated both of them shouted at her howlk in auldek and nawth in some bestial bellowing akin to words but not quite mena let their anger grow fed further by the derision cast at her from the surrounding freketes and riders all of whom circled them they drew closer making it harder for elya to move one of the other freketes slashed the membrane of elyas wing lets do it now mena thought she let elya choose the moment felt it just before she was going to and agreed nawth got closer than ever before and elya reared back spinning to avoid his grasping bigknuckled hand the move put mena in striking position above howlk for the first time she swung but not for him she aimed for the metal chain on the freketes neck the combined motion of their bodies was too much she missed caught nawths shoulder instead she thought the strikeeven though awkwardly landedwould cut through the coarse muscle all the way to the bone it didnt instead the blade dented his flesh barely drawing blood it was as if she had hit him with a fighting stick not a honed edge at all nawth grabbed for elya she just managed to corkscrew away diving toward the ice in the process mena would have lost her sword if she had not had the leather straps from its hilt wrapped around her wrist she fought to get control of it to keep it from cutting her or elya she lost all sense of the world for a few seconds and then it snapped back into place elya spread her wings and went into a more controlled fall nawth was right behind her he raked the air with his good arm trying desperately to grab her tail which snaked around just out of his reach he was acting on his own frenzied he paid no attention to whatever howlk was shouting at him he ignored the way the auldek tugged the steering harness howlk even reached forward and yanked on the chain that held nawths amulet to get control of him back the thought passed from mena to elya so fast it felt simultaneous elya flipped over angled her wings to break her speed lifting slightly upside down sword in hand mena kicked free of her stirrups she yanked loose the thigh buckle that secured her to the harness she fell free and dropped onto howlks back she landed hard and almost glanced off to the side she wrapped around the startled auldek and caught hold of a handful of his long hair gripping it she lunged forward over his shoulder and struck the chain on nawths neck with all her might it snapped free and dropped away in the moment that howlk stared wideeyed at nawths bare neck mena yanked back his head slipped the cutting edge of her sword right along the rim of his neck guard she let go of his hair grabbed the back edge of the blade with her free hand and yanked the blade into his neck with all the might she had the mans eyesstartlingly bluelooked up at her a childlike disappointment in them his hands came up as if he wanted to explain something to her but they got no farther before his body started to convulse mena shoved him which pushed her body back away from them the three of them fell drifting slowly apart she watched the distance between them grow and then looked past them to the ice field far below the armies just eating into each other for a few moments none of it seemed to have anything to do with her the fact that she plummeted toward the earth with the air raging at her ears and her arms and legs kicked about by the force of her fall did not matter and then elya appeared beside her she touched mena with the bottom of her muzzle that brought mena back she grabbed elyas neck loving her like mad and slipped around and back into the saddle elya slowed their descent enough for them to watch from on high as nawth and howlk crashed down in the center of the auldek formation the soldiers beneath them were squashed on the ice and those around them sprang back sending a shock wave out around them there was too much fighting for all the soldiers to understand what had just happened but the freketes swarmed down landing one after the other around their fallen comrades making the circle of confusion wider mena did not need to watch them she checked what was happening elsewhere there was not much daylight left she caught sight of the sun biting into the horizon and knew the battle had just minutes more before both sides realized they had to withdraw it was hard to make sense of the scene from above but she knew what she was looking for and saw it the auldek in the foremost square of troopsnear where the two had fallenhad pressed forward against perrins troops she knew they would because she had instructed them not to truly engage to fight a slow backward retreat cautious and defensive just staying alive the second thing rialus had told her was about their hidden armor no use wasting lives trying to injure soldiers who could not readily be injured instead it was the units facing the quota slave ranks that truly pressed the attack from above she could see that it was working more so on the left than on the right flank what she did then she explained to elya in images so that she would see it all and fear none of it passing over the crash of the two front lines they swooped low over the right flank of quota warriors seeing the spot she wanted she had elya dip nearly to the ground above a patch of clear ice at what she gauged to be the right moment mena pulled free of her harness for the second time that afternoon she went over backward her legs kicked free of the stirrups and passed through the sky above her all the way over until she was chest down and skimming off elyas back she hit ice knowing she had to roll she did rolled and slid she came out of it with the kings trust in her hand she took out the nearest man by severing his leg at the knee he went down screaming splashing crimson across the ice the next nearest she slashed across the chest another she hit awkwardly with the side of her blade breaking his wrist instead of severing it as the soldiers pulled back to take her in she got her footing she gripped the sword in two hands and steadied herself the fury that she recognized as maeben came into her it had been a while but the screeching wrath of the goddess scorched through her veins now she knew she would remember what she was about to do later with horror at herself but in that moment it did not matter she had a purpose in the world and the blade in her grip was the instrument with which she wrote it she blocked a spear thrown at her cowardly and charged the fool who had thrown it it got bloody after that when elya returned only a few minutes later mena was the center of a swirl of red desolation her blade was warm with the work dripping the ring of soldiers facing her tripped and stumbled on the bodies she had cut down elya swept in emitting a hiss so fierce the enemy soldiers dropped to the ice on hearing it mena sheathed the kings trust and caught elya at a run she leaped just in time to grab her stirrup loop she held on though her arms wanted to pop free of their sockets as elya lifted her into the air a frekete pursued them elya grabbed mena and darted away as nimble as a skylark dodging thrown spears and arrows with a grace that made mena grin pressed into the creatures citrussmelling plumage arms aching and feet running in the air above two armies clashing mena laughed like a madwoman battle joy a shortlived euphoria but in the moment there was nothing else like it in the world the princess laughed so hard it became crying the two blended so that she could not separate one from the other or tell apart the emotions that wracked her battle joy battle shame she owned them both she always would chapter fortyeight dariels second arrival in avina was markedly different from his first this time he walked down the citys wide thoroughfares near a vanguard of escorts mor strode in front of him birke and anira at either shoulder others from the sheeven lek river party made a wedge around them and still more of the people who had met them outside the city increased their numbers dariel gripped leashes securing bashar and cashen to him both of them excited by the commotion stomping about large pawed and awkward in their growing size for this entrance dariel wore no bonds he was not the prisoner that sire neen brought as a token for the auldek nor the one stuffed under tunnels massive arm no bit clogged his mouth instead of bruises and an inflamed lip he wore a face tattooed with the spots of the shivith clan a rune rose from the center of his forehead a declaration for all to see and there were many who wished to see it the throng they cut through grew as they progressed more and more people crowded the streets pushing in to get a look at him they were quiet eerily so the signs of belonging stood out even more than usual because many gathered in clan groups whereas dariel was used to seeing the people as a collage of individuals some tusked and others tattooed some with metal whiskers and others with pale flesh here most seemed to have segregated themselves making blocs of individuals sharing skin tone or altered features they strode past groups of wolflike wrathics all of them looking like birkes kin a small clump of fru nithexek stared their eyes somehow rounder than normal seemingly unblinking for a time several shivith youths ran alongside them they called to one another in amazed voices shouting that the rhuin fa was one of their clan the rhuin fa was shivith their voices were harsh in the relative silence and before long others cuffed them into silence and held them back to fade into the distance on one section of street dariel and his group had to physically plow through a sea of light blue birdlike faces all of them staring at dariel he could not read whether their expressions were kindly curious or hostile or something in between he was glad that mor kept the pace brisk when they passed down a thoroughfare lined with massive statues of strange creatures dariel knew they had arrived they went through a colonnade of painted pillars up a stone staircase and stepped into the gaping mouth that cast them in darkness for a time just as before dariel thought this is just as before except that it was not and could not be as it had been before he had no control over his fate he had no voice this time he had both and he had the responsibility of using them for the good of everyone in this chamber both those who supported him already and those who believed they hated him though he still was not sure how he would manage it he had never felt a clearer sense of purpose he made sure that when he strode into the highceilinged chamber there was nothing but quiet confidence on his face they came to rest at the edge of a large rectangle of light that fell from a skylight throngs of the people crowded the shadows more than he could see or number he did know that they were sectioned by clan affiliation that had been a requirement of dukish of the anet clan it was he who controlled this portion of the city he who permitted this gathering and built his strength on keeping the people divided dariel was trying to sort out who was who when a shape hulked up in front of him a giant of a man converged on him grinning madly his tusks exaggerating his joy rhuin fa there he is tunnel crushed dariel in an embrace lifting him off the ground he spun with him making sure everyone heard and saw that the rhuin fa had arrived hello tunnel dariel managed to gasp good to see you too good that you are alive tunnel said once he had set dariel down i like this its good he touched a thick finger to dariels forehead yes thats good but what are these cathounds if bashar and cashen found anything odd about tunnels appearance they did not show it they jumped into his arms paws on his chest and knees as he bent to greet them he laughed as they slopped his face with their tongues hounds like me tunnel explained they should fear me but back on his feet again he wiped his face dry with a handkerchief before greeting the others he hugged anira at length and mor briefly seeming to know that she would not return the gesture as fully as he offered it birke took the hounds leashes and promised to keep them safe in the back of the chamber dariel let them go reluctantly throughout all this exchange mor scanned the crowd she nodded greetings to some stared icily at others wheres skylene tunnel grew somber she was injured mor shot with an arrow in the chest no dariel said is she all right she is not well where is she mor asked safe for now well take you both to her after this she wants that but she did not want you to know before she did not want it to change anything to rush you or you know how she is as stubborn as you mor but quieter about it mor looked toward the contingent of anets and antoks that grouped beside them she kept her emotions hidden but dariel saw the tightness in the way she moved her neck who shot her not them tunnel said the league did it they the deep sound of a bell resonated through the chamber cutting tunnel off the long tones called the meeting to order each of the clans sent a handful of representatives into the center of the lighted space as they moved anira whispered a few names in dariels ear he knew who they were as she said them and wondered how that was possible plez of the kern randale of the wrathic than with his savage demeanor of the lvin each name he knew just before she uttered it how could that be he may have heard some of the names before but he could place their faces now he even knew things about them that he was sure he had never been told he did not have time to ponder it representing the free people mor stepped forward with tunnel as a towering muscled protector beside her anira brushed past dariel she reached back took him by the wrist and pulled him forward more so than ever he felt the touch of hundreds of eyes on him an anet spoke first he took a loop of metal that looked like a goat horn from the small table it rested on holding it high he called the meeting to order he was not dukish dariel knew but one of his secretaries dukish himself had a seat brought out for him he sat while the others stood legs crossed head tilted and his gaze on something in the chambers shadowy distance he had not as far as dariel knew even looked at him and he did not seem to intend to but looking at dukish dariel realized he knew things about him he knew too much about him dukishs man said that they were all gathered here due to the anet clans generosity he reminded them that weapons were not allowed if any had weapons hidden on them they should leave now or face disgrace and exile for violating that cardinal rule of the gathering someone from deep in the shadows shouted a curse at him but he thrust the horn above his head clenched tight in his fist the horn is the voice he shouted only the holder of the horn speaks many grumbled but nobody disputed the tradition at least not until the anet had held on to it too long doing nothing more than justifying the bloody actions they had taken to secure the city eventually the man did let the horn be tugged from his hand and another speaker stepped up to make his or her case the free people being removed from any particular clan were to be the last to receive the horn dariel would have found the wait interminable if he was not experiencing so much each moment his belief that he knew many of these people grew stronger all the time he did not just read them based on the things they said and their demeanor as they said them dariel remembered other things about them when than spoke he called dukish a tyrant who should be put on trial for every murder he had incited he roared his words with passion and a lions strength of bearing but he said nothing about his shame over not being asked to go with his auldek masters on their war march dariel remembered the man making that confession to him admitting how much that shamed him he saw that emotion behind every gesture but knew that nobody else did randale of the wrathic reminded them that ushen brae was vast and should be settled that the clans could divide and live separately they should first share out the resources and wealth of avina equally dariel watching one version of him recalled another speaking quietly about how he wanted only to go to rath batatt himself and range across the mountains there like the wolf his long teeth were modeled after plez of the kern did not say the thing that troubled her most that with the lothan aklun dead they no longer had any way to make the belonging changes to any new people who arrived what would happen she wondered when the next generation of kern did not have blue skin or a beaked appendage that lengthened their noses would there even be another generation of kern nor did maren speaking for the kulish kra admit that her mind was mostly on her lover an antok man who had been forced by his clan affiliation to leave her there was so much behind each speakers words so many hidden fears and objectives thoughts noble and sometimes wicked it was almost too much for dariel to sort through a bombardment beyond anything he had experienced before he held it all within himself behind a calm facade with so many eyes on him he could not show uncertainty whatever was happening mattered it was important it was part of what he was here to do during their discourses each of the clan leaders mentioned dariel in some way or other some praised him randale wanted very much to hear what he had to say some expressed doubts about him than questioned why he wore shivith markings if he was truly of the old lands some attacked him as a fraud how convenient the antok contingent said that the rhuin fa had been found just after the auldek fled if he was truly the rhuin fa why had he not come in all the years that the auldek had enslaved them a good question dariel acknowledged not sure how to answer that and what sense did it make that the rhuin fa should be the heir of the bloodline who had sold them for generations the anet speaker had asked why should any of them believe that he was not just lying to them trying to use their own legend against them and why he asked should they turn their backs on the league it was the league after all that set in motion the chain of events that destroyed the lothan aklun and set the auldek on the warpath none of that is a lie dariel thought and yet neither does it equal the truth when the horn finally passed into mors hand the anet who handed it to her made it clear it was an indulgence to even do so how many did she truly represent who were the free people now that everything had changed the old and infirm rejects living in the wilds of the country you have no voice here he said mor wrenched the horn away dont i what am i speaking with then this is my voice and the free people speak for all of you whether you are wise enough to know it or not who but we kept the dream of freedom and unity alive all these years you do us wrong to abandon us now yoen and elders than strode up to her he grabbed the horn ignoring the way tunnel glared at him he did not pull it away from her he just held it with her for a moment we know what you think he said we have all heard your speeches enough times to spit them back at you i want to hear what he says he thrust his index finger of his free hand at dariel judging by the roar of voices that seconded him the entire chamber awaited the same before you do mor said you should know thatmor turned and met dariels eyesthat i did not want to trust him i hated him when i first set eyes on him i wanted him to fail and to be revealed as just another devious akaran but i was wrong dariel has fought for us without him we would never have destroyed the soul catcher the league would have it instead of the lothan aklun the sky watcher na gamen knew him took him in and gave his soul into him listen to what i say and think what it means i have come to believe that dariel akaran can help save us from ourselves from the league listen to him carefully mor tugged the horn from than and extended it toward dariel he stepped forward and took it staring into her eyes as he did so by the giver she was beautiful he had come to accept that she loved another woman and could never return his desire but he would always find her features lovely he had not known how much warmth would flood into him at hearing that she believed in him but flood him it did enough so that he looked away from her and took in the crowd they stared at him waiting the horn in his hand was heavy solid metal warm from the touch of the hands that had been holding it for the past few hours all those hands all the things they had argued for and secretly thought he knew better than anyone that so far the meeting had been a vast confusion they would never be able to vote on anything or to walk away from here with an agreement that would serve all unless you know my name he began his voice not nearly loud enough he raised it i should declare it with my own lips though i am dariel akaran third child of leodan akaran who was the twentyfirst ruler of acacia i wear this mark that says rhuin fa but i will answer to that name only if you decide it belongs to me i want to explain the antok speaker interrupted him how do you speak auldek if you are from akaran lands you would not speak it as you do like it was your first tongue i speak this way because i was meant to speak this way because i was destined to stand before you and say the things im saying i spoke barely a word of this tongue when i arrived here but i am not the same man as when i arrived here i wear this face now this mark i speak this language and the heart behind all these things has found the purpose it did not have before dukish whispered something under his breath to his secretary the man came forward with a hand stretched out to take the horn back dariel twisted away from him holding the horn high and out of his reach you want to hear me speak then let me speak listen when he was sure they all were listening he began again he admitted that he had been born in the palace of acacia he was raised in privilege with maids about him nannies and servants and guards with a father he loved and siblings beside him most of you had similar things didnt you at least parents and siblings you loved he said and a place you knew as home i know now that each one of you had those things taken from you i know now that it was my family that sold you and i know now how horrible a crime that was i did not know it then as you were children so was i as you learned what life held for you here so did i learn hardship i wont say its equal to yours but hear me he knew he was already talking too much losing some of them but he wanted them to know him what else did he have but words the more they heard his voice the more they would recognize it he described the first invasion of his childhood hanish mein coming out of the north his numrek allies with him he explained the betrayal of his guardian and how a giant of a man named val became a second father to him he spoke of his life as a raider and his war with the league and of later reuniting with his siblings and of seeing his brother killed and of feeling himself uncomfortable in the skin of royalty regained he talked about the years he had tried to find a way to live meaningfully and said he had never felt he had until the strange events that brought him to ushen brae and shoved him under tunnels arm and earned him the scratches mors shivith claws made on his cheek and which led eventually to the sky watcher na gamen showing him centuries of history and writing the rune he now wore on his forehead that is who i am he said thats the journey that brought me here but none of it matters at all if i cannot help you build the best nation you can here in ushen brae that is the calling i was looking for but did not know how to find i had always wondered what sense it made to be born in luxury and to lose it to have a family and to lose it to have a nation but to be taken from it now i know those are the steps in the life that brought me here to you because of that i know not one of them was mistaken not one of them would i change not since they led me here to you he let his gaze move around in silence he looked not just at the clan representatives but at the crowds behind them he touched on face after face remembering things about them all as his eyes met theirs that was when he understood why he knew them he had dreamed them those dreams in which he had spoken to the people of ushen brae were not just dreams they had really happened he knew it and he tried to make them know it as he gazed at them perhaps they already did for they held their silence waiting for him to go on now that im here i have to do something or my life will not be worth anything so here is what i argue for unity among you now is no time to forget the dream youve shared of being free people its no time to see differences its madness to think that the souls and hearts of the kern are any different from the souls and hearts of the wrathic do you know now just how mad it is in my countryi mean in the known world in our country back there he pointed toward the sea back there we are divided you know that dont you we are not one nation that acts together that sent you to this land in some mutual agreement back there we fight among ourselves we have for centuries we see difference everywhere we see excuses to exclude to suppress to exploit we always have i remember when i arrived in falik for the first time it wasnt as if i had never seen the people of balbara before but being in among them hit me in the gut in the eyes in the ears everywhere black black skin do you know it skin so dark that it looks up close like the only color skin could be compared to it the weak brown that i am was embarrassing and what then of the thin paper that is meinish skin what of the short stature of vumu the red hair and freckles of aushenians in the known world we see all those differences seeing them were afraid when i was a child i was told my people were the center of the world and that all around from white to black were races who had not the right to rule that my people did if i was not to be afraid of others i had to rule them suppress them that was our mistake look now at yours he pushed out of the representatives circle and walked along before the front rows of the spectators standing before the gray skin and tusks of the antoks he said look at you youve all forgotten the racial differences that mean so much in my country here if i look hard enough i see beneath the gray coloration of your skin i see balbara features in you nem he indicated an antok man the man looked stunned dariel stared at him and then looked around at those near him seemingly verifying from their expressions that they heard him call him by name and in you maris i see meinish blood its there in the shape of your nose in those lightcolored eyes of yours dariel moved on he pointed out others named them and asked them to remember where they came from they had been born in specific regions of the known world and yet here none of that mattered the auldek had not cared and so the lothan aklun had ignored those differences as they sorted them into clan groups the lothan aklun gave them different characteristics ones shaped by auldek fantasies and now dariel said youve forgotten what you learned the race you were born into doesnt matter to you it doesnt matter if youre bethuni or candovian meinish or talayan or senivalian it doesnt matter if your skin is black or brown or pale as milk youve left those things behind because you all came here united in bondage why should the clan youve been sorted into matter it doesnt dukish wants you to think it does he wants to teach you to fear one another he doesnt say those words he doesnt even know it himself he says anets are strong that they should rule antoks can share ushen brae with them take control and have status but why does any of that convince you because of fear the moment you begin to consider having more than someone else you begin to fear you might end up with less than someone else thats the trick of the mind that dukish has worked on you lies a voice mumbled dariel knew whose it was he had heard that voice in his dreams all lies dukish i wish you no ill dariel had to wait as several people stepped out of the line of sight between him and the anet leader i wish you no ill but you have put ushen brae in danger the war you have waged against the other clans and the deals you have worked out with the league are crimes that will keep the people in bondage if you do not stop who are you to talk dukish said he did not rise but his voice was strong and his gaze fixed finally on dariel shot hatred at him a prince he spit the words do you know what a prince is the child of a man one who has done nothing and yet enslaves the world and is too much a coward to admit it a prince dariel fingered the horn in his grasp he held it still but did not raise it dukish the league does not wish you well they want us all weak they want to elevate one of us above another only because its easier to then exploit us all thats what they have always done they will use ushen brae now as much as they ever have more perhaps because youll be victims no longer youll be part of it with them the league promises you fertile slaves they want to sell them to you they want you to become slavers i can offer you something better when we have sent the league from ushen brae i will call upon my country to bring you settlers think of that husbands and wives who will come here of their own accord who want to make a place for themselves in this land why wouldnt they ive seen ushen brae its beautiful its a continent that cries out for souls to live in it again to fill its ancient cities and to work the lies dukish shouted he pushed up so fast his chair tipped over and crashed behind him he was a short man stout around the chest menacing as he pushed closer only the league knows how to make us fertile again sire lethel can undo what the lothan aklun did to us you cannot can you before dariel could respond anira did yes he has done it already dariel stared at her she walked toward him and took the horn before she continued speaking i dariel i didnt plan to tell you like this i told you once that the sky watcher showed me a vision of the future and of the role i could play in it he did not claim it was the future that would be but just that it could be a small flock of raucous birds swept through the chamber skimming the roof and squawking the whole time anira watched them until they slipped into the shadows and disappeared when she stayed silent dariel prompted and she looked around speaking to everyone in all the years that there have been quota children in ushen brae not one has ever grown into a mother or a father this was the curse for us we know this dukish said we wanted the trade to end but if it did we knew we would end anira continued the free people i mean our ways the things we made despite our captivity eventually we would age and die our freedom if we ever won it would be the beginning of our end that was what i always believed i think that we all did nowshe turned and looked at darieli know differently because of you dariel akaran because of you and me and because of what we are creating dariel knew at some level that she was not talking about the pact between the clans and the fight against the league but it was not until she slid one of her hands across her abdomen that the clouds blew completely away and the realization of what she was saying stood there clear as day clear as a palm pressed lovingly against a womans abdomen its early days anira said but there is life within me i know it i can feel it the sky watcher na gamen told me it could be so and it is im sorry for not telling you dariel but na gamen told me this could be my destiny i have your child in me the entire chamber erupted dukish cursed it all as a fraud it was all planned he said a lie he knew it to be a lie he had proof it was hard to know if anyone heard him for people from all the clans pushed in close to anira some of them touched her belly others looked her in the face and searched for the truth others shouted the joy of it and still others called foul tunnel trying to protect her got into a shoving match with several antoks had they weapons there would have been slaughter and if mor had not clasped her hand over aniras and raised the horn high the place might have descended into chaos calm show calm mor shouted do you really want to learn of life and respond with chaos free people step away back it took her some time but the crowd did draw slowly back mors voice grew calmer as she gained more control of them see the leaguemen want to sell us something that can be freely given there is nothing more to it than joining with dariels people we have a future a free future all we need do is embrace it hearing the buzz of enthusiasm this met with dukish shouted to be heard no no no no he is the one who sold us his people now the league has freed us and he wants us to be slaves again i can prove it he lifted his chin and projected his voice over the crowd bring the prisoners for a moment there was confusion shouted words and questions a murmuring throughout the entire chamber mor demanded to know what was happening but dukish looking smug ignored her and repeated his order people turned as a group of antoks strode down one of the open corridors they shoved and cursed as they did making room there in the center of them four figures weighted by chains in all the commotion dariel could not make out their faces until their escorts deposited them in the center of the lighted square the brawny guards drained away leaving the four prisoners standing dejected frightened in the center of the gathering dariel recognized them he blinked unsure if he could trust his eyes still stunned by aniras revelation melio clytus geena as he said their names their eyes found him they stared each of them looking at him and none of them recognizing him how different he must look one of the quota slaves among others like him he tried to move toward them but dukishs men blocked him these prisoners were caught trying to enter avina dukish said my brothers the antoks captured them and together we got the truth from them they came looking for dariel akaran they came as spies planning to take over this land no dariel said they want to make us slaves again they dont like that the league is willing to partner with us thats why this man is here trying to trick you i dont know how he does it some trick of the lothan aklun all to keep us passive as they tighten their chains around us again no dariel said no dukish asked i have their written confessionssigned by them dariel tried to shove his way toward the prisoners but dukishs men beat him back they would never confess to that because it isnt true clytus tell them the truth the man stared all the harder at the mention of his name but he did not respond dariel realized he had been speaking auldek he switched to acacian clytus its me dariel spratling yes its me dont worry youll be free in a moment i promise it dukish ignored him he droned on building his case on a foundation of lies dariel grasped for the horn mor released it and dariel held it high he jumped with it shouting until people acknowledged him and dukish began to lose their attention these people are my friends dariel admitted but if they came here it was to find me not to harm you in any way dont let dukish speak for them he cannot be trusted nothing he has said here today has been true dukish cursed him you know in your heart thats not true you told me so you told me the truth of yourself never you told me of the way you coveted your masters wealth dukish moved nearer people cleared away from in front of him i never did i dont want to have to say this but i need you to speak truthfully i spoke with dukish as i spoke with all of you you all know thats true as you told me secrets so did he i know your hearts and i do not judge you by whats in them liar dariel said dukish has secrets from you all no of course he does there were things done to him that no dariel punched the air with the hand that held the curl of iron i hold the horn he snapped at dukish be quiet while i speak things were done to him that should not have been you know of what i speak dont you dukish started to say something but tunnel moved on him as if he would hit him if he spoke other anets shouldered closer they jostled dukish and in the confusion he almost lost his footing dariel continued think dukish about the things you confessed to me he looked the anet leader in the eyes he really did not want to say what he was about to it was cruel it would hurt it did not seem fair to break the mans confidence so publicly he could say that dukishs master had raped him since his earliest days in avina he used him on a balcony overlooking the skyline of avina he set his head and shoulders out over the railing and took pleasure in dukishs fear that he might thrust him over the edge to his death at any moment he could say just what dukish hadthat it was there looking out over the city as his master used him that he learned fear and hate and that he first dreamed of the things he would do to others if only he had the power he was not born an evil man dariel could say he was born weak petty scared that is why hes done the things he has here not because he is strong but because he is weak im sorry dukish to say that about you i take no joy in it he could say all those things and everyone would know that they were true but he could not be that cruel instead he said admit to me that you know i hold your truth within me just do that and i will say no more about it now or ever you can say whatever you want dukish said he pushed closer to dariel he stood just before him now nobody will remember ill make sure of it his hand suddenly clenched a knife he was so close and people packed so tightly around them that dukish had only to thrust the knife forward it sank into dariels gut before he could say or do anything he could only manage a gasp so overwhelming was the pain dukish held him on his knife blade his face a rictus of hatred that dariel stared into for a moment then the world turned black t his time dariel barely dropped out of life before he was thrust back up into it when he could see again he saw a chamber in chaos hands held him up dragging him back from the center of the confusion the pain at his center was incredible the knife was still inside him the hilt of it jutted out the point jolting him with continued shocks of misery he wanted nothing more than to curl over it to wrap himself around it completely and ignore everything else instead he looked up at what was happening no dariel thought no dukish and his anets fought like mad with tunnel and mor and many others they pounded one another with fists and elbows punching and clawing tunnel bashed his way toward the anet leader using his forehead to smash the faces of any who opposed him dukish fought like a trapped animal his face crazed shouting something again and again the lvin converged on them than raked an anets eyes with the claws at his fingertips mor managed to sink hers into dukishs cheek before getting pushed back on a surge she seemed as desperate to tear him apart as he was to survive with all his strength dariel threw both his arms up it hurt so much his vision blurred and rippled he held his arms high stiff and trembling palms flat for all to see dont it was not a loud scream but some heard it first just those holding him aniras face came into view beside his and then those around him turned to look and then others as word began to pass more and more faces turned toward him the knot of fighting went on a little longer but even dukish sensed the growing hush he froze his arm cocked back to punch tunnel who had finally reached him he followed the others gazes and found dariel he stared openmouthed all of them did all of them watched as dariel shook off the hands holding him and stood on his own im all right he thought he was not really part of him had just died part of his and na gamens soul was oozing out of him even as he stood there he reached down and took the hilt of the knife with both hands he held for a few breaths and then pulled on it it felt like he was ripping out a link in his spine like it was part of him and would not come and then it did he screamed it out of him with a surge of blood the knife clattered to the floor he let his hands drop and stood there swaying on his feet trembling im all right he thought then he remembered he needed to say it out loud im all right to prove it he stripped off his bloodsoaked shirt he wadded it and wiped at his torso turning as he did so he did not get all the blood off but it was clear that the gash that should have killed him was already just a welt of inflamed skin everyone stared at him the silence hummed and vibrated in the air for a long time until tunnel called out his name not dariel akaran though his new name the one only they could truly bestow on him tunnels voice said it and then another repeated it and then many more took it up dariel stood shirtless and bloody at the center of the chamber filled with the freed slaves of ushen brae as they named him the rhuin fa chapter fortynine one day after aliver told his sister about what sire dagon had written they both agreed that they would permit themselves one day for corinn the news of what she had done with the vintage had a breadth of atrocity that she could fathom no more than learning of her own pending death or alivers it was all too huge she wanted to collapse beneath the weight of it in utter misery she wanted to take up that knife again and end herself it was only at alivers urging and hanishs quiet whisper that she agreed to put the enormity of the world aside for just one day the last they would spend with the ones they loved from the middle hours of one morning through an afternoon and evening still further through the dark hours of the night and into the next sunrise that was the span of time that corinn and aliver let the world wait for them they spent it together with their children for corinn it was a lifetime in the short span of time she had left to live corinn would cherish many moments from that single day when she lowered the cowl from her chin was one such moment she hated doing so and acquiesced only after aaden had asked her to quite firmly she searched his face for any sign of disgust there was a tenseness in his jaw and a quiver on his left cheek and a sudden moistness that brimmed his eyes but there was no disgust he said mother look at that now why did they do that he sounded like an old woman full of empathy his fingers extended toward her asking permission she gave it with a nod and he touched her damaged face to her surprise she felt the warmth of the life within him his skin soft gentle for a few seconds she almost thought his touch had healed her then she raised the cowl into place a few days ago she would not have been content to sit with benabe across the table from her she would not have been able to look at shen and acknowledge the loveliness of her round brown face without fearing that it threatened her sons legacy she would not even have allowed her brother to be fully himself as she sat with them listening to the tale they had to tell the things that had once seemed logical reactions to a predatory world now seemed like rules composed in a foreign language she did not understand herself anymore the woman she had been stood unmasked she felt that she in her own way had been a puppet to base parts of her nature that should never have been allowed to rule her leave that for now hanish said she tried to they climbed up to the terrace of first light later in the morning elyas children were there almost too large now to all crowd into the space they seemed to sense that something was wrong from the moment corinn entered they greeted her halfcovered face with suspicion sniffing her and scenting the air with their slim tongues corinn calmed them by sending soothing yet somber thoughts to them i dont like them as much as elya aaden said he turned apologetically to her im sorry to say that they are incredible mother but elya is special i dont think that any of these would have saved me the same way she did do you corinn ran her palm over his head all the answer she wished to give still when aliver and shen shot up into the air on kohls back aaden clawed at her begging to follow po competitive as always was eager to oblige the four of them swept down from the palace over the terraced layers of the city they swept over the lower town and then beat their way higher corinn thought of the day when all four akaran children had ridden horseback with their father they had galloped out from the town and along the winding road over the islands hills down to that beach the one she saw hundreds of feet below her now that had been a memorable day perhaps for these children this was another such day she hoped so they flew out to havens rock where they stood in the wind and listened to aliver eulogize his former tutor jason and leeka alain of the northern guard the first to slay a numrek and the only one to ever run down fleeing sorcerers he thanked the tutor for being the first to draw the map of the world in alivers mind for being such a lover of knowledge and a keeper of history it was he who first challenged my princely arrogance i should have thanked him more for that before this about leeka he said and here after years of service his last deed he returned to us and said the words that saved us for the now looking at corinn he added in the end he did what mattered for that he will not be forgotten after that they returned to joy they dove down from heights like seabirds they skimmed out over the water the waves growing more and more pronounced as the sea grew deeper aaden shouted above the rushing air its wonderful mother lets go faster this is like mena said corinn did not know quite what he meant and she could not ask she could go faster though she urged po to do so a nd then all too quickly it was night how tired they all were or should be but were not really the notion of sleeping hours away seemed so wasteful when aaden proposed that they stay together throughout the entire night corinn was amazed at how easily that problem was solved of course why sleep there were not enough hours left to sleep listening to the two childrens cheers corinn could not help but think of that day long ago when her father promised them a latenight snowball fight that night never came to be this one would they had the servants stoke the fire in the center of a small amphitheater on alivers terrace night sky clear and chilly above them they curled up among the blankets and cushions and furs so many things to remember the shape of shens teeth when her head was thrown back in laughter the way benabe could make any sentence into a song just by putting music in her voice the stories barad told the tree trunk of a man stone eyed holding the children rapt with his deep voice corinn would always remember the comfort she took when she slipped aadens head from her lap thinking he was asleep she tried to move away but he said mother its not over is it she could not speak and his eyes were closed but he did not need to hear or see her answer youll fix it i know you will a little later after sleep finally overpowered both children beside the fire pit the two monarchs sat beside each other on the stone bench that looked out over the harbor they had both read yet another message this one from mena describing what she intended to do corinn tried to reach out to her across the distance she was tired enough that it almost worked she did shoot up out of her body and above the palace she flew wingless toward the north but as with that time she had searched in vain for dariel she eventually came to a halt hanging in the air no feeling for where to go or how to reach her mena is a warrior if anyone can hold back the auldek she can aliver said then he asked her more about dream travel about what it felt like to separate a soul from a body and about what she knew of how the auldek could hold spare life forces inside themselves she had rhrenna bring her documents the league had provided and together the siblings talked through the fantastical horror of it what greater form of slavery could there be aliver asked enslaving not bodies but souls corinn did not answer for she could think of none as corinn had wanted to speak with her brother without other mens voices she had asked barad and hanish to stay among the others instead she spoke with a quill and parchment it made her choose her words carefully she wrote i know i just wish i could have seen her again and dariel i sent them both so far away now i cant understand why i didnt want them near me and aaden dont make mena wait long go as fast as you can reach her fight beside her if i could i would go with you ill get to her ill do everything i can to end this before i end myself ill do the same aliver slid a hand over hers held it there a moment she did not like the quiet hopelessness of the gesture she pulled her hand away wrote and turned the page so he could see i know what to do i have the book it took a moment for this to fully sink in when it did his eyes came back to hers not so hopeless anymore you have it corinn nodded and then playfully nudged him on the shoulder he understood of course you have it he said you didnt send the santoth to it you sent them away from it my clever sister the way lines formed at the edge of her eyes was the only way she could indicate that she was smiling she saw that aliver saw it and was glad what will you do with the book can you destroy it she shook her head and wrote its not mine to destroy aliver thought about that for a time all right its not yours to destroy it was here before us and it might be wrong to take it from the world completely that could be another mistake i understand that what then return it return it to whom to the worm i dont understand corinn looked at him and then at where barad slept she seemed to consider waking him but then shook the thought away pulling the tablet onto her lap she leaned to write her response with her posture she told aliver not to begin reading until she was done she wrote for a long time and then slid the tablet back into his hands she moved away to the railing as he bent to read she had written from the day i began to study the song i felt a living force protest in my mind it was a great worm i sometimes imagined it rising from the floor of the sea its jaws so large they could close around all of the isle of acacia i knew it to be angry with me and i thought it a foulthing i know now thats not right that creature was always telling me to return the book to it that creature is its protector it was of the world before elenet edifus called on it to devour the book to eat it and hold it inside its body thats what it did tinhadin should have left it there how do you know all this she pressed her fingers to her chest indicating that she felt it in her heart i know it she wrote how do you take the book to this worm i find it i dont think it will be hard it is somewhere beneath the gray slopes po will fly me there the two siblings sat in stillness for a while she thought of leeka alain in the moment just before his death what do you think leeka was trying to tell us aliver shook his head that was all the answer he had eventually corinn asked the question aaden would have wanted her to she wrote might it be untrue aliver did not have to ask what she was referring to i know i should wonder that myself but i dont i feel the truth of it i feel nearer to returning to where i should be i feel no fear of it sadness yes but i dont doubt that dagon wrote the truth she wrote nor do i i wish the first time he was truthful wasnt this so much conspiring he and iweve conspired our lives away thats the only part of this that feels right i couldnt live with this guilt the santoth the vintage jason and kelis and barad the things i did to everyone i couldnt live with it but knowing of my approaching death helps we have little time and much to do seek paddel the vintner on prios make him tell you everything about the vintage its mist by another name aliver another of my crimes make him tell you aliver nodded i will what of elyas children theyre monsters corinn i know you didnt intend that but she stopped him by beginning to write i did intend it they are monsters but they are our monsters use them as long as i live they will be true to us i sang that into them before they were even born after that i cannot say after i die it will be different but trust them until that she paused a moment and then wrote i dont deserve this day the fullness of it the time to talk with you even like this i dont deserve it of course you do corinn exhaled through her nose ive planted nothing but evil seeds now they have sprung to life none of them as i imagined alivers hand stopped hers he had been reading as she wrote dont thats the past i look at you and i see so much to admire it means a great deal to me that you treat my daughter with love and that you are kind to benabe i barely knew her yet still it matters and i know that the sister i had but a few days ago would have seen only challenge in them only foes and dangers to be clipped and controlled you dont have to explain that to me thats what it means to be siblings i do know the worst of you whether you like it or not he smiled but i also know that you would not be here as you are today with them sleeping over there after such a wonderful day if the love that you are showing wasnt in you always thats why i cannot be angry with you anger would be a waste of the moments we have and it would make us weak in the face of the things we have yet to do it sounded so good when he said it she sat with that a while hoping it was true after a while she wrote did you love her she pointed her chin toward benabe who slept with her arm over shen i might have i was too young to know he thought a moment she was very beautiful still is really if we had more time yes if we had more time still later in the night corinn sat at a table not far from the others quills paper and ink at hand she had a note to compose hanish stood with a hand on her shoulder you didnt tell him about the hard part hanish said about the fact that youre planning to lure the santoth into the worms mouth as well that will not be easy she thought no need to worry him thats for me to deal with now be quiet i have only a few hours to write everything i can for aaden you can watch over my shoulder but dont say anything when she had confirmation that he would not she lifted the quill and considered what she wished most to say she knew how she would begin and how she would end it the same phrase the truth it was all the things in between that would take some sorting she wrote his name and then i love you in all the long life that you have before you i hope that you find love in all its complicated variations and each time it confounds you and surprises you hurts you and heals youremember me for the love i mean includes all those things pausing she wondered how much she should say what she should withhold it pained her to think of some of the lessons she had given the boy things she did not believe now and doubted she ever had not completely hopefully some of that would fall away from him hopefully he would be better than she had taught him less afraid more trusting it was dangerous to be all those things but it was even more dangerous to be as she had been one cannot be whole unto themselves she knew that now she would tell him as much she would tell him everything she could so that this letter spoke to him in the years to come she dipped the quill and continued writing t he next morning she and aliver met as the sun rose they laid out the future as they agreed it should be had it put in writing sealed and official and then locked away the business of it took every moment up until the expiration of the single day corinn kept her parting brief private it was not vanity that stopped her from addressing the populace she would proudly enough have stood before them she was still herself in aadens eyes so no one else could hurt or embarrass her nor did she mind asking barad to be her voice to the world he had a good voice she had always liked it and the fact that he gave it to her of his own free will did much to comfort her the reason she said goodbye to her family in private was that she wanted no pomp on her departure she did not wish to speak grandiose words to instill either hope or worry aliver would stay after her to speak with the people in ways that brought the best out of them what she needed to do she had to do alone so thats how she set out or almost alone youre finally going to let me ride on your blessed mount hanish asked he stood beside her as she made lastminute checks to her straps harness and supply satchels i never stopped you you were just nervous you dont like it that he can see you it was true pos eyes did follow hanish he was not a particularly curious creature but he seemed to recognize something unusual in hanishs presence he squinted one eye and then the other when looking at him as if testing something about his vision there was no aggression in it though corinn sensed that the dragon recognized that hanish was somehow a part of her that they were related to him through the magic that had shaped them she hugged everyone she held shens face in her palms and stared at it a long time and she had hanish and barad explain to her that there was absolutely no blame on her for bringing the santoth to acacia that was corinns responsibility shen should never feel another moment of guilt for it in parting with aaden she slipped the folded and sealed note into his hands she told him not to rush to open it read when he was ready wait as long as he wished she pressed alivers hand in hers and asked him to speak the truth of her to mena when he reached her let her know that in the end at least she tried to be somebody maeben on earth would be proud of and then before emotion could get the better of her she mounted po and they leaped into the air she did not look back until she was some distance away so what do we do first hanish asked first we find the santoth who knows what theyve gotten up to or how cross theyll be now that they know calfa ven does not contain what they seek and then and then we destroy them if its possible we destroy them we make things right again hanish with his arms around her waist and lips close to her ear said all right lets do that chapter fifty rialus worried to no end about the frostbite that damaged the tip of his nose and the skin of his cheeks it did not go deep but he feared that devoth or sabeer or allekannoying allekwould notice it and question him to him the dead flesh which went red and painful and peeling as it warmed in his room wrote his whole escapade right there on his face he would cave at the first query where had he been that first day of battle why had somebody seen him trekking across the snow was that where he got that frost damage to his skin had he really thought he could desert them and that his people would want him back it all felt like such a great folly shuffling away from the enormous torches that were the burning towers stumbling into the dark fearful every moment of discovery and then eventually alone in the howling arctic night how foolish and then he had been found bundled into the acacian camp surrounded interrogated as cold and as miserable as he had been joy had sputtered to life a single candle flame of heat and light within him how foolish he had spoken to princess mena in the flesh offering his pathetic bits of information thinking he was saved he was with acacians again he was with his people how foolish scarcely an hour of hope and then back to the ice again sent away by people who loved him not back into the jaws of his enemy he would have liked to believe it was a nightmare except that the proof of its reality was right there in the bits of flesh that fingel trimmed away from his face right there in the wounds she treated with an alcohol ointment that kicked his eyes back into his head with the scorching pain of touch he could not tell if she enjoyed hurting him she worked actually as if the pain did not occur to her at all fool rialus he said why even have your face tended let it fester and go green and kill you death you know is your only way out of this misery fingel said nothing she hardly ever said anything finished with her work she turned away with the warm water bloody towels and shears she put them down and then checked the small pot of broth she had brewing over a shallow pitch fire they wouldnt have me fingel rialus said he could not tell if she listened to him at all so unresponsive was she to his words he spoke anyway a habit he took some comfort in which soothed his occasional stutter right out of his voice i tried but they wouldnt have me they sent me back told me to bring them more to them im nothing but a traitor he watched the shape of her back as she worked even bundled under several layers of clothing he could still make out her figure he had studied it often enough and thought of it many a time in erotic fantasies why had he never forced her because im afraid of what that would mean about me it would mark the end of anything worthwhile in me i wonder if you would kill me if i asked you to it would be your last act as my slave i could write a note explaining that i had ordered you to do it so that you wouldnt get punished i wonder if you would and yet he did not make the simple changes to his phrasing that would have made the question the young woman had to answer instead he looked at his damaged face in his hand mirror he slurped the meat broth fingel had made for him he waited for the summons he dreaded and anticipated i t did not come not that day at least not during the following evening nor in the dark of that night his station remained immobile steaming away like a behemoth at rest he heard movement outside all the normal sounds men shouting laborers at work beasts bellowing a few times he heard the distinctive chattering of freketes in flight they seemed louder than usual more agitated and yet hour after hour passed without the expected knock on his door or the shout that would call him to explain himself on the morning of the second day since the battle rialus could not help asking fingel what was happening outside she had just returned from some errand stripping off layers she said nothing nothing wheres devoth why havent they called for me he knew she would not answer these questions he followed them with others that she did not answer either eventually he could not take her silence anymore he pulled on his furs yanked tight his hood and shoved his hands into his mittens he went out to find the people he most feared finding devoth and the other clan leaders sat at council in the large station outfitted for the purpose the human guards at the entrance barely noticed as rialus walked past them they seemed preoccupied they talked among themselves argued actually rialus slipped inside the council was in full swing crowded and contentious several auldek were talking at once each of them vying to be the center of discussion and none of them managing it i told you we were too many calrach said when nobody listened he slammed his palm on the table you forget that we numrek did this journey before fought these acacians before i told you it was foolish to display the whole army in front of them now you see why we can do nothing with so many against so few we should be more selective to this skahill offered the slight that the numrek had made this crossing before but they did so like thieves in the night with no one to oppose them until they were welcomed as guests given a fortress and a steaming chamber to feast in considering that what did calrach know about how to fight the war they were fighting up here on the ice you want to be more selective perhaps we should send the numrek to do battle by yourselves all eleven of you will that shut your mouth i would do it with joy calrach ground through his teeth no sign in his visage of the joy he spoke of not everyone is so afraid to die as you afraid anets were in the front lines we pleaded for the cowards to fight us so you say perhaps you pleaded them to bend you over and skahill shot to his feet slamming a fist on the table as he did so and roaring in wordless rage calrach shoved the man next to him as he began coming around the table skahill did the same upsetting chairs and the people in them clawing with one hand for his dagger faster than rialus could follow with his eyes sabeer went from sitting to crouching on top of the table with an arm thrust toward either man each fist clenched a curved crescent of steel she stayed that way a moment lean and gorgeous utterly terrifying stop it keep bickering and ill take you to death myself say another word in anger either of you just one more word neither man took her up on that they continued to glare at each other but they held their tongues and crashed back into their seats if they had not been warriors they could have been chastened angry children what in hadins name is going on here rialus wondered he had never seen the auldek so illtempered herith glared at sabeers back as she climbed down from the table or so melancholy millwa leaned forward on the table his head cradled in his hands or so distressed jafith well if rialus had not found the idea impossible he would have said that jafith had been crying recently and devoth wore a look of profound perplexity written on the lines of his forehead and with the vague unfocused way his gaze floated without fixing on anything what in hadins name rialus avoided the empty seat at devoths side his seat he slunk around the edge of the chamber and found a stool that hid him behind the bulky shoulders of several of the chieftains assistants there he listened as the chieftains paid those behind them no mind he even scooted up beside the assistants and whispered questions to them in the hours that followed he pieced together a mental mosaic of what had transpired the battle had not gone well for the auldek at all instead of a day of glorious slaughter they had experienced one of confusion frustration humiliation and even an auldek death this latter thing it took him some time to understand he could not picture how it came about but somehow mena had cut through most of howlks neck in midair both of them riding on nawths back the impact from his fall finished the job sending his head twirling across the ice through the feet of the highstepping horrified auldek his body spasmed through death after death all his lives tearing themselves out of him in one long agony the auldek who saw this from up closeincluding jafithwere shaken to their cores nawth did not die from the fall but he was so crippled that the clan chieftains had decided he would have to be abandoned freketes could not be killed for some sacred reason that rialus could not fathom but neither could injured ones be kept alive their bones do not heal apparently nawth would never be anything more than broken better he be dead then by auldek logic incredible and there was more the things he heard stoked the fires of rebellion inside him the auldek could make no sense of the tactics mena had employed but he could he saw the results of the things he had told mena in all of it she had cut the amulet off nawths neck because he had told her she should right of course yes she had avoided fighting the auldek because he had told her about their impenetrable body armor and she had sent volleys of arrows into the slave flanks because he had said they would be vulnerable it all seemed so obvious to him his culpability swam in his head making him dizzy i did this he thought i helped this rialus leagueman devoths voice snatched him up from his paroxysms of selfcongratulation he had quite forgotten himself and was stunned to find all the chieftains gazing at him come to my side devoth said when rialus managed to reach him after stumbling over stools and having to squeeze among bodies that stubbornly did not move to let him pass devoth said where have you been exactly the question rialus had feared his shortlived euphoria evaporated replaced by the dread he had become so used to iive been trying to understand you and all of us why do they not fight us rialus feeling his pulse quicken rialus picked up the stylus on the table before him as if he had just remembered something he needed to make a note of tell me you know them why will they not fight us as they should are they cowards have we come across the roof of the world to fight cowards no youve come across to die rialus thought he said yes they are cowards look no fffurther than that theyre cowards devoth did not seem to have heard its like they are wolves and we the prey they attack our weak points the lame the young they avoid the strong i did not expect this dont compare them to wolves herith said the wrathic are not cowards perhaps the acacians are not either sabeer said she spoke to herith but her eyes were on rialus he looked down and stayed that way as the conversation circled around the idea of acacian cowardice some time later sabeer remained the only one who saw something other than cowardice in the events of the day the princess did not avoid howlk and nawth she said you cannot say she is a coward exactly rialus said he regretted it the moment the word was out of his mouth she had just said something so obviously true the affirmation slipped out of him the other chieftains fell silent devoth turned and looked directly at rialus no she showed bravery in that at least how did she know to cut loose the amulet she knew more than that sabeer said she knew our strengths and avoided them she did not strike at usat the auldekor engage the mounted warriors arrows may be cowardly but they felled thousands of divine children she hurt us more than we hurt her clever in a way having not taken his eyes off rialus devoth pressed rialus how did she know these things rialus kept his head bent his attention on the page he did not want to speak words bubbled in him too ferociously he did not want to let them out and yet he did not even shrug he did not motion with his fingers or purse his lips or give any answer to devoth at all he knew he should but he did not he wrote how did she know how did she know stop scribbling how did she stop scribbling and answer me i have no answer to give rialus snapped he slashed the stylus across the words he had written and tossed it down he looked around at the auldek faces staring at him what do you want me to say that i snuck out of camp in the night ran across the ice to them told them all your secrets ran back across the ice and crept into my quarters unseen would you believe that even know im a spy if you were wise you would kill me kill me now before i bring your entire race to ruin rialus finished shouting his face flushed red and his hands trembled the auldek around the table stared at him with mild revulsion as if he had just demonstrated his insanity in some depraved manner devoth asked quietly is that true yes thats exactly what i did rialus said his voice dropped to match devoths and lost its edge but he looked at the chieftain as he said it i met a lioness on the way and i broke her neck the room was silent for a moment the chieftains stared the officers and assistants behind them craned forward broke her neck devoth asked with my bare hands a grin tugged at one corner of devoths lips and then won over the other as well all right rialus leagueman all right he slapped rialus on the back and shared his sudden humor with the others he is a lion killer he said our rialus who would have thought it lioness killer sabeer corrected the others guffawed enjoying yet another joke at rialus leaguemans expense rialus sat looking at the scribbled words on the parchment before him hating them b y the time he left the meeting well into the night he knew of the other significant development in the war the night after the battle mena and the acacian army had packed up their camp and departed that was why there had been no continuation of the battle the next day mena had the tail end of her forces into the ice slabs before outriders on woolly rhinos could reach them this was another thing the chieftains debated at length whether it was cowardice on menas part or some design they could not fathom there seemed only one course of action to pursue the acacians ran toward the auldeks goal anyway so why not chase them out onto the mein plateau then on toward the heart of acacia t he next morning the jarring sensation of his station grinding into motion awoke rialus whips cracked like ice serpents brutal punishing sounds met by bellows of protest from the beasts flakes of dust rained down on him from the beams above the engines of the station gurgled and groaned all the familiar sounds and sensations they were in motion again were going home he said out loud knowing that fingel would be sitting on her mat engaged in some small work already were going home it proved to be a difficult homecoming the clear weather of the recent days ran away pursued by a blizzard of snow and ice crystals rialus stayed huddled in his station as much as he could though he was secure inside rialus could not escape nawths anguished jabbering at being left behind how could his voice travel so far grate on the ears with such intensity nawths entreaties were so close to language he sounded like he was fumbling with speech to make a case for himself it was made worse by the cacophony of cries and moans and bellows of the other freketes swooping in the air above and his circling brothers they heard him they left him anyway rialus could not be certain but he thought that even days later the wind brought snatches of nawths ongoing misery to him across miles of ice haunting he would never forget the sound allek brought him news of the troubles they were having rialus could not have said why but the numrek youth seemed to like spending time with him belittling him teasing him allek could not do so to anybody else so rialus served the purpose the weather was a frozen chaos you would get blown by the wind he said to himself the cats would chase you as you bounced and screamed even without the storms the ice fields would have been harder to navigate than anything they had faced so far the enormous slabs of sea ice thrust up at chaotic angles dropped off into crevices they could not see the bottom of ice that looked thick shattered beneath the slightest touch animals slipped on the slopes and fell wedged down below they broke legs or bit each other or kicked their human handlersto death in several cases the stations that had rolled over so much now could barely progress at all the ground was too irregular its not even ground at all it had none of the natural shape of mountains or hills or river channels one of the stations was damaged beyond repair when the ice under one side collapsed canting it sideways in a manner that broke its spine and sent pitch sloshing about aflame inside it and came the time an entire stationone of the dining halls that fed the divine children in efficient shiftsfell through the ice and disappeared into a cauldron of glassblue water everyone in or on the station went into the water people and animals near it slipped screaming on the tilted slabs nearly everyone involved died the divine children who managed to claw back to the surface and get pulled out were as pale as death by the time they did so one auldek was inside the station of him nothing was heard another had been on a kwedeir just beside it mount and rider went into the water neither came up allek had not been there but you would think he had been by the glassyeyed way he described the auldeks plunge he imagined him stoic in the moment of realization still instead of thrashing looking up with stern acceptance of his fate as his ironboned weight plunged him downward more likely he was screaming like a girl and jabbering water words as he died again and again rialus thought if that had been one of the chieftains stations or the temple of records i cant even imagine it the acacians did it allek said rialus looked up he noticed that fingel did as well what he asked we think so the ice was weakened in places lines cut in it some of the pitch they stole from us sabeer said they cut lines in the ice with it made weak sections allek scratched his neck and then looked askance at rialus your people are wicked wonderfully so rialus thought he glanced at fingel who dropped her eyes back to the stitch work in her hands chapter fiftyone kelis had not dreamed so vividly in years he had not slept so long either so deeply unlike other people he had always been fully aware when he was dreaming he knew the difference between the functioning of the waking world and the fluid shifting of dream logic he knew even while asleep that in the waking world he was a miserable man with an iron club of a hand an unwitting traitor who had led enemies to the very heart of his nation because of thisand because of the depths of the fatigue that had plunged him back into the dream worldhe let himself swim from vision to vision out of time that was why he felt no fear standing on a leviathans back as it pushed through a furious ocean he felt no strangeness in the fact that he was not himself that he was a woman instead he knew that what separated man from woman was a thin membrane permeable in ways peoples waking minds were afraid of but he was not when the beast dove and the waters rushed up over her he did not flinch she did not claw for the surface or for the light of day she stayed standing as if her feet were cemented to the creature they plunged into the black depths luminous shapes swirled around her in the water far away first they came closer and closer until she and the diving whale became the center of a vortex of glowing giants sliding around one another as fast and numerous as anchovies schooling it was beautiful so was the sight of a sun setting from a sky like none he had seen before purple hued and hung with floating objects each of which looked like a childs ball but which was he knew a world of its own he lived through things fantastical and mundane taking both extremes in with the same equanimity he walked and loved and lived as himself as men other than himself as women as a version of a child who was he but different than anyone he ever had been for a time he forgot human shape and ran on four legs and experienced the world through scents that exploded in his mind like bursts of color many of the things he saw he forgot he did remember that ride on the leviathans back he knew even while experiencing it that it would stay with him there was another thing he would not forget either for he knew it to have been the purpose of his dreaming a vision of something that was not yet but could be might be having found it he had no choice but to awake he opened his eyes he lay on his back the ceiling above him white plaster cut into long rectangles by wooden beams he stared at them long enough to see the movement of the air against old spiderwebs to note the cracks in the dry wood there were shapes there in the grain elongated faces and eyes contained in knots he was in a guest room of the palace he knew for he had stayed in such a room before whatever had happened while he slept could not be avoided much longer it waited for him just outside the door down the corridor he did not want to move he did not even want to sit up for he knew that doing so would mean moving his malformed limb but he had to he would rise and dress and walk from here to face what he had to face he wanted his punishment just as much as he wanted to know the fate of the people important to him only there was the shame of his mangled hand he did not look at it but he felt the weight of it there beside him pressing upon the sheets he imagined cutting the limb off above the wrist then he would be rid of it he would be one armed crippled forever but he was that already at least he would not have to carry the foulness of the santoth curse for everyone to see if there was a knife in the room he would do it now right here if it killed him no matter that would be for the best he heard a noise it was just a small sound of a foot pressing against the floor but hearing it he realized somebody was in the room with him he turned his head aliver stood leaning against the wall near the door staring at nothing at all lost in thought just the sight of him made keliss pulse quicken he wants to be here when i wake to tell me to my face he would tell him that none of the kind things he had said back in the room with the queen and the man with the stone eyes and the charlatan and the children had been true not the things he said about kelis at least those had been lies for the others benefit kelis began to close his eyes knowing it would not help but wanting his dreams back again do you remember my laryx hunt aliver asked the second the words faded kelis doubted that he had heard them perhaps he was still asleep the prince turned to him do you kelis remember it ive been thinking about it as you slept i realized that id never spoken to you about it not truly i mean we celebrated together i accepted the rewards thrown at me i danced you did as well we both danced didnt we younger then and beautiful you were at least i was too pale to be a handsome talayan he smiled and pushed off the wall he walked forward a bit turned on his heel stopped and then as if the thought just occurred to him he squatted in the center of the room and bounced on the balls of his feet he looked to be preparing for a run building energy in his bunched leg muscles he tented his fingers together and touched them to his nose and then thaddeus appeared and my life changed i thought the laryx hunt marked the change but that was because by then i thought myself a talayan i wanted nothing more than the approval of talayan men and the love of talayan women thaddeus changed all that i never made the time to speak to you about what happened when i could have later i didnt and then nothing went as i planned i want to speak of it now though if youll let me kelis did not know what to make of his energy his revelry his tone nothing he remained silent aliver seemed to expect that he spoke for the both of them he led kelis through what he remembered of the hunt the two of them were in the wild for three weeks before they found the nest of a lone laryx only young males ever were alone those that had left their family group but not found a mate yet as kelis stood watch aliver fouled the nest he spat on it and pulled it apart peed and defecated on it he left his scent all over the area when kelis saw the beast returning they both moved away a distance to watch by the cackling yelps it responded with it felt the insults keenly the creature snarled and yipped it was ugly as all laryx are misshapenly thick in the chest stout necked with small powerful hind legs it ran in circles snout down on the ground and then up in the air tracking already aliver came in close a few times and twice pricked it with arrows neither was enough to truly injure it its hide was too thick for arrows it got its mouth around the shafts and yanked them out no damage done but the second one riled it enough to charge just as aliver had wished as he ran before it kelis dropped away to the side his part in the hunt was over or it was supposed to be aliver said you were to let me run the thing down alone but you didnt no kelis thought i didnt and im glad i didnt instead of leaving aliver to his fate kelis ran behind the hunted and hunter following them both across the plains keeping them at the edge of his capacity to track just barely in view during the day he watched the dust kicked up by the laryxs paws at night kelis kept track of them by their movement beneath the moonlight one day into the next and then on and over again three days in motion aliver kept the beast on his scent kept it running let it see or smell him when its attention wavered as it grew fatigued for that was what the run was about to make the beast so tired it would collapse exhausted and receive the spear that would kill it without protest i almost did it right aliver said almost yes but with a laryx almost is not good enough kelis hid in an outcropping of stones when the laryx first gave up its pursuit and lay down panting in the shade of a lone acacia tree kelis watched thinking no not yet as aliver circled back on the beast no dont approach from behind it make it rise and chase you more a laryx was never fully exhausted the first time it gave up it had more in it and was dangerous still he knew these things and he knew that aliver should too thats why he held his tongue and stayed hidden aliver glanced at kelis and then went back to contemplating the images sheltered beneath the spread of his fingers but i was too tired i let it cloud my judgment and i let the beast trick me you know what happened when i approached to sink my spear in it thinking it had fallen asleep the thing opened its eyes and laughed at me it ran at me and came close to ripping me apart right there i was just lucky to avoid that first charge i ran for the tree jumped into it i dropped my spear you remember that dont you i dropped my spear to cling to the branches of a tree almost too small to support me it had been as aliver described kelis remembered everything he had seen it with his own eyes of course from a different viewpoint he saw it with fear beating in his heart more afraid of the prospect of alivers death than his own if he had wished to he could have admitted that when he ran at the laryx it was not just to distract the beast it was in the full willingness to offer it his flesh instead of the princes the fact that the beast turned toward him without fully charging was just a stroke of good fortune it was the moment aliver needed to come back to himself he had dropped to the earth grasped his spear and sunk it into the beasts side the laryx spun with all the force of its massive frame lifting aliver into the air and tossing him away this time though aliver kept a grip on his spear and it ripped out of the beasts hide with a spray of blood he still had it ready when the laryx lunged at him this time he sank it in the monsters shoulder he stood holding it steady the laryxs mouth bristling with a carnivores teeth lips and nose twitching it even pawed the earth pushing forward and driving aliver back but not enough the wound in its side was too deep the hole in its shoulder had severed an artery and cut through enough tendons to weaken it the laryx died there so close to alivers face that he had only to lean forward to touch his nose to its snout the kill was yours kelis said his first words since he had awoken but it would not have been mine without you kelis fixed his lips in a sour expression not sure how to deny that let me tell a few more things first you should know that i didnt forget what you did i didnt fail to understand that youd saved me i think now that i look back on it that i felt a failure as if the kill wasnt really mine i think thats why i agreed to fight maeander mein im not saying i knew that it was because of the hunt i didnt but how often do we do things without knowing our own reasons i wanted to make sure i was worthy of all the things given to meand being asked of me foolish yes it got me killed kelis started to protest but aliver stopped him but here i am again alive again i would be a fool twice over not to learn from it so heres what i think i think that the laryx was my kill he let this sit a moment and then said but i needed your help to make it you watched over me when i needed it you put your life in danger to save mine thats what got me out of that tree so fast i didnt want your death on my hands see what we have here we succeeded because we care for each other and risked our lives for each other it should never have been about doing it alone when i fought maeander i forgot that i will never do so again i have you to thank for that and i have you to thank for bringing shen to me dont make that face kelis did not know what face he was making but he must have frowned dont i know what you are thinking and i dont want to hear a single word of it dont tell me anything about your responsibility for bringing the santoth to acacia dont act like thats your fault its bigger than you kelis so dont be so vain you think the santoth wouldnt have found a way here without you they are a sickness that attached itself to something pureto you and to shen and to all the labors you and others went through to bring her to me that is notand never can or will beyour fault so dont be the person who wallows in selfpity that way its not you and i couldnt bear it such a waste i need you to march to war with me not to be sitting here feeling sorry for yourself to war kelis rasped lifting his metalflesh hand i cannot be a warrior for you not with this aliver stepped nearer his voice dropped tone softened you have a choice this thinghe placed his hand over keliss metal onehas become part of your destiny it doesnt end it it changes it perhaps this is a gift how can you know it may be a gift to urge you to return to your destiny do you remember the boy you told me you were the dreamer you were born with that in your heart you told me that in dreams you read the future and that you spoke languages you could not speak when awake and that this gave you joy so return to it dont bemoan the loss of a spear arm what is that compared to the gifts of a dreamer i have already had a dream kelis heard himself say while i slept here do you remember it some things are they things you could tell me kelis had to think about that for a while he knew his answer but what he had to be slow with was the feeling of hope that rose with it could he really be blessed could it really be thatafter all the things that had come before and after all the ways his life was and wasnt what he thought it should behe would still be permitted to return to where he began to be a dreamer and find in the sleeping world things that could help the ones he loved in the waking one he said i dreamed that the queen rode a sea beast into the depths it gave her no fear aliver it was what she wished aliver sat down on the stool and set a hand on his arm the two men sat in silence for a long time kelis began to fear that he had given the prince ill tidings he should explain more of the dream he thought but that was filled with images that might further seem ill if if the queen is near i could tell her shes not aliver said is that all did you dream anything else yes then tell it to me i dreamed that you had seven children did i aliver said he smiled sadly i dont believe that will happen you had seven children other than shen i could not see their faces you walked with them away from me i could not see your face either but it was you and there were seven children with you ill have to think about that aliver said and then putting it aside and lifting his voice into a kingly register kelis of umae will you march to war with me i dont need you as a warrior not this time not ever again come with me as a dreamer if you like or just come as my friend speak to me as you used to puzzle through that dream of seven children with me will you do thatbe a friend to me a brother kelis closed his eyes he wanted to nod he wanted to say nothing would mean more to me but he still doubted he could be that blessed part of him feared that reaching for a future would be just the thing to pull it away from him he wanted to good aliver said not waiting for his response we leave tomorrow chapter fiftytwo chafing from the sabotage and accidents the auldek halted forward progress for a time work crews hewed a thoroughfare through the slabs the crews labored nonstop through the short day and long night lit by pitch lanterns that glowed in the howling white dark they cut and sawed and melted the ice creating one wide track smooth and safe enough for the entire army the animals and the slaves to walk on it took several days and during the first few the scav managed to set traps in the ice or pick off lone laborers and scouts when menteus nemre and the sublime motion took up protecting the workers things progressed more steadily a full week after the opening battle the bulk of the auldek force slipped through the cleared passage rialus watched his own station begin the journey standing on the ice beside sabeer one gusty overcast day the blizzard had cleared but it seemed even colder for it rialus could not keep from shivering he had woken several times from nightmares of being trapped within his room as his station broke through the ice and water rushed in a torrent on top of him he had no wish to see this dream realized during the day menteus nemre stood a little distance away legs set wide arms crossed surveying the progress as if he were a king and not a slave he wore no hood the wind tugged at his long knotted mane of white hair making him look every bit the leonine merging of man and beast that so perfectly embodied his totem oh look at that sabeer said you beauty youve caught another one thinking she meant menteus himself in some way rialus did not notice at first that a real snow lioness trotted toward him she skimmed along the thoroughfare at the edge of the enormous wagon and station wheels oblivious to the rotating danger of them she carried a corpse in her jaws held high to keep it from tripping her behind her more feline shapes ran to keep up the cat went directly to menteus she dropped the body at his feet and circled away as he bent to inspect it the other lions joined her milling around looking expectantly at the warrior without going any nearer rialus knew the corpse was a scav it was clothed just like the other one bloodstained just like the other one menteus took only a moment he stood pressed one of his booted feet against the corpses side and kicked it toward the waiting animals he coughed some command to them and they pounced on the corpse they tore into it clawing at it growling and snapping at one another rialus looked away trembling still more my poor chilly boy sabeer said moving in close to blow a plume of warm air in his face she had not been so near him in days she slipped her hands inside his hood and rubbed his cheeks rialus silver tongue what happened to your skin frostbite frostbite i thought you only stayed in your bed with your slave rialus had explained to her several times before that they did not have carnal relations he did not go down that road again still itit happened sabeer peered at him a moment and then touched his cheek with her fingertip he jerked back youre a foolish man rialus you must take better care of yourself if you dont well have to feed you to the cats they would like that considering that you killed one of their number she smiled and steered him with an arm over his shoulder come lets go before they seek vengeance on you their walk was short they stopped at a station that was lined up to enter the ice field rialus had seen it before but had never had reason to visit it or inquire about it just one station out of many a bit smaller than most its only distinguishing features were the conical gold cap at its pinnacle and the geometry of glass panes that sectioned its roof and sides sabeer entered rialus followed for a moment rialus did not know why the inside of the place seemed odd when they reached the top of the winding staircase and came into a dim dank room his breath clouding the air in front of him he realized the station was unheated unlit except by the dull light that came through the glass panes sabeer did nothing about the cold but she did strike up a spark to get a lamp burning when she had a flame she covered it and lengthened it the room came into highlight and shadow row upon row of shelves lined the walls around them tall bookcases crammed with the spines of numerous volumes or with drawers or doors that folded open the shelves climbed all the way to the high ceiling of the station making it one great library with ladders and narrow walkways scaffolding each level do you know whats housed here sabeer asked no my heart my peoples history this collection includes our most sacred records she set the lamp down on the table and walked along a shelf perusing the spines individual clans have some of their own collections but these are the volumes that we hold in trust together remember that i told you we cant remember the distant past this is where we come to be reminded of it i come at least others cant be bothered they even let it go unheated since our stores of pitch were depleted i argued that this should be kept warm but i lost they all know how important these records are but were preoccupied with other things as you know this damp cannot be good for the parchment dont you think tossing her long hair out she looked over her shoulder at him the lamplight accented the auburn tones of it and caught in her eyes in an alluring manner sometimes sabeer was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen sometimes he forgot that she was a different race than he sometimes he wanted her with a hunger made more violent for the ways in which she played with him she knew as much smiling she said rialus silver tongue you say things without even speaking i hear you though i hear you at her side he looked through the volumes she found most interesting some of them were truly ancient enough so that rialus gingerly turned the brittle pages he read accounts of battles lost to memory preserved only here in ink on parchment in some ways it was no different from looking at old acacian records except that he knew the individuals named in these longpast events howlk was on the page and jafith with her famed attack on the wrathic stronghold in rath batatt and devoth presiding over the terms of the numreks exile he read of events in sabeers life that she knew only from the images and thoughts the words returned to her she guided him to passages that mentioned her shivering and laughing that now she was cold she had them take off their coats she pulled her stool behind his scooted up close behind him and draped the coats over them like blankets her inner thighs wrapped snug around him leaning forward to point at things on pages her breasts pressed against his back not all the records are our own though some of them rialus were written by the lothan aklun the most ancient ones they gave them to us but would not translate them at least they did not offer and we did not ask she pulled another volume nearer opened it and ran her finger over the script perhaps we once could read what they said we might not have known then that we would forget i cant say because i have forgotten but rialus part of our history is in these lothan aklun volumes perhaps important things we cant read them but you can read their writing cant you they were from your nation i think would you translate them for us me rialus peered more closely at the pages she had opened to the letters were looping and antiquated formal in a way that acacian no longer was but it was acacian he could read it who better than you sabeer slid one of her hands across rialuss thigh he was aroused already but the touch of her fingers sent his blood surging you know things about us that no other acacian does the writing is too complicated for the divine children to translate it doesnt seem right for them to read things about us that we cant read ourselves you understand how that could be undesirable and if you find anything in there that speaks unfavorably about me youll correct it hmmm it would mean a lot to us if you did thisif you became our chronicler it would make you an important man rialus once we have conquered your lands this will make you a rich man a man all auldek will have to respect also it will mean a lot to me rialus tried to stand again with her free hand she turned his face toward hers she covered his mouth with a kiss her lips were softer than he would have imagined they were unbelievably lush they were a world and her tongue when she slid it through his teeth was too much for him to bear she pulled away tell me youll be our chronicler rialus tell me and you wont regret it t hat night he deserted the auldek army for the second time he realized he could as he lay still as death on his bed he knew what he needed to do in order to face mena again considering the placement of his station near the back of the encampment there might not be another night as favorable as this one he could not get the taste of sabeer out of his mouth i can still taste her stop it stop thinking of her she is a bitch who would kill you in a heartbeat he couldnt stop thinking of her though and he hated that he wanted more of her he would never be able to defy her to her face he would never be her equal so he fled when he gauged the hour late enough he climbed out from under his covers and carefully slipped into his many layers he tried not to wake fingel but it would not matter if he did she would say nothing do nothing care not at all about his activities when he opened his door and felt the rush of frigid air on his face he glanced back at her cot her back was turned to him as it always had been the night was dark moonless the wind came and went in savage gusts as he climbed down to the ground between the gusts were long quiet lulls it was frigidly cold despite the temperature rialus kept his hood thrown back he wanted all his senses and he had them every touch of his feet on the ground crunched absurdly loud it was real earth frozen just as completely as the ice had been he kept stopping thinking the entire camp must have heard him in the silence he heard motion was it the sound of steps or just the play of the wind on the frozen earth it doesnt matter he thought just go fool crouched low he ran through the shadows of several stations he looped away from where he knew the rhinos were penned and soon after he was at the far edge of the encampment the end farthest away from the acacians and least guarded he stopped and looked back no movement the stations squatted on the ice steaming an antok bellowed something groaned on the far side of the camp he stood long enough that he imagined he could hear nawths laments floating across from the ice that got him moving again he had made it away from the camp and down into a dip that ran south he shuffled fast now his hood up perhaps that was why he did not hear the lioness approach he just saw her she crept down the slope in front of him with a feline grace that stopped rialus in his tracks the cat froze she crouched she moved forward low to the ground and then froze again rialus closed his eyes the thought came to him almost coolly kill me fast you bitch when he heard the sound of movement behind him his eyes snapped open another cat he turned a heavily furred person rushed toward him the person raised an arm rialus ducked the person collided with him throwing something over him at the same time rialus saw what happened from his back sprawled on the ground the objectno bigger than a childs ballbounced once on the ground it ignited as it sailed up toward the crouched cat the lioness leaped to one side but not fast enough the ball exploded in a wide spray of liquid flame the cat ran writhing and screaming away a living torch for a few moments more at least the person grabbed him by the arm and hauled him up he could not see the persons face hidden behind a visor with a hood pulled snug around it but he recognized the voice lets go fingel said she tugged him into motion fast chapter fiftythree melio sat on the bench squashed between clytus and kartholome with geena just on the pilots other side the bench was too short for all four of them but it was where a wolf of a man dragging around two hounds had deposited them after the strange events of the clan gathering unwashed bruised scratched smeared with dried blood around their wrists and ankles with staring eyes and faces limp with perplexity they looked like children rammed together by a callous tutor being punished for a game that had gotten violently out of control i dont understand anything kartholome said he had found a comb somewhere he dragged it through his beard causing it to frizz in a manner that he would not have liked at all if hed had a mirror to see it the others grunted not a damn thing and then indicating the curving metal slivers that a passing man wore as earrings kartholome asked how do you think id look with some of those i feel less myself with only a single hook in this lobe has healed up you know he caressed the earlobe from which the bone earring had been ripped back when the league ship tried to run them down near the outer isles nobody answered him is that really dariel melio asked watching the prince from a distance of course it is geena said as ever melio could not fathom where she got her certainty the man they watched in heated discussion with a tight circle of strangely tattooed and accoutred foreigners spoke fluently in a guttural language that sounded like numrek his face was spotted like a running cats from the talayan plains and he seemed to have some sort of mark embossed on his forehead he was one of them at home amid the strangeness of them had melio no known the man was darielif he had not heard his voice and met his eyeshe would have had no clue to his identity and that barely helped for that same man had harangued a chamber filled with the weirdestlooking people melio had ever seen dariel had then been stabbed in the abdomen a killing slice if ever there was one instead of dying he had shouted out ripped off his shirt and displayed himself bloody and yet unscathed how could that person be prince dariel akaran if that was him what had happened to him was he still somehow the man melio had been sent to find how do you know melio whispered his chest geena said hes got dariels physique and his backside whatever this second smaller meeting was it ended abruptly all the seated participants rose and bowed to one another the man who might be dariel spoke a few last words with a woman whose black hair jutted up from her head in featherlike plumes as she turned away dariel seemed to remember the waiting acacians he cast about until he spotted them then rushed over embracing them one by one he probed their faces as they did the same to his up close it was obvious that he was the prince the open lips of his smile revealed the spacing of his teeth a trait melio never knew he would recognize as dariels and yet there it was and there was the distinctive ridge of bone high on his nose the prince named each of them reverently as if their names held sacred power melio clytus geena by the giver what are you doing here how are you here i cant imagine it tell me tell me for some reason the others deferred to melio to answer we came to find you he said to rescue you corinn sent me and clytus and geena and kartholome dariel grinned as he absorbed that he said kartholomes name a few times memorizing it and then he backed a step away taking them all in well you found me rescued me not so much would i be boasting if i said i rescued you thinking about the short brutal captivity they had suffered at the hands of the gray tusked peoplebeatings interrogations in broken acacian threats of their pending horrific deathsmelio said not at all i think really that we came quite close to having a hard time of it geena barked a laugh which set the others off as well serious again a moment later dariel said oh theres so much i want to ask you and so much i want to tell you i dont know where to start also everything is happening here now i can see that clytus said youve no idea what youve dropped into i may have to ask you to go to war with me a just fight clytus asked yes absolutely dariel glanced over his shoulder a woman with facial markings like his own stood waiting for him looking uneasy i have to go now one of my friends here is hurt i must see her well talk tonight all of us i want to know you too kartholome well talk each others ears off as soon as we get a moment ill leave you with birke to wash up and rest he indicated the wolffaced youth he is a good friend to me hell be one to you very soon a half step away he paused melio would you come with me we could speak a little as we walk melio joined him they walked quickly part of a small group that cut across courtyards passing from inside to out and back again down a mazelike series of corridors that occasionally offered views over a stunning cityscape as on acacia a contingent of guards shadowed dariel not marah but a motley deadly serious crew armed with a hodgepodge assortment of weapons judging by the sidelong glances they fixed on him they did not yet trust melio to be so near dariel what is going on here how are my sisters dariel asked tell me the last news you had of them melios attempts at this got him virtually nowhere so much had happened since dariel had left the known world with sire neen that each thing he mentioned was predicated on explaining something else that in turn affected something else that he needed to loop away from enough so that he was soon unsure he was doing anything other than tying them both in troubling knots stopping at the door into which the others entered dariel took his arm but they lived when you left they both lived yes and melio cut himself off he could not tell dariel what corinn had said about aliver it might not have been true it would be cruel to say it now in the midst of whatever was happening here the prince motioned to someone just inside the door that he would only be a moment more and what i cant say it now later when we can truly talk reluctantly dariel nodded he stepped inside melio followed him the entrance opened onto a large living room filled with silent people on a wide couch set against the far wall lay a woman propped on her back blankets pulled snug across her chest her shoulder bulged with bandages what the injury was melio could not tell but that it was grave was obvious the womans skin was a light blue her eyes were large in their sockets her cheeks sunken the woman with the running cat spots had already reached her she clung to one of the womans hands speaking close to her kissing her face with a passion and sadness that made melio feel he should look away dariel exhaled a long breath oh skylene just a whisper he did not go to her until sometime later when the spotted woman lifted her head and pointed him out the blue woman found him and bent her lips up into a weak but sincere smile on that invitation dariel went forward he kneeled by the spotted woman at the side of the bed and took one of skylenes hands he touched her forehead with his own and they spoke close too quietly for melio to hear watching them melio realized he had forgotten all about doubting this mans identity he was dariel akaran somehow he had found a new family in ushen brae a new conflict that he was at the center of he had a sense of purpose that positively glowed as if a flame burned inside him melio did not yet understand what was going on here but it felt perfectly right that he had come mena would want him here she would want him fighting beside dariel shoulder to shoulder with the same guards that for the moment looked at him with suspicion im with him mena i found him now ill just fight this war with himwhatever that entailsand then ill bring him home t hat night while mor and tam went to another meeting of the clan leaders the others talked well into the dead hours there was so much to tell it proved impossible to convey any of it in perfect order instead they made a stew together with dariel and his friends anira and birke and tunnel on one side of the pot and the new arrivals ringed around the other they all tossed in what they could about the situation in the known world as they knew it about their voyages across the gray slopes about dariels betrayal by sire neen the extermination of the lothan aklun the bloodbath that was the princes first meeting with the auldek the confusion in this city avina it went on and on when melio thought the time was right he offered the tale hed heard of alivers resurrection and of corinns confirmation to him that it was true he just told it plainly worrying that he was stirring hope for something that sounded too fantastic to be true dariel sat with it in silence for a long time then looked up is she so powerful as that melio had mentioned the defeat of the numrek in teh already now he described how it was accomplished after he had the others sat through another long silence dariel eventually shook his head not even a year away and one sisters the most powerful sorcerer since tinhadin the other is facing the worst invasion in history and my brother hes defeated death and youthe rhuin fa tunnel said strange family you have later visions of the one dariel called the sky watcher na gamen led melio into sleep against his will he followed the slim man around his mountaintop aerie he could not help thinking of him with avian features some blending of him and the injured woman skylene perhaps his version of na gamen showed him the way to sleep walking explaining to him the unimaginable things that dariel had just tried to explain w hen melio woke it was to birds as well yellow finches flew through the room in a rush his eyes fluttered open as they skimmed the ceiling above him darting away down one of the corridors its funny he thought in avina i can never tell whether im inside or out the birds cant either geena lay on the mat beside him her sleeping warmth curled toward him he sat up around him the others slumbered where they had passed out on mats and wrapped in light blankets all of them near the fire pit carved out of the stone floor the warmth of it had somehow radiated through the stones themselves fighting back the mild chill of the night dariel sat with his knees pulled up to his chest watching him its okay dariel said when melio reflectively scooted away from geena i know how she is she already told me you did nothing to dishonor my sister i never would melio said i want nothing more than to get back to her alive we have a child to make dariel she promised me i want to hold her to it i hope you do in any event im no one to judge dariel poked the coals in the fire atop which a kettle hung from a thin delicately constructed framework i dont suppose you caught all of what we argued about at the meeting none of it melio said he rose stiffly and moved closer one of the hounds pressed against dariels hip sniffed in his direction the other simply stretched the lot of you spoke auldek well lets just say ill have some explaining to do when i get back he tossed his poking stick into the fire youll know what i mean soon enough melio already had some idea he had noticed the way dariel and anira tended to stay near each other how she spoke to him in touches on the wrist and back when you get back when will that be i get the feeling you dont plan to leave until youve finished what youve started here he let his eyes drift around the sleeping forms i like these people already birke tunnel what kind of name is tunnel dariel smiled he poured a viscous liquid from a carafe into two glasses he offered one of the glasses to melio who took it squinting warily at what looked as near as he could tell like frogs eggs the teas not ready but try this its good just try it he did so himself turning the glass in his fingers melio said youre at the center of something here i know that already im surprised you didnt go to the clan leaders meeting last night i havent figured out your role here yet nor have i entirely im no clan leader though mor is the leader of the free people its for her to speak with her peers not me im something different one of the sleepers stirred birke rolled over and then settled again on his back in a manner that moved his steady breathing toward a snore melio leaned forward and said i have to ask can we take you home now i mean theres a league clipper that ive been thinking about that all night dariel said the things you all told me it goes around and around in my mind like mad but no matter how much i want to go home i cant im already committed here i allowed this he ran a finger over the symbol emblazoned on his forehead melio almost did the same wondering at the texture of it i wanted this its part of me now and the thing is melio all of thisall of these peopletheyre part of our story already if i can i have to close the circle what circle dariel frowned as if he did not like hearing his own expression spoken back to him do you know that when i sleep i have dreams in which i speak to people all around ushen brae individual conversations with individual people and yet somehow i speak with thousands each night the number is only increasing and sometimes i feel a part of myselfor of na gamenspeaking with them even as i move through the world even right now this very moment dariel stared at the rim of his glass his eyes were still but melio saw hidden motion in them as if the surface of his brown irises hid other eyes beneath them ones that moved in response to things that were not in front of the dariel sitting here with a glass in his hands i cant go home until im done he said thats all there is to it i cant go home unless im done one thing depends on the other all right melio said i had to ask corinn wouldhe was going to say skin him alive but considering what hed seen at teh the expression lost its humorbe displeased with me if i didnt tam and several of the others strode through one of the open doors dariel looked up nodded at them well he said we wouldnt want that would we he pushed upright with the unfolding of his legs and walked to meet them a short time later the entire party awake and sipping hot tea listened to the news tam had gathered it was more than the dark tattoos under his eyes that made him look tired mor was with the clan leaders all night she has gone to skylene now but she asked me to report to you dariel so that you know whats being proposed the clans are agreed they will sign binding declarations of unity they wish for some autonomy so that those who want to can retain clan identity but they all agree to be grouped collectively as the people they agree to have both clan councils for their own affairs and to send representatives to sit on a council that oversees the people they will even respect a separate body the council of elders as another voice in decision making dividing up the holdings of ushen brae will be complicated but they have agreed in principle to abide the boundaries weve proposed theyve put this in writing thats a lot of agreement melio thought theyve accepted everything weve worked for anira said pitching it somewhere between a question and exclamation not exactly tam said but damn close tunnel took hold of one of his tusks and yanked on it a strange gesture but one that seemed to express mirth i told you all the rhuin fa would make it so tam looked away from him apparently not wanting his official facade to crumble yet they found dariel very convincing but it sounded like many of them always had this in their hearts they just let the wrong voices rule them dariel helped give them courage not everyone agreed but those who fought it saw their own people turn against them dukish has been stripped of his clan leadership the anets did that themselves because he carried a weapon into the gathering and used it birke added scowling by the gathering codes the clan could be exiled for that the anets voted new leaders for themselves and are begging for mercy they say dukish deceived them and that they will see to his punishment the other clan leaders want to know what we wish them to do should the entire anet clan be exiled or do we accept that they kill dukish for his crimes or would you have him as a slave dariel they could wound him wound him so that he would be a good boy tunnel said the auldek had ways of doing that to the troublesome ones they knew it we know it dariel had his response ready i dont believe we should punish the anet we must get beyond that and quickly if we canand they canit will be for the better the anet and antoks should cede all they grabbed back to the people and they should swear that their allegiance is to the free people they should help us fight the league dukish should be imprisoned for now until the conflict is over and we can decide in time what should become of him this way would be better for as all no revenge just justice thats what i think tam shifted melio was not sure how to read the movement until he grinned thats exactly what mor said when i told her she wasnt sure youd agree though there are other developments tam continued dukish had sent word to sire lethel about dariel they know that dariel is here clytus asked that hes your rune fan rhuin fa tam said dukish wanted to capture him and serve him up to the league it would have been the gift that cemented their partnership ah geena said with a smirk if they hadnt wanted to do you all in before they certainly will now looking disgusted clytus emptied his tea on the coals the damned league we shouldnt have stopped with blowing up the platforms should have done it right the first time should have squeezed every last one of their pointed heads he scowled his way around the gathered faces lingering on melio and the others who had come across on the slipfin he seemed to see what he wanted to in them he said all right what do we have to do to finish this lets get it done yeah kartholome said lets get it done one night and you are willing to fight with us tunnel asked i didnt think we were as charming as that geena strolled over squeezed the mans bulging grayhued bicep and then hung from it melio felt a twinge of jealousy dont think of it that way one night and youre willing to help us finish our business with the league thats how i see it a good deal for us this is a muscle do you all see this thing if you mean it dariel said looking from geena to clytus to melio you fill me with joy you see i thought a lot about how to proceed last night i think i have it but i do need my brigands to aid me you have us clytus said then we have a fighting chance dariel said first lets send the good leagueman a message in dukishs name chapter fiftyfour aliver and barad walked side by side on the cobblestone streets that led from the palace down through the various tiers of the city the prince had asked barad to accompany him to see off the transport that was to depart that morning taking kelis and the last of the soldiers on acacia to alecia aliver himself would climb aboard his dragon there at the docks he would lift up and fly away from the island of his birth and from the children he had just parted with nothing had ever been harder in his life but it had to be and he had to speak a little with this man before parting he had two questions he wished to ask this would be the only occasion he had left to do so walking beside the tall stoneeyed man aliver beheld acacia for what he knew would be the last time he would never see this view again never look down at the terraced levels dropping away beneath him never again watch the bustle of ships in the great harbor or see that man stepping out of his house or those faces peering from a window or those workmen pausing on that rooftop to watch him pass so much of life was now made of buts and nevers and cannots and other words that denied despite them aliver was not morbid to every failure he could think of there was a rebuttal to each thing he had not done in his life he could respond yes but think of all i have seen so much who is to say i deserve any more to the time he would not have to spend with those he loved he could say but if i hadnt had the time i did with them i would never know how special those moments were to thoughts that it was unfair his life would be cut short again he could reply but ive had two lives two chances who else has ever been as fortunate as that he faced his all too few remaining days with a tranquility he had never mastered when the future stretched before him he would not have predicted that how much of his life could he have predicted very little he could not have anticipated that upon learning he had a daughter he would have only one day of life with her nor that in that short span he would grow to love the girl it amazed him how much he loved her how much he felt that he knew her perhaps it was because his mother aleera was behind the girls eyes and that his father lived in the corners of her lips only hours together but within them was all the lifetime of parenthood he would ever have he could be bitter but doing so would be unjust to what he had just learned he would not die completely his death was not his death not when his daughter lived on the prince wore a tunic of black chain mail over a sleeveless vest and long flowing trousers the morning was chilly but he wanted to display the tuvey band that rested snug above his bicep it did not matter that the enemy was far away he dressed for the crowds that had gathered to watch him pass it was early but the people knew he was to depart this day many called to him bestowing blessings and the givers speed on him others offered to join the army an old man said he could not fight but he had once been a blacksmith he could mend armor sharpen weapons and the like a boy piped up saying he could cook and tend a fire and carry water im strong aliver smiled his thanks to them and declined telling them he would remember their offers always he explained that they had gathered a great host already on the mainland and more were pouring in even yet stay here he said and keep the island secure and proud do that for me many asked for news of the queen aliver had nothing new to offer them she has flown to destroy the santoth she will she is your queen and she swore to defeat them in your name the words sounded grandiose to his ears too simple a way to put a complex thing too buoyed by optimism he could not be entirely swayed by he still projected the words with the grinning confidence he needed to and each time he was amazed at the effect people believed him or they seemed to at least both were gifts heand theyneeded barad aliver said once they had pulled away a bit and could talk i love these people i know they know it as well which is whats truly important it almost softens me on the whole question of the monarchy he smiled almost if all monarchs were like you if it were written into the laws that all monarchs must be just like aliver akaran in all important matters but theyre not all like you and such a law would not stand longer than it takes to wean a young tyrant from the breast after you win this warand after corinn defeats the santothyou two will have to find a way to guide the nation into a different future i dont say it will be easy or that you must change everything overnight but you must put in place a system that lets people decide their own fates you will do that wont you oh corinn and i wont do that aliver thought well be dead the peoples fate for better and worse will be in their own hands he resisted the urge to confess to barad to unburden himself and ask him to conceive of the fight going on without him and of the world after without him he pressed it down beneath a clearing of his throat it would not help anything telling anyone would be an indulgence that might do more harm than good though he could not have said whom he was beseeching he thought just let me live long enough to finish this please out loud he said i wish we had more time to speak of such things to plan when the wars are over will you help our young monarchs into that future barad did not seem to notice the peculiar wording in any way i can i will good aliver said then there is hope does this mean youve forgiven us i never needed to forgive you queen corinn enslaved us both for her forgiveness is a long road im yet only standing on the edge of it the prince nodded his acceptance of this i will admit that i do care about your family more than i imagined i could barad said i still believe that no one family should rule the world and i will not forget the things corinn did to me and to the nation but i cannot feel the anger i wish to he paused as a child rushed up to aliver offering him a wristband woven from dyed leather aliver kneeled and let the girl slip it on watching barad said i cant imagine the people fighting a war without you before i would have said that these adoring people are deluded by the vintage your sister gave them thats only part of it though beneath that they see something in you they need you right now without you i dont know what would unite us enough to fight the auldek we could be scattered and running hiding and thinking only of ourselves instead all the people of the world seem content to put aside their differences until this war is over they walked for a time surrounded by wellwishers once through them aliver asked the first of his two questions so barad visionary that you arehow do i defeat this enemy im not a warrior you know better than i what your family has done in the past barad made a fist and smashed it with force but humor also into his other palm you crush them dont you you kill enough of them so that they have no heart to fight on you destroy their wealth their happiness their capacity to threaten you you control where they live how they live and you take their resources so that they have to come to you for the very things necessary for their survival you make a myth that explains the rightness of your victory and the wrongness that made the defeated into the defeated he inhaled a few breaths as if the catalog he had just spoken winded him all these things your acacia has done and yet none of it made you safe the meins came out of defeat a stronger enemy than before you conquered them the santoth roar back upon us all now when we were not even thinking of them the auldek come against us because of what are they an old or new enemy they have been devouring our children for generations now they want more i know the way things have been aliver said i ask you to speak of a way things could be barad looked up as they passed through the gate into the lower town watching the gentle sway of flags above it aliver did the same tell me this is the world too small for the people that live in it no aliver said is there too little water and air wood and food and animals stones to build with and ore to make tools with is there not enough in the whole of the known world i meannot just as measured in any one place of course there is enough will any of us live forever no need any of us fear death aliver let his eyes drift over the faces of the people they passed young and old men and women a child clinging to his mothers leg a crone with one eye closed as if she were winking at him no he said none of us need fear death if all that is as you say war makes no sense i never said it did then dont make war i must no make something different from war dont allow your enemies to be enemies make them something else because otherwise they have a power over you that they should not have if you think in the same ways as the past you will only get new versions of the past think differently thats what im saying exactly aliver thought it was what he had already decided he needed to do it helped to hear barads deep voice expressing the same conclusion think differently thats what im learning to do again now that he was free inside himself his visions of what the world could and should be spoke to him with growing urgency he had been thinking differently when he and corinn spoke of the souls trapped in the auldek bodies and when they composed the documents he had in a sealed box already safe in kohls saddlebag he had been thinking differently earlier that day when he met with delivegu aliver sent him on the task unlike any that corinn had assigned him the first and last mission aliver would ever set him on a little later they stood on the dock at which the transport was moored kelis and naamen were waiting on the boat kelis waved from the deck but did not descend to intrude upon them despite the bustling crowds and the din of patriotic songs and the incredible sight of the three dragons perched each on their own cleared section of pier theyand othersknew that the two men were conversing privately aliver stood with a hand resting on a pylon he and barad watched the rippling green water below them the barnacleencrusted pier fading into the depths below their feet crabs worked at the their precise harvest one large claw and one small coordinated what will you do now aliver asked is that for me to say instead of answering aliver found a new question barad do you remember that i spoke to you when you were still in the mines of kidnaban the mans stone eyes managed to convey surprise of course hearing your voice changed my life aliver you gave me purpose before i had the words to speak against tyranny i borrowed yours and learned to speak by juggling them on my tongue the queen almost took that away from me under her spell i came to doubt that i had ever heard your voice i came to doubt many things and i had forgotten it myself aliver said but i have it all back now i reached out to you because i knew you were the peoples conscience i needed you then it was good to know that you were there in the mines among the people saying all the brilliant rebellious things youve always said i still need you but after whats been done to you i have no right to ask anything of you go if you have a mind to do and say what you will all across the world a group of soldiers strode by they bowed their heads to aliver as they passed barad watched them until they began to climb the gangplank to the transport i dont know where i would go or what i would say i have my tongue back but i am tired aliver i dont have it in me to harangue the masses anymore not after the speeches i made for your sister if i were younger i would go with you id listen to you speak i have a different idea aliver said nervous now as he approached the second question he wanted to ask barad if you want to serve the nation without having to shout above masses or wield a sword how about having a smaller group of pupils you could stay here with aaden and shen barad pulled his head back studying aliver as if he needed to adjust his angle to see him clearly aliver educate them speak your mind and tell them every wise thing you know explain to them the world as you understand it so that they can be rulers with their eyes openand with their hearts and their consciences at the centers of their beings always or help them learn to be something other than rulers if it comes to that do you mean this barad said after a moment teach them to think differently help them make a better future for themselves and acacia shouldnt you do this yourself with all my heart i want that but i am dead and cannot do it if i had the time i would love to but i may not have that time if i dont will you do it i have already written a testament giving you complete power over their education and what of the mothers of these children what would they think of their children being educated by a commoner a mine worker a rabblerousing rebel a man of they both approved corinn did before she left benabe you can ask yourself mena i will tell with my own lips and dariel he may not be of this world anymore he would approve of this though you see nobody will stop what you begin the mans gaze drifted from aliver it seemed to lose itself somewhere in the middle distance of the green depths at their feet corinn approved he asked but aliver knew it was not so much a question as a statement one he needed to test out loud to believe his eyes ground back to the princes i would not lie to them not about anything if i teach i will teach them that there is a better way than that of monarch and subject i never believed in that system aliver i still dont i know aliver said i know what you think about such things much of it we are of one mind about barad shook his head he spoke with an almost angry edge to his voice almost as if he had not heard aliver you cannot ask this of me and then tie my tongue i would swallow it first if i am their tutor i will dive with them into the royal records i will show them what your line has done and how there will be no secrets if we find horrors i will hold their hands and face those horrors with them but i will not lie to them i know do not tell me that they are only children war happens to children slavery happens to children the ravages of corruption happen to i know better than most that children deserve the truth of the world explained as they can handle it and reexamined as they grow i would do the same with them myself i swear i would but our history is not all horrors its still being written if you show them what we have done make sure to show them the things that will make them proud let them have that as well and be kind to them i know you will but there is nothing harder for a monarch than to be asked to give back what he thought was his this new world that you and i want so much if it comes it will not be easy for them i had thought once that i would oversee changes myself now i see my work was not about me it was about helping set the stage for them i havent done it all that well but im still trying here please take this for me keep it safe he pulled a chain from around his neck and held it for barad to take a key dangled from it keep it for the children for mena when the time comes to offer it to them youll know it barad closed his large hand over the chain his expression deepened it grew lined and grave even though his stone eyes remained still at the center of it you you are not coming back aliver there is a pall around you since the coronation its been on you and the queen both i thought it was just sadness but its its the pall of war aliver said he forced his smile to look genuine i may as well be cautious thats all i may as well leave the children in the hands of a tutor like you that way i know they will not face the future blind you will do it the instant he had the mans affirmation aliver bid him farewell he could look not a moment longer into barads stone eyes aliver turned away as if his mind had moved on it hadnt though moments later though he was aboard the transport talking with kelis shaking hands and patting backs and speaking to the crowd he fought to contain the emotion of the arrangement he had just made and then back on the pier he took to the saddle on kohls back and looked across at ilabo on tij and at dram on thais a little farther away outfitted for war they looked like characters of living myth the dragons wore plates of armor kept in place by a snug lacework of cords they went laden with packs and supplies with swords and crossbows strapped into place the riders wore chain mail tunics like aliver as a final touch they pulled snug helmets fashioned to replicate the heads of the mounts they rode aliver tugged on a black helm that flared behind his ears in imitation of kohls crest feathers they all rose into the air at the same moment propelled upward on the cheers of the onlookers kohl roared and tij answered thais corkscrewed just above the heads of the crowd a move that spurred them to even greater applause for a few moments aliver forgot the weight of responsibility and loss on him the scene was too glorious not to fill him with pride surging into the air above a beauty of an island climbing up the terraced levels of the city everywhere people waving and shouting for them over the palace itself he saw shen and aaden at the balcony of the upper terraces rhrenna just behind them he swooped past them with kohl tilted to one side so that aliver hung toward them in the saddle one arm outstretched as if he were touching them over the distance for the first time in his second life prince aliver akaran went to war chapter fiftyfive breaking camp after the first battle had been a terrible task for menas army they worked through the night taking no rest laboring in clothes and armor still smeared with gore they tended the injured as they went piling themthe living the dying and the deadon sledges that they dragged toward the broken mangle of shore ice the scav had scouted and improved a halfsubmerged route that proved much more efficient than climbing up and down over the slabs and crevices trusting them with a completeness that would have been unimaginable a fortnight earlier the acacians followed their lead they did not stop until they were all out on the frozen ground once more even then the scav did not rest they went back into the labyrinth of ice to destroy the route and to set their traps it was fortunate that they did watching from a distance as that auldek station plunged into the water filled mena with exhilaration if only they could have dropped all of them into the depths let the water and ice cover them and forget about them if only they would vanish like the phantoms of a nightmare they would not of course do any such thing they rolled and marched hauled and flew ever onward they ate each passing mile and bayed to do battle the whole time mena refused to meet them again on the field the acacians backed across the glacierscoured contours of the landscape defensive cautious devious all of it clearly drove the auldek crazy for a time they flew into the acacian camp on freketes ignoring the rain of arrows that always greeted them speaking accented acacian they hurled insults they implored the acacians to fight like true soldiers threatened that they were only making their nations fate worse by their cowardice the freketes leaped about crushing people with their feet and snatching others up in their fists they bit chunks of flesh out of them and spat the meat on the ground one auldek leaped from his mounts back and went running through the camp hacking down anyone he could if others had followed his example the slaughter would have been horrible fortunately the rampaging auldek caught a crossbow bolt in the face he went down clawing at it he rose a moment later his face bloodsplattered he tugged at the arrow as his body jerked and convulsed unable to pull the bolt free he managed to climb atop his frekete and took to the air again after that such attacks grew less frequent heartening perhaps except that not even a bolt right through the skull managed to kill these fiends that was why mena pressed her bizarre form of warfare in every way and shape she could imagine adjusting it daily as the circumstances changed she once flew a mad gauntlet over the auldek camp dodging and dipping cutting at sharp angles to avoid the freketes pursuing her behind her she trailed a falling snow of sorts hundreds of short letters on small bits of paper blowing out of the pack bags she had flipped open each note contained a personal entreaty to the quota slaves to desert the auldek and come over to their own people each of them signed with the writers name written in their native tongue with the invitation to bring the note across to the acacians and be personally welcomed home as far as she could tell the freketes did not often fly at night she knew they could because one had done so on the night of the scavs first fiery attack but they had never again dropped out of the dark something mena had feared instead she owned the dark skies herself on a night of low cloud she flew in through the mist over their encampment she circled several times testing on edge for the beat of any wing other than elyas nothing an hour later she returned with perrin dangling from elyas claws they both dropped to the ground well inside the auldek encampment by the time elya swooped back in to retrieve them they had slit the throats of five sleeping watchmen and had tossed a sack full of poisoned meat out to steam on the frozen ground food for lions she hoped nor was there anyone in the air to answer her an hour later when she dropped a flaming kettle filled with pitch into one of the pens that held the antoks she watched the large backs of the creatures from above the tiny glimmer of the wick falling with the pot when it hit the ground the pitch must have splashed out underneath their legs it ignited in one large sheet beneath them she stayed above long enough to verify the deadly furnace of kicking bellowing creatures that she had created one of them crashed through the pen wall and in the next instant the creatures were rampaging through the camp all sizzling hair and flesh confusion damage it must be taking a toll on them mena despised it there was no honor in an assassins tactics in making war on animals and supplies a strange thing to a call a war really this running skirmish through the arctic it was nothing mena had trained for or read about or studied not a style of fighting she had ever imagined fighting was not even the right word for it but she did not know what else to call something so deadly so desperately important when she doubted her tactics she had only to think of the lives of her soldiers to remember why she did these things she had as many reasons for each treachery as she had souls in her army for them she would do anything ten days since that first battle hundreds of lives lost the ranks of the injured and incapacitated growing mena could not claim that they were winning but they were not losing either since not losing was about as positive a situation as she could envision she kept her people focused on the small victories they were accumulating each slave warrior they killed any animal they lamed every carriage or station they crippled all the delays and inconveniences they created small victories on the rare occasions when they killed an auldek jubilation howlk had died the frekete nawth had been taken out of the war things that had seemed impossible could be accomplished if they could keep doing what they were doing if aliver and his army ever arrived f or the second time mena found herself standing inside a ring of her officers interrogating a bedraggled stammering nearly frozen rialus neptos this time however he brought a companion the woman stood beside rialus unflinching under the mens scrutiny she wore a full body suit of some sort so thick it would have hidden her completely except that in the relative warmth of the tent she had pulled off her hood and stripped back the top of it she stood with her shoulders and arms exposed her chest covered by a thin tunic that showed both the sweat around her neck and the outline of her breasts meinish if ever a woman was gray eyed delicately featured with hair so blond it seemed to light the room with its own luminescence she searched the collected faces with her eyes touching on mena briefly before moving on her gaze caught on haleeven who are you mena asked rialus had been trying to say something but he jerked to a halt her he asked yes but i asked her not you shshe doesnt speak much acacian maybe none i dont know i never meinish then haleeven speak to her he did and she answered readily enough her voice calm and deliberate after a few exchanges haleeven said she wishes to join us she was a slave to the auldek she says but only a slave never willingly your enemy she was like rialus trapped by the auldek rialus ceased trembling his head turned slowly to the woman and he stared at her he could not have looked more perplexed she said that edell asked she did whats her name haleeven asked her fingel she has served rialus neptos since he arrived in avina all the way to here well have to ask her a thing or two about him then edell said fixing rialus with a dry hostile gaze the two meins talked a little longer haleeven screwed up his mouth at something she said it looked like a grimace but as he held the expression it showed itself as a smile she claims that rialus is a good man she has reason to think wed doubt it he told her as much himself rambled on often even talked in his sleep sometimes rialus actually could look more perplexed after all his face reddened and it was not from the warmth in the tent i really look forward to talking with her at length edell said mena could see that there was something more behind her facade what else she has more to say i think fingel fixed her eyes on mena for the first extended time she listened to haleevens translation and deliberated her answer by pressing it between her thin lips for a moment when she answered rialus obviously understanding her meinish sat down on a campstool he stared at her with an expression of complete mystification she represents a contingent of domestic slaves haleeven said a few hundred of them who want to desert the auldek she is a scout to find out if they would be received kindly shes asking for refuge among us theyll be coming tonight she wants to make sure that they are not attacked when they approach she wants us not to attack a few hundred figures walking into our camp in the middle of the night mena asked that could be a very foolish thing for us to do haleeven translated fingel dug around inside her body suit for a moment and brought her hand out with a note pinched in her fingers she offered it to haleeven and then spoke at length haleeven listened a long time before offering his translation she says she found this one of the notes you dropped among them shes not the only one who hid them and began hoping they were true she says they will fight any way they can those who can will put poison in their masters kettles theyll take a few souls out of them you asked for them to trust you in these notes she asks that you trust her now as she returns it to you the meinish chieftain handed mena the note she rolled it over in her fingers she let it look like she had to weigh the hazards carefully but really she was hiding a swell of euphoria this was what she wanted this was the beginning of it if some came now more would follow soon haleeven tell her she is very welcome among us they all are well accept every one of them home when we have a moment of peace to do so well drop to our knees and ask forgiveness of them i mean that literally wont she and rialus be missed today perrin asked the other slaves will cover for them today say rialus is sick keep the door to his room closed they wont be found out today and tonight they flee only a couple of hundred edell asked haleeven had the explanation for this already too they kept the conspiracy very tight they could have gotten more but it was too risky any warriors with them fingel must have understood the question she guffawed and answered straightaway no haleeven translated those ones will not come over they are too far up the auldeks asses but she says they will all suffer from the lack of wellcooked food laundered clothes he smiled i think shes right a couple of hundred may not be much perrin said but its a start it will put the idea in others heads lets hope its the trickle that starts the flood mena said for a time the conversation turned to the practical matters of aiding the deserters gandrel suggested setting up a distraction like the explosions the scav created on the first night that neptos came across a good idea mena thought but not easy to arrange the auldek were more vigilant about patrolling their camp at nightor their lions were the pitch was guarded particularly well the small amount the scav had stolen was all but used up mena had a single flame bomb left and had not decided how best to use it fingel once she knew what they were discussing explained that they had arranged for such a distraction themselves one of the men who tended the woolly rhinoceroses was going to let them loose after feeding them a concoction that would put fire in their bowels the creatures would purge themselves in great gouts of excrement it would be messy and they would be angry hard to gain control of while they rampaged the others would make their escape the officers sat in silence for a moment all of them likely imagining that scene there was never a war like this one gandrel said or if there was they didnt write it all down in the official records maybe we shouldnt either edell said looking at rialus mena edged her tone and asked this is what you thought would buy your pardon a few hundred cook slaves and bed servants i thought you understood that i expected more from you rialus the man blinked rapidly he really did look confused rialus it took him a while but eventually he managed to say ii brought other information tell it then mena said crossing her arms to wait through the long delay of his stammer end of book three chapter fiftysix the hunting lodge of calfa ven had once perched on a stone buttress high above the thick woodland of the kings preserve the nest of the mountain condor as the translation of its senivalian name went had catered to acacian nobility for more than two hundred years standing on its balconies with wild valleys stretching out beneath her had been the closest corinn had come to experiencing flight before her dragons brought it to her for real it was a place of memories of long horseback rides of pastoral opulence rich meals served by rustic staff of cordials sipped beside crackling fires of walks with her father and even images of her mother in health a place of sunrises and sunsets and the everchanging play of the light on the crowns of trees and over the granite outcroppings that jutted up like islands amid waves of foliage it had been here that corinn had bested hanish at archery thinking she hated him at the same time she was falling in love with him now having just climbed off pos back along with the ghost of hanish beside her she could not even recognize the field in which they had loosed their arrows the lodge itself had been obliterated smashed and scoured clean from its granite foundation nothing remained of it save the bases of the timbers that had secured the building to the stone the outbuildings stables and storehouse all jumbled piles of lumber broken and strewn about the woodland in the valley had been scorched trees snapped others uprooted splintered some of the largest trees twisted at bizarre angles as if they had rendered temporarily molten great gashes festered in the earth smoking reeking of death it was like this as far as the eye could see an enormous scar with the former site of the lodge at its center po cried out in frustration as he flew over the valley in all that expanse no other living thing moved nothing for him to hunt he fled from place to place chased by evil vapors in the air uneasy he wanted to leave but corinn did not respond to the wish in all of it she recognized the same accursed song that had set worms eating through her flesh in all of it santoth rage had she any tears left within her she would have cried she took the scene in dryeyed she had called this devastation upon the place what right did she have to cry over it now it is changed but we knew it would be i should not have sent them here you had to send them somewhere hanish said this place was full of memories for you for us it came into your head when you needed to name a destination you could have chosen much worse places to send them corinn as he talked he walked around her trying to sift through the ashes with his feet he did not seem to notice that the toe of his boot did not really push objects about he left no footprints touched nothing in the world except for her you dont know all of it corinn thought to him no i dont but still lets not talk about this he straightened and took in the desolation of the valley again what we should be asking is where are the santoth now thats clear enough they dont exactly walk lightly on the ground theyre out there they wont stop searching corinn gestured with her chin indicating the wide world around them theyve gone in different directions no doubt some are heading back toward acacia we soared so high on the way here perhaps we flew over some of them this is like the rage they experienced when tinhadin exiled them they may yet kill many people thats why were going to stop them call po back we should a womans voice reached them queen corinn isis that you they both spun around searching for the speaker she was so still that corinns eyes passed over her only to snap back a moment later a woman stood with something gripped to her chest half hidden behind the rubble of a collapsed wall she stepped out from behind it it is you isnt it corinn touched a hand to her cowl which still hid the lower portion of her face realizing that was not a gesture that would serve as an answer here she nodded the woman said something over her shoulder a second woman emerged like the first she bore a bundle in her arms just after a third head peeked out she came more reluctantly as they picked their way forward through the debris corinn recognized them both the first woman wren dariels lover the second gurta rialus neptoss recent bride the third was a girl who worked in the lodge peters daughter she could not remember her name steady corinn hanish said he stepped up close one hand at her elbow one at the small of her back they are not ghosts they live and so i think do the babes they carry he was right the bundles in the womens arms were unmistakable as was the care with which they cradled them corinn felt her breath escape her she leaned more heavily into hanish you see he asked there is still life here when wren reached them she bowed her head and said your majesty gurta tried to do the same but her eyes were round circles that would not leave the queens face whats happening she asked they came here and destroyed everything they killed everyone but us we would not have survived if bralyn hadnt hidden us she knew of a cave she paused looking from the queen to wren a desperate intensity in her eyes it was horrible they i dont know what to call it they tore the world apart they stayed for days raging they were demons i know it sounds mad but look around only great evil could do this queen corinn you should not be here they may come back the place may be cursed it is cursed i can feel it isnt it cursed wren the slim woman kept her smoothly lidded eyes on corinn she did not seem to be listening to gurta at all except that when prompted she did speak queen how do you come to be here alone corinn shook her head wren misunderstood her i saw you ride in i know that thing out there is yours but are others coming hanish said show them corinn did she pulled down the cowl and tucked it under her chin all three women drew back staring aghast yes thats the horror of me they could not hear her of course or see or hear hanish unsure how to proceed corinn just stood looking into the womens faces as if into three mirrors each of which showed a different reflection wren began the conversation again those ones did this to you didnt they the same ones that came here corinn nodded oh queen im sorry they are so awful you youre chasing them arent you again the queen nodded tell me you are going to destroy them blinking her eyes closed for a moment corinn answered with a third nod good wren said i dont know how you could possibly do that but if anybody can i guess you can thats what dariel would say at the mention of her brother corinns eyes went to the bundle in the womans arms she stepped closer and pulled back the blanket to reveal a tiny childs sleeping face so small with thin tendrils of black hair and a fist a little ball of a fist clenched just beside its face this is my baby wren said your niece if you ever wish to call her so she was born early i got ill bad ill she wanted out of me shes all right though small but strong like me the woman smiled corinn almost collapsed i got ill bad ill that sentence next to that smile and beside that child was almost too much for her to stand she sensed that po felt her distress and wanted to return to her she ordered him not to do you see the things ive done hanish i tried to kill this child i tried to kill this woman and yet she smiles at me she has every reason to he said she lives her daughter does too she doesnt have a name yet ive not had time to think about it but shes my little girl gurta found her voice again i got mine out too she said i was cursing him for coming but im glad he was out and at the breast before them ones came and did all this hes got more sense than his father i can tell that already corinn reached in to see the infants face she saw only an ear and a soft lumpy curve of his head but she peered in for a long time she could smell the child a scent that was sticky with his birthing but somehow lovely all the same mostly though she listened as gurta continued her nervous rambling she sounded more like a maid now than ever the young woman had annoyed corinn before she could not imagine why anymore her voice was lovely kind and warm without guile rialus was lucky to have had you touching her back again hanish said tell her that so she can hear it find a way to talk to them corinn tell them the things you need to time is short reluctantly she drew back she rummaged around in one of her saddlebags until she found writing utensils and sheaves of parchment as the women stood awkwardly beside her she wrote two notes one she signed with her royal title and stamped with the akaran seal rolled and tied tight with a strip of ribbon that any official of high rank would recognize the other was a simpler missive when she was finished both she pressed the rolled document to wrens breast indicating that she should hide it somewhere upon her person the other she offered to them both to read she had written take this document with you to acacia its an official pass of protection from me if anyone troubles you show it to them tell them they face my wrath if they harm you take it to acacia show it at the palace and ask for my secretary rhrenna go there and be safe under akaran protection from now and for as long as we can provide it gurta forgive me for sending rialus into such danger i did not know what i was doing i pray that he gets back to you and that you live long and raise this child with love wren i have committed crimes against you i am too afraid to name them now and i dont ask you to forgive me thats too much to ask but please go to acacia with my blessing declare yourself the mother of dariels daughter if my brother makes it back to you love him wed him be a part of my family go now hide yourselves again until i leave and the sorcerers follow me when they had both clearly read the messages they stood nervous and unsure what to make of them gurta said you cant fight them by yourself your majesty dont do that fly home and get others get everyone in answer corinn picked up the quill again on the back of the missive she wrote im not alone i was before but im not anymore and need never be again hanish said l ater once the two women had departed and had time to return to their deep hiding place corinn opened the song of elenet as ever she heard the song waft up from the pages winged notes that danced on the breeze instantly intoxicating do you hear that of course i do hanish said i can understand why you like it so much corinn bent forward eyes closed breathing the song in through her nose the music caressed her face searching the mottled flesh of her sealed mouth with gentle fingers it wanted to heal her she could feel it the song itselfand whatever intelligence somehow lived in itwished to rewrite the abomination that was the santoth curse it was wonderful to sense that sentient wish but corinn knew it could not be done no matter how much of the song she could build within her head it always had to be released through spoken breath through open lips and with some resonance of the notes vibrating on her tongue even a whisper could do it as when she whispered barads eyes into stone but i cannot whisper if i could whisper for you i would hanish said i know and she knew he could not if she had years to be his tutor perhaps she could have found some way to teach him he could have been the ghost sorcerer that walked beside her unseen by any eyes but barads she would have spoken to him with her mind and the song would have danced unheard from his lips but again there was the trap she did not have those years the serpent of her dilemma ate its tail her life was a closed ring tightening each moment what a couple we might have been together corinn what a couple we are together corinn opened her eyes and looked down at the living words she let them rise up into her eyes with their own power just as they had done the very first time she looked upon them that was all she needed to do the response came quickly a bellowing from the west followed by a roar from the north and concussions of rage that passed soundless through the air from all around them the santoth sensed the touch of her eyes on the song just having it alive within her head was enough she knew they would hear it just as she knew they were each of them turning toward her drawn to it hanish said i think youve got their attention chapter fiftyseven it all went horribly wrong and it was her fault mena knew it was she should not have slept how stupid of her to think she could sleep through a night while others risked their lives at perrins urging she had left the task of receiving the incoming slave deserters to him greet them in the morning personally with all the sincerity of feeling you want he had said but get some rest first he reasoned that rialus neptos had crossed back and forth three times surely these slaveswho were cunning if fingel was anything to judge bycould manage it as well thinking this made it easier for mena to acquiesce sleep she did harder and longer than she intended and dream she did as well of being held tight by perrin he clung to her and sought to kiss her mouth she would not let him instead she placed her lips against his closed eyes she felt the feather touches of his eyelashes and there was something wonderful about the ripe curve of his eyeball that in her dream state was permitted nothing else when she woke to the flute notes that announced the predawn hour mena felt in the pit of her stomach that something had gone wrong she should not have slept so deeply she should not have dreamed the things she had melios eyes were the only ones she had kissed that wayand that was how it ever should be the fact that she had slept and dreamed prompted her to kick off her blankets and dress hurriedly perrin collided with her as she came out of her tent it was dark yet and windy he was hooded and mittened she knew him by his stature though and his shape what happened we dont know princess i mean nothing happened they didnt come we even had lookouts posted out beyond the barricade they saw nothing until just now come and see standing atop a sled with her officers just behind the barricade of wooden spikes sleds and other supplies that served as their makeshift protective wall mena peered toward the auldek camp a barren rocky expanse separated the two armies but through a spyglass she could see the enemys stations steaming in the distance something was happening over there torches lit the area in front of their camp in the crimson light mena could make out shapes moving structures being shifted construction work it seemed but even through her spyglass she could not figure out what they were building do you think the deserters were discovered perrin asked mena inhaled the night air so cold it froze the hair in her nostrils perhaps but theres something more going on a n hour later the light of dawn as it finally began to creep in fits and starts across the frozen lands contours gave her a better idea of what the structures they had built took on a familiar shape simple solid tall and long necked they reminded mena of foulthings made of stout wooden beams catapults she pulled the spyglass from her eye and offered it to perrin theyve erected catapults big ones about time gandrel said to spite the cold as he liked to put it he stood with his hood thrown back sniffing defiantly to keep his scarred nose from dripping ive found these auldek a bit slow on the uptake is what i mean if youd been on their side mena youdve finished us by now lets hope theyre not thinking that way mena took the spyglass back and lifted it but catapults edell asked he took off his gloves and tried to rub warmth into his cheeks were not exactly a fortress here what are they going to through the distorted circular clarity of the spyglass view mena saw the arm of one of the catapults lever forward abruptly it looked odd the silent jerk of motion so far away theyve shot she said the object that surged up from it seemed to come apart as it rose it broke into pieces that fanned out she lost sight of them pulled away the spyglass and watched like the others with her naked eyes what are those perrin asked mena realized the answer just before they hit the hard earth something in the way each projectile somersaulted and contorted in the air many limbed and limp as the dead for they were the dead bodies naked bodies they hit the ground about a hundred paces out smacking down with sickening thuds all that long arc of motion ended in an instant some of them split apart and sprayed red mist into the air most just landed the sounds of the impacts followed one another in a quick dull staccato the deserters were found out edell said and this is their punishment perrin asked monsters theyre monsters he whispered it first and then he shouted it as if in answer a second rain of falling forms crashed down again the staccato of thuds a scream yanked mena around fingel the woman stood a little distance away with rialus beside her she dropped to her knees pointing with one arm at the thing they had all already seen she emitted a sound from somewhere in the tormented center of her it carried a misleadingly rising tenor as if she were about to scream or moan but kept having the foundation of it pulled from under her a third catapult hurled its grisly load ten or so bodies why are they doing this perrin asked the first catapult launched again rialuss voice answered theyre sending us a message the second catapult snapped forward again what message mena answered they would rather be without servants than be betrayed by them the auldek kept it up throughout the day building scattered piles of hundreds and hundreds of broken exploded naked bodies a battlefields worth of carnage lofted through the air as a sickening gift it was as rialus said a statement not an attack t he attack came that night lookouts sounded the alarm when the auldek were still out beyond the piles of corpses riding in atop antoks menaawake this timejumped out of her cot fully clothed snatching up the kings trust hearing the alarm horns the auldek responded as well they discarded stealth they spurred the beasts forward as mena reached the barricade the antoks rushed toward them bellowing they plowed through the bodies they sent the white bears that had come to feast on the frozen meat running roaring their anger as they did so perceven shouted for archers to man the barricade perrin directed the foot soldiers into ranks bledas sprinted past his sword drawn rallying the confused and groggy mena connected with elya telling her to stay put sheltered and hidden when the attackers were just a few hundred yards out the catapults still in front of their encampment lobbed balls of flaming pitch instead of bodies the orbs hurtled upward like shooting stars bent with the earths pull and then plummeted the catapults this time had been calibrated to send their missiles farther the first one hit near enough to mena that the impact knocked her from her feet the impact area became an instant inferno fly elya mena thought hoping the bombardment at least meant the freketes had been held back get high and stay safe out loud she shouted ignore them ignore the fireballs distractions you cant run from them so forget them look at what else comes once into the crimson highlights of the fires glow the antok riders pulled up their mounts the beasts halted churning the turf with their hooves raking their heads about impatient for the living blood on the other side of the barricade the auldek clinging to them began to leap off they hit the frozen ground and came up drawing their weapons they proceeded forward leaving the mounts fuming in their arrogance mena realized the auldek wanted to do the killing themselves as far as they were concerned they did not need the monsters to do it for them they were just as tall and fierce as ever long limbed and fast they wore dark body suits that covered them entirely with hoods over their heads but no obvious armor on them none of the encumbering bulk of her own troops thick layers the auldek batted away the arrows that hit them as if they were troublesome insects even the arrows that struck them in the chest did not stick mena saw a heart shot knock an auldek back it caused a hitch in his step but did little more than that the arrow hung there until he ripped it away it had not penetrated at all it had just caught on his clothing aim for their faces mena yelled to the archers around her and then stood on her toes and passed the order over to perceven on one side and bledas on the other everyone aim for their faces another fireball exploded nearby flinging out a molten wave of pitch a man near her got splashed with the stuff one arm so drenched that it liquefied while he was still on his feet other pitch balls landed with powerful whoomps followed by the horrible splatter of flying liquid and the screams of the burning they fell everywhere igniting tents and supplies the animals worked themselves into a grunting squealing frenzy the air a moment ago ice pure and gelid filled with the stench of burning pitch flesh and hair and wood and fabric the auldek reached the acacians barricade the wall put up and taken down hastily each time they moved their camp was more a visual gesture than a true fortification a delay and a nuisance although for the auldek it was barely even that they leaped over it chopped into it shoved their way through it mena was right there in the front of her troops yelling for them to attack them as the auldek came through while they were encumbered she hacked at the arm of an auldek whose feet were caught in a crosshatch of timbers the man yowled but the arm did not get sliced through as she envisioned she struck again on his helmet shoulder slashing up in the hopes of reaching his face none of the blows bit she hacked down on his shoulder with enough force to sever it in response he buckled beneath the blow for a moment then surged upright spouting what must have been auldek curses he was throughand others were through instant chaos at a frantic level immediately different from just moments before her troops behind her surged forward they became a squirming struggling press of bodies into which the auldek cut bloody paths mena got shoved away from the auldek she had been fighting and had to watch as he waded into the soldiers next to her slashing and shouting the sound of metal striking metal shouts of agony and rage and fear guttural auldek punching its way through their acacian for a time the battle was such utter confusion that mena had no control over anything she struck at any auldek she neared but she was too hemmed in her own soldiers pushed her into the jumble of the barricade so that she struggled even to stay upright this burned away any trace of fear and left her red hot with anger seeing an opening she dove for it with the kings trust clenched in her sword hand she scrambled on all fours beneath a lattice of wooden beams along an overturned sled and then over another into the clear outside the camp now she ran along the barricade trying to work out what they should do the auldek had all passed through already which meant there were not so many of them only auldek and only a small group of them she had the sickening thought that they must have drawn lots or something to win the privilege of this slaughter think mena they had taken control of the moment but was fight and die all that she could respond with she would not accept that she found a clearer section of the barricade climbed on a wagon and got a view the auldek rampaged through the camp they did not stick to any formation but ran where they pleased swinging their massive swords and axes with a blurred rapidity that horrified her they looked like dancers working through a practiced choreography except that they were slicing off limbs and sending arcs of blood into the air with every move another sickening thought that this might be the night the war ends for her and her army had they done enough had they delayed and hurt them enough for corinn and aliver to be able to defeat them think she was just about to call elya to her when she saw perrin and another soldier fighting with an auldek the monster bore down on them stepping through the bodies he had already cut down he slashed and spun he tossed his sword from one hand to the other and slashed and spun again a game mena thought its a game to him it was not a game to perrin and the young soldier they barely managed to fend off the auldeks blows they kept trying to round the brute but the auldek herded them kept them backing perrin tripped once and only avoided getting cut in half because he rolled away then gained his feet again in the blurred moment that followed the young soldier went down mena did not see how but his body fell to the ground twisted without dignity in a way that only the dead permit the auldek celebrated by pumping his fist in the air something in the gesture shot mena through with recognition the warrior she thought to be an auldekdressed as they were of the same stature and seemingly just as deadlywas actually a numrek calrach mena could not leap down from the wagon fast enough she reached perrin at a sprint just as he managed to get off an attack he swung high calrach blocked likewise mena came around her officer holding her sword in two hands at midheight her left shoulder so near him that she touched his hip the kings trust hissed around her and landed exactly where she wanted it with the full energy of her swing she expected it to slice into the numreks side as far as his spine then she would have kicked him with her left foot as she yanked back on the blade carving it to the side as she did so to maximize the damage she would have fallen against perrin and the two of them would have danced back as calrach followed his guts in their spill to the earth she saw all this in the rapid screen of her minds eye she had seen such visions a thousand times in battle always able to shape her rage sight so that the reality of it followed not so this time the sword kicked back against her torquing her wrists so badly she nearly lost her grip damn their armor mena thought i keep forgetting it calrach stumbled back clutching his side and cursing in a guttural barrage he frowned at mena and then grimaced whatever pain the blow had caused into hiding his sharp features contorted for a moment then settled composed again calrach twinned his tongue around acacian words as if he only wanted to release them after he had strangled them ah the princess comes to this boys rescue do you hold his thing for him when he pees i think he would like that ill happily hold yours mena said before i slice it off calrachs mouth cracked open full of mirth and large even teeth none of that little girl i have too many uses for my manhood i have sons to make many sons to make when they are still but babes i will tell them how i killed princess mena akaran with a naked blade they will like the tale i know it youd be dead already if you werent dressed in that suit mena said what sort of thing is that for numrek to wear i thought you were warriors not afraid to die warriors enjoy slaughter warriors bring pain to others warriors find a war i have done this all this i will do and bring joy to myself fine please yourself calrach plucked the devils forks from his belt a short threepronged metal weapon mena knew the weapons from her practice of the third form calrach was no bethenri though and the kings trust no normal sword he stepped forward brushing back black hair as long and flowing as any meins he gestured casually that he would fight them both at once mena could feel elya in the air above her watching begging to come to her but she held her back i killed greduc you know i have heard this but dont believe it i enjoyed it he and the other numrek cried like girls i dont think so but anyway that doesnt matter you killed greduc but i am not him im calrach calrraaacccchhhhh he bellowed the name then added in a softer matteroffact voice come lets fight mena and perrin moved without speaking they circled to opposite sides of the giant calrach turned sideways to them offering a weapon to each the princess attacked first she snapped her sword out it was a quick motion intended to catch him off guard but her blade had hardly moved before he caught it with his devils forks he twisted his wrist pinching her blade between one of the tines and the main stem he made it look casual but mena could feel the strength of his forearm he released the tension a moment and slid the fork up her blade testing it even as he looked the other way and parried perrins flurry of swordplay savagely mena yanked the kings trust free she hated the touch of those metal fingers on her sword she came in again calrach called out as he blocked her and perrin as he shifted and dodged high and then low he spoke auldek sounding like he was praising them or teasing them commenting on their technique like an adult taunting a child it was infuriating but he was too fast too aware of what she or perrin was going to try next mena varied her attacks she searched for weaknesses she fought against her instincts and did things surprising even to her none of it worked save to amuse the warrior so frustrated she forgot that she and perrin were still living along with him fighting himthough it took two of thema draw a glob of pitch landed near them it broke their dance as they all jumped back its mother whoomped down a second later far enough away that they were safe from the splash the numrek stepped over the edge of the flaming puddle with a disdainful glance at it as if it were animal dung he said something gesturing with the fingers of his sword hand he seemed to be explaining that the falling pitch was not his fault mena and perrin circled keeping him between them ive killed numrek she said to herself dont forget that perrinive killed numrek this is no auldek he has only one life lets take it then perrin replied calrach did not make that easy for them im my clan leader he shouted you know what that means it means im not greduc not crannog who am i a smug bastard who needs to die mena thought and thenwhy notshe repeated the answer out loud this was all taking too long the two of them stuck here fighting one man when there were so many others i want you dead bastard it should be possible it should happen right now so thinking she swung low hoping to take out his legs at least to break them or injure them calrach jumped over her blade like a child over a rope in midair he caught perrins sword in his forks his toes touched down for a moment but he leaped again spinning and landing a kick on menas head though the force of the blow sent her reeling she watched calrach bring his sword down on the flat of perrins trapped blade with a resonant crack the tip of it twirled away released perrin sprawled backward he landed beside the puddle of burning pitch he did not rise immediately and mena feinted to draw the numreks attention it worked but it made her head swim she tried not to show it but she saw two calrachs one stepped out of the other and both of them spoke to her in auldek she heard that arrogant bouldergrinding voice doubled she watched him set two pairs of fists weapons clenched in them on his two waists two grins calrach she said she had something else to follow it but forgot it in effort not to stumble calrach behind him two versions of perrin rose calrach noticed them both of him turned and rushed toward them both of them dropped their devils forks and cocked their swords far back twohanded cal the two perrins turned both of them holding flaming swords they snapped out their blades at exactly the same time in a manner that sent two lines of pitch from the sword through the air scorching a path right into both calrachs faces they howled and in howling merged into one calrach dropped his sword and wiped at his face but that only made his hand come away flaming as well perrin stared at him horrified by what he had done his sword still on fire mena walked forward she raised her sword and thrust it with both arms and the full weight of her body the blade pierced calrachs flaming face into his skull cavity and beyond his head flew back as the point hit the back of his skull mena still dizzy clamped her gloved hand over the naked blade just in front of his face she yanked it back and forth cutting whatever was inside his skull to scrambled ribbons he toppled arms thrashing mena went with him riding his chest all the way to the ground she rolled away and lay for a moment on her back through panting breaths she said what she had started to before without knowing that she would finish it i killed greduc and i killed calrach are you hurt perrin asked as she rose he still held his broken sword smoking now and blackened he looked strangely sheepish considering the carnage they had just lived through mena shook her head regretted it flexed her jaw instead she wiped sweat from her forehead and then realized too late that she had smeared her face with blood perrin were overrun we must organize a retreat well have to get everyone to head for the stashes we left for the return everybody who can make it and all the wounded who that was as far as she got before another auldek strode into view mena recognized her immediately she groaned inside sabeer chapter fiftyeight once he drew near enough to see that something was amiss sire lethel asked what exactly is going on here dariel had never met this particular leagueman nor had he seen any leagueman in person since the massacre that sire neen had dragged him into lethel looked just as strange as any of them ever did his coneshaped head had been wrapped for this occasion with a silken red fabric his shoulders were narrow chest birdlike and arms so thin it surprised dariel they carried enough muscle to animate them the two jagged lines of his eyebrows gave him an expression of almost explosive surprise quite a contrast to the grim pucker his lips made i know things about your kind that you may not even know yourself dariel thought he had seen a vision of them up in the sky mount nearly dead diseased and insane did lethel even know that it was the lothan aklun who had first bound his head and fed him a diet of mist probably not not with surely the clarity of vision that dariel had both from what na gamen had shown him and because he actually carried some of the sky watcher within him yes he was tranquil enough that he let the heat of his resentment for the league roil up just that little bit more controlled calm satisfying lethel had arrived as scheduled for his meeting with the anet leader dukish lethel and his ishtat strolled into the openair courtyard quite at ease this time lethel approached his eyes drifting around so casually that they did not settle on dukish until he was but a few strides from him at that point he stuttered to a halt only then noticing that dukish was not simply relaxing in the chair as was his wont he had been gagged bound at the wrists and ankles and set on a stool not looking relaxed at all instead of his trusted anet and antok ruffians surrounding him mor tunnel birke anira and dariel flanked dukish judging by the way lethels eyes scanned them all he was only noticing this just now the situation in avina has changed somewhat since last you spoke with dukish mor said her voice was clipped official there was a tension in it but it was the tension of the control she was keeping over her voice dariel realized how hard this must be for them all of them had been but children when a leagueman just like this one stripped them of all they knew and changed their lives forever not more infighting and discord lethel said dukish you assured me you had a firm grasp on avina im disappointed perhaps he was he tutted at dukishs misfortune already putting any sign of surprise behind him his gaze drifted up and down mors lean figure as appraising as a wealthy customer at a brothel you are rather lovely do tell me youre the one in charge now thats an improvement i can acknowledge right away what do they call you i am mor of the free people as you were told dukish did not mor of the free people lethel exclaimed he glanced at the ishtat next him we know that name dont we the bird woman said something about mor before we shot her turning back to mor he added how is she faring by the way it looked to be a nasty wound in the chest wasnt it we would have looked after her but your lot bundled her away mor held her anger she had not introduced herself as skylenes lover but as mor of the free people she held the dignity of that in her jaw and neck when she said as you were told last time dukish did not speak for us he has been deposed stripped of authority the disunity he tried to sow in avina is a thing of the past we are here only to tell you that ushen brae is not a place for you this is the home of the free people we have earned this place and we will never be slaves again lethel tilted his head back squinting a little as he took her in oh i dont know that i would say never thats rather a long time who can say such a thing for certain glancing around lethel seemed to only then realize that a chair had not been set out for him he motioned an ishtat closer whispered something and then waited as the man stepped forward hands raised to indicate his harmlessness he moved to the side of dukish which brought him close to the stretch of tunnels bare gray chest he made a visible effort not to look instead he put his hands against dukishs shoulder and shoved him from the stool dukish landed hard on his side groaning and struggling on the paving stones dariel could not help laughing though he half hid it behind his hand the man lifted the stool and set it down for lethel to occupy now lets get past the bluster shall we is it really you im to negotiate with he said to mor if so id much rather do it back on my soul vessel id zip you right off the barrier isles we could talk there in the baths perhaps amusement gone again dariel was starting to find lethels lecherous remarks aggravating he inched forward a little bit itching to enter the conversation there is nothing to negotiate mor said theres always something to negotiate you just havent thought about it yet listen lets do this lets leave dukish in the past hes yesterday ive nothing against dealing with the free people especially ifas you sayyou really do speak for the whole lot of you here in avina how about that no mor said lethel rolled his eyes must you make this difficult life would be very much harder for you without us i mean honestly in half a year you could be running your own estates with staffs of new slaves doing all the work slavery has no future here youre still not understanding the league has no desire to enslave you well enrich you you wont be slaves nothing of the sort youll be masters he said this last sentence with a flourish and a grin that showed he believed he had won the point youre the one whos thick mor said her voice snapping inside your head at least listen ushen brae is a land of free people now we are the rightful inhabitants of avina and of ushen brae both the mainland and the barrier isles the league must leave if you dont youll end as badly as your sire neen did sire neen dont talk about neen with me he was a fool im not do you know dukish made me a gift of neens ashes thank you for that dukish i smoked them mixed with the water of my mist pipe neen was smoother than i would have imagined slightly nutty with a tar undertone that was not entirely pleasant but soft on the palate despite that i blew little particles of my uncle out into the world with each exhalation thats what i think of neen you have a month to withdraw mor said one of the ishtat behind lethel tried to get his attention but the leagueman ignored him a moon cycle you say what happens after that edging her words with something like longing mor said you will find yourself at war with us do you know how absurd this all sounds lethel looked around as if for support from another but finding none he came back to himself rightful inhabitants quite absurd i assure you mor of the free people this is going nowhere youll want to back away from talk of war right now already just out there on the barrier isles we have several thousand ishtat inspectorate soldiers two three thousand something like that a guard bent and whispered to him three thousand four hundred and ninety nine im told one unfortunate got knocked in the headsome dock accident they die much harder on the battlefield in addition to thatand this you wouldnt know anything aboutwe have four thousand more troops just recently arrived all of them trained since birth to kill when we say kill we have soul vessel transports enough to move all of them anytime we want against the tides or winds with complete control we could deposit all of them at the wall of avina at exactly the same moment if we wished consider that before you declare war he began to cross his arms as if he would give them time to think it through but then he snapped them out before the gesture was complete what makes you think you can wage war on the league nobody wages war on the league i have dariel said he stepped forward coming around tunnels bulk into better view of the leagueman lethel glanced at him and then away dismissive then back the thin line of one of his plucked eyebrows expressed his skepticism that the answer to the question was of consequence but he asked who are you weve never met dariel said but i imagine youve cursed my name many times already i plan to give you reason to do so again the eyebrows did not drop but the face beneath them sobered youre not prince dariel akaran hello lethel i know ive gone a bit native tattoos and such and this he gestured at the rune on his forehead you would need to have been there to understand im pleased to learn that you werent on sire fens warship when i dropped a pill in it or on the platforms when i blew them up or in the soul catcher when i destroyed that or on that soul vessel that i set alight down near sumerled why does that please me because youre still alive to be killed i may be afloat in ushen brae but letheldariel bent a little closer the ishtat bristled in responsei still loathe the league more now than ever for the first time lethels face went blank no readable emotion on it neither mirth nor arrogance nor anything like fear he said i could have my crossbowmen kill you right here and now you probably could dariel agreed but you wouldnt make it from here alive yourself you are outnumbered he nodded that lethel should take note of all the people who poured into the courtyard as they spoke your ishtat tried to mention it to you but you were distracted his eyes on the prince lethel spoke to mor this man is one of you mor did not hesitate yes this changes everything lethel looked away from dariel his cheek twitched and it was clearly with some effort that he kept emotion from his face this man is an enemy of the league hes a war criminal a brigand a murderer mor here are the new terms i offer you you give me dariel akaran thats it if you dont ill bring armies down upon you you have no you cant have dariel mor said hes one of us rhuin fa tunnel said it first but others echoed it both in their group and around the wider circle youve disappointed me lethel said shaking his head all of you have but so be it he stood and drew himself up chin raised he pronounced you leave me no other choice on behalf of the league i declare the inhabitants of ushen brae enemies we will settle this through clash of arms will you impede us as we depart after glancing at dariel mor said no go safely well kill you later turning lethel said you want war you have it ive never heard sweeter words from a leaguemans mouth dariel said he makes good talk sometimes tunnel said watching the group exit turning to dariel he asked now what you have a plan yes d ariel waited until he knew mor would be away for several hours she stayed amazingly busyespecially in making their preparations for the league invasionbut she came and went from her chores to check on skylene so often that he chose his moment carefully she was crazy with grief she hid it well but all who knew her saw it skylene was dying and she was taking mors heart with her when she went off to the north of the city to oversee the fortifications being built there he risked it he went to her dying lover hoping he would have enough time to accomplish what he had come to believe he could skylene lay as she had when he had first seen her on his return odd that a face already tattooed to skyblue hue could still look so sickly pale or perhaps it was stranger that dariel no longer saw anything unusual about that color or about a nose altered to resemble an avian beak or about a hairline that included living feathers that sprang right out of her scalp none of that was strange it was all skylene it was this face that had looked on him with kindness in his first days as a captive here skylene more than anybody talked him out of ignorance and into a new understanding of the world she had waked him from childhood and opened his eyes it was a much gentler maturation than the quota children received gentler than anyone bearing his family name deserved this made it all the more heart wrenching to see how drained she was of life her skin sagged into the cavities of her skull her forehead was slick with perspiration even the lids of her closed eyes looked wrong as if they were too thin and the orbs beneath them too large for the face in which they set she smelled of death not just in the festering wound in her chest the scent seeped from the pores of her skin dariel had closed the door behind him leaving himself alone with her and asked her caregivers to allow him some time in solitude with her had anyone else been in the room they would have thought dariel silent he wasnt its just that the onesided conversation he carried on with himself went on inside him can we do this he asked i feel that youre part of me but i dont know where i begin or end i dont even know why i believe i can do this thats why i think its you telling me that we can do this am i right no answer came but he had not expected it to na gamen was not an active consciousness inside him not a voice he heard or anything like that it was more like the life force that had been na gamen had been absorbed into dariel body and mind and soul to hear or understand na gamen dariel needed to listen to himself the two were one now and we always will be skylene he said and then was not sure what to say skylene i want to help you can i she stirred but only with discomfort and only for a moment she had not been awake or conscious for several days if she were awake he could have asked for her permission for what he proposed but if she were awake she would not have been as gravely ill and if she were awake she might give him an answer he did not want to hear after all she abhorred the trafficking in spirit energy that the lothan aklun had mastered what he intended was a cousin of that possible only because part of na gamen lived inside him he had more than a single persons life force inside him not much more his two knife wounds in the gut had depleted him but na gamens spirit was strong ancient it was thicker than other human souls and not so easily depleted the taking of souls was a corruption the most horrible of crimes that he believed without doubt nothing good could come of the theft of life not even the soul vessels justified it but what about giving life not taking it that was not a crime it was an offering he wanted to make na gamen wanted it too if he did not dariel would never have known such an offering was even possible skylene would not willingly accept even a sliver of lothan aklun life force into herself but im not talking about giving you any of na gamen dariel said only me you wouldnt turn that away you dont find me so repulsive i hope not at least another thought followed thisthat when mor loved skylene in the future she would be loving a little bit of him as well it made him blush he brushed it aside this was not about that it really wasnt it was about giving what he could to skylene to mor as well true enough but he was giving not taking he lay one hand on skylenes hot moist forehead he smoothed his fingers back over the plumes of the feathers that were now a part of her hair and then he set his hand back on her skin leaning close he set his lips just beside hers forgive me he thought but i wish you to live please live he kissed her with the kiss he exhaled life out of himself and into her chapter fiftynine unlike most of the auldek sabeer did not carry a long sword no battleax or halberd nothing massive or hooked or pronged she stood with empty hands the two long knives sheathed at her waist her only visible weapons slim and long limbed she wore her body suit with an upright grace that was overtly athletic when she spotted calrachs motionless body a look of astonishment transformed her sharp features into softer versions of themselves ignoring the two acacians she walked to the corpse she knelt and bent close to him saying his name and then other words in her language judging by the cadence of it a prayer mena perrin whispered casting his voice so that the auldek woman would not hear it im no coward but lets go lets help the others what a reasonable idea mena thought why cant i think of ideas like that she said perrin thank you for fighting with me that was well fought remember how we did it they may ask for you to document the form someday you go now ill deal with her leave me and dont come back dont bring others here no princess thats an order take the others and flee obey me perrin sabeer straightened rotating to face them as she did so sabeer said something her tone was casual like an old friend commenting on the weather but perrin said what about do it mena said thankful for the moments she had to clear her head she inhaled and pulled her composure around her like a shawl against the cold it was not much time but it would have to do she said its all right perrin really it is ill take care of this one no i cant go right now thats an order she had to say it several times before he obeyed ill need to reprimand him for that later she thought sabeer watched the exchange patient enough to wait with her hands resting on her hips studying her body her posture the composed intelligence of her face mena thought this is a woman i could have liked if i hadnt needed to hate her she thought good that i wrote that note to melio it will reach him that i believe it wouldnt make sense for it not to bending to one knee mena tried to wipe her blade clean on the turf it did not really work calrachs blood had frozen already etching the fine engravings in a crimsonhighlighted black she stood sabeer shook out her arms making them loose as snakes for a moment then she crossed them and unsheathed her knives she began to say something lifting one of the curved knives as if she were going to explain her choice of weapon lets leave off the banter all right mena asked im not in the mood for it she launched at her the battle that ensued was more intense than the one with calrach sabeer had two feet of sinewy muscular height on mena with reach enough that her knives struck like swords she was incredibly fast each time mena struck sabeer deflected the sword with one of her knives knocking it away or catching the blade at the hilt each time her other knife slashed back with a blurred rapidity that mena could only match by not thinking by not deliberately planning by not being awed into errors and certainly not by worrying for her life she gave her body over to rage to instinct and the fury of the blade itself the kings trust was savage in its wrath it screamed as it cut the air she did not so much direct the blade as follow it it was not a weapon meant to be deflected not meant to be caught between those two knives not meant to slip through the air missing the body that shifted away from it not meant to strike angrily into frozen ground it wanted only to cut breaking away mena circled sabeer let her rotating in unison this is a race to the cut bitch why dont you finish it or let me finish it saying this mena heard her words from another time long ago when she was just learning the sword back then to melio she said im sorry but heres my point why dance through fifty moves when a single one will suffice it had made sense then and it still did and yet she had already put more than fifty moves behind her she wiped at the sweat on her forehead she blew her nose into her gloved hand and then snapped the snot away sabeer laughed and then came in again a whirlwind with both knives cutting circles around her s ome time later the two of them balancing on bundles piled atop a line of sledges mena backed over the uneven load saying sabeer you should die now you really should die now die now she repeated those two words again and again she fixed on them and drove them into every parry or strike or thrust or dodge she tried to think only of them to keep back the other thoughts that clawed at her die now it did not work for one thing there was elya in flashes she saw the world as elya did from above circling the carnage watching mena wanting to swoop down to her begging to be allowed to for another melio kept emerging through those two words she kept seeing him in a part of her mind that was separate from the world around her she heard him with ears different from the ones filled with the din of death of explosions and screams and clanging metal where was your fear he asked he was not speaking to her now he was not even really in her head she knew that he was in her past jogging to stay with her as she left the stickfighting arena on vumu ages ago where was your fear he had asked she had answered i dont know mena leaped from the sledges sabeer just behind her she sprinted for a time and skidded to a halt they converged again i should have had a better answer for you she thought when you said where was your fear i should have responded i dont have any i dont know that i love you yet that would have been the truth much better than i dont know sabeer landed a blow to menas cheek with the knob at the base of one of her knives it was an awkward strike as the two of them slipped by each other the auldek swung her blade around mena managed to drop beneath it watching the point trace the air just next to her eye i know fear better now that was another truth when a pitch orb exploded near them mena fell flat praying that the splash would take sabeer out the auldek woman fell backward letting her upper body go horizontal the spray of pitch scorched right over her untouched she landed on her upper back she kicked up from there all back and abdominals and legs knives still in hands that had not even touched the ground standing a moment sabeer crooked a grin at mena twisting an admonishment into the expression what mena thought i already said i want you dead i dont care how it happens they continued o n the frozen ground again the two of them fought watched by a ring of other auldek mostly men they stood in a loose bloodsplattered circle taking a break from the slaughter they talked among themselves as mena and sabeer danced death at each other occasionally they tossed a jibe or encouragement or advice at sabeer mena could not tell which for her part the auldek woman stayed silent she had left her mirth behind some time ago grimly determined her face glistened with her efforts her lips puckered and frowned puckered and frowned as she struck and parried her left cheek twitched she had yanked back her hood her hair long and auburn snapped about behind her die much mena asked trying to slice the crown of her head off sabeer ducked and drove an upward thrust with no how about trying it no you die sabeer said slashing like she meant it she really does want this mena thought she wants me dead more than anything now look at her to her surprise her sword finally connected with sabeers wrist but it was not like when she had carved flesh from larkens arm so effortlessly this time nothing happened except that sabeer spun away spitting curses through her teeth mena wanted to scream at the unfairness of it if they were fighting on equal terms sabeer would be onehanded in pain squirting gouts of blood the fight would be over she would be dead and then alive again you bitch youd be alive again sabeer shook the pain out of her wrist she snapped at something one of the watching auldeks had said she threw out her arms and flung the two knives away a moment later she closed her outstretched hand around the hilt of a sword offered her she twirled it flexing the wrist that should be useless this really isnt fair mena said what is fair asked one of the watchers called devoth i dont know this word mena could not tell if he was sincere or joking the mirth was the same as sabeer stood breathing heavily mena spun around taking in her audience i killed calrach yes but this is not calrach devoth said calrach is the past here is sabeer no mena sheathed the kings trust calrach is enough for today sabeer shook her head she said something in auldek mena could not understand a word of it but the meaning was clear enough surrender was not an option she acknowledged its not for me either mena thought but not all battles happen on your terms she ran toward sabeer five quick steps she leaped the auldek woman stepped back more surprised than alarmed she cocked the sword back but for once she was not fast enough mena kicked her in the face with one foot and pushed off her chest with the other that was the last contact between them before elya caught her in midair cradling mena tight to her chest lifting on powerful wingbeats mena buried her face in elyas plumage but only for a few seconds thats all she had for such things as comfort relief she had lied calrach was not enough for today she wanted more m oments later in elyas saddle and racing over the plain toward the auldek encampment mena clenched an oil lamp full of pitch behind her she left a ruined camp the tattered remains of her army fleeing into the night as the auldek danced bloody joy behind them at least some of them would make it into the dark some of them that was all she hoped for them now that within a few days some of them would stumble into mein tahalian alive she intended to be with them but first there was this to take care of the lamps wick glowed red in the night too buffeted by the wind to actually flame she flew under the flying pitch orbs cut through just above the catapults and saw the freketes and their riders circling in the air beyond them she wanted them to see her to pursue her to witness what she was there to do dodging and weaving among them she skimmed over the auldek encampment searching for the station rialus had described when the traitor had told her about the station that held the auldeks histories she had not at first understood why he thought it such important information a library documents and tales from the past surely it had no military significance that was what he thought he could buy his forgiveness with she had sent him away angrily on the verge of ordering him back to them once more that would have been a death sentence she knew but she came close to delivering it later as she lay not sleeping in her tent she had turned over the things he had said if the auldek really did not have any memory of their distant past how important might those records be for them she could not imagine not remembering her own life back to her first years of childhood what would it mean to know that the greater portion of your existence survived only on pieces of parchment the more she thought about it the crueler it seemed to imagine destroying those documents if she did so the auldek race would be effectively always less than a century old before that would be nothing the tail that connected them to their past cut a frekete and rider appeared out of nowhere elya spun and dove to avoid him she came out of the corkscrew so low that she touched her feet to the ground and ran for a moment wings pulled tight darting between two stations and circling around one of them when a kwedeir leaped in front of her she jumped over it the beast snapped at her but she rose above it slapping it with her tail as she pulled away the innocuousness of the station surprised mena by the time she found it she realized she had passed near it on several occasions it was smaller than the rest it sat dark along a lane of similarly dark stations the sight of her and elyas reflection on the icelaced glass panes caught her attention yes thats it the gold cap at its peak just like rialus had said she looped away from it freketes behind her and came back after she had put some distance between them she hovered as long as she dared and then threw the lamp straight down with all the force and precision she could manage it twirled end over end the wick appearing and disappearing it smashed through the pane of glass for a moment the inside of the chamber was alight with a wonderful radiance mena took in the stacks of shelves the many volumes the logs and legends and journals that kept the history of an entire race it was in a way beautiful i killed greduc i killed calrach and ive killed the past the flames spread chapter sixty terribly imprudent sire nathos said as he settled into the elaborate contraption that was his council seat i cant wait to ask what you were intending this will be interesting dagon im sure of it i was thinking about saving the world from the likes of the santoth dagon thought aware that in a few moments he would no longer be safe thinking thoughts he wanted kept private and grau nathos continued why would you act without our complete agreement if you had not hatched your plot to assassinate the bitch and her brother we would not be so exposed i can recall nothing like it everything we have built is in jeopardy grau was not in a mood to be chastened he answered in a gruff whisper we did what we had to nobody could have foreseen the outcome dagon in my opinion made the best of an unfortunate situation one that you caused in part dagon thought youre lucky that some of us have had greater success in our ventures nathos said by that of course he meant himself and his vintage why he should be so proud of that now dagon was not sure but he looked smug as nathos settled back and closed his eyes a smile tickled the corners of his lips you hardly seem troubled perhaps its you who isnt taking things seriously enough sire revek called the session into order before i set you to explaining yourself sire dagon he said we should be sure the entire chamber knows just how the calamitous events in the inner sea developed and how you acted and why dagon started he knew he would need to do some explaining but he did not expect the chairman to begin with him sire he said you have all read my testimony and graus i delivered it when i arrived this morning and was told everyone would come here prepared and with respect calamitous is hardly the word to silence just a word from a frail thin frame but with it the chairman stopped him resonant echoes of it reverberated through the newly built council chamber on orlo the largest of the outer isles revek had barely more than whispered but that was all that it took to get heard in here especially when speaking from the center of the senior leaguemens circles behind his voice the chairman sent waves of his disquiet resonating through the council chamber the acoustic structure of the place was sublime the airflow circulated the mist efficiently and the sculpted seats in which they reclined seemed to enhance their capacity for subverbal communication reveks voice at least filled the entirety of dagons skull so completely that he felt himself crammed up against the bone such a chamber he had never experienced before nor had he ever found himself the focus of his brothers animus not what he expected would greet his arrival at the outer isles dagon you must acknowledge the seriousness of this matter reports testimonies these are not enough you singlehandedly ended hundreds of years of league occupation of the known world you assassinated two monarchs informed them of their pending deaths while they yet lived then abandoned league property ordered other property destroyed set the vineyards of prios aflame revek sighed in exasperation at the unending extent of it the list of things you have to answer for is staggering because of it i move that you provide us access dagons heart rate had been increasing on the word access it skipped forward into an irregular syncopated dance of its own choreography access just so you will be probed you did not see fit to consult us earlier when you made decisions that affected us all you will do so now we will judge you accordingly and with the wisdom of hindsight do any object or think this action unwarranted if any did the cowards and scoundrels leaning back in their seats kept their mouths shut had dagon been one of them instead of the individual at the center of this scrutiny he would have been just as silent probing was not without its benefits at least from the point of view of the ones doing the probing it was rarely called for but he had enjoyed the unfettered access to other unfortunate leaguemens minds on several occasions nobody would refuse looking into his secret places under the guise of an official inquiry being the one being probed however was ghastly it involved inhaling a liquid distillation of mist one that inundated your mind in a way that let your fellow leaguemen push inside it and explore your memories at will it was an ancient process one that each of them trained for in their youthboth to learn how to penetrate and how to allow penetration better the one than the other dagon had always thought what of grau he came very close to saying will he be probed as well he did not want to end the possibility of getting aid from that senior leagueman just yet though he tried to return the discussion to reason we all understand the facts already he said truly if you just let me answer each of these points ill put your minds at ease sire grau can assist me i second the chairmans proposal sire nathos intoned several others chorused their assent as well dagon craned around to see back into the dim ranks of reclined leaguemen behind him but if you just sire grau said let it be done let it be done did you say that grau let it be silence dagon sire revek whispershouted we will hear from you afterward the probe will be carried out first that is our decision you have no choice but to abide by it the litensspecial ishtat officers who normally stayed pasted to the far walls of the chamberconverged on him they appeared through the mistthick air as if they had only ever been a step away wearing goggles over their eyes and breathing apparatuses over their noses and mouths they moved with a clearheaded speed that dagon could not comprehend they pressed down on his chest pinned his arms to the armrests and wrapped cords around them so quickly dagon only realized what they were doing after they had completed the task he tried to pull free he could only strain against them he kicked but his feet too were bound he shouted but that ended quickly too a liten vised his jaw in a painful finger pinch the figure stared down at him eyes unseen behind the green glass that hid them dagon got ahold of himself he ceased struggling it was useless and just made him look ridiculous this situation was absurd but it was serious better that he acquiesce with faith in his rightness with dignity that would be the shortest course back to his proper standing of course sires dagon managed through his nearly immobilized jaw mymy mind is yours i have no fear of being a liten carefully slipped a tube into his nose dagon could not help but thrash he had thought this part amusing when it was happening to someone else interesting that so much tubing could be shoved and shoved and shoved up a persons nose where did it all go he had wondered now he knew and then the liquid flowed in brief moments he had before the liquid mist overcame him dagon thrashed around both in his chair and inside his head fighting the rush of fear he claimed not to feel he searched for thoughts that he should somehow banish but as soon as he found one that was embarrassing or questionable another popped up like a bubble beside it and then another he got nowhere there was so much to hide the innocuous just as much as the substantial he wondered how this was happening he should have arrived here a hero a man of action one of decisive b eing mindprobed by a chamber full of leaguemen dagon learned was unequal parts horrifying degrading embarrassing and enlightening how much of each depended on the moment in question each moment of the examination blurred into spiraling circles in which he could get no sense of times progression he put together a sketchy narrative for himself of how the experience had gone afterward even this was putting order to a process that had in truth been like being explored by a swarm of scheming bees early on his brothers had focused their attention on the queens council meeting that had so disturbed him the one in which aliver had appeared in the flesh they moved forward through his visit to grau in which he suggested and then argued for the monarchs assassinations an observer at his own dissection dagon knew that the memory as he reexperienced it did not match the memory as he recalled it but he could find no way to voice this his brothers watched the coronation through his eyes turned over his emotions as the monarchs caressed their present felt his fear as the santoth changed everything they looked through his eyes as he searched his library for some way to understand them and they watched him write the letter that confessed the crime he had helped perpetrate only hours before they followed him as he fled from acacia aboard a pleasure yacht in the dead of night chasing a messenger bird toward alecia the voyage surprised him in some particulars had fleeing acacia really wrung him through with as much melancholia as it seemed to no not possible he had not gotten teary at seeing the harbor lights recede in the wake of his boat he had not been overcome with sadness for the lives of all those poor fools still rafted together in shock and mourning and confusion now instead of sharing the euphoria the day had begun with apparentlyalthough he did not remember it this waya barrage of random memories had assaulted him throughout the short voyage he revisited old conversations with leodan akaran and thaddeus clegg his treacherous conflicted chancellor dagon had not liked either man so why did it seem like he wished he could have them with him in his cabin talking through the recent events while sharing a mist pipe why recall the time one of the white minks the concubines kept got loose in his quarters unnerving him as it darted about with its long tail swishing behind it what use was remembering the time he sat through some banquet with a sore tooth struggling to hide his discomfort from those around him what a strange useless thing to recall and yet there it was as vivid in its own way as some of the most crucial moments of his tenure in acacia they lingered with him through the dream he had of the time corinn arrived in his officesso young then beautiful in the newly ripened manner of youth he had thought cruelly about the work he would have liked to put her mouth to when she caught him off guard he had to retrace the halfheard words she had spoken taking a moment to comprehend the audacity of the proposal she was making she spoke her way into an empire right then and bound hanish meins hands with a few wellconceived words not her lovers pawn after all it turned out and that took him to a view of hanishs face in profile as he stared at one of the palaces golden monkeys it was an image dagon saw with such detail it might have been a painting hung on the wall before him he had hated the mans perfect features his lovers eyes and the arrogant grace with which he occupied his body but what he remembered was wondering if hanish had any suspicion that the league had often used the monkeys as thieves and messengers they were clever easily trained and seemed to take a certain amount of satisfaction from working covertly of course hanish hadnt known nobody on acacia ever had dagon would miss those monkeys realizing this made him shake his head at his own mawkishness he needed the steadying influence of his brothers irrelevant he thought and yet some of his brothers seemed fascinated by these things and by the fact that he buried all such thoughts deep when he met with his fellow leaguemen in alecia they had all been agitated both by what had happened during the coronation and by the call for evacuation that dagon arrived with he had acted recklessly there would be a reckoning about it an investigation consequences despite the grumbling they echoed dagons orders to their own staff see dagon thought they did what i suggested because there was no other choice i acted i led and why was there no mention of graus part in all this by dawn of the next day they had all fled aboard the largest vessels they could organize on short notice they sailed south bristling warning with the manned ballistae hanging from the sides of the ship in their wake they left abandoned estates and billows of black smoke rising from their offices and libraries storehouses and estates dagon rather liked the images it all left in his mind it helped sweep away the troublesome memories here was something decisive when the leaguemen abandon a place they leave scorched earth behind them nothing for others to use no apologies no regrets these portions were not so bad much of the probing vindicated him if it had ended thereand it should havehe would have had no reason to complain it did not end there though he would later wonder just which of his brothers had spent so much time on raking through his childhood like a gardener turning manure into the earth and who circled around and around his early sexual encounters what reason was there to tease out small perverse moments things at the edge of his life things inconsequential he knew the answer it could be any of them and they did it because it amused them those things were out of his hands only how he handled himself when the probe ended could matter now r egaining consciousness took much longer than dagon would have imagined he slowly came back into his body he felt the tubes as they were yanked out of his nose and then the straps on his feet and later wrists being untied someone wiped spittle from his mouth and tugged at his nose with the same cloth he heard one liten ask another if dagon had soiled himself and felt the cursory probing of his nether regions that prompted the response not from the back end at least though his consciousness returned it took some time before he could so much as open his eyes he lay there listening to his brothers discuss him the gurgling of their mist pipes sounded like laughter if they had spent time discussing the serious matters they were beyond it now sire grindus joked about the childhood infatuation he had for one of his maids sire pindar increased the mirth by mentioning that he still had the same infatuation despite the fact the woman must surely be many years a corpse if the queen knew the sort of things he had pictured her doing another said she would have his head she would have all our heads grindus admitted to a murmur of laughter that echoed around the chamber odd the workings of the mind sire nathos said ah dagon said ah odd indeed the others hushed a moment until revek said i believe he is back among us dagon we have discussed your matter at length wake and hear our verdict dagon drew out a handkerchief and dabbed at his face he ran a hand up over the long cone of his skull patting his hair into place that was all the regaining of dignity he managed before revek continued pulling his mouth away from his pipe he spoke through an exhalation of green mist vapor we find you guilty of gross misconduct no yes we do why wouldnt we we know everything that happened without a doubt you committed grave actions without the councils consent you compounded these with further actions and then you compelled your fellow leaguemen into actions they had no choice but to agree to all these things are true i suggest you close your mouth before letting any of the thoughts in your head slip out of it remember dagon that all of us in this chamber have been inside you we are still to some degree so hush that is a command for the rest of this council you will not say a word on pain of banishment stirring a cloud of mist vapor from in front of his face revek peered through it so that is the verdict he said as for punishment we are also agreed upon that you are to forfeit your rapture tithe you will keep your rank but if you ever hope to gain rapture you will need to earn a great deal in the coming years your tithe will be divided among the sires nearest to rapture themselves this cant be happening i only did what you all would have and i did not do it alone he glanced across the close circle at grau but the man had attention only for the chairman now let us discuss the future revek said i know the situation looks dire but it may not be as bad as all that we know the ill tidings well enough let us share the better news ill start he glanced around touching each of the faces of the men in the inner circles it appears sires faleen and lethel have been doing fine work in ushen brae dagon reclined numb he knew that what he thought had just happened had in fact just happened but it was too enormous a reversaland too unwarranted and cruelfor his mind to grasp the whole of it despite himself he listened to reveks report on ushen brae the nascent unification of the slaves into some collective state had been nipped instead the slaves had fractured along the very lines of their enslavement the strongest groups among them were loyal to the league to aid in the continents pacification sire el had been dispatched with his army they would ensure that the league secured its position there should ushen brae need to become their base of operations of the fate of the known world revek shrugged and said that what will be will be he did not subscribe to the sort of panic that had taken possession of dagons senses to those who likewise despair i ask one thing sire revel said just one thing and then i will fall silent while the younger among you speak he let that sit a moment as if to demonstrate that he was capable of falling silent who is to say that we wont be able to do business with the santoth when all the confusion dies down they are sorcerers like tinhadin was and we had no difficulty coming to a most agreeable arrangement with him it could be the same with the santoth better even for we now have years of experience on which to set our terms that dagon is where you erred not even a santoth victory is as calamitous as you seemed to believe the phrase too true escaped more than one leaguemans lips bu dagon began but clipped the word before he completed it all that he had done the decisive action he had taken and this was the thanks he got for it he wanted to lash out at them all he could not though he realized listening to the murmuring affirmation and enthusiasm that greeted reveks one thing that had someone else acted as he had he would himself be speaking against him he could not argue because revek was right the league had not been in the danger he feared how could it be they were the league it was as simple as that they rode atop the tides of other nations follies they did notor should notfall into their traps themselves sire nathos could not keep the enthusiasm from his voice when he said and dont forget the vintage brothers in the coming weeks the supplies of the stuff in the known world will begin to run out as our testing has shown they will grow apathetic they will lose any lust for life they will sit down and die a great many of them will at least imagine the santoth newly in charge of the world discovering that their conquered subjects cant be made to work to eat to fornicate or do anything else the same goes for the auldek should they emerge victorious and the same is true for the akarans if by some miracle they hold on to power all of them will face the same problema mass dying that they have no way to remedy he paused for effect except by reaching out to us only we control the process only we can make more of the vintage sire dagon was foolish for ordering the warehouse and distillery on prios destroyed but we can just rebuild either here or in ushen brae grau finished i rather fancy one of those lothan aklun estates on the barrier isles myself you will have one nathos said we all will its absolutely without risk of failure brothers if they balk we simply let them die if for any reason we want to prevent that we can give them the release not even the queen ever figured out that we both made the addiction and the cure for it at the same time it was the cure really that took us so long to perfect should we want to we could even give the cure to some and not to others as suits us he chuckled im sorry for showing my mirth brothers but we have been too somber up to now the situation is not so dire despite dagons attempts to make it so true enough sire grau said let us sail through this as ever when the dust settles we can make our arrangements with whoever is left both the known world and ushen brae will need to be rebuilt repopulated controlled labor will need to be managed security provided goods and services transported the powerful will need the resources only we can provide them the weak will again clamor for the illusions and trinkets only we know how to wave before their noses i think brothers that we can look to the future with just as much optimism as ever easy for you to say sire grindus said if im not mistaken youll be on your way to rapture now you and revek fate has made that so grau acknowledged such is my burden i may not see it all with you but i know the future is wonderfully bright oh dagon said he caught himself before the exhalation became a word he stretched it out staring at grau as he did so and at revek what a fool i am chapter sixtyone having so little time to live with so much to do aliver worked without resting he did not think about all the weeks he had lounged about the palace in acacia bemoaning the past would do him no good he had told corinn not to he wouldnt either later that very day he cut away from the other riders and swept down on kidnaban he caught paddel the head vintner trying to make his escape on a pleasure yacht loaded to the brim with the riches of his estate landing kohl on the boats elaborate prow aliver shouted over her shoulders and the black flare of her wings paddel i am aliver akaran i come to you with questions i will have answers you will give them now if not you will be food for my mount paddelsweating and faint as he was constantly touching his bald head and the tattooing meant to replicate hair on itproved very forthcoming that evening in alecia aliver spoke before a late session of the senate the things he said were easy for him the words there on his tongue without hesitation they were truths as he knew them he would himself lead the army of acacia north up over the methalian rim hopefully they would meet princess mena quickly but in any event they would face the auldek on the mein plateau while i live they will not come down from there he said i pledge you that he declared that the league had shown themselves to be traitorous scoundrels enemies to everyone in the empire theyve bled us all these years and sipped our blood as if it were wine you see their abandoned palaces their warehouses in ashes and their ships all gone fled to the outer isles this is all proof that theyve been found out theyve run from us and they are now our enemy just as much as the auldek are he announced to them what he had learned about the vintage the nation was addicted to the mist once again they did not even know it for it came to them in the bottles of wine on every table in the empire and it affected them so mildly that they did not know how much they depended on it they drank of it every night an enemy right there in their homes it is vile and subtle he said but we cannot save our nation without our full and true minds he ordered all wine poured out casks smashed not one more drop of it consumed friends let us drink water until this war is concluded i will do the same you may find it hard at first but i will be with each and every one of you helping you forward he told them that the santoth had finally revealed their true nature they are an evil none of us here can stand against and if they triumph all the world will be enslaved to them he said that only one person could defeat them queen corinn only my sister has sorcery to match theirs so pray for her put behind you now your hatred of her your jealousy put behind you the schemes you have had for grasping power when this war ends put it all behind you and pray to the giver that she succeeds if she does not you have no future anyway he admitted that he had a daughter but said she was not to be a pawn in the war or after it the queen and i have agreed to the order of succession should anything happen to us we want these instructions followed he produced the box a small metal container that he had carried with him on kohl i have them here in a locked box that i will leave in the care of the senate in this box are my wishes corinns wishes you need not fear them for they are just this box is not to be opened until instructions on succession are needed the key will be kept in safety you need not seek it it will appear when its needed before i leave this in your care i must have something from you your word that you will abide by our wishes all of you each and every one of you must swear to abide by our wishes i want your oath on the senate records aliver had smiled then looking around the chamber at the rapt faces staring at him i understand that i am not giving you a say in this but i am your king after saying all this and after getting each senators oath to abide by the instructions in the locked box aliver left the senators in the chamber speechless yes he spoke the truth but he did not speak all of it he had not mentioned that the league in their treachery had put numbers on his days of life if he failed on the mein plateau he would be dead before he had to see the auldek coming down from it he did not say that as the people came off the vintage they would lose the will to live and die because of it though he told them corinn fought on their behalf he did not say that she had only as many days to succeed as he did or that she no longer could use the song to aid her or that she did not intend to return from the mission at all he knew that the senators who swore to obey the succession plan would not have done so readily if they did not fear him and corinn and the coming war and while he told them he would repel the auldek he did not say that to him success was no longer the same as what it was for them victory could be something else he believed no easier to attainperhaps harder in truthbut a new way a better way kohl lifted aliver away from the city that night the silence and the sound that is wind in motion the flapping of massive wings the creak of kohls harness and armor far out to his left thais carried dram to the east ilabo rode tij the dragons called to one another every now and then their sounds were like chirrups stretched out with bass notes each call ending with an almost flutelike sweetness of tone aliver had never heard anything like it dragonsong he thought i would never have imagined such a thing as he listened to it the night passed in beauty the world below them slept beneath a starry sky farms and villages rivers and roads and dense patches of woodland love it for what it is aliver told himself love it for being my daughters world my nephews future love it for what it is and because it will go on after me many campfires glowed beneath them often in clusters his army a great migration of soldiers heading north love them for who they are for them i cannot fail this thought became the frame inside which he ordered the rest of his life inside which he planned and dreamed and worked through the things to come and how he would face every hurdle he could imagine he had already begun reaching out to people urging them off the vintage speaking to them to keep their minds clear to fill them with his love of life with purpose he would not let them die or waver not while he lived he had done this before with the santoths help and he believed he could do it again without them he had only to open his mind to offer himself to all the people of the known world to touch their minds and let them touch his as part of his consciousness took root in peoples minds the sense of connection with them built thousands upon thousands of different connections it was wonderful through it he knew every reason he had to succeed to end this war and save all the lives he could it was not the same as when the santoth aided him it was better the connection his and the peoples alone it was a communion shared even as it was intimate with each individual it was not even a strain on him rather it felt as if once the connection was established each person hosted his voice inside himself or herself keeping alive alivers words and praise and hopes for them he was still at this at sunrise when the three dragons left the eilavan woodlands and rose over the methalian rim the zigzag path up its heights thronged with his army climbing aliver flew up to the mein plateau skimming low over the great mass of troops already gathered there he let the army see him and the dragons and he rejoiced to hear the shouts that rose to greet them then he and the other dragon riders pressed on as the climbing sun crept across the land bringing color to it and it was later that day under the brief blaze of the arctic day that he saw mena and elya they were under attack chapter sixtytwo bad idea mena thought this was a bad idea she clung tight to elyas back as she rose and fell dipped and twirled and undulated with the contours of the broken icy terrain stone and snow crevice and outcropping snapped by beneath her at speeds mena had never experienced before it might have been exhilarating except that elya raced before a snarling pack of freketes all baying for her blood they were so near mena had stopped looking back but she could hear their jaws snap several times she felt one of them had clawed at elyas tail faster elya come on girl faster an hour earlier back with the ragged remains of her army rialus had pointed out devoth and his frekete mount bitten as they swooped in for another aerial attack it had seemed like the right strategic move to single him out as she had done howlk and nawth if she could kill or lame them perhaps the auldek would cease their endless pursuit for headlong pursuit is exactly what her army had faced since the auldeks nighttime attack menas battered army ran the auldek pursued they rode on their antoks and woolly rhinoceroses and kwedeir they dropped on them from the air on bellowing freketes her soldiers marched day and night racing between the food and supplies they had cached during their earlier march northward but they were not fast enough or strong enough anymore they could not pull away and the auldek had clearly decided to run them into the ground her soldiers died one by one trampled or cut down snatched into the air or impaled some simply fell and gave up the exhaustion and cold too much for them to carry on fighting even her officers died bledas got trampled by an antok perceven won himself honorand a bloody deathdefending a sled packed with the wounded a group of the divine children ran them down a man with a lions mane of white hair cut him with two strokes so fast that perceven was legless before he even began to topple and headless by the time his body hit the ground mena watched from a distance but could do nothing not even avenge him or the injured who followed him to the afterdeath just moments later if she let this go on she would not have an army anymore she was not sure what effect she had expected calrachs death or the destruction of the auldek histories to have but so far all the small victories they had won only seemed to fuel the intensity of the auldeks rage that was why mena had wanted so badly to buy them a reprieve she and elya had flown within shouting distance of the freketes instead of listening to anything she had to say the beasts converged on her no talking no taunting none of the curious arrogant bravado of their earlier encounters they just roared toward her she had given elya free rein to flee mena simply held on at least they led the freketes away from the army that was something the beasts took turns pressing the pursuit two or three of them clawed the air behind elya as the others flew resting themselves elya performed with agility and speed mena had not known her capable of but elya could not go on much longer before them stretched a hilly landscape of dips and rises mena glanced back the frekete that had been behind them had just pulled away devoth and bitten pressed the attack now coming on with a fresh surge of energy lets get them mena thought to elya she shaped the thought with anger and defiance but she knew they had no choice any moment now one of those grasping claws would get a firm grip on elya and pull her from the sky they had to act first they did not get that chance while mena still looked behind elya broke her speed and cut to one side the motion whipped menas neck around savagely a frekete that had lain in hiding for them surged up from a hollow right in front of them it raked one of its claws through elyas thin wing membrane and then down her side blood erupted from the wound the beasts claws cut through the saddle straps mena felt her harness go loose and cant off to one side she barely managed to say atop elya by clinging to her neck elya skimmed away so near to the earth that her feet touched down briefly as each hill rose beneath her that did not last long either another frekete and rider dropped from the sky in front of them elya snapped her wings in and twisted past them sleek as a spear the auldeks sword sung by menas ear so close elya reached another rise but her feet twisted beneath her she crashed down on the other side grinding and rolling mena with her in a tangle of harness and webbing and wings mena felt the familiar breathstealing pain of her shoulder being dislocated her arm flopping limply the frekete and its rider swooped over the rise mena tried to grab for her sword hilt with her good arm but the scabbard had twisted around beneath her and the pain in her shoulder made it hard to control her movements the frekete touched the ground in a flying run mena knew it would reach her before she could draw her weapon she was still struggling to get the kings trust free when elya twisted away from her found her feet elya leaped over the frekete he slashed at her but passed just underneath herand just above mena one of its feet swept so close to the princess that it splattered her face with bits of rippedup turf elyas wings beat the air as she lifted higher flying backward tail slapping about tauntingly close to the freketes grasping claws from below mena watched the auldek twist around in his harness looking at her he yanked back on his reins with his full body weight trying to turn the frekete back toward her the cords pulled taut against the freketes shoulders but the creature strained against them it did not care about following its riders commands anymore or about mena it wanted elya the three of them disappeared over the hillcrest leaving mena crumpled on the ground tangled in her harness rigging mena screamed elyas name both in her mind and with all her voice she writhed up and out of the harness and kicked free of it with her good hand she gripped the bicep of her dangling arm she inhaled clenched her teeth and then pushed the arm back into place the pain was dizzying it took several attempts before she felt the ball of her arm bone slip back into its socket once it had she drew the kings trust and ran as fast as she could up the slope over which the others had disappeared cresting it she saw them below her in the next depression the frekete fought a snarling duel with elya the beast punched and grappled her landing brutal blows it was all brawny muscle and weight sharp claws and bared teeth elya writhed with serpentine speed a hissing tangle of motion she fought more fiercely than mena would have thought possible but she was not made for it her body too slim and delicate her wings hung in useless tatters her side black with blood she tried several times to leap away but the frekete yanked her back down each time the auldek had dismounted to let the beast have its fun he had started up the rise toward mena his sword in hand but had paused obviously amused by the fight he shouted something to the animal it bellowed in return it slammed a fist across elyas jaw she reeled away but it grabbed her and pulled her back it bit down on the long curve of her neck no mena rushed down the slope her sword raised all pain forgotten the auldek snapped around he moved to intercept her they crashed together mena savage in her attack the auldek just as furious in repelling it they went around the auldek moving so that she could not see what the frekete was doing to elya this drove mena into a fury of slashing hacking thrusting motion faster than any attack she had managed before the auldek backed mena wanted him dead fast now when a roar ripped through the air behind her she feared it was the frekete announcing its kill the auldek heard it too he looked past her and saw something that surprised him his eyes left mena only for a moment thats all she needed she hacked his sword hand off at the wrist as the sword and severed hand dropped she reached over them and sliced a cut through the auldeks face he survived it only by snapping his head back turning and running a second roar hit menas back this one different from the first higher and more shrill mena wanted to turn but she also feared to she ran after the fleeing auldek as if blasted forward by a third roar a low bass note that made the ground tremble the auldek stumbled once again that moment was all mena needed she was maeben now dropping from the sky nothing but a screech of mindless rage at full sprint she brought the kings trust up horizontally her shoulder cocked high she slammed her foot down on the auldeks heel as his step hitched she dove forward driving the sword with all her weight and speed the point of the blade slipped in at the base of the auldeks skull cut through and jutted through his face mena nearly ran up the mans back she kicked off him yanking the cutting edge up as she did so his head split in two she did not pause to watch him fall she turned in the air and landed ready to run back toward elya only then did she see what had so frightened the auldek the sky was alive with dragons a brown one hurtled toward the approaching freketes the othernearly as blue as the sky behind itswept around to attack them from the other side the brown one roared first and then the blue one did the same all the freketes heard them they pulled up hesitating as their eyes took in the shapes approaching them mena saw the dragons cut into the airborne freketes scattering them that was all she saw for now there was a third dragon this one became a searing black arrow that shot straight toward elya and the frekete that held her limp body the creaturelarger than any frekete dwarfing elya with a massive bigjawed head that was so crimson it could have been on firerode in on that rumbling wave of sound the greatest of the roars the frekete holding elya tossed her down and leaped into flight the dragon met the frekete that way at the last moment the dragon pulled its head back and tossed its claws forward grabbing and scratching at the very moment of impact a man leaped from the monsters back mena had not even noticed the rider he slid across a slick stretch of wing membrane and then hit the ground in a jarring roll the two beasts were carried forward by the dragons weight and momentum a writhing ball of wings and tails teeth and fists screaming fighting fury they disappeared over the hillock the man found his feet and spotted mena meeting his gaze mena felt her vision blur she stood swaying staring the kings trust forgotten in her hand her eyes followed the man as he rushed toward her she heard his feet crunching on the snow she saw the plumes of vapor when he breathed she knew his face and recognized the joy and concern written in his features she knew him she knew him mena aliver said reaching her in time to catch her before she fell from consciousness its all right im with you chapter sixtythree nualo was the first to appear called by corinns reading from the song circling high above the ruined valley of calfa ven she saw the moving tumult of his passage it began as a disturbance to the east like a small dense storm roiling on the horizon and moving at an unnatural speed she did not know why she knew it was he except perhaps that his hunger was greater than any of the others his evil more pronounced how close do we let them get hanish asked close enough but not too close that could be hard to measure hanish said theres no ruler for such a thing when nualo was near enough that corinn could see his tall elongated form striding up and down the mountains she turned po and headed north they left behind the devastation of calfa ven but there were signs of the santoths wandering destruction written across the hills and valleys beneath them in places it looked like giant versions of the worms that had eaten her mouth had chewed up the earth and then vomited it back in twisted sickening piles of soil and vegetation and rock would the santoth do this to the entire world would studying the song move them away from this rage and hunger for destruction or would it just make them more horrific versions of what they already were she knew the answers to these questions the world below her both prompted and confirmed them over and over again whatever had twisted the santoth had taken them to a state they could not come back from she hoped the same was not true of herself looking back at nualo seeing him shoulder through great pine trees as if they were shrubs corinn did not notice how close they flew to another santoth po barked an alarm the figure climbed up over a buttress of rock on the mountain below them as soon as he stood with his feet planted he threw up his arms and bellowed out his garbled version of the song the notes rushed upward in the form of long deformed black birds with eyeless heads stretched eagerly forward from their bodies they flew without so much as flapping their wings like darts with only the force of the sorcerers voice to propel them po twisted and turned as they reached him he contorted his body as the birdshaped missiles zipped by each of them cried out as it missed leaving in its wake a scorching burn that fouled the air the stench of malevolence was so thick corinn began coughing a painful useless gesture that wracked her chest with pain dont breathe it hanish said dont breathe hanishs hands reached around and grasped hers steadying her through her he pulled the reins to direct po into a sliding dive away from the sorcerer the missiles continued to fly past them but po kept at his maneuvers even as he banked away wings pulled tight to edge their speed forward one of the birds punched through pos left wing it expanded on impact its legs and wings and beak all became hooks that tore through the thick membrane blood and tissue sprayed from the ragged hole the barbed bird then sank away beneath them po screamed he yanked the wing in sending them into a corkscrew dive hanish fought to get control still using corinns hands the spin was too chaotic corinn hanish called i cant corinn reached for the creatures mind she found it a cauldron overflowing with pain and anger and fear the wound was worse even than it looked the touch of the birds hooks carried the poison of tainted sorcery with it it ate at po burning his wing like flaming oil the agony of it was driving him mad corinn grasped for the song she built it inside her head she conjured the spell she would have used to heal him and shared it with po it could not do so not as she would have liked but just hearing it in his mind soothed him she reminded him of who he was how strong and wonderful he stretched the wing again pulling them out of the descent and flew the ragged hole remained loose skin flapping horribly in the wind but corinn could feel that he was fighting the poisoned magic deadening it and he was beating his wings anyway looking back corinn saw the evil bird drifting toward the sorcerer dural that was who it was he stood calmly his hands folded no longer singing no longer enormous just a man waiting for the bird to drift back to him something about his receding outline gave corinn his name and brought to mind the face that she had seen him wear back at the carmelia before she looked away she saw nualo reach the rock buttress he too had shrunk to normal dimensions he conferred with dural both of them reaching to catch the falling bird they have the scent of us corinn said thats what they just took theyre hunters and that bird has brought them pos scent they can follow us around the world now hanish responded by pulling his hands away from hers giving her the reins again and wrapping his arms back around her waist she knew what he was thinking and loved him for not saying it better that they have that scent it would help draw them to her as she led them on with the part of her mind reserved for po she thanked him for it coming on the wide glimmering snake that was the river ask po rode the air up its course toward candovia all that day they flew all that day nualo and dural trailed them toward dusk another santoth abernis ran south toward them along the surface of the river at times he jumped from rock to rock at others he simply churned across the surface of the water when he attacked them he did so with a motion of his hands that scooped water from the river and sent it in a flood up and over them as it fell toward them corinn knew it was not water any longer it still sparkled in the air but was more like shards of glass than liquid the wave of it stretched so wide and moved so quickly that po could not avoid it instead he beat furiously toward it as it fell on them he wrapped his wings around himself the short lengths of bone in them going loose they wrapped across his belly and over his back they covered corinn and the ghost and still went farther wrapping around and around they punched through the rain of shards like an arrow corinn felt pos agony as the glass slivers cut into him savage as living things they cut into his wings but not deep enough to touch corinn pos momentum carried him through them only then did he snap his wings out and catch the air again they were even more shredded like the previous time the cuts festered with acid like last time corinn helped po fight them to fly through the pain with yet another santoth now behind them that night they stayed aloft they saw the lights of pelos to the east but stayed far away from that city po carved a meandering course avoiding settlements as much as possible during the dark hours corinn felt other santoth join the hunters and early the next morning tenith emerged out of the marshes of the lakelands he hurled the corpses of cranes at them the creatures sprang to undead life and surged up toward them po dodged a few caught one in his jaws he snatched it out of the air and then with one whiplike snapping of his neck he sent it twirling toward the ground another he batted away with a foot each touch of them was filled with corruption but he did it anyway he was getting better at this already corinn hanish said ive not told you how glad i am that we have this dragon and they dont dont tell it to me corinn answered tell him po swung his neck around and gazed at them a moment corinn knew he did so because she asked him to but it looked very much as if he had turned to hear hanishs praise he received it gracefully blinking his large golden eyes and never losing the rhythm and strength of his wingbeats the santoth were pulling together now drawn not just to her but also back to one another corinn kept them as close to the far horizon as much as she could watching their numbers grow they flew out over the northern ocean and then cut around the peninsula north of luana the santoth ran across the waves as if they were moving features of the land they were tireless persistent they could no more stop pursuing her than they could choose to stop breathing good corinn thought good hunt me hunt me to our deaths hanish stayed pressed to her the whole time often he spoke beside her ear telling her tales like the ones he had that night he spent with her after she tried to cut herself a new mouth he spoke of his childhood of his brothers amazingly he found humor in even the brutal meinish winters in the training that was forced upon him in the constant need to prove himself to both the living and the dead corinn had never shared such stories with him she had never been able to see the light in the darkness that he did or she had never been able to before chapter sixtyfour you know delivegu said once his gasping breaths had calmed enough to allow it im not so sure anybody noticed how terribly bold it was of me to bring kelis and shen to the palace ive yet to be thanked properly for it rhrenna lifted her sweatslicked forehead from his chest she tossed her head snapping her hair from her face so that it draped from one naked shoulder why she asked would you think to say that right now no one has acknowledged it is all i mean im here with you rhrenna said that should count for something from straddling him she flopped to one side and lay on her back eyes closed delivegu missed the warmth of her immediately he rolled onto his side and studied her in profile the almosttoofine point to her nose the bones across her shoulders a little too pronounced her breasts small enough that they all but disappeared when she stretched her arms above her head in all these ways she was not the type of woman he would usually have fancied but fancy her he did perhaps more than he should oh come now you dont mean to say this bed wrestling is a thankyou am i paid as cheaply as that in a manner that pleases you so much more than me rhrenna lifted the arm nearest him and dropped the weight of it over him shut up she said for a time he did he liked that she could be so direct she had been so when she arrived unannounced at his chamber door though she had come for seduction she had not followed any of the routines he was used to her light blue eyes had not smoldered her lips had not puckered she had not batted her eyelashes or anything like that still when she said i think ill try you now if you are prepared for it he had found that he waswith stunning rapidityprepared for it lying beside her now staring at the ceiling he was so satiated that he did not even mind when rhrenna began to snore softly it seemed a little strange to him that she came to him now when events in the world had taken such a dire turn when her own mistress was cursed and off somewhere hunting sorcerers who had already proven themselves more powerful than she perhaps rhrenna was not as devoted to the queen as she had seemed in a way the possibility that her loyalty was a carefully calculated deception impressed him as much as if it were real more so perhaps either way youre besotted delivegu he whispered youre growing silly with age that got him thinking with a small measure of concern about his recent choices the thing with kelis and shen for example stroll into the queens presence with an illegitimate heir to the throne one that might very well usurp her own illegitimate heir bring along the talayan who had escorted the santoth right into the heart of the empire with catastrophic results if he had done something like that before the events at the coronation the queen would have found a way to kill him unpleasantly no doubt employing a man like himself for the task nor did he arrange to meet the queen on the stone staircase as he once had to present them both bound and gagged for her secret consideration interrogation and disposal that based on all the services he had rendered the queen in the past would have been a reasonable way to proceed why did he choose the first way and not the latter because the events at the coronation changed everything for all he knew the queen might not have escaped the carmelia with her powers intact surely she had suffered from some curse the santoth had tossed at her she might not even be long for this world if she wasnt what better than to enter alivers service with a golden ticket alsodare he even think itit felt like the right thing to do delivegu had not yet given up on the hope that his role in the world might be measured by things other than hunting down verbose rabblerousers poisoning pregnant women and bedding maidservants and secretaries theres more to me than that he murmured rhrenna broke from her rhythmic snore for a moment he watched her until she resumed it smiling when she did regardless of his reasons if he judged by what transpired in the library he had chosen wisely what was going on with that scarflike thing wrapped around the queens face he could not have said nor could he fathom her silence barad the stoneeyed acting as corinns mouth kelis blubbering like a sleepwalking child aliver speaking with an animation delivegu had never seen in him before it had been strange stuff all around perhaps he should consider the new mission aliver had proposed before leaving a sort of thanks at least it indicated that he trusted him and thought him capable of a task of importance it was not nearly as interesting as the type of job corinn had him get up to and he did not entirely understand what the purpose of it was but why not go along with it he had to work for somebody i wonder he thought if aliver might be inclined to make me an agnate after ive rendered sufficient service of course could he triangulate his former relationship with the queen his new one with the prince and his muchimproved one with rhrenna into such an increase in his fortunes of course he could that was what delivegu lemardine had always done he mused on his prospects for a time at some point he realized that rhrennas breathing was no longer audible he turned his head she still lay in profile but her eyes were open her lips trembled slightly and a tear escaped the eye nearest him and rushed down toward her ear i dreamed she said i dreamed delivegu waited to hear what she had dreamed but apparently those two words were full sentences not the beginning of longer ones i dont know whats going to happen she continued nothing is right anymore i read what she wrote to aaden its she choked on whatever it was i dont want to be without her i dont want to be alone she loved me like nobody else did she gave me life when that was as far as she got delivegu curled into her he pulled her into his chest and kissed her eyes closed and smeared her tears away with his lips he told her she would never be alone he told her he was with her always everything would be all right he would make sure of it she would always be loved he would love her he said he already did he told her all these things as she sobbed against him wrapped in the sheets of his bed and he meant it by the giver he actually meant it all h e sailed for aushenia the next morning he took no joy in leaving rhrenna if she had showed any of the emotion that had racked her with sobs during the night he might well have said something regrettable sentimental further promises of the type he had thought only lesser men ever made to women fortunately she parted with a businesslike efficiency wishing him speed on his mission in no more time than it took to roll out of bed snatch her garments from the floor and depart while still climbing into them he lay in bed a moment after the door slammed shut uneasy with what seemed like a reversal in the role he normally occupied in amorous matters you cant pretend i didnt see into you he said to his empty chamber we both know i did what he did not say but thought was that perhaps she had seen rather a bit too much into him as well what he also did not sayand could not quite believe he even found himself thinkingwas that he wanted nothing more urgently than to return to her to have her again to be with her many more times to make love yes but also to talk to jest to see the fit of clothes on her under the play of many different types of light to be there should she wake crying perhaps even to reveal even more of his intimate thoughts to her youre getting soft delivegu he thought ruminating on this as he sailed delivegu failed to remember to stop in at alecia manil or aos he could have found diversion in any of these placessocial gatherings and flirtation early more serious drink and fornication later his friend yanzen had even left an open invitation for him to stop in at sigh sadens rustic estate outside aos the senator having fled the isle of acacia divided his staff between alecia where he had to conduct senatorial business and aos where he planned to flee if the empire collapsed yanzen had promised delivegu that if he visited he could deduct from the debt yanzen owed him by dipping himself into the concubines saden hid among the household staff theyd welcome that stiff rod of yours he had said yanzen always knew the right things to say to encourage delivegu inexplicable then that he sailed right past each port with barely a sideways glance he landed in killintich a full two days before schedule and he found himself riding with king grae doing his best to offer the monarch a deference he did not feel outside the city the country was beautifulwoodland and small villages occasional solitary farms they rode winding dirt roads through the forest with just a few guards trailing them delivegu would have been happiest with silence but the king was in a more talkative mood we did not expect you so soon grae said he sat easy in his saddle like one born to horses which he was he was just as stonechiseled handsome as delivegu remembered his rustic attire nonetheless wafted a scent of royal luxury as if the supple leather had been sewn with gold thread and the pockets filled with lavender flowers he wore his blue eyes as much like jewelry as his turquoise necklace or the subtle diadem that rested on his reddish blond hair delivegu avoided those eyes as much as he could im on the kings business he responded best to be prompt prompt prompt is not a word i would have associated with the name delivegu lemardine grae said he showed a mouthful of straight white teeth and leaned toward him at least thats not what certain ladies of my acquaintance have said about you they all attest that there are two things you are gifted at one is deceitful treachery the other is oh i shouldnt mention it its a somewhat more admirable skill though even if its a gift mostly to the whores and maidservants of the world hes baiting me delivegu thought it surprised him to hear that the king of aushenia had been asking anybody about him for some reason he did not like the idea it was he who was supposed to know things about others not the other way around it was grae who had been sent packing from acacia spurned by the queen for his treachery the fact that she discovered that treachery had been delivegus doing of course apparently the king knew it telling himself to keep his calm delivegu shifted the subject so have they been safe in your care no more unfortunate accidents yes we havent lost a one of them since the queen sent them here the ones who were killed were not slaughtered in aushenia that happened in aos here theyve been taken good care of all of them how many are there seven seven i know not many to be an entire generation of a race grae said the queen makes for a challenging adversary how is she ive heard all manner of dire things she is the queen delivegu said yes grae guffawed im sure shes that off to sort out the santoth while the rest of us do the same with the auldek i suspect weve got the bloodier end of that bargain you werent there you didnt see them but he did not want to give grae anything so he said is this it on a rise of land coming into view before them stood a squat stoneblock building it was large enough to be a castle but it was in truth a prison yes thats our keep grae said straightening to take in the view im sure you understand the various reasons we did not want to house them in the city it wasnt one of the queens stipulations she asked this of me and i obliged theyve been perfectly safe here safer than they deserve do they speak acacian i suppose ive not been stopping in to chat with them delivegu noted the edge in the monarchs voice he rather liked finding it beneath his regal demeanor grae did chafe at being told to care for these creatures feeling a bit like a wet nurse are you your majesty no i wouldnt imagine youd have much to say to them or they to you once they had both dismounted and had their horses taken from them grae led them into the keep on foot what are you to do with them take them to king aliver as instructed the aushenian pondered that for a moment i meant what is he going to do with them but i dont suppose its your place to know that king aliver back from the dead by the giver the world seems to have turned upside down overnight youll have to dine with me this evening i have many questions for you thats not possible delivegu said i carry on tonight i have to see to the details of transporting them surely you have an evening to no i dont delivegu turned toward him meeting those blue eyes as i said im on the kings business i choose to be prompt grae studied him for a long moment you dont seem like the same man i met in acacia just months ago youre tamed obedient fine dont dine with me i have no interest in your people anymore i would say i wish you all the best with your war but the words would stick on my tongue it may prove to be your war as well delivegu pointed out i know more about the numrek and their kind than you errand boy aushenia took the brunt of the first invasion or have your people forgotten that have they written aushenguk fell out of the histories no matter we remember we remember that we fought the numrek first with no aid from acacia we remember that the numrek overran our lands while acacians looked after their own interests this time aushenia will defend its own borders fiercely if need be but we wont fight your war for you they had walked through the keeps main gate beneath the fortifications through a second wall and a gate that was cranked up only once they had reached it as they stepped through it immediately began to descend again there grae said theyre out at play we let them spar with wooden swords whats the harm in it delivegu saw them then on the far side of the large enclosure sparring just as the king said just seven of them seven numrek children of various ages the only ones still alive after corinns massacre of their parents at the thumb theyre yours now grae said take them chapter sixtyfive dariel did his best to explain that he had reconsidered how to proceed now that he was about to set off he worried about taking others into danger on a fools errand he should go alone he could handle a small skiff himself he knew the way to lithram len already if he succeeded at what he had planned it would not be because he fought his way in if a league clipper spotted him it would not matter how many friends he had sitting on the seat beside him stealth was what mattered that he could best achieve alone this was his mission after all if he was wrong or failed at it they would need each and every able body perched on the walls of avina he might as well have been a youngest child arguing for something before a unified front of older skeptical siblings he had felt this way before they would have none of it they had discussed dariels plan only within a small circle but mor still insisted they be cautious considering the magnitude of what hinged on dariels success they could not chance some malicious clansman of dukishs alerting the league somehow tunnel is with you rhuin fa the big man said he tugged on a golden tusk thats the way it is stop scratching at it and us geena said youre not going alone in some skiff not when we have a right lovely sleek fast clipper with your name on it face it dariel clytus added were brigands you cant expect us to stand on a city wall flashing our asses and such i mean thats all right for melio being marah and all that but us no not when theres a bit of piracy to get up to even skylene asked him to see sense the very fact that she could ask him was miraculous she woke the evening he breathed life into her sometime that night her fever broke and the next morning she sat up her skin cool and filled with color the first thing she did was ask for lentils red lentils in a creamy cheese sauce with long strips of fried onion in it she ate and ate and laughed and asked a thousand questions about the things that she had missed and here she was just a couple of days from the edge of death standing thin but vibrant in the late light of the day holding mors arm and asking dariel to see sense he had not told her what he had done and figured he never would he told no one when birke showed his canines and shrugged as if to say that he surely would not try to say no to skylene dariel did not he acquiesced without a word more of protest tunnel had hefted up his mallets clytus tied back his long hair with a band across his forehead set his hands on his hips and danced for a few merry moments preternaturally light on his feet kartholome patted the throwing stars flat against his waist geena smiled and batted her eyelashes dariel loving the buoyancy of the moment prayed that he knew what he was doing that he was not leading his friends to certain death and placing the free people at the mercy of the league i think its safe to say the invasion has begun clytus said none of the soul vessels churning the waters from the barrier isles toward avina paid the slightest attention to the single now terribly oldfashioned clipper moving the other way propelled only by the power of a favorable breeze the league had been won over by the wonders that were the soul vessels and why not those vessels cut right into that wind sleek and glistening unerringly aimed at their target dariel remembered the intoxicating power of having his hands on the steering wheel of one of those ships it was a hard wheel to let go of he had counted on that being the case for the leaguemen were right about that at least dariel thought of course if he was wrong about the rest of it that would be a moot point while most of the barge transports would be coming down from eigg where the newly arrived army had landed two of them had sailed for lithram len all on board the slipfin gathered by the bridge to stare at them each transport was its own squat rectangular island of dull gray smooth as stone flat and largely featureless dariel thought them ghostly deadlooking things unnatural in the way they shoved through the chop both barges thronged with ishtat soldiers thousands of them from one edge of the structure to another stood shoulder to shoulder here and there towers jutted up the structures were not the same material as the vessel but were simple wood and stone and leather obviously recent additions other military hardware cluttered them as well the distance made them hard to discern the transports may never have been used for warfare before but the quick outfitting for sire lethels siege of avina had transformed them most convincingly they moved us on those tunnel said when we were small those took us across to ushen brae he stared a moment longer they dont know them soldiers they dont know theyre slaves too dont start feeling sorry for them kartholome said he fingered the new earrings that hung in long curves from his lobes theyd spit and roast you in a bocoum minute though you wouldnt really taste like pork would you the large man looked at the brigand perplexed he tugged on a tusk the harbor of lithram len proved a floating labyrinth though largely deserted in the wake of the invasion forces departure it was crowded with the league ships that had been left behind dariel and the others tethered the slipfin to a brig well away from the docks they crammed into the skiff and rowed the rest of the way navigating a meandering course through the maze of anchored ships they pulled in below the bow of a large brig in its shadow they tied the skiff to the pier and clambered up an old barnacleencrusted ladder standing on the long high pier as the others climbed clytus scanned the distant piers ships and even the town itself we still dont have a plan do we dariel said if it were just me i wouldve worn a disguise tried to blend with that face clytus asked i havent seen too many ishtat wearing full facial tattoos true enough theyve no fashion sense the others continued to bunch around them nervously looking about tunnel came up last he had looped a strap of leather around his neck and hung his mallets from it they dangled behind him as he climbed gaining the pier he let the mallets drop heavy things that dented the wood and stuck to it pressed down by their weight a moment later as everyone watched he hefted both up and straightened he stood surprised to find all eyes on him holding the mallets out to either side as the muscles of his arms and chest and ridged compartments of his abdomen flexed what ive got the plan kartholome said he pulled his hand away from the oiled tip of his beard and pointed at tunnel we follow him they did weapons drawnbarechested like tunnel open shirted like clytus and kartholome smiling with unaccountable good humor like geenadariel and his brigands marched down the pier and into the lothan aklun port city of lithram dariel took the vanguard unsure where his destination was ill feel it he thought ill feel it when im close he thought of bashar and cashen wishing they were with him to help sniff out the place he intended to find they would not have actually helped however the place he searched for was not to be found by scent part of him already knew his destination it was that part of him that had proposed this vague as it was to the others he had not even detailed what he hoped to accomplish here he had just said that na gamen was urging him to go to lithram there was something he needed to face there something important they met no one along the waterfront in the distance several people went about their work but none was near enough to notice the new arrivals any idea where were headed clytus asked we could ask that fellow geena said indicating a figure passing between two buildings without noticing them quietly so the man would not actually hear him kartholome said hey you know where to find the thing were looking for not sure what it is but up there dariel said indicating a narrow structure the roof of which was just visible rising above the nearer row buildings its over there joking aside nobody asked him how he knew that they found a stairway between two of the larger buildings and ascended it taking the steps a few at a time reaching the higher street they stepped cautiously onto it tunnel pointed out that the architecture of the town was nothing like the lothan aklun estates he had seen on some of the barrier isles though childhood memories the images were strong in his mind as they were in dariels here the smooth granite stones and the spires atop some buildings looked like the work of laborers not sorcerers they did not have long to ponder the differences kartholome saw them first he cursed a hundred or so paces down the street a contingent of six ishtat dashed into view judging by their wellarmed look of determination they had been alerted to the groups presence they pulled up spotting the intruders they conferred for a moment swords drawn they fanned out evenly spaced clearly disciplined we can handle them clytus said to dariel drawing his sword they cant be the best of the lot else they wouldnt be here theyd be with the invasion kartholome cursed again another group of ishtat appeared on the far side of them about the same distance away the two groups converged with dariels group in the middle were not so good at sneaking huh tunnel asked oh well he stepped toward the first nearer contingent of soldiers he paused dariel i see a passage what do i do go around and over or through through it dariel answered tunnel grinned thats the way he walked at first but as he came nearer the soldiers he fell into a jog and then a run his mallets came up the careful array of soldiers burst like an explosion had just hit their center tunnel had to swing around and come back at them pressing several up against a building wall he went to work mallets hissing savage arcs around him smashing stone knocking swords away and then when he got serious smashing bones go clytus said grimly do what you have to we will too he led the charge toward the other group with kartholome just behind him already snapping his throwing stars into hissing motion geena pulled her knife free go dariel she said pointing to the narrow structure dariel had indicated earlier it took great effort for the prince to pull himself away he hated doing so he had never left his companions in danger hand on the hilt of the ishtat sword he bore he almost could not go theres your goal well sort out these ones go she rushed to join tunnel go dariel turned and ran the entrance of the narrow building stood open he dashed into it and kept going stumbling over a low table reaching out for the wall for support he kept moving down a long corridor past adjoining hallways and rooms not really thinking about where he was going he just got himself farther and farther from his friends committing himself to leaving them behind once he was deep enough inside and the clash and shouts of fighting had faded dariel paused all right let me do this quickly he closed his eyes and waited hoping direction would come to him when it did he wasted a few precious seconds realizing it as ever na gamen did not speak to him as a separate being he spoke as part of dariel himself so the vague feeling that he had to walk down the corridor to the second opening through it and down the stairs was not just an idle thought remembering this he opened his eyes and dashed for the opening the next several minutes passed in the same manner dariel had to keep reminding himself that his instincts were more than instincts he was not guessing he was following a path he already knew though it only came to him piece by piece it felt like his knowledge stretched only as far as the light of a candle as he moved the illumination did as well he kept going until he stopped at some point just an empty stretch of corridor he lost the drive to move forward for a moment the fear that he was lost knifed through him he breathed tried to trust he leaned his hands against the wall and pushed his weight into it as before he thought the action was meaningless until the section of wall turned soft he pushed right through and emerged into another room a small chamber four walls and seemingly sealed tight just before him a lean curving pedestal rose up to waist height the room was not exactly dark and not exactly light but he could see what he needed to the dust was inches thick on the floor beneath his feet it was as soft as carpet undisturbed until this moment the league has not found this place yet they must have scoured the city already and the island after that and farther still searching without knowing what they were searching for here though was a relic right here undiscovered i wouldnt have found it either dariel thought not without help having found it he stared hoping na gamen was not done helping for he had no idea what to do now a framed area on the wall before him glowed with a low luminescence the frame held no painting or window and yet it was the centerthe purposeof the chamber staring dariel saw deep inside the wall which was translucent lights pulsed and wavered much like the glowing aquatic life he had seen on special nights at sea the energy in there was different though it changed shape before his eyes at times it looked like a constellation of stars blooming into life all at once but then that wasnt right the lights moved in swirls tossed and shaped by layers of different currents in other moments the light came in pulses like so many heartbeats looking closely at the pedestals top he saw a single shape on the flat surface it looked strangely familiar but it took him a moment to realize it was an engraving of the same symbol protruding from his forehead his fingers tingled he had thought the chamber was completely silent but that was not quite right he heard something he craned his head this way and that sure that there were sounds just out of reach the sound did not come from inside the room it did not come from the pedestal it was not even inside the living wall stepping back he took in the whole frame as if in response the constellation bloomed again so many lights all of them pulsing pulsing in time with one another he pressed up close against it and then he understood the lights were not within the frame the lights were not even lights the wall was simply a way of seeing what they represented he knew then what this place was and why he had come here most important he knew what he was supposed to do he did not question the impulse that came to him he moved around to the pedestal he bent forward like a peasant before a king like the faithful before evidence of his god he bent forward in reverence and humility and he touched his forehead to the altar he placed the rune he wore into the imprint that matched it chapter sixtysix you cant be serious mena said you cant mean to try that not after what theyve done aliver almost replied that he was dead serious but considering the things they had spent the night discussing he did not think the expression would go over well i am mena he said i do mean to try it i may be wrong but it feels right it feels like it may be the way to cut through to the heart of things i know its a hard thing to hear me say but lets toss it back and forth if i cant convince you i wont manage to convince anybody else either they had already been at council many hours sitting together in a shelter made of living bodies elya lay at its center with the long bulk of kohl curved around her and the two humans aliver and mena sat wrapped in blankets with an oil lamp burning between them heat and light both such as it was the night blustered above them but the spread wings of the dragon covered them dulling the sound of the wind an unusual chamber in which to hold a reunion but it was what the giver allowed them aliver was more thankful for it than he could have expressed mena he was really seeing mena again it took her some time to stare aliver into belief to accept him as real but he knew her without a doubt it was truly mena who had touched his face with her fingers smearing his tears even as she cried herself it was mena who had first been wordlessly amazed and then had been possessed by a babbling of halfformed sentences and declarations aliver had found what threads he could in her words and tied them together because of this menahis sister his young wise gifted sister she who lived both gentle and furious her faces like two sides of a sword blade one of peace and one of warcame to believe in him again she was leaner than ever her face gaunt curls of skin peeling away from her nose and cheeks painfullooking crevices lined her lips she was not the girl he had known in childhood nor was she the woman he had later known on the fields of teh how very strange their lives had been how much he loved her even though fate had kept them apart more years than it had let them be together ilabo and dram had flown their mounts to meet the tattered remains of menas army to chase back the freketes and to protect those battered troops as they continued south they numbered only a fraction of the souls the princess had set out with by the time they arrived they would be even fewer than they had been the day before mena delirious with pain and fatigue battered by the sight of elyas horrible wounds and the shock of alivers appearance had stilled only after ilabo had sworn to guide her army to safety youre not alone out here anymore aliver had said there with the sleeping mother and daughter sheltering them they worked through many things of import when they did begin to talk everything came out in a rush all the events on acacia the truth of things corinn had done the arrival of shen and the santoth the events at the carmelia the curse on corinns mouth and the changes they all went through in the days just afterward so much aliver confessed the death sentence that he and corinn were under he thought it best to reveal this right away before mena grew too accustomed to him being among the living again the many things mena told him in return were troubling her hatred of the auldek blazed in her eyes the hardest of the things aliver had to explain was that he wanted to make peace with them but that was the truth so he said it you cant be serious mena repeated they nearly killed elya they would have if you hadnt arrived if they had if they had i would have gone mad i would have killed every one of them each and every soul id have mena i did arrive elya is not dead i dont want you dead either i dont want thousands upon thousands more deadwhich will happen if we keep fighting the look she gave him was a glare but he thought the lamplight exaggerated her anger he hoped so for the wildness in her eyes was nothing he had seen in her before she said i hate them there is no way to make peace with them what if i find a way would you consider it they ate the villagers of tavirith that cant be undone it cant be forgiven i know aliver said but perhaps the way to move forward is to find peace without forgiveness or to find forgiveness in peace not to forget anything but to put first the lives of those still living mena youre arguing with me but everything youve done up here was for the same cause in all your decisions i see you trying to keep your soldiers alive thats what im proposing if we ask the thousands who are still climbing up the methalian rim to run to their deaths theyll do it if we do that theyll understand it it will be the same as what our family has asked of them for generations maybe their sheer numbers will tire the auldeks arms or dull their blades but what then wont that be defeat what world will there be for any of them afterward mena closed her eyes they wont let you you may be right but i have to try they want us all enslaved aliver reached over the lamp and set a hand on her blanketed knee that they cannot have im not talking about giving in to them no concessions no defeat im talking about finding a peace that doesnt destroy us all help me do that tell me everything you know about them help me find their souls its that ill have to speak to how can you even think thats possible i am aliver he said he lifted his hand to her chin nudging her head up so that she looked at the thin smile he offered her ive been given a second chance i cant fail this time i wont t hat resolve was what drove his soul up out of his body two nights later after hours upon hours of talking with his sister after caring for mena and seeing elyas wounds miraculously heal as the creature slept after seeing the first of his troops arriving in force after flying out to greet menas battered forces even after speaking for a time to rialus neptos the traitor who had proved a treasure trove of information about the invaders after all that when it was time to sleep aliver lay down for the busy nights work he had ahead of him he had seen devoth flying atop his mount when he saved mena she had identified him aliver used those images to pull his spirit out of his body and to send it after the auldek his version of dream travel may or may not have been akin to what corinn had attempted or to what hanish mein had used to commune both with his undead ancestors and with others among the living likely it came to aliver easily because of the years he had spent as a spirit dispersed throughout the world floating separating his soul from his body proved not difficult perhaps his body had already begun the dying that would soon make his release complete he had barely fallen into the rhythm of sleep before he rose above his growing war camp he surveyed the tents and supplies and animals the slumbering forms and the many campfires for a time but only until he got his bearings then he set his mind on devoth alivers spirit floated north slowly at first then gaining speed until the dark cold world of the plateau rushed by beneath him graywhite under the moons light he reached the auldek camp coming upon its steaming masses bodies and beasts and fires the towers seemed like mountains on the undulating landscape their numbers might have daunted him but he had not the time to consider them before he knew it his soul found the station it needed and punched soundless and without force of impact through the structures wall inside a large sumptuous room the walls hung with swords and axes with tapestries depicting cityscapes and mountain ranges and vistas not of the known world a lamp burned low on a table but even without it he would have been able to see light was within him it illumined the room around him and also flowed through his vision he came to stillness at the foot of a bed standing there for a while alivers glow built in the room until he could see the shape beneath the covers devoth aliver called you are devoth arent you chieftain of the lvin get up i know you speak my tongue the shape in the bed went from lying down to sitting up in one flash of motion his reaction was so immediate he might have been lying in wait for the moment his eyes found alivers wavering form and his face expressed the depths of his confusion and fear he sprang from the bed he snatched for a battleax racked on the wall and whirled around with a savage swing that would have cut a man in half at the waist or it would have if he had managed this same motion as a physical body and if aliver had been there in the flesh also instead the auldeks body lay still beneath the blankets just as motionless as before the ax that devoth had grasped for hung as it had not disturbed at all devoths spirit swung around after the blow he had tried to make you cant defeat me that way aliver said once devoth had looked back at him still now and even more terrified im a ghost you see im one who went to the afterdeath and returned ive pulled you out of your body so that we may speak who are you devoth rasped his accent thick on the acacian words aliver akaran no that one has gone do not lie to me aliver crossed his glowing arms look at me devoth do i look like any man you have ever known i am vapor and light i am one who is dead and who also lives look at me and decide for yourself he stood letting the warrior take him in at the same time he studied devoth there was something about his spirit that confused aliver he could see the auldeks features versions of his body made of glowing light but his form held more than just his features there were others beneath that outer skin of spirit light the longer devoth held still the more aliver could see the others move quota children what devoth asked he circled around the bed trying to pull several weapons down clearly hating it each time his hands passed like vapor through the wood and steel what have you done to me nothing yet aliver said we are just talking when i release you you can return to your body devoth shook his head he tried to climb back onto the bed but he was terrified at how he sank into the blankets both having purchase and yet passing through them part of the world but not look at me aliver said the auldek did all the other spirits within him did as well how many incorporeal faces were layered there aliver could not tell but he could see them and they could see and hear him i have come with an army that dwarfs yours all the people of the known world are united against you they pour onto this plateau like a river running uphill we will overrun you i have come to tell you to turn back now go back to your own lands and we will not pursue you for the first time devoths spirit seemed to regain some composure he said slowly drawing the word out nooo youve made a mistake in coming here one that will destroy your people if you dont return to your own lands think about this you forget the past i know this about you you forget the past which is why you brought that collection of records with you what will you do now that its gone you have lost so much already so much cannot be regained but if you continue with this war you will lose yourselves completely what will you tell your grandchildren nothing because youll have forgotten your grandchildren wont know the truth of where you came from they wont see your cities in their minds or know the view over avina or understand the beauty of ushen brae they wont see lvinreth or amratseer you say you want to die back into your true souls and age and die again good do so thats the natural order but if you do it here your grandchildrens children will know nothing of what it means to be auldek do you hear what im saying you are already a defeated people its up to you now to decide the depths of that defeat stay and war with usand you will destroy yourselves your sister is an evil one devoth said that much is true to burn our records his spirit form spat though nothing came of the gesture but it is not as you say we can have acacia and we can journey back to ushen brae we know the way now we can have both places why not the future is an auldek future the entire world auldek when you are defeated nobody will be able to stop us so why not an auldek world behind the clear words that devoth spoke aliver could hear other voices they were soundless like screams on the other side of thick glass they had substance but he had to learn how to hear them aliver answered because we can make a peace between us that will honor us both devoths smile showed a glimmer of confidence thats what you want only that now i know this is a trick no no no devoth said chuckling you have no terms for me your world is ours you may send your army against us but they will die we are a great host there are as many divine children fighting for us as there are acacians in your army and we have sublime motion we could send only our slaves and they could harvest your army for us but they are slaves devoth the spirits trapped inside him clamored about the truth of this they so clearly heard him aliver tried harder to hear them as well he pressed his consciousness up against that unseen and intangible barrier listening from a place that had nothing to do with sound they are loyal your speech is a trick and i am not afraid of it you have not heard my terms there are none that i need hear aliver closed his spirit eyes and stilled himself completely he heard the words and thoughts and emotions bloomed inside him they were childrens thoughts raw and youthful filled with life and scared trapped begging for him they spoke their names to him there was a boy called nik and another named dru a girl hanna cried out to him so beseechingly it was hard for aliver not to open his eyes and let it show erin and allis ravi so many names each of them belonging not to devoth but to an individual who should have lived a true life im so sorry aliver thought they could not hear this but he thought it more than once i present my terms anyway aliver said opening his eyes he spoke slowly doing his best to ensure that the auldek would understand him you and all the other auldek with you will release your quota slaves from bondage you will tell them they are free to do as they please you will send them all across to our camp so that my people can speak to them and make sure they are acting on their free will whatever they choose you auldek will abandon this war you will turn your stations around and go home shedding no more blood in the known world you will make a solemn oath that when you return to ushen brae you will not punish the people living there every auldek will make this oath calling on your totem deities as witnesses such an oath would be unbreakable right if it were made yes we may send ships to retrieve the people in your lands but they are free if they choose to live in ushen brae you will have to find a way to live with them we will have your oath on that at first devoth had listened with incredulity as aliver talked he craned his head to hear better by the time he finished devoths spirit had begun to smile is that all and what will you give us in return there was nothing like sincerity in the question but aliver answered it as if there had been the entrapped children had begun to name where they were born they seemed to fear he did not believe them they threw memories at him emotions images of what home was to them under the bombardment aliver could barely keep track of his interaction with devoth it took all his concentration to do so we will do four things for you he said first we will give you peace without fear of retribution our past will be our past though we will not forget your crimes we will not hold them hard in our hearts the children screamed for him not to forget their crimes they were not past they said they were entrapped now very kind of you yes second we will allow you to leave without interference nobody will hunt your backs i will not haunt you anymore third we will put into your hands the numrek children numrek children yes those who still live my sister captured them but did not kill them there are not many but they could be the start of your future of the generations to come we will give you that gift is that it there is a fourth thing yes is it the best thing it may be tell it then i will but not tonight i will tell it to you in person on the field south of here when our forces meet talk to me then devoth you and all the other auldek come to me in front of your army with all your great host behind you then i will tell the fourth thing but now go back to your slumber wake in the morning and remember what i said go sleep devoth for a second it seemed the auldek would fight the order that he had something else to say but the command was strong his spirit slid back toward the body beneath the blankets aliver saw the trapped souls being pulled back with him he heard them shouting without sound pleading with him the sight of their anguished faces was heartbreaking but he waited until the final moment to do what he had planned he felt there was only one moment that he could achieve what he wanted to just as devoths spirit began to sink back into the skin of his body aliver rushed forward he swept through the auldek with his arms outstretched filled with love and shame and grief and hope asking forgiveness for those who came before him he grabbed for the childrens souls and he pulled them all free chapter sixtyseven a cave on an outcropping of rock at the very edge of the outer isles out beyond thrain and palishdock the dark of a cloudheavy night the air and sea in furious struggle not a place many would choose to rest and yet that was what corinn and hanish knew they had to do atop po they had ranged over hundreds of miles gathering sorcerers all along the way they had pushed po to great speed over the sea leaving the santoth far behind but not so far that they would not catch up with them soon though he showed not the slightest indication of needing it po had earned a rest such as it was having furled his wings the dragon perched sentinel above them still as the wet stone and just as black corinn hoped that his wounds were healing she thought so the turmoil in his mind had grown calm damaged yes but resolved she did her best to always keep a part of her mind speaking to him and to the other dragons they were each of them faithful to her but she could feel their desire for freedom when she was gone no other would be able to keep them tamed he will warn us corinn said if they come faster than we expect hanish stood at the mouth of the cave gazing out into the night as if he were keeping his own watch i know he will he responded im not doubting him just looking is all just looking the leaning rock walls around them provided the only shelter from the heaving of waves and the wind a small fire cast their only light corinn fed it with things her servants had packed into her saddlebags a tent and its bamboo poles thick hard crackers that burned as well as wood and that she could not eat anyway rolls of parchment she would never now need the leather bags themselves my servants what would they think to see me now though she took warmth from the fire she knew she could have sat in the damp chill and not been affected by it just as she had gone days now with no food or drink she was as empty as she had ever been and yet she went on feeding on the goal she had set herself to hanish she sent the thought we have them all behind us youre sure of it yes i cant tell you how many they are their number never sets in my mind but i can feel that theyre all together they have a different energy it hums at the same tune now with only one purpose catching us exactly we have the scoundrels just where we want them then hanish said turning back toward corinn and the fire haha take that he swiped at the air with an exaggerated flourish that made corinn smile or that made her know she would have smiled had it been possible he came away from the cave mouth and settled himself beside the fire he rubbed his hands together and held them palm out toward the flames old habits corinn thought to herself are hard to break hanish said i guess thats it then we have a few hours until dawn perhaps then its nothing but the gray slopes for us have you any way of calling this worm of yours i wont need to it can hear the song even more clearly than the santoth it has been telling me as much for years i just didnt listen i suspect it already knows were coming ah so the worm is expecting us hanish said i guess its not the first time either of us has had dealings with worms no but this one i like better than senators and leaguemen its not like anything else it doesnt really talk to me thats not quite right its more like the way i communicate with po it thinks to me its very old hanish i think its something the giver made when the world was still new before elenet before any of the creatures of the land it has a quiet mind its gentle except that it knows the givers tongue is not for us to speak thats one thing that matters to it and what exactly happens when we find this creature youve not filled me in on the specifics yet i dont know corinn said this was not entirely the truth she did know the worm itself had shown her what was to happen in images that she had once thought of as nightmares now those same images were the exact fate she sought they were not however things she could say not even to hanish i think we just have to find it she said the rest will come with that all right love hanish said the rest will come with that you should sleep now if you can even just a little this next flight will be long come he indicated that she could rest her head on his lap she did so and without prompting he began to talk corinn lay watching the play of the firelight on the cave wall marveling that even nowwith everything that had happened and was happeningshe was still learning more about how to love this man how was it possible that she could rest her head on a ghosts lap and learn of things he had never told her while he lived how could she feel the warmth of him the texture of his tunic against her cheek the weight of his hand where it rested on her shoulder she tried to listen to his tales but after a while what she truly did was listen to the sound of his voice how she liked his voice it managed to be truthful but at the same denied that life was anything less than a grand amusement corinn breathed him in wishing she had some of his equanimity herself wondering if this was how she gained it by having him complete her later after hanish had fallen silent thinking her asleep corinn remembered another dream it had nothing to do with the worm she had only had it once on the morning that she had worked three acts of magic including bringing aliver back from the dead in the dream she had been riding in a carriage down from calfa ven when aaden became unwell she stepped out and walked the path to avoid smelling his stink aliver and then hanish had walked beside her for a time and then both of them had rolled into somersaults and become leaves that blew away on the breeze for some reason she had whistled a tune for them she asked are you real he still sat as before stroked her hair slowly as if counting the strands one by one yes of course are you sure you love me corinn youre the single woman who has ever had all my heart you did in life and you still did in death and you will do forever why asking it she was not seeking praise not looking for false comfort she really meant the question at times thinking of all the mistakes she had made she thought herself unlovable unworthy of anybodys trust she had proven herself that so many times in so many ways who knows why anybody loves anybody i love you for the things i love about you i love you for the things i hate about you i think corinn that you love me as well me the one who wouldve killed you dont ask me to make sense of it and i wont ask you my heart is yours for as long as you want it do you want it yes then its yours in life and in the afterdeath glad thats decided he leaned forward and kissed the damaged skin where her mouth should have been though she knew he was but a ghost a vapor that no other eyes except barads could see she still loved his touch there in that small cave at the edge of the gray slopes with her eyes closed it seemed each of his kisses glowed with golden warmth each of them a pulse of light in the midst of an ocean of darkness a s the sun broke over the eastern horizon later that morning and cast crimson highlights over the gray waves po spread his wings and lifted the couple into the sky again gaining height they saw their pursuers they still ran atop the surface of the water rising and falling with the swells unrelenting po turned and headed west before them stretched nothing at all except moving mountains of water and the rest of their lives chapter sixtyeight as soon as the vessel cleared the quay lethel called to his pilot lets go he sat on a seat he had ordered specially constructed it perched high on the sleek ships deck the perfect vantage from which to watch the lothan aklun vessel devour whatever distance he set it toward make it fast he shouted as he pulled tight the straps across his waist the pilot backed out as silently as if by sail power and yet without any sails or oars or poles the boat moved with a power infused into every portion of the craft it spun atop the water and surged forward into a curving arc that bore them away from the estate lethel had claimed on one of the craggier barrier isles it moved north around the island then turned west when the open stretch of the inner sea came into view the vessel raced smacking and leaping across the waves with a speed like nothing lethel had ever experienced he clung to his chair roaring with laughter each time the spray fanned over him he liked speed very much in no time at all the leaguemans hair was a disheveled birds nest blown back behind his pointed cranium he clutched his skullcap in his hands riding high on the exhilaration of the journey when they joined the invasion fleet the great mass of soul vessels plowed toward avina lethel had his pilot zip among the barges and larger ships at breathtaking speeds he could not help himself he laughed idiotically every spray of water that fell over him or any expected turn that yanked his body one way or another caused him to throw back his head in uncontrolled hilarity to think that the league had avoided military campaigns all these years what a waste as far as lethel was concerned this invasion was a lark they could not lose the outcome was obvious they had the troops ishtat by the thousands sire els trained army of quota slaves they had the means to deposit these troops anywhere they wished everything just as he had told dariel akaran and mor of the free people the only thing for him to do really was to enjoy it the pilot pushed them through a narrow choppy gap between two barges their ship squeezed past them and shot out ahead of the armada the coastline of avina stretched before him it shone bright in the morning light the citys drab seawall crawled with life the free people out to defend themselves lethel thought how charming they raced toward the shoreline the pilot pressed the speed so unrelentingly that lethel let go of his cap and gripped the seat beneath him his cap flew away in the wind the pilot wrenched the boat to the left at what must have been the last possible moment water sprayed up from the side of the boat drenching the breakwater and washing well up onto the quay that ran along the base of the citys walls the flat stone ledge would make a wonderful platform on which to deposit their soldiers the boat sped along it sending up a spray of water the whole way the speed was such that lethels eyes watered in the wind he still managed to look up at the figures on the wall beside them a few of the figures threw stones at him but none of them gauged the speed right in response lethel waved a chastising finger at them a little later back out toward the rear of the fleet now he sat watching from a safe distance he spotted the large schooner that sires faleen and el had chosen for the occasion at least he thought he should call it a schooner it hardly looked like one in his understanding of the term but for pure size and carrying capacity he thought the term fit multistoried outfitted for pleasure the ship crawled with ishtat guards staffers hangerson and concubines el when he arrived with his army had done the leaguemen the service of bringing a great number of these with him most of them it seemed hung about the upper decks of the schooner theyre hardly even paying attention lethel muttered he waved a hand trying to catch someones attention so that he could point at the attack which had commenced he did not try for long the proceedings proved too interesting to be distracted from them the barges approached the shore first though massive packed with soldiers and ballistae battering rams and movable towers their draft was so shallow they could press right up to the quay with the water beneath them only on the height of three or four men it would be as if the barges had simply added a wide extension to the shoreline one filled to the brim with soldiers the barges halted a little distance from the quay the large ballistae with their mortarpunching missiles cranked back when they shot the barbed bolts flew with blurred speed they slammed into the stone walls with explosive thuds sinking deep and sending shards of rubble into the air each bolt was attached to a length of rope trailing back toward the barges more and more of the missiles struck home soldiers fastened the trailing end to anchors jutting from the barges then they reloaded and shot still more missiles the fools on the wall hunkered down they cowered each time a missile sent up clouds of debris do you know nothing lethel asked having been briefed just the previous day on how the attack would proceed he knew that it was not the impact of weapons they had to fear it was what they did next once enough of the bolts were set the ballistae stopped firing normally lethel had learned winches would crank back on those ropes the lines going taut would pull the missiles which in turn would cause the barbed points of them to expand inside the stone pulling down sections of the wall for the invaders to clamor over into the city normally this winching was a slow process dangerous for the attackers because of the tension in the ropes and the possibility of mechanical failure but these were not normal circumstances today the barges simply backed away from the shore the ropes went from drooping lengths to straight taut cords all along the expanse of the wall lethel watched the chaos that ensued through a small spyglass in some spots single blocks crashed down in others the wall buckled and weakened before the prong fell free whole sections of wall crumbled toward the sea in an avalanche of stone blocks debris and screaming free people lethel set down his spyglass and clapped his hands he yanked it up to view again where was dariel akaran along that wall where was mor or the bird woman or anybody else he recognized the confusion was considerable he could not make sense of what the defenders were doing like so many ants responding to the destructive pressure of a boys foot swarming running in circles he thought of calling for a larger spyglass but with the pitching of the boat he would not be able to keep anyone in focus the barges approached the wall for a second round as with the first the poor defenders could do nothing but scurry about or cower the walls came tumbling down as they should they were unforgivably ugly the lothan aklun having feared the sea had looked away from it they left the shoreline drab and unfinished not a facade at all the wall more resembled the dingy rear of a city let the entire thing fall the league would redesign the coastline to wonderful effect avina would become one of the worlds premier trading cities a powerhouse for a nation that the league would rebuild to suit them why am i so far back lethel wondered he shouted over his shoulder for the pilot to move them in the boat closed some of the distance so that he had an improved view when the barges pushed forward a third time they smacked right up against the quay stopped dead there the first contingent of soldiers jumped the narrow gap they poured onto the platform and clambered over the rubble the defenders to their credit rushed down to meet them they seemed in their exuberance to forget that they were supposed to stay safely in the city they brought the fight out to the quay itself only the early ranks of the troops could engage but that was perfect the first ashore would batter the defenders into bloody heaps until they surrendered or fled lethel rather hoped they would do the latter let them run through the city streets ishtat in pursuit slaughter every last one of them for all he cared they did not need them in the coming years the league could repopulate the city as they saw fit just as they would rebuild it to suit them crumbled walls massacred rebels it was all messy at the moment but to build a sturdy foundation one always began with a bit of demolition lethel still could not find the akaran he did focus in on one individual who seemed to be directing the defense but it was not dariel his hair was darker than the princes an unruly mop clinging to his head after pointing and shouting and gesticulating for a time he dove down into the melee below the wall lethel assumed that the sound when he first noticed it was coming from the besieged city itself he had experienced an earthquake once while staying along the talayan coast and the strangeness in the air reminded him of the odd moments that preceded the earth shaking he yanked the spyglass up expecting to see the entirety of the wall come tumbling down or something like that it did not the fighting just continued what happened next did not so much frighten lethel as perplex him to his core the humming grew louder he wrinkled his forehead making the thin slashes of his plucked eyebrows into two squiggles the fighting figures stopped they must have heard it too and then the sea it went flat not calm but completely flat the entire undulating surface of the water became as featureless as polished stone lethel saw this all clearly especially when his vantage point shifted he soared up from the deck so fast he left his gasp at water level his seat came with him ripped free of the vessel he hung in the air with a view of the sea beneath him craning his head around he saw that all the thousands of soldiers on the transports likewise floated in the air the leaguemen and staffers and concubines turned circles their arms and legs waving about them in a slow pantomime of panic how unusual lethel thought sure that nothing like this had been included in his briefing there followed a moment of stillness and then the world changed the soul vessels concussed with a sudden explosion of pressure except that it was not really an explosion it was soundless there was no flame or smoke no flying debris only a flash and ripple in the fabric of the world in an instant the vessels all disappeared lethels ship vanished beneath him as did the frigates and schooners and brigs as did all the barges they just ceased to be just afterward all the hovering peoplethousands of themsplashed down into the sea as he hit the surface losing control of his bodily functions on impact lethel was certain this had not been mentioned in his briefing nobody had said anything about this chapter sixtynine the next couple of days brought a steady inflow of troops coming onto the plateau not just soldiers the new arrivals included the young and the old women bakers and cooks merchants offering their wares laborers offering their bodies for whatever work needed to be done it looked gloriously as if the people of the empire all came to aid the war effort bringing whatever they could with them aliver had known from his connection to them that this was happening as he spoke to them about why and how to overcome the addiction to the vintage he challenged them not to lose their sense of purpose clearly they had not elder anath and sinper and ioma ou of bocoum appeared they came riding in a covered carriage that looked most out of place on the plateau among the dreary disarray of a growing war camp they petitioned for a meeting with aliver the king allowed it but he kept it brief he could see these men wanted only to ingratiate themselves with him to play up their role in getting shen back to him and find some way to turn all this turmoil to their benefit aliver gave them nothing once he was gone they would grab for power and influence through their connection with shen he had already done the best he could to leave a legacy behind him in that locked box back in alecia he gave rialus neptos more of his time for the things he had to say had more bearing on his present actions beyond that he decided to speak to no one but those he needed to help him end this war the auldek approached as well before them freketes swooped through the air calling taunts from a distance they did not come very close the dragons had only to lift off the ground to drive them back the invading army crept over the horizon one morning and by midday had paused to make their camp that was it they were in place the tundra between them would be their battlefield the meeting aliver had arranged with devoth would happen tomorrow before the two hosts both of them ready for battle when kelis arrived tired from running across the mainland his friend naamen with him aliver could not have been more ready for them i need your help aliver said each of you i need you to fight with me in a way you have not before he stood before the small group he had summoned to meet him mena kelis naamen perrin haleeven rialus what i say here is for now to stay among this company i am going to ask something of you that few others would understand and im going to ask it for a goal not many would imagine possible mena knows what i intend she is a skeptic which i understand still she helped me choose each of you for this mena herself has dreamtalked with her sisters spirit before perrin mena tells me you dont know this but you were kind enough to offer your body as a spirit vessel the young officer could not have looked more perplexed corinn also reached you rialus over a great distance you must be sensitive to the spirit world kelis you were born with powers over dreams with gifts outside the waking world naamen few people have spent as much time with sorcery in the air around them as you and haleeven i believe your people for generations knew much about conversing with the dead the old mein nodded its those traits in each of you that i want to use before i tell you what i want us to do i should tell you why i want us to do it he sat down to be closer to the others i am going to make peace with the auldek no rialus barked and then surprised by his own outburst asked much more quietly what did you say aliver repeated it he saw exactly the concern and doubt he had expectedand which he had received from mena as well as with her he took some time to explain himself making it clear that he did not mean surrender or defeat in any way he intended for both sides to gain much more in the agreement than they would lose by continuing to fight by the time he finished the concern and doubt had moved around on all their faces it remained but in differing proportions on each of them rialus was again the first to find his tongue your majesty this this cannot happen even if we offer it they will never accept you dont know them as i do they are fearless ruthless they have no respect for life not their own or anybodys i saw them eat human flesh why did they eat flesh rialus i told you shocked again by his outburst he said your majesty i explained earlier they thought it would make them fertile they wanted to have children they are so obsessed with with life thats what theyre obsessed with they are not casual about life they hunger for it more than anything else they want to be parents wouldnt you say that rialus thought for a moment he seemed reluctant about the answer he came up with yes but they want war and conquest murder just as much they are vile just vile they are not just vile there is more to them than that if you cannot see that then you have only one of two choices destroy them or be destroyed by them i want more than two choices rialus you yourself told me the auldek once built magnificent cities you said they sing poems of love and tell tales of valor you said that they trained birds to dance about them to land even in their mouths you said that in their country eating human flesh was a crime and you said rialus that you were certain that their codes of honor mean more to them than ours do to us im sorry to use your own testimony against you but the race you described to me was not entirely vile and the part of it that is most vilethe ways they use our people as slaves body and soul that is something we partnered with them on rialus shook his head i pray you destroy them all i pray for something better aliver said menas young officer perrin spoke for the first time if we do make peace with them whats to stop them from becoming our enemies again sometime theyve suffered coming over here we made sure of it he glanced down at his hands which were wrapped with layers of new bandages frostbite suffered on the long run south with the auldek tormenting them he had lost parts of all his fingers he knew something about suffering though it barely showed on his boyish face what a group we are aliver thought perrin with his hands two bandaged mallets kelis with one hand part flesh and part metal naamen born with one stunted arm small of stature rialus sniffling through his peeling nose his eyes darting about nervous as a mouse haleeven once an enemy now a grave face watching him from the back of the small group and mena bruised and battered her shoulder wrapped and arm in a sling ready to shake free of it and bring up a sword again at a moments notice an extraordinary group but what about in ten years perrin asked twenty who is to say they wont come at us again i would not want future generations to have to face them because we didnt nor would i but it may also be that a future generation will find them to be friends i am an idealist perrin have you heard that about me the young man smiled nodded what else can i do but provide the possibility of us all finding our better natures haleeven sitting behind most of the others said i can testify that such a thing is possible enemies may become friends lest he sound wistful he carried on more sharply but will our soldiers accept this all these people theyve come to fight havent they they came to live they came because living meant they might have to fight its the peace they want though not the war that precedes it if we can end this honorably of course the troops will support it perhaps in the future some will find cowardice in the act but i hope they will see inspiration instead mena and rialusperhaps you as well perrin haleeventhink that the auldek will accept nothing but victory on their terms right now today thats probably true but by tomorrow if you help me i believe we can have them thinking differently will you help me as nobody objected aliver explained it as best he could t hey think youre crazy mena said once the others had exhausted their questions talked it all through and then walked mystified out into the fading day aliver smiled yes but they will get past that soon before i got here they thought you were the crazy one he caught the first scent of the dinner stew that made him smile as well he could count the time he had left alive on his fingers and toes and yet he still knew hunger when his belly was empty how is elya he asked mena nodded much better i think she is healed as much as she is going to she is strong everywhere except the wing that the frekete chewed on im not sure why i think she could heal it if she wanted to but i dont know i may be imagining it i may be thinking of myself instead but i feel like the intent of the wound is what she fears it was too malicious she was not meant to be attacked like that with time aliver asked she will heal that too yes i think so we will have to be far from here though has she warmed to her children no mena said i know she recognizes them she stares at them they approach often but she hisses them away theyre so much bigger than she but they fear her corinn took them from her i dont know if i can forgive her for that aliver closed his eyes he nodded and exhaled a breath and said i know with the hand of her good arm mena rubbed her injured shoulder it too was healed she said but only as healed as it could be that arm had tried to leave her body several times already the first when she was a girl being pummeled by the surf in vumu hand clenched around a sword too heavy for her to even lift at that point the shoulder was healed by elyas touch but that did not mean it had not been damaged by time and abuse mena aliver said i am going to die you told me that already but i dont need to believe it until it happens sire dagon is a liar i would not trust him to tell me whether it was snowing outside or not youve changed mena before you came up here you would not have talked of snow you would have said i would not trust him to tell me whether it was raining outside or not we knew so little of snow on acacia just that one time really thats the only snow i remember he cleared his throat then coughed for a bit by the time he quieted the memory had passed i can feel it believe me ive been to death already i know what it feels like as it approaches im not scared i do wish i had he stopped himself cut the words with the side of his hand and pushed them away with the flat of it its hard not to talk of regrets but i wont waste of time regret he sat forward and took her hands in his mena i am constantly asking myself if i could live in a world in which the auldek are at peace with us can i find a way to get beyond the crimes theyve done and the suffering theyve caused can i do all the things that come after this war ends in peace between us its not easy to imagine he looked at her a long moment when i ask these things the answer i come back with is yes yes of course yes i would be a fool to let even one more good person die if he or she didnt have to thats what tyrants do not kings the thing is i wont be living in that world so then i ask the same questions but thinking about the world youll live on in and aaden and shen do you know what happens to my answer it changes it becomes an even firmer yes i dont just think you could live in that world i think you should i think it will be a world to be proud of thats a lot to ask of me mena its not the only thing im going to ask of you both corinn and i we expect a great deal from you l ater that night aliver once more rose up from his sleeping body he floated through the top of his tent and hovered in the air above it for a time he paused there alone the world quiet around him save wolves howling somewhere in the distance he knew he was not alone when he heard menas voice saying that she was here a little later haleeven found them and then perrin glowing bright as he moved toward them soon they were all there with him beautiful spirit selves pure energy and light hovering about the earth all right aliver said come harvesting with me come you will like this work remember we are not killing we are setting innocents free come harvesting souls with me so saying he led them north toward the sleeping auldek chapter seventy amazing corinn thought how different one wave can look from another she would never have believed it before but after days on the wing with only water beneath them she began to see waves that seethed and waves that crested ones that bulged in soft mounds and others that cut like blades some smooth and black as stone others foaming and hissing some cut diagonally against the others some changed their character and shading right before her eyes and some rose like mountain peaks so vast that they changed the air currents above them and had po struggling to maintain his course the range corinn thought dariel saw this before i did amazing also how much the sea thronged with life yes there were great lifeless and gray swaths of sea but so too were there times when schools of fish rose to the surface in such massive numbers they became the world she watched shoals of silverfish paint swirls and shimmers dancing as predators cut through them for the greater part of a morning they flew over floating islands of sea fronds so thick that creatures lived atop them running from pos shadow like tiny antelopes one night the glow of life under the sea outdid the shining of the stars and once she watched the illuminated outlines of a pod of whales large and ghostly moving with a stately grace at the back edge of all this wonder ran their hunters pressing ever onward sometimes they too seemed like giants striding ocean miles with each step but other times they were only men tiny men in an ocean that dwarfed them po stayed beyond the reach of their sorcery but corinn heard them speaking to her for a time they tried to convince her to stop running they must have the book but once they did they claimed they would heal her make her mouth right they would study the song with her though she knew better there was something powerfully persuasive about them strange how narrow the line between their warm soothing voices and their evil truth was the intent behind both was the same strong in a way that had a similar essence she never let herself believe them it helped that hanish was there whispering warnings keeping her true to her course eventually they dropped the pretense and taunted her instead they would never tire they said she had already failed she had already led them back into the world she could not stand against them she was not tinhadin she had not his strength she had not his mouth they would chase her right around the world if they had to she could not outfly them they would catch her tomorrow or the next day but they would catch her the song is ours its already ours your days are few she did not know if they said that because they knew about the poison in her or because they intended to make sure of that themselves she gave them no response hanish did not even talk anymore he just rested his chin on her shoulder and watched the same watery world that she did that was all right there was nothing more to say they just flew a nd then came the day they were searching for the sea beneath them suddenly thronged with creatures one moment it was empty the next white leviathans clamored at the surface hundreds of them enormous creatures that she had only seen in paintings paintings that at the time she had assumed were touched by fancy sea wolves hanish said po did not like them at first he roared at them thinking them some new curse of the santoths corinn calmed him careful not to let him see the images she had of what was to come she had him bank into a wide circle looping around and around above the water why are you doing that i dreamed it ah she knew that hanish had a quip to follow but he held it in i dreamed it since that was so she did the only thing she could she did what had been shown to her already in the dream she flew that circle taking po lower and lower as she did each time she came around she saw the santoth on the horizon but closing on them they had not been part of the dream but they would be part of the reality the sea wolves did something hanish found very strange what in the givers name he murmured corinn expected it though they copied pos circular motion they drew tighter going around and around beneath them they swam with a strange pulsing motion twisting over one another ghostly white tentacled with eyes that watched the dragon fly above them hard to separate one from another the tighter they got the more that became the case they are his searchers corinn said thats all they were ever doing searching for the song of elenet anytime ships passed near them by the time pos wingtip skimmed the surface they were so close together there was no water visible between them and when corinn asked po to land on them the bodies of the strange leviathans congealed together forming a circular flat surface on which to land it took some convincing to get the dragon to do it in the end he did it only because she promised him he could fly away as soon as she and hanish were down pos feet danced across the surface it was flat and strangely smooth but it was made of great seacrusted white bodies entwined tentacles and large eyes that stared up at them po only stayed touching them for the time it took for corinn to gather the song of elenet from a saddlebag and climb down then he lifted into the air barking as he did so it was a strange noise one she had not heard him make before for some reason she knew what it meant he was telling her to be quick he did not like this place and wanted to go hanish stood beside her what now corinn now we call for the worm she had wondered how he would respond to this when he did she knew he had done so perfectly all right i hope its quick he dipped his head in the direction of the santoth who were tall figures now slashing the air as they ran sending sprays of water up from their feet corinn held the book out before her she ran her palms over the aged leather of its cover her fingers caressed the frayed leaves of its pages as she did so she felt the creature wake he was somewhere far below them embedded in the depths of the ocean floor come ive brought it what it sent back to her was not an image or a clear thought certainly not words it was a feeling it was the sensation of a massive body peeling away from the bottom turning upward in the blackness and writhing in great sweeps of its gargantuan length its coming she opened her eyes the first thing she saw was hanish standing just before her his gray eyes there to meet her gaze i could not have done this without you you could have he said but im glad you didnt have to the santoth were much nearer they stood even taller their elongated forms stretching far up into sky their churning arms cut through the clouds she could hear them now singing themselves faster and faster hungrier than ever for the book that was so near corinn opened it and pulling her gaze away from the sorcerers she began to read the song bloomed inside her it twined and danced about her it wrapped her and hanish in ribbons of energy it sped the santoth on and it snapped through the tail of the creature below them driving it upward when the santoth reached them it looked as if they would arrive in massive stature stamping the strange platform down into the water they held to that size until the last moment po had to pull back roaring at them just as their feet touched the sea wolves the santoth shrank the entire stretched length of their bodies pulled in so that they stepped onto the platform the size of normal men cloaked dull figures old and ravaged by time and evil and desolation their eyes bulged and trembled with intensity give it to me nualo extended his hand give it to me looking at his cracked aged hand corinn realized what the last thing leeka had tried to say to her and aliver was they cannot take it from me i have to give it to them they stood there ranked in front of her like starving men before a feast she held in her hands and they could do nothing for a sliver of a moment corinn rejoiced if they could not take it from her she could keep it they did not have the power over her that they claimed she could and then that brief madness was gone she could not keep it she had not the life to use it anymore and even now surrounded by the threads of beauty that still swam around her she knew the song should not be sung by any human mouth never again you cannot have it she said none of us can this ends now here nualos face bunched with rage he raked up a curse from deep within him but before he could utter it the worm arrived as when she had envisioned it swallowing the whole of the isle of acacia the creatures mouth was enormous it emerged under a great swell of seawater a wide ring that took in everything the sea wolves the people standing on them the sea around them the mouth rose around them all it stretched upward stories upon stories tall a wall so dripping with water and encrusted with barnacles and hanging with tendrils of seaweed that corinn could only take in the vastness of it with no greater understanding of exactly what it was the strong aquatic smell of it drenched the air and still it rose the santoth tried to leap away they roared their anger and slashed out with their foul sorcery nualo clawed for the book begging corinn to give it to him she yanked it from his grasp when the sea wolves beneath him fell away he splashed down among them bellowing curses the sea wolves loosed their tight weave and sent the sorcerers down to thrash among their tentacles and the great rolling heave of their bodies only the sea wolves directly beneath corinn stayed together the queen pressed the book to her chest and looked at hanish he stared back he reached out and took one of her hands the two of them stood like that the only stillness in all that great commotion his mouth opened as if to say something but instead of speaking he smiled of all the things he could have said and done that smile was perfect it was sad resigned and yet also confident somehow it conveyed that this was as it had to be the best of all possible outcomes it said that what they went to now was nothing to fear then the creatures mouth closed around them all it stopped its upward thrust and slowly heavily fell back into the sea above the churning froth into which it sank the dragon po circled for a time crying out his distress circling as the sea went calm beneath him as the waves rolled on and the wind until there was nothing but the sea chapter seventyone standing alone in the dressing room he had been provided dariel listened to the murmur of the gathering crowd he could not help but remember the multitude of voices he had sensed inside that glowing wall on lithram len it was the same sound in so many ways except that here out in the main courtyard of avina the masses gathered in exuberant joy they had mouths to speak with hands to clap free will to move themselves through the world they had life to rejoice in now more than ever such had not been the case with the spirits trapped through the sorcery that encased them in that wall and somehow connected them to all the accursed soul vessels dariel did not expect to ever understand it entirely he hoped he wouldnt understanding the sorcery was the very thing that drove the lothan aklun to acts of revenge that had enslaved the entire worldthemselves along with itfor generations better just to know that his bow of reverence had placed the raised rune on his forehead into the engraving meant to receive it his living tissue touched that strange glowing matter a key that was what na gamen had given him a key that unlocked that cage of souls freeing all the spirits that the lothan aklun had used to power their vessels the moment it was done the glowing wall had gone dark silent motionless he had felt a concussion of energy but it had come from elsewhere in that small chamber the cage of souls simply ceased to be and the enslaved vanished into freedom i freed them dariel said or you freed them that was another thing that he was going to have to learn to live with that he and na gamen would share his soul for as long as they both lived on inside dariels mortal body acknowledging that dariel said we freed them bashar brushed his leg he stroked the hound still a pup but tall enough already that dariel did not need to bend to reach him all lean muscle and bone hunters the ridge running against the grain up his back bristled stronger than ever he looked at cashen who lay watching them the pup thumped his tail considering the massive pads of their paws dariel had finally come to believe birke had not exaggerated the hounds would be enormous and they would be there soon dariel repeated we freed them yes a voice said we did mor stood in the open doorway in silhouette against the light behind her dariel could not see her face but he knew her form and her voice she walked in more beautiful now as the lamplight illuminated her you look good in these clothes she reached for the collar of his new linen cloak tugged it around a bit seemed to like it even better are you ready dariel said he was but mor did not move to lead him to the meeting being held in his honor she stared at his face tattooed just like hers she stared at his forehead which no longer had the rune embossed on it his skin was as smooth as it had been before the sky watcher took the stylus to it the key once used vanished along with the soul vessels at least youll always have these shivith markings mor said and ill never forget who drew them under my skin dariel responded rather painful as i recall mor ducked her head a moment laughed weve come a long way dariel akaran ill tell you something she leaned in a little closer and whispered i am a woman who finds beauty first in other women that is just the way i am but if i did like men i might come to you to explore it dariel was glad she pulled back his face had flushed and he feared if she kept studying him so closely his cheek might start to twitch i never told you what na gamen told me at the sky mount mor said strolling away and running her finger across a nearby desk i didnt doubt him but i didnt want to accept it either first he said you had a destiny here he said your story whether it ended well or ill would be the story of our nation as well i told him i despised the blood in your veins do you know what he told me what that it was your akaran blood that made greatness in you possible i thought that was foolishness but the more ive thought about the many things he showed me the more i believe he could not complete his work without an akarans blessing does that sound right dariel nodded mor did as well the second thing was that he confirmed that my brothers spirit force was still inside devoth buried deep he said it was close to his true self i had always thought my memory of that was true and it was she picked up a stylus and felt the grain of the wooden handle he said that if i went in search of himto kill himi might succeed but that i might not get back to ushen brae he said i could have revenge or a future among the people he did not think that i could have both she hit the stylus against the palm of one hand for a time stopped glanced down and seemed surprised that she even held it which do you want more i wanted each more than the other but i had sworn to fight for the free people i thought that once we had won i would track devoth to the ends of the earth and cut each soul out of him until i found ravi i would have done it i believe that i would have but now i dont have to ravis been released released how do you know i felt it happen i always felt his life force dariel every day since he was taken from me ive known that he still lived trapped you once called me cranky you would be too if you had to live with that she tossed the stylus back onto the desk anyway i felt his soul go free i dont know how it happened i dont know if devoth is dead i only know that it was a different thing from what you did with the soul vessels somehow over there in your lands ravi found peace i n the high hall a short time later mor led dariel to the gathered council of elders yoen and the other elders stood waiting for him they had arrived the day before having trekked all the way from the sky isle on the news that dariel had been accepted as the rhuin fa little did they know that as they journeyed a short crucial war would unfold little did they know they would arrive in a city rejoicing with the league defeated at the moment that the soul vessels vanished a great number of the invaders had drowned but others were plucked from the water prisoners now locked away and awaiting their fate mor waved dariel into the circle of elders he stood feeling awkward before them he knew them all if only from his brief time at the sky isle perhaps it was the new garments it had been some time since he had worn clean clothes with sharp creases and fine stitching or maybe it was the crowd gathered in the squares just below them he could hear them even better now the sound drifting through the large open balcony windows at the far end of the room it was heady stuff to be a hero to so many people heady enough to make young spratling nervous dariel thought it might also be that the chamber contained a solemn air he had not expected everyone gazed at him the elders near at hand mor and skylene tunnel and birke and all the people he had become so close to here in ushen brae a little farther back stood melio and clytus geena and the others who had come so far to find him all of them safe and well largely unscarred by the skirmishes they had fought so that he could complete his part in this story they stared at him too he got the feeling everyone knew something that he did not i have a story to tell you yoen said he spoke to dariel but he lifted his voice for everyone to hear its a true story true stories do not always make the best ones but this one is pretty good many many years ago hundreds of years during the early days of the free peoples settlement at the sky lake he cut in on himself to say this was before my time in case you are wondering he waited as the polite laughter faded he was just as frail looking as before his hair still disheveled in contrast to the care taken with his long robe his limp had increased the product no doubt of the journey he leaned heavily on his cane one day a lothan aklun found the settlement he continued the people were shocked because no lothan aklun had ever come searching for them before not even the auldek had ranged that far they need not have been alarmed though the lothan aklun was not hunting them he was on a mission he told them that he had come to hate his peoples ways he was taking his quota childrenboth those inside him and those living through their years beside himup into seclusion in rath batatt you know this man it was na gamen before he went he gave the villagers something he took from his wrist a bracelet made of pure precious gold he said that it was not actually a bracelet it was an armband that had been worn by the first quota child he had come to love as his own i called it a tuvey band though in truth it was just a childs trinket he gave it to us and he also gave us a sapling from a tree of your lands dariel an acacia tree he planted the tree and slipped the band around it he told those free people that one day the quota trade would end one day a person would come to us who had the power to change everything a good person a kingly person a man or a woman with a pure heart and noble intent this person would have the power to release our trapped spirits he said that on that daywhen we knew this person had arrivedwe should build a great fire around that tree a beacon to announce the freeing of the world when it died down we were to retrieve the band from the ashes and see if it still held its shape we did as he asked us to we left the band around the trunk of that small tree waiting for the day we could build that fire a lovely idea but it did not go as anyone wished the wait was to be longer than we could have known not a lifetime or two many more than that that sapling became a tree generations lived and died the tree got thicker stretched taller years passed the ring grew tight around the trunk and then the tree lifted the ring into the air still longer it took so long that the tree swallowed the band and grew around it the band went hidden for generations the world turned so long that i was born and you were as well dariel and everyone else in this room and out in the courtyard there the old man pointed to the great balcony that opened above the gathered crowd he had been strolling in circles as he talked his eyes drifting gentle everywhere they touched they came back to dariel now do you know the tree im speaking of remembering the sacred acacia he had seen from the hillside above the village by the sky lake dariel nodded before we came here we burned it we believed in you dariel akaran it appears that we were right to and look what we found in the ashes yoen had paused behind a small table atop which a simple box sat dariel had not noticed it before yoen opened it reached in and lifted out a thin circlet of twisted gold he walked toward dariel holding it high for all to see it began as a childs armband he said now it looks rather more like a crown he paused before dariel the band was but a simple circlet no stones set in it no engravings the only feature enhancing the gold beauty of it was the waves that years inside the tree must have bent into it its beautiful the prince said yoen agreed none here dispute it you are our savior dariel you are the one who came to free us the rhuin fa this band is yours to do with as you wish i hope that you do something wise with it he pushed the band from his fingers into dariels this is not for me its too precious we believe it is yours it was always yours you may even slip it atop your head if you wish and ask the people to accept your leadership i believe they would holding the warped and stretched banda childs bracelet that had grown inside an acacia treedariel absorbed what was being offered it was there in the curves of the band it was in yoens eyes looking around the circle of elders and beyond them to his companionsboth the new ones and the oldthey all waited for him it was up to him to say whether he wanted to ask the people to make him king of ushen brae the headiness of this dizzied him he stood with his mind racing out across the great continent he had only seen a portion of he thought about the glowing ruins of amratseer and the jagged peaks of rath batatt and the wild rapids of the sheeven lek he remembered names of places he had heard of but had never seen by the giver he might rebuild the ancient city of lvinreth he had never seen it but the notion of a whiterocked city carved into the far north a place where snow lions roamed the streets beside people it took his breath away he could be king and he could create a culture different from anything in the known world better fairer a dream of a nation like one aliver might have imagined perhaps one day he and birke would climb into rath batatt with bashar and cashen they would go hunting wandering until they found whatever wonders lay beyond that range of mountains it would be a magnificent life only he searched out melios face saw him watching concern on his features clytus as well geena even kartholome if they had not come for him he might have answered yoen differently he might have grasped for a magnificent life in ushen brae but they had come and that life could not be they had come to take him home to acacia to wren if she lived and he could get back to her he would never let her go again never he had to go back he had to sail with melio beside him hoping that the future included him being uncle to the child melio wanted to have with mena no i cant accept this he looked around at the silent people watching him i love the free people he said i have learned to love ushen brae and i could not be more thankful for the gifts youve given me buthis gaze settled on mori must go home he walked to mor and pushed the crown into her hands if this is mine to do with what i wish i give it to mor why not a queen instead of a king a mother for the nation go ask the crowd what they think of that when mor looked down stunned by the treasure in her hands dariel turned and walked away in the hush his steps sounded loud on the marble slabs he did not look back though he badly wanted to he wanted to see mor stepping into the light of day crown in hand to ask the people to name their future he pictured it in his mind he saw it that way and walked with the vision in his minds eye knowing it was a fine vision a truly fine vision he was into the hallway and down it some ways before his steps slowed he wanted to go back what was he doing he loved this place if he had come here under different terms he might have stayed forever but he had been away from home too long he did not want to forget the ones he loved over there no he had to go he had to go home he got a few steps farther before he heard the eruption of cheers from the square he kept walking embarrassed lest anybody see the tears suddenly washing his face a good effort but he did not get far he stopped again he leaned against a wall and watched the world go liquid he was not even sure why he was crying whether it was for this place or the other whether from sadness or joy he listened to the hush and burst of cheers to the gaps during which one or another person spoke he could not hear what they were saying but he was happy for them the free people were becoming a nation the children who had been stolen had finally dariel he began to walk again but with blurred vision he was not sure which columned passage would take him out anira caught up to him as he hesitated he tried to turn his face from view she caught his chin has anyone told you what rhuin fa means she asked they did not say so before because it might have affected your decisions you had to be pure and to do what you would of your own accord the moment she said this dariel realized that he did know what the title meant he just had not thought about it since na gamen gifted him with the lothan aklun language he knew though he knew before anira even said it dariel it means the one who closes the circle she shook him gently she moved her face close to his and kissed him it was not a sensual gesture it was just a gift between two friends do you hear me the one who closes the circle rhuin fa do you hear them theyre calling for you i think some of them want to go home with you i think many of them want to go home with you they want a big big league boat they want you to captain it and to take them home chapter seventytwo theyre not bad young ones delivegu said didnt talk much at first but they loosened up as we traveled get them talking about warfare and theyll chew your ear off i mean that literally he mussed the unruly black hair of the boy beside him aliver smiled at the gesture there was a fatherly sincerity to it that he had to acknowledge he had always thought delivegu a swaggering braggart though he had not managed to say so while still bound by corinns magic delivegu still had a swagger but he had done what aliver requested he had reached them last night in time perhaps for his mission to make a difference in what happened today thank you delivegu aliver said you have done well the numrek children stood in a nervous cluster around the senivalian the eldest was in his early teens the youngest looked to be five or six aliver could not be sure if their ages matched their appearance but he thought so he saw in the older boys the flame of newfound rebelliousness in the younger children the staring eyes of ones so frightened by the world that they could not look away from it even for a moment they were just children his enemys children but still just children he counted seven of them just like the number in keliss dream he recalled that kelis had called them his children he had dreamed that aliver had seven children here they were he thought what if shen had been captured like this aaden it was not a farfetched thought in a world in which the auldek fought this war to victory his own dear ones would be at the mercy of his enemies as these were i mean you no harm aliver said i know harm was done to you i think perhaps that you saw what my sister did to your parents back in teh i am sorry for that i hope that you live long lives and that the years as they pass blur that memory i cant undo it any more than you can undo the crimes that drove the queen to feel the wrath she did that day do you know why she was so angry because your parents conspired to kill her son that more than anything drove her to the madness you watched i understand that madness but i want no part of it myself i have a child too that last statement stopped him whatever he was going to follow it with flew out of his mind he sat a moment looking from one childs face to anothers searching for what he had been about to say he did not find it i have a child too was not the beginning of a thought it was the conclusion of it would you like to see ushen brae aliver asked it took some time to get them to respond with delivegu helping all of them eventually said they did want to see ushen brae its a foreign land to you and it wont be as it was when your parents left this they did not have any response to why should they they did not know ushen brae they did know acacia though and this place had not been kind to them if the auldek will have you would you go to them the answers came back faster this time yes of course they would rising aliver moved toward the tent flap he paused at it and said i will try to send you home its not up to me but i will try t he mass of troops collected a few hundred paces behind them was an impressive force aliver only glanced at them though he had no desire to see the thousands of warriors and hundreds of beasts and machines of war arrayed against him his own army had grown just as massive the united humanity of the known world stood rank upon rank behind him people from all the provinces with all their various languages and traits and characteristics they would fight and die today just as the auldek forces would for different reasons but with the same ferocity corinns dragons would take to the air the freketes would do the same this day could become an unimaginable bloody conflagration the wood was all stacked the torch had only to be touched to the fuel or not so he kept his attention on the delegation just in front of him devoth sabeer and the other clan chieftains stood a few strides away aliver had only seen them as spirit people glowing and transparent still he knew the figures who stood before him now were not as they had been but a few days ago the defiance in devoths laugh just a few nights before the confidence the certainty of knowing that death was far removed from them it was all gone their faces looked haggard stunned their eyes drooped with fatigue mena stared at them as if she did not even recognize them behind him and his sister aliver had brought a small contingent the handful who had done the spirit work with him the night before it fell to him to complete this to succeed or fail but it felt very good to have those trusted friends behind him both groups were unarmed having set their weapons on the ground before drawing near each other if the auldek attacked them he and his people would die again if that happened he would have failed and there would be nothing more he could do about it devoth spoke first what have you done to us he asked speaking acacian nothing unjust aliver said he spoke without a hint of bravado without derision or anger managing to sound both firm and empathetic it was not a tone of voice he had to work hard to master it was simply how he felt you awoke the other morning feeling different didnt you you didnt speak of it to the others because you felt weak you felt frightened in a way you never have before or at least a way you dont remember ever having felt before no devoth grumbled though his eyes were savage his no came out strangely passive he denied it he also wanted to hear more the others did as well you were alone then aliver continued but when all the auldek woke this morning they felt the same as you they might not have said as much i know you are a proud people and what could you say when you could not explain why the world feels different to you today from yesterday i can explain it for i had a hand in it do you want to know what weve done to you we have already asked you to tell us sabeer said has devoth told you of the peace that i proposed yes sabeer answered have you also heard it in your dreamsfrom me or from one of these here behind me the silence they responded with was answer enough the peace i offered is still what i offer today i swear to it before my god the giver who i believe created this world the visitors that you had in your dreams they were also real they took my message to you they also took something from you they took back what you never should have stolen they took from you and released into death the souls you had eaten thats why the world feels different to you today today you have all woken up mortal you have only the life you were born with inside you only that single transparent fragile soul stands between you and the afterdeath the other auldek stared at him their faces like masks they looked standing so still and vacant like they were already dead aliver almost smiled you would think id killed you already i havent im the one counting down his last breaths hurry lets complete this you have stolen our lives from us devoth whispered no you stole them from the children we sent you your sin was taking them inside yourself ours was sending them to you in the first place these last nights we worked to end both your sin and ours you stole from us devoth said we made you auldek again aliver said you dont even remember what you used to be once you were mortal you dont remember that but back thenbefore you sold yourselves to the lothan aklunyou were truly auldek you lived and died you married and had children i know these things about you rialus neptos told you of us he also told us of you devoth did not glance at the thin acacian sabeer did though she pinned him with her eyes without even turning aliver knew rialus squirmed beneath the gaze you loved life and feared death and that is what living is life is given to us only as a temporary thing all of us who can think know we live on borrowed time thats the beauty of it we have to live now for it will soon be gone you lost that and then you forgot that you lost it we have given it back to you its a gift from us to you i know that you intended to die back to your true soul here in the known world thats part of what you came for you would have killed or enslaved us first but i cannot allow that so take the gifts we have given you leave the rest leave the old crimes leave the new ones you would have committed leave it and go home take with you a future in which you can live true again your mission here will not be a failure this is not defeat devoth you came to find a way to live again you came to become fertile you came to end your life as slavers and become your true selves again all that you can have let me show you what that future can look like aliver turned before they could respond he shouted something back to his army and a moment later several soldiers moved aside the numrek children walked through the gap left open for them the seven figures proceeded forward cautiously aliver beckoned to them come let your uncles and aunts see you come when the children reached them they stood awkwardly out from the acacians and yet reluctant to go any nearer the auldek sabeer said something to the children in auldek several of them responded she motioned them forward with her fingers a man to one side of her squatted down and beckoned them with his arms the children drifted closer until near enough that the adults touched them they began speaking rapidly to them different adults asking different children questions they squeezed them on the shoulders and pulled them into embraces and cupped their faces in their palms allek the numrek who had come in his fathers place pushed his way through his elders and called to one of the younger girls seeing him she broke from the woman who was stroking her hair and ran to him she jumped into his embrace and the young man turned away trying to hide the heaving sobs that wracked his chest aliver gave them a few moments and then said i told you i would provide these children to you here they are take them take them home to your lands and teach them how to be auldek i believe that will give both you and them great joy we have not said we accept your terms devoth said he had been gazing enraptured in a young mans face he straightened hardening his expression no but thats because i have not told you the last aspect of my terms i told you i would reveal it now so i will aliver lifted his chin and indicated the vast array of troops that made up devoths army those soldiers and slaves who fight for youi want you to let them decide their lives from now on they may return to ushen brae with you or they are welcome among us there will be no punishment for the fighting that came before today youll tell them this if you dont we will tell them that all of you auldek are mortal he paused letting the significance of that grow inside them you may think they love you and are loyal to you but i think its more that they fear you they think youre invincible thats what keeps them standing behind you if they knew that you were just as mortal as they they would not look at you with slave eyes anymore that one there what is his name aliver picked out a lvin slave one who stood out before a contingent of the divine children he stared his chin raised almost as if he were sniffing the air his face was white as snow framed by the thick locks of white hair that made him seem truly half snow lion just as regal even more deadly rialus answered menteus nemre what do you think that one would do if he knew one blow of his sword could end you i suspect i know the answer but should we ask him we could call him over and hear what he thinks we gave him a good life devoth said the old certainty which had already slipped out of him along with his souls had escaped him now entirely he spoke but he did not even seem to believe himself you dont know how much we gave him you did not give him freedom aliver said he stared at menteus nemre the man had noticed he stared back you did not give him the respect an equal deserves i suspect he would like that more than anything else i suspect they would all want that i may be wrong devoth but i believe that if i shouted the truth of your mortality to them right now you would not have one army facing you you would find two surrounding you i suspect that your own army would slaughter you with more relish than anyone standing behind me aliver brought his eyes back to devoth and asked should i ask them l ater that day after devoth said no he did not want aliver to ask menteus nemre or any of the divine children that question after he had conferred with the rest of the auldek and brought back the answer aliver had longed to hear after he had listened to all the oaths to peace that he could and when he believed it had really truly been achieved with protection for any acacians remaining in ushen brae as well aliver asked if mena would accept the rest there was still a long line of auldek waiting to accept the peace it would take some time she said she would complete the work she took his hand as he rose and held it a time as if she were rehearsing the words she would say to him in the end she only repeated i will complete this aliver parted with her casually as if he just wished to go outside and walk among the troops he did that there was much rejoicing among them and he wanted to feel some of it but when he felt the fingers of death brush his shoulder he did not run from them they had been near for a long time and he could not possibly begrudge them their due now not after the day they had just allowed him to complete his time had come he hoped that mena would not be angry with him for not saying a more formal goodbye but he thought she would know that he had been doing that with every action he took since being freed from corinns spell better that she take over from him as that was what the future held for her anyway he walked for as long as he could greeting soldiers and touching hands until he managed to slip down a quiet lane of tents he lay down on a cot under a shelter and then on second thought he rose and pulled the cot out underneath the sky he watched the heavy blanket of clouds so near to them in the darkening sky when the first snowflakes began to fall he closed his eyes and felt their cold delicate kisses on his cheeks on his eyelids and lips he opened his eyes once more stirred by a commotion near at hand he heard pos roar come down from up above he saw the dragons dark shadow pass above and then heard the answering calls from his siblings his eyes almost fluttered closed but then a man yelled there came the crash of something being knocked over and then a series of snaps the clink of metal rings and grunts of agitation aliver understood what was happening before he knew why he understood po flew riderless above calling on his kin to join him the other three were tearing off their harnesses he heard their wings unfurl that loud concussion of clicking that was like nothing else in the world and then swoosh as those great wings grabbed the air and lifted them upward he heard the panic in peoples voices but he did not feel it corinn had written as long as i live they will be true to us after that she said they would be different listening to them chatter to one another as they rose into the snowheavy night aliver knew that change had begun and he knew that his sister had gone before him to the afterdeath corinn he had been so consumed by his own work that he had almost forgotten her battle with the santoth he remembered it now and knew that she had been triumphant eyes closed again he lay there a long time feeling the snow build a blanket atop him thanking his sister it was not just her saving the world from the santoth that he was grateful for he thanked her for himself for allowing him to know in the end that she was wonderful that he loved her completely without reservation as a brother should a little later he stopped feeling the snow he stopped feeling anything he had a thought that would have made him laugh except he no longer had the lips to laugh with aliver akaran he thought look what youve done youve made it so that theyre going to start calling you the snow king again he did not really mind he had always liked the ring of the name before he just had not deserved it now perhaps he had earned it chapter seventythree the flutes played the noon hour they started high in acacia at the top of the palace and then the tune cascaded down toward the lower town beautiful a sound that mena had never really believed she would hear again she stood on the balcony of corinns offices amazed at the view of the island in the brilliance of the spring light how was it even possible that a sound so wonderful lived in this world in the same one that had just been filled with the din of war with arctic winds howling and men and women crying in pain and rage it did not seem possible that the images that had comprised her life the last half year could be real if this was real or that the view out across the spires and down toward the glistening sea could be anything but a dream if that other version of life was a reality she would need to spend a great deal of time coming to terms with this and finding a way to face it alone she was home but aliver was not corinn never would be dariel and melio had gone out of the known world and nobody could say a word about their fate she was alone at least alivers body worked its slow way home escorted by the army that loved him his body encased in a simple casket took one last meandering trip around the mainland mena hoped aliver would have welcomed that she thought he would she thought he would like it very much that his body was being carried the entire way on the shoulders of former slaves who had just weeks before stood in the army that opposed him so many of them had chosen to stay and had begged for the honor of bearing aliver home to acacia there was a rightness to that a closing of very old wrongs yes she thought he would have liked that very much hearing someone enter mena stepped back into the room rhrenna her sisters former secretary stood at attention a collection of papers held to her chest she bowed her blond head i have news she said from alecia of course she did rhrenna had nothing if not news since menas return to the island a few days before the meinish woman had acted as if she were menas personal assistant she had been a great help really leading the princess through her own palace as if she were a visitor new to it perhaps she was perhaps she had not come back the same and would never feel the same or perhaps with aliver and corinn both gone acacia itself was not the same i would rather you had news from the other lands mena said one fair word about dariel or melio would be all the news i need for some time still nothing from there im afraid this news though your majesty perhaps you should sit down rhrenna had been nothing but courteous to her she had not called her majesty before though why do i look so ill as that mena glanced down at the dress she wore and nearly started a dress a garment of light cotton that flowed all the way to the stone floor pressed and clean embroidered with gold thread this will take some getting used to she thought it had been a good thing for her to return directly to acacia on elya she needed time to remember how not to be at war how to wear a dress and wake in a mild clime and not think constantly about the lives that depended on each decision she made you look very well rhrenna said its just the decrees were opened and read before the senate they may surprise you the secretary had her attention now not knowing how to read her face mena felt a tingling of fear familiar trepidation whats happened its not anything that you expected rhrenna looked around the empty room i feel like somebody should be here with us when i say this just speak it aliver and corinn have made you queen mena stared at her they both conceded that their children being illegitimate should not inherit the throne thats how they explained it at least you are the only direct legitimate heir only you are married with the potential to produce a legal heir rhrenna paused searching mena to see if she acknowledged that logic the senate agreed theyve reratified the decrees already they had no choice they had already accepted the decrees aliver gave them in a locked box remember i told you about that he did that before he flew to meet you and now considering the way the people love the snow king nobody disputes his and corinns wishes you are to be queen of acacia nobody opposes it and what if i oppose it mena thought theres more of course there is you should read it yourself the secretary offered it but mena made no move to accept it after a moment rhrenna continued aliver and corinn have called for an alliance of nations not an empire they called it the sacred band she stopped again do you really want me to rhrenna just tell me please its a plan to be implemented over time rhrenna said skimming the pages right now you are to be queen of the empire you are to oversee the five provinces as they each form governments in ten yearsor after ten of peace calm if all is going wellthey gain selfgovernance theyll still be within the empire i think but after twenty years the nations are to become truly independent there are details more to it than that but thats the thrust of it eventually acacia will be one nation among others among equals she set the papers down on the desk now that i think about it i can see why the senators wouldnt want to interfere with this selfrule you know how many new kings that will make what a grand confusion that will be mena thought but even as she thought it she felt lifted on a tide of relief it was right a confusion but confusion that would no longer rest on a single pair of shoulders hers they trapped me and freed me at the same time aliver you did say you were going to ask a lot of me now i understand or im starting to l ater that afternoon mena gathered aaden and shen from their lesson with barad they took it up at the same openair classroom in which she and her siblings had received lessons from jason mena ushered them away quickly thanking barad but not wanting to stay too long with the memories of the place or with him not that she could escape memories in the palace barads eyes though saw into one yet another thing she would have to get accustomed to another topic on which she would need to slowly come to trust her older siblings wisdom the children were unusually quiet as they walked only when they reached elyas terrace and heard the creature chirrup a greeting did they find voice to ask about what barad must have told them is it true aaden asked many things are true which one are you asking about youre to be the queen shen answered she did that sometimes and aaden did the same for her finishing each others thoughts as they shared them like twins mena thought looking at them a paleskinned boy with light eyes a brownskinned girl with dark ones so different and yet not not for the first time since joining them she wondered what her child by melio would have looked like it was too difficult a thought though she pushed it away knowing that she faced a lifetime of wishing she had had that child with him when she had the chance thats what ive been told mena said i never planned that i dont know what it means really i dont know she looked at the two of them helplessly im sorry but its too new i just dont know melio will be king aaden said when he comes back mena had not had time to consider that melio sharratt a king love him as she did that was rather hard to imagine lets pray he comes back then i always do aaden said every morning i ask the giver to let dariel and melio return the boy turned his face away he watched elya preen pretending to be fascinated mena knew better she heard the emotion trying to crawl over his last words she almost said that she said the same prayers herself she wanted melio back beside her so much she walked with a perpetual emptiness inside it had been there throughout the war but she noticed it much more acutely now that she was home finding wren here on acacia when she returned with a wee babe whom she had named corinn in her arms made things both better and worse mena was so pleased to be an aunt a third time so pleased to know that dariel lived on in the child and that corinn would be honored by her as well what a father dariel would have been she could not imagine anyone better suited to it instead though it was the likes of rialus neptos who would soon be arriving back to meet his daughter for the first time maybe he would make a good father too mena could not say despite the animus she might always feel for him he had played a part in saving the nation how very strange the turning of fate shen said my mother is happy she said this means i wont have to worry about being queen would you have worried about it the girl caught the question on her lips and paused to consider it id rather you did it me too aaden said glancing back dont tell mother i the words fell from his mouth and dropped out of the air the sentence unfinished he began to turn away again but his aunt did not let him oh dear come mena said she pulled aaden in hugging him tight and then looked up and motioned with her fingers that shen should join the embrace arms around both of them she whispered you two are good friends now arent you that would make your parents happy it makes me happy listen the world surprises us all me as much as you it even surprised corinn and aliver again and again it finds ways to surprise it makes things tough sometimes thats what its been lately but it wont always be so hard weve come through so much we really have aunt what will become of us shen asked mena drew back to see her nieces face what a question to ask i dont know the future child i only know whats been and what i wish will be and even then i know that ill never even really understand whats been it confounds me all the time nor will what i wish to be ever come to pass exactly as i imagine shen crossed her eyes it was such an unexpected bizarre gesture that at first it alarmed mena when the girls eyes popped back to normal mena saw it for the joke it was smiling she agreed youre right life is confusing enough to make you go crosseyed but what do you imagine aaden asked i knowit wont happen just perfectlybut still tell us you would have me lay the future before you made only of my hopes and fears both children nodded all right here mena took a seat on a couch and motioned for the children to do the same she had one sit on either side of her turned them so that they rested their heads on her lap elya stopped preening to watch them mena looked up and away from them all what i imagine is that you will live magnificent lives she said and that you will live lives of quiet disappointment you wont be able to explain why but there will always be some failures you will strive for greatness and justice and you will help to make our nation wondrous im counting on that dont let me down you will both be great but you will also fail at many of the things dearest to you and peopleeven ones you lovewill disappoint you you will know great loves and you will have dear friends and you will be part of the great tree of akaran you will never be alone and yet some of those you hold dearest will betray you or envy you or covet the things they perceive you to have that they do not at timeseven within a throng of people despite the noise and clamor of attentionyou will feel strangely lost you will find gifts that are special to you but you will never understand why such things were thrust upon you you may curse the world for always always spinning never pausing and yet this motion will be the music to which you dance in the end i hope you will come to feel that none of the life you led could have been any different any better or worse you will find meaning in accepting many things you cannot understand or change and if you live a long life youll grow tired and that will be all right because you will have done the best you could during your lives aaden shifted his head as if to look up at her but mena stilled him with her palm and pressed him gently back against her knee you will take into the future all that ever has been for us you will take your mothers and your fathers you will take all that was acacia and all that was talay and all that was mein and you will take more than thatgifts and memories beyond measure all of it lives inside you because of you the days to come will be better than the days before this one mena paused she flexed her fingers where they touched the two children at least that is how i imagine it i may be wrong i am not so old myself some say the greater portion of my life is before me but dear ones thats the future i imagine for you i wish that it were more and yet i also know it to be a vast thing beyond what you can imagine now she paused again unsure how they would respond if they would be saddened unduly she did not want that but she could not lie to them she was surprised then by the calm with which they answered let that be so shen said and a moment later aaden echoed yes let that be so after a silence shen said mena yes love but it was aaden who answered youve said many of the things that my mother wrote me in her letter shen read it too did you read it mena no funny aaden said because she wrote the same thing almost only almost what did she say that was different shen responded she wrote all that and then she said that it was our job to make it better than that when were grown she said we should make it better in ways she could not imagine we will aaden said mena closed her eyes she tilted her head up slightly as if she needed to scent the air when she opened her eyes she was glad the children couldnt see the tears that escaped them she was glad her handthat was a gentle weight on their headscould just as easily hold them in place she said of course you will thats what you were born for end of book four epilogue sire dagon lingered on the dock after the others had departed the ceremony he stepped out of the shadow of the enrapture and stood gazing at the ship there it was the new home of his eminence the enraptured sire grau stacked stories upon stories tall the enrapture was not the largest league brig but it was the most revered the most sacred it never docked longer than a few days never filed a plan of sail and for most of each year it kept no contact whatsoever with the rest of league society it floated the worlds seas followed the currents it rose and fell with the tides all the time it did so the enraptured leaguemen housed within it lived in a state of unending bliss sire grau having just joined them had an eternity of floating dreaming paradise stretching before him the bastard dagon thought you lying conniving bastard i hope the vessel sinks he glanced around to make sure nobody heard his thoughts he would never let such venom escape him in council but he was not in council now the leaguemen and ishtat and workers draining away toward the town paid him no heed he wished he did not have to hide his thoughts as he just had throughout the ceremony he had stood beside his brothers through the pomp of graus rapture watching grau climb into the casing that was to be his lasting paradise watching as the casing was winched up into the vessel dagon had even intoned the sacred songs honoring the sire for the life of service he had lived complete rubbish why would anyone think id have anything but hatred for him anyway hes ruined me thanks to grau and his plotting dagon was a failure having been forced to forfeit his rapture tithepart of which went to conclude graus paymentsdagon would never live long enough to earn admittance the lowliest young league novice in the outer circles of the council had a brighter future than he dagon did not follow the others he strolled out to the far end of the dock looking to the west and also south across the open expanse of water he set a hand on a pylon a thick stump of wood that he knew was actually the very tip of a massive tree one that extended far down into the depths of the deepwater dock a brig caught his eye in the distance coming in from the west one of the large ones most often used for crossing the gray slopes he did not recall a brigs return being planned but his mind had been on other matters recently he tried to take some comfort from being able to absorb the news of the world from the safety of orlo tumultuous events were best studied from a safe distance he much preferred mulling over the known worlds turmoil while inhaling the sea breeze blowing in from the west watching the sun slide toward the watery horizon as he was doing now he even took some satisfaction in finding himself somewhat vindicated by recent events who among you brothers he had asked at the last council meeting would prefer being prisoner in the inner sea to being free leaguemen perched between the two continents the answering silence had been gratifying regardless of the grumbling undertone hidden just beneath it watching the brig come in and waiting for the sun to dive into the horizon he stood cataloging what he knew of recent events for one queen corinn was no more nobody knew what had happened to her but she never returned from the confrontation with the santoth dead gone and good riddance her dragon po circled high over the isle of acacia one evening but he never landed he flew north and gathered his siblings all four of them ripped off their harnesses and lofted into the air roaring themselves into freedom wild monstrous freedom elya their mother could do nothing to restrain them though she stayed true to mena aliver had managed to arrange a truce with the auldek he even sent them home with his blessing the numrek orphans and a box of childrens toys or so went the joke making the rounds among the leaguemen the vintage had not proved to have the deadly apathetic withdrawals their trials had suggested that the people claimed was alivers doing the same magical connection with the masses he had employed to help them off the mist during the war with hanish mein the people went on and then the king had promptly lain down and died dagon had tried to win some credit for that butinjusticeit all fell on grau none of the blame all of the credit hail grau dagon lofted a bit of phlegm into the air watched it splat on the water below it floated until the gaping oval of some fishs mouth opened below it and sucked it in the brig was near enough now that dagon expected it to furl its mainsail there were sailors up in the rigging but whatever they were doing it was not tending the sails perhaps it was not going to dock at orlo at all on to thrain maybe then there was all the business about mena becoming queen a neat maneuver for herit avoided all sorts of unpleasant manipulation of the two illegitimate children the leaguemen were unsure whether the crown had been thrust upon her or whether she had arranged it for herself mena had never seemed interested in rule but akaransespecially akaran womenhad proved surprising before as for the whole notion of a sacred band of independent nations alivers work obviously nathos doubted that it would result in anything but a new round of wars but revek had offered that it might actually be for the best it made for an entire continent of individual monarchs all of them new even mena the potential for the league to enrich themselves exploiting them was considerable tired as the thought made dagon he had to admit it was true the league would worm its way back into the commerce of the known world the sires faleen el and lethel surely had hold on ushen brae by now the auldek might be marching back that way even now but they were not to be feared anymore not really for many in the leaguethe raptured of course and the young as wellthe future remained bright for yourself dagon not so he paused midsentence realizing that the brig really had not lessened its speed at all it grew larger by the second plowing through the water most recklessly it was sure to pass too close to the docks shouts of alarm confirmed that others thought this too dagon could hear the strange almost inaudible hiss of the prow cutting through the water he started to back away he paused when he saw the sailors in the rigging release a flag as it rolled out and then snapped full dagon felt the color drain from his face he knew it immediately how could he not he had lived years beneath it on acacia the tree of akaran the black shape of an acacia tree against a yellow sunburst unmistakable even if it lacked the perfect craftsmanship of the flag that flew atop the palace it made no sense a joke of some sort had one of the sires gone mad on the voyage home a figure waved and shouted from the deck dagon ignored him searching for the conical head that would distinguish a fellow leagueman sire dagon the person yelled sire dagon dagon squinted him into sharper focus the man moved along the deck as the ship slipped past others crowded the deck shouting and waving also but the single figure held dagons attention now as he ran others leaped out of the way he was in a state of mad euphoria pointing to his chest and gesturing in the air look at me you see me though dagon could not make out his features he could see that the man wore a smile as radiant as the sun watching him dagon failed to heed the warning shouted by those around him the wave thrown up by the ships prow hit dagon with a force that knocked him off his feet and sent him sprawling sliding across the pier grasping for something to hold on to he slammed into a pylon his breath escaped him and for a few moments the tide of water held him in place wrapped around the plug of wood by the time he gained his feet again breathless sopping wet and bareheaded the brig was almost past the pier its me your friend dariel akaran the madman on the brig shouted its spratling im in a hurry now cant stop and chat too much good news to spread ill come back soon and settle our business the stern of the brig cleared the pier as it carried on dagon lost sight of the prince for a moment then he appeared once more looking out from the rear deck he yelled tell your brothers that spratling is back and hes brought friends he pointed at the bulky figure beside him a gray man who climbed upon the railing turned around dropped his trousers and wiggled his buttocks over the stern as the ship charged away dagon barely heard the commotion of the others rushing around him and the leaguemen pouring out onto the pier to watch the ship as it carried on to the east he sat down on a pylon he went to take off his cap and hold it on his lap but he did not have a cap he glanced around for it and then gave up and watched the vanishing brig he could have thought a thousand things but what came to him was something small something that grau had said back in alecia how had he worded it he had said what use is going to rapture if it all comes crashing down in a few years sire dagon chuckled what use indeed he thought what use indeed in a perverse way despite the unfortunate magnitude of what had just been revealed he felt a little better than he had just a moment before he wondered if he might gain entrance to the rapture vessel just long enough to find graus chamber he would knock on his casing and say i hate to wake you brother but guess what guess what
