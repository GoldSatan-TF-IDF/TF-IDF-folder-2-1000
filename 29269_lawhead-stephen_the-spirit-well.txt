travel is an endeavour fraught with complication and error far from being an exact science using ley lines to travel among between and across the various known dimensions of the multidimensional omniverse is at best an art that can only be perfected through long apprenticeship and even the most expert of explorers is likely to go astraya fact that kit livingstone knows only too well using a ley line discovered by wilhelmina his former girlfriend kit has succeeded in eluding capture by lord archelaeus burleigh a ruthless and violent man determined to possess the fabled skin map at any cost in kits desperation to escape burleighs clutches however something has gone amiss for although he landed in the right place it seems to be entirely the wrong time at least the epoch in which kit finds himself is definitely not the one wilhelmina had in mind when she advised him to use that particular ley line for his getaway suffice it to say that for the time being and perhaps the foreseeable future kit seems to be stuck in the stone age making the best of his predicament kit has stumbled upon a discovery that could prove important to the ongoing proceedings it would appear that against all odds he has discovered the fabled well of souls or as it is perhaps better known to readers of these pages the spirit well meanwhile back in seventeenthcentury prague wilhelminas enterprises go from strength to strength her grand imperial kaffeehaus is a rousing success and a boon to the citys population engelbert etzel stiffelbeam minas business partner and a baker by trade provides tasty pastries and invigorating coffee to a wildly appreciative public as well as stalwart support to wilhelmina her material welfare thus guaranteed mina now has time and money to spend in pursuit of the quest to find the scattered pieces of the skin map to this end she has formed a shaky alliance with the mercurial lady fayth against the same lord burleigh and his gang of base ruffians the nefarious burley men yet we ask ourselves can lady fayth be trusted it should be remembered that giles standfast the late sir henry fayths footman and driver was sorely wounded in the attempt to flee burleigh on the night kit vanished and was taken to the kaffeehaus for medical attention the unfortunate mr standfast has been returned to his home in england to convalesce what lies in store for giles remains to be seen but it is expected that he will make a full recovery half a world away in egypt dr thomas young and his new and enthusiastic assistant khefri are deeply engrossed in their work we last saw them beginning the task of cataloguing an astounding trove of treasure recovered from the sealed tomb of anen high priest of amun and brotherinlaw to pharaoh amenhotep iii one of the items retrieved from the tomb was a portion of the skin map our dr young we may recall is also in possession of a meticulously rendered copy of the map and with khefris help will endeavour to decipher its unique symbology we wish them well and hope they continue to occupy themselves to good effect unbeknownst to the others a rival questor has been quietly making progress in the search for the ultimate treasurenone other than douglas flinderspetrie for those who may be sensing difficulty with the expanding flinderspetrie line there is a simple alphabetic mnemonic the line begins with a for arthur followed by b for benedict c for charles and d for douglas the last in line douglas the greatgrandson of the intrepid arthur possesses a purloined section of the map and is diligently applying his considerable talents in learning how to read it to this end he has succeeded in locating and suborning an unsuspecting aide to the cause in the person of friar roger bacon a thirteenthcentury scholar philosopher theologian and scientist careful readers may recall the audacious assault on the british museum by douglas and his young associate the surly and taciturn snipe the two forced entry into the venerable institutions rare book room after opening hours and following a brief search made off with a prize volume plucked from the collection to allow a slight digression it can now be reported that the book in question had long been part of a minor southern aristocrats family library which at the disposition of the deceaseds estate had come to the museum along with his collection of roman glass and tudor silver the volume was thought to be from the late s it was a small neat leatherbound tome handwritten by its author and entitled inconssensus arcanus or forbidden secrets this particular work was prized not for its historic value which was minimal nor for its educational value which was even less because it was wholly unreadable the book was kept merely because all that could be deciphered in page after page of dense cryptic text was the name roger bacon who was none other than the famous professor of oxford university in the early medieval period priest and scientist the renowned doctor mirabilis was the author of many learned volumes including the legendary opus minus alchemaie every page of the book of forbidden secrets as it is known is filled with strange pictograms resembling the letters of an unknown alphabet an alphabet serving a language no one on earth had ever heard spoken a secret code an occult language who could say douglas flinderspetrie had a fairly solid hunch that it was not a language neither was it a code rather it was in his considered opinion a wholly symbolic script devised by friar bacon sometime around the year the same symbology that had inspired his own greatgrandfather arthur flinderspetrie in the making of the skin map in short it was douglas belief that the archaic manuscript was a catalogue of experiments and coordinates the experiments detailed alchemical processes the coordinates were those of ley line destinations ergo roger bacon in addition to his other more highly lauded achievements had also discovered ley travel more could be said about these matters but one feels this is quite enough for now in any event it is enough to be getting on with so keeping these details firmly in mind we return to our tale in which friday takes a holiday part one the ghost road chapter in which friday takes a holiday cassandra clarke dug bones for a living she spent every summer of her professional life hunkered down in trenches of various depths with a trowel in one hand and a whisk broom in the other excavating the skeletal remains of creatures long dead many of which were known only to science and some known to no one at all although digging was in her bloodher mother was alison brett clarke palaeontologist of turkana boy renowncassandra did not plan to spend her entire life in plexiglas goggles with dust in her hair and a damp handkerchief over her nose her ambition was far greater than crating up fossils to be carefully catalogued and then locked away in some musty museum basement her fatherthe astrophysicist j anthony clarke iii whose theory on the origin of the universe through quantum fluctuations in a plasma field won him a nobel prize nominationenjoyed telling people that his precocious daughter was born with her feet in the dirt and her head in the stars those who heard that quip assumed it was a reference to her parentage and the fact that she spent so much time scrabbling around in holes in the ground true enough but it was also a sly allusion to his beloved cassies penchant for fanciful invention as a child cass ran a neighbourhood theatre company from a tent in the backyard for two summers running she cajoled kids within a sixblock radius of th avenue and th street into performing in a string of dramas she wrote produced and directed usually the plays involved beautiful princesses being menaced by either dinosaurs or aliens sometimes both later she graduated to writing poetry and short stories for the school newspaper and won a prize in junior high for a poem about a melancholy wildflower growing in a parking lot despite these artistic leanings she gravitated naturally to science blessed with her mothers patient persistence and her fathers analytical proclivity she excelled in her undergraduate studies and chose to follow her mothers lead into fossil hunting spending her summers assisting in digs from china to mexico earning her spurs now as a doctoral candidate she was assigned as assistant director for a major arizona excavation with careerconsolidating potential lately however the routine had begun to pall coprolites and jurassic snails no longer held the fascination they once did and the incessant backbiting and political manoeuvring endemic in upperechelon academiawhich she had always known and accepted as part of the scholastic landscapewas proving more and more of an irksome distraction the further she travelled into darkest phd territory the more the fossilised remains of extinct creatures dwindled in fascination she was rapidly specialising herself beyond caring about her subject whether or not the world learned what the latest new megasaurus ate for lunch sixty million years ago what difference did it make on bad days which seemed to come fairly often of late it all seemed so pointless more and more she found herself looking at the gorgeous sedona sunsets and irrationally hankering for a clean canvas and a set of brushesor seeing individual cacti as surrealist sculptures or inwardly rhapsodising about the towering windcarved rocks of the canyons in ways she could not fully describe she felt she was being moved on to other things perhaps another life beyond science still she was not willing to throw in the trowel just yet there was a teetering mountain of work to do and she was up to her hips almost literally in unclassified fossils using a dental pick cass teased a glassy curve of mineralised bone from the hardpacked brickcoloured earth it came free and plopped into her handa black leafshaped stub of stone so smooth it looked as if it had been polished the tooth of a young tarbosaurus a theropod that streaked about the earth during the cretaceous period and until this very moment had only ever been found in the gobi desert cass had studied these creatures in detail and now had the proof she needed to support the theory of a more farflung population than previously recognised there was a time when securing such a specimen would have had her doing handsprings around the camp today however she merely tossed the fossil into a plastic bucket of other such treasures paused and straightened pressing a hand to the small of her aching back she sighed rubbed the sweat from the nape of her neck and shielding her eyes from the merciless afternoon sun muttered wheres friday she made a quick scan of the surrounding terrain the same bleak landscape met her gaze unchanged in the twentyone days since the dig season began unchanged in eons bloodred sunscoured rocks gnarled and withered creosote bushes manyarmed saguaro scraggly yucca choya and assorted cacti by the carload of fridaya yavapai indian who acted as gofer and scout for the excavating teamthere was no sign she turned to the west and glimpsed a faded red bandanna bobbing above a haze of purple sage as the workshy fellow sloped off into the neighbouring canyon she glanced at her watch it was nearing six oclock there was another good hour left before they would have to gather up their tools load the vans and head back into town hows it going down there cass turned the voice belonged to joe greenough her colleague team leader and chief community liaison officer for the university field team an affable chap in his early thirties joe coasted up with his hands in his pockets anything interesting he peered down into the trench in which she stood same old same old she reached up a hand here help a lady out any time grasping her hand he held it and smiled but made no effort to help her up today would be good she told him any time now perhaps he put a hand under her arm and pulled as she scrambled up the side of the hole i hear theres a new invention called a ladder he said watching her dust off the seat of her cargo jeans great for climbing if youre ever in a town that sells em you should get one you know me she said moving off an oldfashioned girl to my fossilised bones dont hold with these newfangled contraptions hey he called where you going after friday ill be right back i came to talk to you he pointed out not shout what you wearing cement shoes cass listen he jogged after her slow down a second its important then speed up she kept her eye on the quickly disappearing indian it was strange how the indigenous folk could cover ground so quickly without appearing to expend any effort at all fridays gone walkabout and i dont want to lose him its about the dig joe paused as if remembering what he had come to say yeah with you so far she said giving him a sideways glance she saw a cloud pass over his usually sunny features gosh it must be some kind of important if it has you at a loss for words its just he sighed theres no good way to say this then say it in a bad way she urged just say it already theres trouble okay and before he could reply she went on dont tell me the department is cutting back on our grant money again she stopped walking and turned to him i dont believe this after all ive done to convince no no he said quickly the grant is fine the committee is delighted with the results okay then she shrugged and started walking again its the indians he blurted native americans theyre on the warpath why what did you say to them this time she skirted a large prickly pear and stepped lightly over a fallen saguaro limb the universitys assurances and goodwill notwithstanding the arizona native american council had long ago decided to take a dim view of any archaeological activity in the region so far the project directors had been able to placate the anac by hiring local people to help with the dig and consult on indigenous culturewhich was somewhat outside the remit of a palaeontology project but helped keep the peace nothing to do with me joe protested apparently theres a major celebration coming upa holy day or something the tribal elders are claiming the entire valley as a site of special cultural significancea sacred landscape is it who knows joe shrugged anyway they have a state senator on their side hes up for reelection soon so hes got a bee in his bonnet senator rodriguezhes on the squawk box giving interviews about how were all a bunch of cold heartless scientists tearing up the countryside and defiling indian burial grounds this was never an indian burial ground cass pointed out anyway were not digging up the whole valley only a few specific locationsthe same ones weve been working for the past two years did you tell them that joe regarded her with a pitying expression you think logic and reason have anything to do with this its political and its gone septic well thats just dandy she huffed as if we didnt already have enough trouble with the sedona tourist bureau and the new agers this isnt going to help one little bit tell me about it ive arranged to speak to the editor over at the sedona observer tomorrow and put our case on record hold that thought she said and resumed her pursuit of the wayward friday who had passed from view behind a boulder at the foot of a washout we have to stop digging until this is settled he called after her get friday and his crew to help you tie things down and put a tarp over the trench cant hear you she replied dodging a pumpkinsized barrel cactus she hurried on leaving greenough behind keeping an eye peeled for rattlesnakesthe constant bugaboo of desert digsshe clipped along dodging the bristles spines and sawtoothed edges of the local flora all of which seemed to have been designed to puncture slash tear or otherwise discourage progress one way or another strange she thought how quiet it became and how quickly the thought was no sooner through her head than she heard that rarest of desert sounds thunder the distant rumble clear and present on the hot dry air brought her up short she glanced up to see that the sky above the towering redrock hills and canyons of the verde valley had grown dark with heavy black angrylooking clouds oblivious with her head in the ground she had failed to notice the fastchanging weather the wind lifted and cassandra smelled rain a thunderstorm in the desert was not unheard of but rare enough to be fascinating and fragrant the smell of washed desert air tinged with ozone was unlike anything else it would be she considered less fascinating to be caught out in a lightning storm she picked up her pace and called to the swiftly retreating figure ahead friday the echo of her cry came winging back to her from the surrounding canyon walls directly ahead rose a towering rock stacka multibanded heap of the distinctive ruddy sandstone of the sedona region gotcha she muttered certain that her quarry had ducked out of sight behind the massive windsculpted block of stone she hurried on the sky continued to lower the mumbling grumbling thunder grew louder and more insistent the freshening wind sent dust devils spinning away through the sagebrush and mesquite as cassandra rounded the base of the sandstone stack she saw that it opened into one of the many feeder gullies of the larger system the locals called secret canyon she thought she glimpsed a figure flitting through the shadows of the gulch some distance ahead she shouted again but received no answer she sped on moving deeper into the enormous crevice her yavapai colleague was in most significant ways the stereotypical red man workshy taciturn to the point of monosyllabic arrogant furtive given to odd moods habitually dressed in faded jeans with the cuffs stuffed into the tops of his scuffed cowboy boots he wore his straight black hair scraped back into a single braid that fell down the back of his sunbleached blue shirt and bound the end with a leather strap decorated with a bit of red rag or a quail feather in both dress and demeanour he presented an image so patently cliched that cass had come to believe that it was purposefully studied and one he worked very hard to maintain no one could have combined so many of these dimenovel qualities by accident friday she concluded wanted to be seen as the quintessential native american of popular romance he chased itto the point of standing outside the walgreens on main street on the weekends dressed in a fringed deerskin vest and beaded moccasins with two eagle feathers in his hair posing for pictures with tourists for tips sedonas very own drugstore indian all he lacked was a fistful of cigars as to why he did it she as yet had no clue why play a part so obviously derisory and beneath him why perpetrate a demeaning cliche that belonged to a backward less enlightened time was it masochism or some kind of elaborate joke cass could not begin to guess friday she shouted still moving forward come out i know youre in here she paused then added youre not in trouble i just want to talk to you the rock walls of undulating stone layered in alternating bands of colour rose sheer from the floor of the gulley which upon closer inspection appeared unnaturally straight a curious quality cassandra noticed but put down to a trick of the uncertain light and oddly shaped stone walls a sudden gust of wind sent loose pebbles falling from the heights above and with them the first drops of rain friday the sound of her voice pinged along the sandstone walls but there was no reply from the deepening shadows ahead the sky grew dark and angry as a bruise the low clouds churning the air tingled with pent energy it felt alive as if lightning was about to strike with a hand flattened over her head to protect herself from the scattershot of pebbles cassandra raced on taking the straight path through the canyon to avoid the loose debris from above the wind shrieked a withering note sending a sheet of rain down the length of the gulley drenching everything in its path cassandra was caught the wind funnelled by the canyon surged over her dashing cold water into her face blinded by the rain she scooped water from her eyes and dived for whatever cover the overhanging ledges of stone could provide a blast of icy wind slammed into her with the force of a jet engine stealing the breath from her lungs and driving her along the canyon floor she staggered forward tripped put out her hands to break her fall and gritted her teeth but the expected jolt did not come to her horror the ground gave out beneath her and she continued to tumble between one step and the next she was airborne plunging into an unseen void the landing when it came was abrupt but not the bonebreaking shock she instinctively feared the ground on which she landed had an odd spongy granularity she could not have anticipated her first thought was that she had somehow fallen through the roof of a kivaone of the underground ritual houses favoured by the pueblodwelling natives of the past these were often hidden and the roofs were known to give way beneath the weight of unwary hikers but whoever heard of a kiva hidden in a canyon floor her second thoughtan absurd possibilitywas that a tornado had plucked her up and dropped her miles away did she not feel that she had been flying how else to explain what she was now seeing for stretching before her was a vast arid plain of volcanic gravel without a single cactus or mesquite tree in sight the towering red rocks of sedona were gone and in the far distance a band of black hills lined the horizon and that was all what had happened to arizona cass stared at the alien landscape whirling in panicky pirouette like a dancer who had inexplicably lost her partner panic rising she gulped air in a futile effort at forcing herself to remain calm two thoughts chased each other round and round in her spinning thoughts what happened where am i cass the back of her hand pressed to her mouth to stifle the scream she felt gathering there struggled heroically to make sense of this exceedingly strange turn of events and was on the verge of collapsing on the path and gathering herself into a tight foetal position when a gruff and irritated voice startled her what are you doing here distracted momentarily from her panic she whirled to look behind her friday relief of an oily queasy sort spread through her thank god its you didnt you hear me calling you no he put his hand to her upper arm you must go back she looked around the strangeness of the situation increasing by the second where are we what happened this is not for you he started walking pulling cassandra with him she wrenched away from his grasp im not going anywhere until you tell me what happened she insisted she glared at him well an uncertain mixture of pique tinged with amusement squirmed across the native americans sunwrinkled features this is tsegihi he told her you do not belong here cassandra frowned if she had heard the word before she could not place it i dont understand you crossed the coyote bridge on the ghost road there was no road no bridge i in the canyon he made to take her arm again but cass stepped away we must go back before it is too late why she glanced around at the elaborately empty landscape what could happen bad things cassandra allowed the indian to take her arm he turned her around and began walking along a path scratched in the pumice chips that covered the plain to a depth of several inches the path stretched across the empty landscape in an absolutely straight line as far as she could see is this the ghost road how did i get she began but her next words were stolen by the wind that gusted out of nowhere snatching her voice from the air as between one step and the next her feet left the ground chapter in which the secret canyon gives up its secret when cassandra could see again she was once more in secret canyon sopping wet her head throbbing with a headache so virulent she could not see straight hands on hips bent low at the waist she gulped air and fought down a queasy motion sickness friday towered over her frowning what she demanded you might have warned me that was going to happen you are weak friday replied looking at the sky the roiling black clouds were already dissipating as the storm sped off into the distance and you are both stubborn and arrogant she countered wiping her face with both hands we will go back to the dig now he gave her a cursory glance and started walking when she failed to follow he stopped and looked back im not taking a single step until i get some answers mister okay he sniffed you can stay here he started off again cass watched him striding away and understood from the set of his shoulders that he would not be turning back a second time she hastened after the lanky figure listen she said falling into step beside him i want an explanation you owe me that much at least you followed me he did not look at her but kept walking i dont owe you anything that place we were just atwhere was that how did we get there what happened was it something to do with the storm you ask a lot of questions nothing like this has ever happened to me it wont happen again hey she shouted i want to know whats going on i mean to get to the bottom of this you wont try me she shot back you dont know what youre asking then tell me make it simple so ill understand people will think youre crazy so what friday turned his broad weathercreased face to her he was smiling you dont care if people think youre crazy do i look like someone who cares she demanded give it up what happened back there i already told you you said it was whatzaygheehee tsegihi he confirmed thats right what does that mean in english if possible friday nodded to himself you would say it is the spirit world that was no spirit world that was real i said you wouldnt believe it he strode on okay im sorry cass hurried after him continue please how did we get there i already told you i know i knowthe coyote bridge on the ghost road he made no reply but that is just awhat do you call it a myth or a metaphor or something if you say so no tell me i want to know what is the ghost road it is the way the medicine folk use to cross from this world to the spirit world you mean literally physically cross over yes thats impossible if you say so they had almost reached the mouth of the canyon she could see the desert beyond and judging from the long shadows cast by the saguaro and mesquite bushes the afternoon was waning towards evening among my people there are those who travel to the spirit world to perform sacred duties he paused then added i am not one of them so what are you then a tourist a faint smile touched his lips maybe so a tourist she harrumphed i dont believe you that is your choice okay sorry so youre a tourist in the spirit world we call one who travels the ghost roads a world walker right so how do you do it this world walkingwill you teach me no why not it is not for you despite her repeated attempts to cajole threaten and otherwise bully him friday refused to tell her more in the end she was forced to abandon the attempt and return to the dig to oversee the securing of the site on the ride back to town cassandra was preoccupied and distractedbehaviour that did not go unnoticed by her coworkers in the van youre a quiet one today declared anita one of the undergrads the dig relied on for donkeywork am i wondered cass sorry anything the matter i guess im just a little tired tell me about it mac had us wrestling bags of rubble all afternoon hmm cassandra gazed out the van window at the passing scenery all red and gold and purple in the early evening light it really is a beautiful landscape she said absently anita gazed at her for a moment are you sure youre all right yeah fine why shouldnt i be i thought greenough might have got to you with this news about shutting down the dig i suppose so she returned to her contemplation of the skyline with its monumental sandstone rock stacks a little while later the van convoy pulled into the motel parking lot hey cassyou going over to red rocks with us called anita as the crew disembarked and headed off across the parking lot red rocks served cheap tacos and fizzy beer and was the official digger watering hole yeah later i guess replied cassandra walking away you guys go on without me she picked up her key from the front desk and meandered to her room the kings arms motel was a tired old fleapit but it was inexpensive by sedona standards moreover it was about the only place in town halfway eager to cater to the diggers the lobby smelled of damp dog ineffectively masked by pinesol the result was acrid this sucks she thought not for the first time to be a poor academic in a resort for wealthy tourists was contrary to any expectations no picnic you couldnt turn around without being reminded that you didnt belong and moreover were just taking up space that could be better used by paying customers once in her room she threw herself down on the sagging bed and stared up at the ceiling her thoughts whirling in unison with the creaky ceiling fan she took her time showering and changing and by the time she arrived at red rocks the party was in full swing the worker bees were celebrating the fact that they had just received at least two and maybe three whole days off from the dig out of deference to the native american sensitivities and a wish to avoid confrontation with senator rodriguez and thereby deny him a soapbox joe greenough had announced that they would suspend operations over the weekend after a beer and a handful of nachos cassandra called it a night made her excuses and sneaked away she walked back to the motel by herself outwardly calm inwardly a raging turmoil of halfformed thoughts and wild speculations she closed the door to her room picked up the phone dialled and pressed the receiver to her ear while the dial tone rang again and again when no one answered she hung up and turned on the tv she sat in bed watching mindless sitcoms for an hour or so then picked up the phone again this time it was answered on the fourth ring hello this is tonyspeak to me dad cassie is that you whats wrong its me does anything have to be wrong for a girl to call her father no nonot at all honey he replied quickly its just thatdo you know what time it is uhum cass paused is it late sorry i forget about the time difference no problem sweetie im glad you called whats up nothing im sorry go back to sleep everythings fine ill call back another time cassandra her father said in a tone of voice he used when he was serious what is it im here to help she drew a deep breath dad ever have one of those days when the whole world turned upside down of course dear heart that happened to me last thursday cass could hear him move across the room and settle into his big leather chair so tell me about it whats turned your world upside down not just my world dad cass told him everybodys world in fact the entire universe has come unhinged or disconnected ori dont know what its just so weird its inexplicable wellhis laugh was a soothing sound gentle and familiar youre going to have to try or were not going to get very far thats just it i dont know how to explain okay she could hear him putting on his scientist hat dont analyse anything just start at the beginning and dont skip anything what are we dealing with at her pause he added dont thinkjust speak animal vegetable or mineral you know the vortexes she asked the famous sedona vortexes im familiar with the termfrom what youve told me i assumed it was nothing but a racket hyped up by the locals to bring in the tourist tradeexploitative hooey i suppose cassandra sighed it was true the sedona vortexes had been tarred with the tired old brush of new age claptrap whatever the scientific legitimacyif there was even a molecule of fact in the conceptthe enterprise was now the hobbyhorse of aging hippies earth goddess devotees wannabe mystics and assorted kooks quacks and fraudsters whether they existed or not vortexes were grand for the sedona economy everything from vortex jeep rides and vortex helicopter tours to vortex psychic readings and vortex energised jewellery was to be had for a nifty price are we talking about the same thing her father asked yes but something happened todaysomething really weird i guess youd call it a natural phenomenonbut of an order i have never seen before excellent before she could respond he rushed on now where were you what were you doing when you observed this phenomenon she explained about her routine the dig site what she was doing and went on to describe following friday into the canyon when it came to what happened next she faltered yes yes go on her father urged dont think just blurt it out you know how all your buddies are always talking about those extra dimensions of the universe mathematical dimensions yes well what if they werent merely mathematical she took a breath and then plunged in dad i think i travelled to a different dimension this admission was met by silence on the other end of the line dad still there you mean he began then paused and started again exactly what do you mean only that one second i was in the canyon being pelted by sand and wind and rain and the next i was dad i was standing on an alluvial pan of volcanic cindersno canyon no cacti no nothing only lines stretching to the horizon in every direction define lines her father said after a moment linesyou know like someone had taken a snow shovel and dug a shallow trough through the cinders across the plain but not arbitrary or haphazard these lines were absolutely straight and they went on for miles again there was silence finally he said was it hot today i mean hotter than usual are you drinking enough water out there dad cassandra said exasperation edging into her tone i am a seasoned proi dont get sunstroke okay you think i was hallucinating her voice rose higher it was not an hallucination or food poisoning or malaria im not having my period it was real it happened i wasnt judging you cass he protested im on your side but we have to examine every possibility rule things out youre right she sighed im sorry its just that the more i think about it the more rattled i get at the time it was weird enough but now you said friday was with you you followed him and met him in this other dimension and then what he said i shouldnt be there and he brought me back how did he do that she paused to consider he turned us around and we just started walking the wind kicked up some dust blew in my eyes and everything got a little hazy i felt the rush of wind on my face and then it started to rain when i looked up we were back in the canyon the same canyon as before her father asked right the same onethey call it secret canyon she said and paused thats all thats what happened any physical symptoms anything at all i got a little seasickqueasy dizzy and a terrific headache all that passed pretty quickly besides getting windblown and spattered from the rain nothing else was friday there too yes he brought me back as i said cass confirmed i tried to get him to explain what happened but he was very elusive about it he kept saying it wasnt for mei took that to mean for white folk in general not just myself in particularand he used all these native american names for things he called it the ghost road and coyote bridgethings like that he said we had visited the spirit world extraordinary you do believe medont you dad of course i believe you cass he said his voice full of confidence and assurance what is more i think this worthy of more extensive investigation i think id better come out there dad you dont really we need to test it document it ill bring some instruments he paused i wish your mother were here she would be in her glory cass could hear him thinking can you find this place again sure no problem but listen i was thinking that good dont do anything until i get there not a thing ill catch a flight out tomorrow afternoon can you get me a room where youre staying yes butdad im not sure this is such a good idea its settled then ill see you soon sweetie now dont mention this to anybody okay you havent have you nojust you thing is dear heart the last thing we need is a bunch of amateurs and nutcases poking around making things difficult from what you tell me sedona is full of those do you really think goodbye cassie ive got some phone calls to make dont do a thing until i get there love you click the line went dead love you too dad she held the phone for a moment then closed the cover and tossed it on the bedside table great she muttered then thought well you dolt what were you expecting you wanted to be taken seriouslywhat did you think that would look like chapter in which kit contemplates a miracle the cold seeped up through the frozen ground into the very marrow of his bones as kit lay shivering in the snow he had the feeling that he had been curled in a slowly chilling heap for days if not longerthough it could only have been a few minutes at most move he told himself or freeze where you lie slowly slowly kit rolled onto his side and looked around his head ached and his muscles were stiff and he was back back in the forest clearing back in the dead of winter back in the prehistoric past the sky was overcast and dark silent snow sifted gently down from the low heavy clouds softening the contours of the bone house constructed entirely of interlocked bonesgreat curving mammoth tusks the antlers spines and pelvises of elk buffalo antelope and pigs at least one rhinos skull innumerable ribs and leg bones of lesser creatures and who knew what else all intertwined in a crazy jigsaw pattern that formed a gently mounded dwelling that was somehow more than the sum of its disparate parts set in the centre of a circular clearing deep in the forest the odd iglooshaped hut exerted an undeniable forcean earthy primitive power like magnetism or gravity subtle but palpable the mere sight of the structure brought the vision back in all its splendour he had seen the spirit well and in some way he could not yet fathom nor even begin to describe he knew his life had changed he closed his eyes so that he could relive it all again from the beginning first he had been inside the bone house holding the ley lamp and feeling it grow warm in his hand as it became active he saw again the little lights shining blue and bright in the weird halflight of the bone house then inexplicably he had plunged through the snowpacked floor and into a realm of dazzling light and warmth a realm of breathtaking clarity where even the smallest objects possessed an almost luminous radiance his first impression was of a world of such beauty peace and harmony that it sent a pang of longing through his heart reeling from the almost intoxicating tranquillity kit had stumbled along a path lined with plants and trees of exquisite proportion in colours so vivid it made his eyes ache every leaf of every tree and plant seemed to shimmer with vitality every blade of grass radiated the same energy of unquenchable life kit walked through this lush and verdant woodland garden in a state of rapt wonder eventually reaching the edge of a lake unlike any he had ever seen before an expanse of translucent crystalline fluid with a slightly viscous quality like that of olive oil or syrup it gave off a faintly milky glow its smooth ripples shimmering with the restless energy of living light he remembered reaching out to touch that miraculous substance and then something had happened what the creak of a nearby branch cold and bending with snow brought him back to the present reality of ice and cold and prowling predators brushing clots of snow from his furs he stood and shuffled forward dropped to his hands and knees before the tunnellike entrance of the bony hut and crawled inside the interior was sunk in gloom but relatively warmat least warmer than the clearing outsidedue no doubt to the radiating presence of its sleeping occupant on impulse kit reached out to the reclining form of enul the aged primitive was warm to the touch and stirred under his hand the old one was still alive and still dreaming time the term was kits attempt to translate a concept that he could not exactly definea sort of mystical meditation or prophetic journey that involved time in some way then again maybe it was something else altogether kit settled himself beside enul and tried once more to reconstruct what had happened to him after dropping through the floor of the bone house and making the leap into the unknown he had followed a sunlit leafy trail through the paradise world as through a garden of delights eventually discovering the spirit well something had happened there at the mystical pool he had seen arthur flinderspetrie and something so incredible that even now it seemed to cast a magical glow over himif he could only remember what it was concentrate he told himself what did you see pressing cold hands to his head he squeezed his eyes shut and into his mind came the image of his own feet on that otherworldly path walking swiftly almost runningaway from the pool of light retracing his steps and then he felt himself falling his foot catching something in the patha vine maybe or the root of a tree falling hard hitting his head kit reached a hand to the back of his skull and felt a tender goose egg there yes he had fallen and struck his head of course that proved it was no dream he had been there he had witnessed a miracle that was it he had witnessed a miracle of rebirth or resurrection instantly memory snapped sharp and focused once more his mind filled with clear precise images he saw again the wondrous pool a movement at its edge had warned him to take cover amongst the foliage he withdrew into the shadows and arthur flinderspetrie had appeared at the edge of the pool carrying the body of a woman the woman clearly dead had been restored to life by the vivifying waters of that extraordinary pool cradled in the arms of arthur flinderspetrie her corpse had been carried into the water emerging a moment later fully alive kit had seen it with his own eyes the same eyes that now misted at the thought that the beautiful world he had found was now lost again the memory of that wonder so fleetingly glimpsed and experienced filled him with a longing of such intensity he could hardly breathe kit slumped back holding his throbbing head and feeling immensely sorry for himself until it occurred to him that what had been discovered once could be discovered again why not the first time had been by accident he had not even been searching the well of souls had found him so to speak this time he would find that miraculous pool and plunge himself into its living healing water with that in mind kit fished the ley lamp from its place in the interior pouch he had sewn into his deerskin shirt wilhelminas curious brass gizmo was dark now the little row of holes that glowed bright blue in the presence of telluric activity were black and empty from this kit knew the ley portal that had opened to allow him to pass to the other world was no longer active just to be sure he waved the device around the interior of the bone house the lamp remained a dark cold unlit lump of cast metal the sense of loss sharpened at the realisation that he would not be able to return to the spirit wellat least not yet not until the ley or portal opened once more he stuffed the instrument back into the pouch he would try again later resigning himself to waiting kit settled back and listening to the slow easy rhythm of the sleeping enul was soon dozing in his dreamy state kit let his mind roam where it would and it soon wandered to wilhelmina he wondered what she was doing was she still searching for him did she fear for his safety as for himself he had no such fears he had found a place among the river city dwellers and aside from the lack of a few obvious creature comforts kit was not only surviving but thriving in fact in ways he could not have predicted he was content he still wanted to go home eventually but for now it seemed right to stay if this was meant to be he could accept that thinking of wilhelmina tirelessly searching for him stirred in kit a desire to somehow reassure her that he was safe and was content to wait however long it might take im okay mina he murmured as he nodded off dont worry take your time ill be waiting for you kit dozed on and off for a while when he stirred again it was darker inside the bone house than before he yawned and stretched and looked around then saw that he was being watched you are awake enul he said aloud holding in his mind the image of a man waking up the ancient one gave the customary satisfied grunt that kit associated with assent and in his minds eye kit saw the clan sitting by a fire eating meat followed by the image of an empty mouth opening wide you are hungry asked kit rubbing his stomach in a pantomime gesture for hunger shall we go back to the camp he mimed walking with his fingers against his palm and then pointed in the vague direction of the gorge again came the grunt of affirmation and the old chieftain made to rise kit helped him sit up we can take it slow he advised forming a mental picture of this thought there is no hurry they sat in silence for a time and then enul moved to crawl out of the hut kit followed and emerged in the early twilight a snowsoftened hush lay upon the forest he could hear the soft plop of clumps falling from the branches of the trees around them the air was crisp and tasted of pine kit drew a deep breath into his lungs and exhaled feeling the icy tang on the back of his tongue enul stood for a moment gazing around listening then turned and began the trek back to the gorge and the safety of the rock ledge where the clan waited night came upon them long before they reached the valley floor kit saw torchlight winking through the trees on the trail leading to the limestone escarpment and they were soon greeted by members of river city clan who had come out to welcome them once again kit experienced the uncanny sixth sense of these primitive people he thought of it as a sort of mental radio that allowed them to communicate with one another instantaneously and over considerable distance they might have had the vocal acuity of bright toddlers but telepathically they were wizards their looks too were highly deceptive a casual observer might reasonably surmise that the typical river city clan member was a shaggy lumbering specimen slow of foot and apprehension a hulking hamfisted brute utterly lacking all human refinements in actual fact they were agile and lithe possessing a peculiar grace all their own they could move through their forested world in complete silence and near invisibility they knew how to avail themselves of every source of food on foot wing or root they possessed the gentleness patience and longsuffering tolerance worthy of saints they would never be mistaken for elegant their stocky muscular build thick limbs and broad bodies were not designed for dance but for endurance shaggy they were true but in the months kit had been with them he was no less hairy in many ways life was simpler without scissors the clansmen were glad to see them with much patting and pawing and grunts of satisfaction the two sojourners were gathered back into the fold to kit it felt like a genuine homecoming he had a place among these people yes but in light of his experience at the well of souls he could not help thinking it was something morethat he had some more definite purpose here what that purpose might be eluded him at the moment but the feeling was real and inescapable the words of sir henry came back to him no such thing as coincidence despite all that had happened to him or maybe because of it kit could accept that at face value thinking i am meant to be here now all he had to do was figure out why the welcome concluded the greeting party led them back to the winter quarters the soft flutter of the burning brands and the soft squeak of snow beneath feet swaddled in bearskin were the only sounds to mark their passing they moved along the rivers edge now iced over the snowcovered humps of stones creating a lumpy field they trooped up the narrow passage along the wall of the gorge to the generous rock ledge that was the clans winter home by the time they tumbled into camp once more kit was chilled all the way through a wide flat space on the lip of the ledge had been given over to a sizeable campfire which was kept burning day and night sleeping mats made of bundles of dried grass overspread with pelts and furs lay scattered around the perimeter of the fire and at the back of the ledge two hollowsone for food and one for waterallowed the clansmen to keep ready supplies close at hand kit threaded his way among the wellwishers and stood as close to the campfire as he dared until the flames warmed him once more strips of venison from the haunch of a deer were sizzling on wooden skewers filling the air with the aroma of roasting meat the skewers were passed hand to hand after all had eaten their fill river city settled in for the night kit sat up for a long time watching the fire and thinking about what he had experienced in the bone house and what it meant then tired at last he squeezed a place in amongst the scattered bodies and slept to the slow tick of smouldering embers it snowed throughout the night and was still snowing the next morning when enul rose and stood before the clan as they huddled around the fire kit like the others noticed at onceit was not a common actionand all looked in hushed expectation of what the ancient one would do standing before his people enul looked around and then gave a grunt into kits mind came the image of a dimly flickering light and a hand the hand was red and dripping with blood then he saw animalswhole herds of deer and antelope and great ruddyhaired slowmoving mastodonsall in motion on a great plain of tall grass the image faded and to kits surprise the hunters of the clan all rose as one and began swaying back and forth grunting their approval kit watched hoping for some other sign but nothing more was forthcoming dardokthe one kit thought of as big hunter the clan leaderrose and took up his spear he lofted it and gave a low rumbling call like that of a bull elk or buffalo the other hunters acclaimed this by lofting their own spears and repeating the bull roar then they left the rock shelter descending down the narrow passage leading to the valley floor dardok was the last to leave and as he turned to go enul made a clicking sound in his throat dardok paused something passed between old chieftain and big hunter and kit found himself the object of scrutiny dardok gave a grunt of assent and enul reached out and rested a hand on kits head at the touch kit felt a sudden surge of warmth spread through him and in his minds eye he saw himself walking with the hunters dardok regarded him expectantly by this kit knew he was meant to accompany them on their expedition dardok stooped and gathered some embers from the fire placing them in a vessel made from a hollowedout bit of wood he covered the embers with ash to preserve them then picked up his spear and left the rock ledge kit followed big hunter down the path to the frozen river and into a day bleached white as bone chapter in which confession is good for the soul wilhelmina came to the conclusion that kit had made good his escape from burleighs murderous clutches but that something had gone haywire in the leap consequently he had not ended up at the agreedupon destination in short kit was now lost somewhere in space and time fortunately she had thought to retrieve the skin map from him before he fled otherwise that would be lost too the scrap of human parchment almost translucent with age had been recovered by kit and thomas young from the tomb of anen high priest of the temple of amun during the eighteenth dynasty after examining itshe could make nothing of the obscure squiggly symbols scattered across its surfacemina had wrapped it in a bit of clean linen and hidden it in the iron strongbox bolted to the inside of the clothes chest at the foot of her bed probably i should have locked kit in the strongbox as well she thought sulkily his disappearance had caused wilhelmina no end of concern and now it was causing her sleepless nights as well what had happened to kit she had given him explicit instructionswhere to go what to doand the river ley as she called it was tried and true she knew this because she had personally explored it numerous times and found it wholly reliable boring even never had she experienced the slightest difficulty when traversing it added to that the river ley led to a very stable part of the worlda place she called simply mill valleyfor the old grain mill in its deep limestone gorge it was a peaceable rustic place that from all that mina could tell was inhabited by gentle souls who tended their flocks of geese and sheep and were scrupulous about minding their own business what could possibly have gone wrong of course knowing kit almost anything was possible she could not begin to guess what he might have done true he had fled prague on the run chased by burleigh and his gang no doubt that had complicated matters somewhat but she had covered for him on her end and taken care to arrange a failsafe hiding place trust kit livingstone to bollix things up big time even given the fraught situation surrounding his disappearance she should still have been able to locate him when the heat died down the fact that after repeated attempts in numerous time periods she had not been able to locate himand she did keep trying faithfully whenever she had a spare momentwas deeply worrying if kit had been wounded or worse killed she would doubtless have found his body on the trail when she searched the ley on the other side dead or injured his body might have been dragged off somewhere by a wild animal but there would have been signs of that and in numerous searches she had turned up nothing to indicate a mauling or a struggle of any kind added to this she had giles eyewitness testimony that kit got clean away which she had no reason to doubtall the more because her sources indicated that burleigh for all his trying had not been able to find kit alive or dead either the current report that kit in a frantic attempt to escape capture had leapt into the river and tried to swim to freedom was merely a ruse concocted to hide the fact that he had escaped via minas ley line and just supposing kit had panicked and done something so harebrained as jumping into the river and getting himself drowned his soggy corpse would have fetched up downstream just to be sure she had made discreet inquiries with the local officials in the towns and villages all along the moldau no one had found so much as a washedup shoe so now weeks later frustrated and perturbed wilhelmina was at the end of her expertise she had one last recourse if that did not succeed there was no hope in the meantime she applied herself to learning the subtleties of the new and improved ley lampthe upgraded version of the one she had slipped to kit to aid his escape the new model like the first had been supplied by her friend and coconspirator gustavus rosenkreuz a young alchemist in the emperors court rudolf ii maintained a cabal of palace alchemists charged with the duty of lifting the veil on various mysteries of the universe chief among them immortality and how to achieve it this august and imposing work was led by herr doctor bazalgette one of the emperors favourites and gustavus was his much putupon personal assistant naturally such blindingly arcane labour necessitated regular refreshment which the alchemists took at the grand imperial the weirdly cloakedandhatted coterie maintained a ready presence in the kaffeehaus and wilhelmina made certain they always had a good table and the best of etzels sweet pastries through gustavus she supplied the alchemists with the bitter earthspent coffee groundsthat they valued so highly for their obscure experiments by way of reciprocation if not revenge for his neglect at the hands of his superiors young rosenkreuz supplied her with useful information and happily another illicit copy of burleighs latest leyfinding instrument if his lordship ever found out that mina had a spy inside the palacethe same person in fact seconded to fashion the earls special devices for himthe full extent of wilhelminas deception would be revealed and her life would be forfeit she shuddered to think what the earl of sutherland would do if he ever found out she possessed copies of his gizmos whatever form it took she had no doubt his revenge would be complete and deeply unpleasant one bright day in early winter a month or so after kits disappearance wilhelmina pulled on her coat and shawl and took the mule and wagon out into the countryside to experiment with the new and improved ley lamp despite repeated efforts she had yet to discover the extent of its alleged enhancements she did not doubt improvements had been made according to rosenkreuz lord burleighs investment in the new device had been considerable everything from the rare elements that powered the lampincluding gold platinum and other precious metals and more exotic earths like radium lithium phosphorus and some even the alchemists had never seenhad been obtained by the earl at great expense presumably the increased benefit was thought to be worth the high price paid to realise it the improvements were there waiting to be discovered mina just did not know what they were upon reaching the river ley she turned the mule onto the narrow path that ran between a double row of beech trees arrow straightits end if there was one lost in the shadowed distance she tethered the mule and fitted the sturdy animal with a nosebag so it could eat while she was gone then tying her shawl more tightly around her shoulders she pulled the new ley lamp from her skirt pocket the basic size and shape was much the same as the originalthe one she had sent away with kit made of brass burnished with a swirling filigree of swooping lines connecting tiny holes it was bluntly rounded like a watersmoothed river stone and big enough to fit comfortably in the palm of the hand but unlike a stone heavier for its size the new version had more holes and a series of small nubby protrusionsfor grip controls of some sort wilhelmina could not say she began walking at a slow steady pace holding the lamp comfortably before her she had taken but a few steps when as expected the little row of holes along the curved side began to glow with the distinctive indigo light this mina knew indicated the presence of a ley she felt the small hairs on the nape of her neck prickle to the energy around her not wishing to make a jump just yet she stopped in the path while she waited for the energy to dissipate she found herself thinking about etzel back at the kaffeehaus and what a patient understanding man he wasa random thought for no apparent reason the new ley lamp flickered to life a heretofore unrecognised row of tiny holes lit up with a pale yellowish glow on closer examination mina saw that the series of holes in the brass carapace ran completely around the perimeter of the instrument the light was weak and would have been almost imperceptible in stronger sunlight but in amongst the trees she could make it out well enough even as the thought passed through her mind the little yellow lights faded and died she stared at the thing resisting the urge to shake it gently and instead began walking again to see if that would bring them back it did not motion then was not the trigger she then began to try out various combinations in walking touching and direction as they occurred to her this went on for a fair amount of time but produced no result at all the perimeter holes resisted any attempt on her part to coax them back into life finally frustration got the better of her and fed up she turned around and started back to retrieve the mule and wagon gus she muttered aloud what have you given me at the mention of the alchemists name the yellow lights sparked with a faint gleam the effect was so quick and so definite she did not fail to discern the connection she stopped and took a deep breath clearing her mind of all thought then very deliberately she brought the image of kit to mind and held it the pale yellow glow faded and the tiny holes went dark thats it cried wilhelmina it works on sound gazing at the device she raised it before her face and speaking slowly and clearly said kit but the holes remained unlit kit she said again but to no avail bother she grumped just when i thought on a sudden inspiration she brought an image of etzel to mind once moreetzel as she had last seen him working in the kitchen immediately the row of lights took on the lookedfor gleam wilhelmina stared at the instrument in amazement not sound but thought she whispered still holding etzels pleasant round face before her minds eye she turned in the general direction of the city and the row of lights grew gently brighter with those pointed more directly towards the city taking on a deeper warmer hue then as a test she switched the mental image back to kit and the little lights immediately dimmed and went out i am gobsmacked she raised the ley lamp and pressed it to her lips you clever little thing she tried the same small experiment a few more times and each time obtained the same result the lights winked on when thinking of etzel whom she knew to be in pragueand blinked off the moment she shifted her attention to kit for a more difficult trial she thought of thomas young the archaeologist she had sought out to help kit excavate the tomb containing the skin map again the yellow lights came up fainter this time the marginally brighter area shifted along the perimeter pointing vaguely towards the southeast directional signs nice touch she thought instantly the lights went out now what she stared at the gizmo what had she done to make it behave that way she decided to try again and consciously drew up the image of dr young once more the lights flicked on as intense as before then on a whim she dismissed the doctor and thought instead about giles again the little lights flickered slightly then glowed but the ring around the edge moved the brighter lights indicating a different direction inbloodycredible wilhelmina murmured shaking her head in wonder she tested this theory a few more times to be certaineach test with a different personand it did seem to be the case that whenever she thought of someone she knew whether in a separate dimension or not the device reacted but as soon as the mental link with the desired object of her attention was broken the lights fadedas if connection severed the line went dead head swimming with the implications of her discovery she stood in the narrow gap between the trees gazing at the device only stirring from her contemplation when she heard the rooks calling in the trees surrounding the adjacent fields and smelled pungent wood smoke on the airhearth fires were being lit in nearby farmhouses the short day was swiftly fading evening was moving in stowing the ley lamp safely in her pocket once more wilhelmina hurried back to the mule and wagon and returned to the city her mind filled with questions and halfformed possibilities indeed it would take her some time to fully appreciate let alone comprehend the capabilities of the new instrument and what it all meant that could come later there was something she had to do first right away before she did another thing mina drove the mule and cart straight back to the city the torches and smudge pots were being lit for the night as she passed through the gates with a wave to the gatemen she rambled up the long street that led into the old town square she left the wagon outside the kaffeehaus and went inside the air was warm and full of the yeasty scent of dough on the rise mina drew a breath deep into her lungs a few patrons idled over their coffee and strudel in an atmosphere of peace and calm the warm scent of fresh coffee and rising dough mingled in the air i love this place she thought is there anywhere better than this she called a breezy greeting to her patrons and staff as she swept through the dining room and headed straight for the kitchen where etzel was instructing two of his young helpers about the next days preparations we will make braided raisin bread tomorrow he was saying see that the baking trays are clean and ready before you leave tonight he half turned as wilhelmina entered the room ach mein schatz he said breaking into a smile when he saw her there you are hilda was looking for you i will see her later she gave him a quick peck on the cheek then turned to one of the assistants hans the wagon is outside take it to the stable please and see the mules water bucket is full give him an extra handful of grain jawohl fraulein mina replied the young baker smartly barthelm she said to the other helper go with him i wish to speak to herr stiffelbeam alone the two kitchen aides left the room come etzel she said as soon as they were gone she took his hand in hers and led him to the worktable i want you to sit down mina what is it is something wrong nothing is wrong she assured him but i have to tell you something she drew a stool from beneath the table and perched him on it then paused thinking how to begin concern and curiosity wheeled across his goodnatured face wilhelmina smiled dear etzel she sighed what will i do without you i hope you will not have to do without me herzerl he said but that is what i have to say she took his hand again and clasping it in both of hers raised it to her lips i think i may have to go away for a while and i want you to know the reason so you wont worry about me go away his expression grew puzzled why where will you go i have a confession to make she said this will not be the first time i have gone away i know you go out into the country he said to talk to the farmers and the beekeepers that is true she allowed but there is more i have been travelling to other places too many other places he stared at her in baffled silence etzel she said softly it is time you knew the whole truth some of the places where i go are not of this world he continued to gaze at her until at last the light of understanding shone in his eyes nodding slowly he replied ach mein schatz we are none of us belonging to this world chapter in which lord burleigh takes a stroll archibald burley walked as he walked everywhere these days with a sprightly spring in his step life in all its unique and unqualified splendour stretched before him in glittering vistas of happiness success and unstinting prosperity as themanalsoknownas lord archelaeus burleigh earl of sutherland his acumen in finding and securing the best artefacts and passing them on to londons elite collectors had established him on the upper rungs of londons social ladder his eye for authenticity was extraordinary and his judgement second to none as the premiere purveyor of the finest antiquities and objets de desir for the aristos and wouldbe uppercrusties burleighs prices were as breathtaking as the artefacts were exquisite and beautiful and with the current craze for all things classical the young earl was squirreling away the dosh by the cartload if business was good his personal life was even better in fact he could not recall a time when he had ever felt such joy confident optimistic and so brimming over with good cheer he all but sloshed as he walked following the untimely demise of his guardian mentor and benefactor lord gower archie had been at liberty to be do and go as he pleased and he luxuriated in the freedom he did not squander either his wealth or opportunity like so many of his ilkthe poor barrow boys ragamuffins and street urchins who by one means or another occasionally manage to rise above their station and gain a toehold on a higher rung of societys ladder his rising fortunes notwithstanding topping archibalds list of reasons to be cheerful was the gladsome fact that he was in love the object of his affection was the estimable beauty phillipa harveyjones daughter of the notorious empire builder reginald harveyjones whose roster of industrial conquests was precisely as long as his inventory of enemies truth be told the earl of sutherland was not the man harveyjones would have chosen for his beloved pippa ever the shrewdly calculating businessman reg considered young burleigh a jumpedup northern bounder with a dubious title yet for reasons he could not fathom phillipa loved the darkhaired lord so there was nothing to be done about it but pour the champagne and announce the nuptials that this had not yet happened was not for lack of trying on pippas part she nudged and coaxed her paramour as sweetly as any maid ever coaxed a beau but there always seemed to be some excuse why this or that close date could not be countenanced the latest obstacle was an urgent business trip to italy to collect certain promised objects for an influential client we will be married as soon as i return burleigh declared he stroked her hand in the hope of making his words more palatable you said that last time she pointed out her lower lip protruding in a pout the situation is quite different this time he insisted not ungently if i win my way with lord and lady coleridge our future in society is secured clients will beat a path to my door youll want for nothing all i want she replied petulantly is you and you shall have me my sweet he raised her hand and brushed it with his lips one more trip and you shall have me all to yourself forever after how long will you be away only as long as it takes the ship to sail there and back must you really go yourself can you not send someone to collect these trinkets for you if only i could sighed the young lord but no the thing must be done by me in person there is less risk of anything going wrong and i dare not hazard the loss of this sale he patted her hand when i return we shall be married with unseemly haste i promise we had better she replied accepting his assurances at last i shall content myself with picking out my trousseau in your absence and all the restchina linens crystal silverware everything choose whatever you like my love for if you like it then i am sure to like it too they talked about where they would like to honeymoon and other pleasantries and this carried them up to the day of burleighs embarkation he called on her a few hours before sailing time and made his final farewell they shared a kiss or two and then he departed no one but the coach driver saw him walk onto the dock to board the waiting ship and that was the last that anyone in london saw of him for a very long time as for burleigh the trip began as routine and uneventful as any traveller could wish the shipa fairsized packet steamer christened gipsy called on ports along the french spanish and italian coasts she was tight and seaworthy the captain a capable and conscientious seaman who had served in the royal navy the steamer made its appointed rounds collecting and delivering mail and freight and passengers to their destinations and picking up the same for return to england when asked later the captain did remember dining with the young earl during the voyage the purser even recalled seeing burleigh drive off in a hired coach at livornothis he remembered because the earl had made a point of booking the same cabin for his return journey when the ship was to call back in ten days time in any event the young lord failed to appear and gipsy returned to england without him after disembarking burleigh wended his way to florence where he acquired a small painting of the duke of montefeltro two cameos from the time of emperor trajan and a marble bust of cicero from there he went on to the capital to conduct his principal business somewhere between florence and rome so far as anyone was able to figure out disaster struck the coach had put up for the night in viterbo and burleigh checked into the inn he had a fine supper of fresh river perch and a mushroom rissole and went to bed early the next morning the coach continued the journey but a mile or so outside town one of the horses threw a shoe and pulled up lame this necessitated a wait while a blacksmith was fetched burleigh and the only other passengera talkative italian lawyer by the name of lorenzo de pontedecided to stretch their legs they began walking the day was pleasant and the rural countryside a veritable medieval painting come to life have you ever seen one of the old etruscan roads i cannot say that i have replied burleigh i am not surprised said the lawyer they are not well known beyond the region would you like to see one the young lord regarded the roughcobbled road on which they stood am i to take it that this is one of them he indicated the bumpy stoneflagged path stretching before them across the countryside lorenzo chuckled by no means my friend this is a roman road etruscan roads are far older also they cannot be seen at burleighs dubious expression he laughed again and explained they are below ground you see burleighs italian was not as good as his french or german so he asked below ground underground do you mean subterranean no not like a tunnel the affable lawyer pointed off across the landscape and said this way i will show you as they walked the fellow explained i grew up in tarquinia not far from here it is in what was once known as etruria which is called tuscany now the etruscans were very clever people yes they invented many useful things but they were also very mysterious they invented many mysteries too i think lorenzo led them off the road across a shallow ditch and over a stubble field towards what appeared to be a cleft or fold in the landscape they built houses of stone with red clay tiles and running water they built wonderful temples and palaces and tombsmany many tombs you never saw people who built so many tombs they also built roadstwo kinds ordinary roads they made for travel and secret roads for their secret ceremonies how very odd replied burleigh his sense of interest quickening the mention of tombs and palaces brought the possibility of antiquities instantly to mind etruscan art was an area he knew little aboutwhich meant it was an arena ripe for exploration and plunder tell me more these etruscans carved their secret roads deep into the tufa stonethe soft volcanic rock yes and they carved for miles and miles he waved his hands at the low hills around them sometimes these roads connect the ancient towns and villages but most times they simply connect one strange place with another andhe raised a finger for emphasisthey are always always lined with tombs also carved in the tufa stone extraordinary said burleigh these tombsare they ever explored always and are there objects artefacts but of course wonderful things they were very good craftsmen and they made fine ceramicsand tiny little figures in iron we find these things all the time fascinating i would be most interested to see some of them that could easily be arranged lorenzo assured him i have a friend in firenze who can oblige he stopped walking but now behold burleigh looked around but saw nothing they had come to the edge of the cleft and so he took another step closer and looked down into a deep trench that as the lawyer had said was carved into the underlying tufa the trench was perhaps twenty feet deep and no more than eight or ten feet wide and it ran along the natural fold of the hill the local people call them spirit roadsor ghost roads he shook his head gently as he peered into the shadowed trench they were considered sacred but how they were used no one knows it is one of the etruscan mysteries can we go down there lorenzo hesitated getting down is no difficulty he smiled getting out againthat is the problem he looked down the length of the sacred road you might have to walk many miles before you find a place to climb out again i would not advise it he stepped back from the edge perhaps another time i did not hear that came the shouted reply youll have to speak up when de ponte turned back burleigh was nowhere to be seen he stepped to the edge of the trench and saw the young earls face smiling up at him sorry he said couldnt resist he looked around this is extraordinary might as well explore a little as long as im down here i would not take too long the lawyer suggested we do not wish to delay the coach youre right i hadnt thought of that burleigh confessed casually ill just walk along here a little way and see if i can find a place to climb out yes that would be best lorenzo cast a hasty glance in the direction of the road still empty perhaps i should go back and wait for the coach i dont see it yet but it could be along any minute righto burleigh agreed we dont want to miss it unless you think you will need help climbing out no no i should be able to manage that easily enough burleigh said im just going to walk along here a little way and find a good place i think i see one a little way ahead you go on and hold the coach very well if you insist i do insist burleigh told him you run along now i will join you in a moment lorenzo hurried off and returned to the roadside where he spent an idle twenty minutes watching the highway for the horses and carriage and searching the countryside for the earl as he feared the coach with its newly shod lead horse appeared first the driver slowed the carriage as the italian gentleman hurried to meet it signor de ponte called the driver as he brought the horses to a halt where is our other passenger he will be coming along shortly answered the lawyer and went on to explain about the earl wishing to explore the sunken etruscan road please wait here and i will go and bring him now by all means said the driver but hurry please or we shall be late arriving in florence dont worry he is just over there i will fetch him at once lorenzo began walking rapidly along the side of the trench calling out for burleigh as he went when he failed to receive a reply one way he turned around and walked a fair distance the other calling for burleigh every few yards or so there was never any answer to his repeated cries i fear something ill has befallen our friend de ponte announced upon his return to the coach i called as loudly as i could but there was no answer he might have fallen and struck his head i think we must go down and search for him this is what they did the driver and his assistant climbed down into the deepcut road and proceeded to search for the lost passengerone going north the other south along the ancient pathway they ended up searching the entire twomile length of the sunken causeway but failed to turn up so much as a muddy footprint so after leaving word of the young mans disappearance with local farmers lorenzo reluctantly agreed that there was little more to be done and allowed the coach to continue on to florence where he immediately informed the authorities of his companions strange disappearance to be sure a formal investigation was begun at once the next morning a search party was organised the ancient etruscan road scoured end to end and flyers distributed throughout the area in case anyone should stumble upon a lost or injured foreigner none of these efforts met with any success and although the case remained officially open without any new evidence there was nothing more to be donesave inform the british embassy this they duly did allowing for the more relaxed attitude of the mediterranean temperament then the polizia and carabinieri and lorenzo de ponte settled back to await further developments sadly no news was ever forthcoming no one involved in the whole curious affair ever learned what had happened to the earl of sutherland chapter in which a new thing comes to pass kit followed the little band of hunters along the frozen river as it wound in great curving arcs towards the south and west there were eight in all seven clansmen and kit led by dardok forging a path through the snow lining the riverbank they walked by day beneath low heavyladen skies sometimes with a little wind at their backs which seemed to urge them on their way ice narrowed the river margins and chunks of snow and slush floated downstream they walked in a constant fog produced by their own breath crystallising in the frigid air pausing every now and then to scan the rock walls of the gorge for any sign of predators all the while the snow fell lightly but steadilysmall hard flakes that dropped like frozen grit and squeaked underfoot the air was cold stinging all exposed flesh but the exertion of the trek warmed him well enough and after days lounging around the fire the exertion felt good kit was reminded yet again of the clansmens natural hardinesstheir strength stamina and endurance far exceeded anything he had ever encountered in his own species and as the day lengthened he hoped he would be able to keep up eventually they came to a place where they were forced to scramble up a steep incline to a higher plateau at the top dardok paused and kit puffing from the climb joined the hunters as they stood gazing down into the gorge now far below kit thought they were looking at the river but upon joining them saw that dardok had spotted a herd of the shaggy longhorned bison that usually roamed the reaches of the higher forests the beasts were moving slowly and laboriously along the river forging through the snow kit experienced a visceral thrill at the sight and caught something of the bands instinctive urge to go after good meat on the hoof they watched for a moment as the dozen or so brown humpbacked creatures ambled along then dardok turning his head this way and that and sniffing deeply gave out a little grunt kit followed his example and caught the merest whiff of a sharp sour scent on the air the others murmured softly having also recognised the smell kit looked to the big hunter for an explanation and dardok extended his finger and pointed to a stony outcrop across the gorge a little above the riverbed squinting his eyes against the white kit made out the pale grey muscular form of an animal he recognised as caninea beast easily two times the size of a normal wolf a dire wolf the creature was watching the bison herd traversing the valley and no doubt licking its chops dardok pointed again and kit saw another slightly smaller wolf watching from a stone ledge below them clearly the predators were tracking the bison stalking the herd and awaiting a chance to make a kill silently as shadows the hunters edged away from the overlook and moved on the river valley which had been bending ever farther westward now began swinging away to the south the ground continued to rise and the woodland closed around them becoming a tangle of brush and closegrown trees with no clear path through progress slowed to a laborious crawl the party strung out single file and kit falling farther and farther behind had begun to fear he would lose sight of his companions when dardok suddenly came to a halt the hunters quickly gathered around him and kit hurried forward to see what had happened he found them all squatting in the snow transfixed by something they saw there peering over the head of the nearest hunter kit saw the tracks of a large and heavy animal in the snow bear he asked then remembered to use their word for the animal gangor he held the image of a large black bear in his mind dardok gave a forceful snort which kit had learned to interpret as a negative the big hunter spread his fingers and placed them in one of the imprints then he raised his hand and made a clawed paw karka he said aloud kit had never heard the word before karka he repeated dardok uttered a grunt of satisfaction and pointed to the line of tracksfirst one then the next then with the tip of his spear the big hunter indicated a long slash between two of the tracks and made a flourish with the flat of his hand the action was so expressive kit could not fail to understand a beast walking its tail sweeping the snow now and then again dardok pointed to the tracks karka into kits mind came the image of a great shaggy animal the size of a small cow but with a huge head supported by a huge neck and muscular shoulders it had a short mane that wreathed its jaws and ran down its sloping back in the form of a ridge of spiky dark fur kit knew instantly what it was he had seen one before in another time in another place at the end of a chain it was a cave cat older brother to the beast the burley men called baby karka breathed kit with his broad hand dardok swept the print away then rose and resumed the trek they soon came to a place where the river gorge made a wide arcing curve bending around to the north the valley below widened and flattened out and the cliff top on which they walked began to descend to meet it falling to within thirty metres or so of the riverbank a little farther on dardok found a trail and led the party down to the valley floor he halted there to take a good sniff of the wind and satisfied there were no predators lurking about led them around the arc of the river to a massive wall of pale limestone he stopped again and gazed around scanning the rocks and cliffs above as well as the riverbanks then moved cautiously towards the wall it was only as they neared this curtain of stone rising sheer from the valley floor that kit saw the holean empty oval a few metres in radius and not more than three metres off the valley floor the entrance to a cave a tumble of rocks lined the base of the wall and dardok moved towards them slowing as he came to stand below the hole in the wall kit felt a shiver of awareness and the party instantly contracted into a tight knot scanning the area he saw what had drawn the others attention on the rocks below the hole were more tracks identical to those they had seen on the bluffs above kit stared at the tracks in the snow and then smelled the sharp animal pong an image came into his mind a great slabsided dark beast with massive forequarters powerful haunches and a shaggy brindled coat karka the wooden vessel containing the embers was pressed into kits hands and dardok turned to the others in his head kit heard the brief flutter of thoughts as they passed among the hunters and though he could not understand what he heard he glanced up to where they were looking and saw the big cat standing in the entrance to the hole it was watching them its huge yellow eyes narrowed its ears flattened to its enormous head instinctively kit stepped backwards then everything seemed to happen all at once the great cat sprang from the mouth of the cave forelegs outstretched scimitar claws extended the hunters scattered darting away in every direction kit turned to flee slipped in the snow and went down losing his grip on the emberbearing vessel the cave lion landed on the rocks below the cave mouth its head whipping first one way and then the other as it determined which of the many victims provided the nearest easiest kill it saw kit floundering in the snow and crouched gathering itself to pounce the huge head lowered as the immense body contracted muscles bulginga coil tightening before releaseand kit swam backwards through the snow kicking his legs his arms windmilling the cave lion leapt a slight lift of its chest and the creature was in the air in the same moment dardok darted to kits side with a grace born of endless practise big hunters massive arm drew back the spear point came up and with only the merest pause flashed forward dardoks shoulders and torso followed as he delivered the full weight of his body behind the throw the rude weapon sliced the air in a tight arc and struck home with the sound of an openfisted slap the shaft buried its razorsharp flinthead between the ribs of the enormous cat just behind the front legs ears flat baleful eyes glaring its great mouth open in a snarl of pain and rage karka spun to confront the attack a second missile was already in the aira blur of motion that ended as the spear sprouted from the beasts thick neck the lion swiped at the missile and succeeded in dislodging the shaft it gathered itself to pounce but dardok gave out a cry and hunters advanced on the run darting in behind their spears to stab and jab before darting away againfirst one side and then the other keeping the angry animal off balance and confused dardok turned and swooped on kit picking him up and setting him on his feet in one swift motion pressing a big hand to kits chest he pushed him back then with a mighty shout ran to join the fray the lion bleeding now from several wounds roared to shake the stones from the earth with great slashes of its claws the cat tried to catch its tormenters as one at a time they darted nearer big hunter dared the claws and in an act of courage that took kits breath away snatched his spear from the beasts side growling spitting the great cat spun and raked the air with its claws dardok dodged just out of reach and then plunged the spear point into the creatures side the cat loosed a scream of pure hatred and rage and turnednot toward dardok this time but awayjust as another of the band leapt in to retrieve his weapon karkas huge paw met the oncoming clansman and ripped through his side opening a fourfold wound across his belly the hapless hunter staggered from the blow and looked down his fur clothing in shreds and then the muscle cords severed and a gout of blood and bowels gushed from the wound the man crumpled as if made of paper dardok gave a cry of rage and drove in again stabbing down into the cave lions huge muscled neck he buried the stone blade deep and leapt away again the other hunters continued their feinting attack careful to remain just out of reach of those killing claws every thrust nick and stab drew blood staining the snow in a wide circle as the beast thrashed and gyrated trying to capture another of its tormentors meanwhile dardok ran to the injured hunter and seized him by the arm kit ran to help him and together they dragged him out of the way blood welled from his injury the mans face was white and his lips were blue and trembling his body shook kit bent over him gripping his hand the hunter his eyes wide gave out a sighing groan as a spasm seized him then abruptly relaxed leaving kit holding the hand of a dead man behind them the cave cat gave out a bonerattling yowl the creature reared up on its hind legs towering over its attackers it made another ineffectual swipe with a mighty paw then turned to retreat the hunters were ready as the big cat spun around to scramble back up the rocks and into the shelter of the cave behind it the nearest hunter lunged driving the stone point of his spear deep into the lions side just behind the forelegs the cat screamed and turned half rising up on its haunches the clansman held firm to the shaft of the spear forcing it deeper the lion raked at the hateful weapon and a second hunter dashed in from the other side he was followed by a third and the three held the writhing beast pinioned as a fourth hunter took careful aim and plunged his spear into the lions massive chest the last wound was fatal the lion gave a final roar and its legs collapsed beneath it the great body rolled onto its side and the creature subsided with a long gurgling sigh even dead the animal presented an aspect of tremendous power and fearsome grace dardok pulled his spear from the carcass and wiped the stone point on its bloody pelt he then knelt and placed his hand on the big cats head one by one the other hunters followed his example they remained in this attitude for a long moment and then rose and taking up their spears once more walked away without a backward glance kit hesitated what about their dead comrade he wondered they had shown a moments respect for the dead lion why not their clansman wait kit called after them his shout was not understood but it produced the desired effect of halting them stepping to the poor mangled corpse of the hunter kit fought down a queasy sickness at the horrendous gaping wound he knelt and began pulling together the bloody bits of fur straightening the mans limbs and wiping the blood from his face as he worked kit became aware that the others had gathered close and were watching him when he finished arranging the body he rose and searching along the base of the limestone wall gathered stones and placed them around the body once the corpse was outlined he proceeded to cover it dardok was first to catch hold of the idea imitating kits example he joined in building the burial mound the others were quick to follow big hunters lead soon all were busy adding stone to stone until the body of the hunter was completely subsumed beneath a neat oblong heap of stone kit stood and feeling that he should say or do something to mark the occasion stretched his hand over the grave and after a moments contemplation said creator of all that is and will be we give you back one of your creations his life in this world was taken from him but we ask that you receive him into the life of the world that has no end this impromptu prayer shocked kit fully as much as it surprised his companions what they made of it he could not guess the sentiment and words to express it had simply materialised on his tongue as he spoke still now that they were said he felt there was a rightness about them both words and sentiment seemed good and proper he raised his head and gave a grunt of satisfaction the hunters could not mistake then picking up the dead hunters spear he stepped away from the mound he had gone but a few steps when he felt dardoks hand on his shoulder the gesture stopped him in his tracks and held him there for a few moments before releasing him again no other communication took place but kit understood a profound connection had been made a link forged in the minds of all who had witnessed kits improvised burial rite a new thing had come to pass and it was now acknowledged nothing else was needed chapter in which subversion is plotted lady haven fayth was accustomed to skating on thin ice where her relationship with the vile lord burleigh was concerned but cracks of doubt were beginning to show beneath her blades and she was having to skate faster and faster to stay ahead of his racing suspicions she could sense that a parting of the ways loomed she would like to have learned more from him about ley leapingat least sounded the depths of his knowledge to find out how extensive it was but time was against her now and the best she could hope for was to make sure that the inevitable separation happened on her terms not his the black earls present distraction might be she reasoned the perfect opportunity to make good her own escape her captor and erstwhile coconspirator was at the present moment wholly consumed by the kit livingstone affairand not without good reason secure in the knowledge that kitalong with cosimo sir henry and giles had met his ultimate end and been entombed in the sepulchre of high priest anen burleigh had come to prague to collect the latest version of his leyhunting device hot off the workbench of the emperors chief alchemist bazalgette the cunning little instrument was made of brass and was about the size and shape of a cobblestone but that was about all she knew of it haven had only glimpsed it fleetingly and furtively because his lordship kept it like much else entirely to himself haven suppressed a laugh recalling the look of disbelief on burleighs face when he was informed that the presumedtobedeceased kit livingstone was surprise alive and well and loose in the streets of prague the resulting chase succeeded only in wounding the coachman giles kit had escaped and the burley men were held to blame for the debacle for the last four days the black earl and his louts had been combing the countryside for kit at first they merely searched the physical geography of the areathe hedgerows villages barns and even the riverand when that failed to raise any material evidence the search was expanded to include any ley lines within reach of the fleeing man they had found a likely ley in the vicinity of their initial chase but a thoroughgoing search of the destination on the other side failed to raise a trail as day gave way to day and reports from the burley men brought them no closer to finding the fugitive his lordships temper darkened the more he was angry at everyone and everything angry at being lied tothough the burley men denied this vehementlyangry at the lack of results angry that his plans were being stymied by a mere knownothing nobody angry at his own failure to get his hands on the one piece of the skin map he knew where to find none of this was havens fault a fact she was not hesitant to point out she most strenuously distanced herself from the current disaster hoping to remain aloof from the steadily mounting storm of his lordships wrath there is some deception here that i have yet to penetrate burleigh declared on his return to the inn it was the evening of the fifth night of the futile search and his mood was toxic livingstone has been aided and abetted in his escape that is the only explanationat least it is the only explanation that makes sense the weather had turned cold and wet with a foretaste of the winter to come lady fayth was sewing new buttons onto a coat she had bought in the market replacing the wooden ones with silver lord burleigh sank into a chair by the fireplace and summoned one of the inns serving boys to come and remove his muddy boots clean them and bring them back when you are finished he commanded his german lumpy but understandable have the landlord fetch me something to drinka jar of mulled ale will suffice for now get on with you and be quick about it the lad scurried off he had learned to obey swiftly and without question when the earl spoke you say kit is a knownothing haven ventured and by all indications it would seem that you are correct in your assessment if that be so then what can it possibly matter that he has escaped because he is a thorn in the flesh snarled burleigh he is an increasingly troublesome obstruction to the ongoing search for the map he is a rival and a threat haven did not raise her eyes from her work hardly that i think do you doubt it i doubt it very much indeed sir she replied he is as you have painted hima nothing a nobody his only attachment to this enterprise was through his greatgrandfather cosimo that tether has been severed and kit has no idea what to do or where to go next in the brief time i was with him he showed no volition and demonstrated no extraordinary understanding of the enterprise in which he was involved my impression too affirmed burleigh entirely why not simply put him out of your mind kit livingstone is of no consequence whatever his understanding may be it can have no bearing on your designs how is his presence in prague to be explained just coincidence surely she suggested passing the needle through the button and into the cloth in a single smooth stroke everyone must be somewhere after all but why here burleigh growled watching her i think he was here for a reason and i want to know what it was that woman at the coffeehouse is mixed up in thisi know it who haven raised an eyebrow one of the serving girls nonot a servant blind you the other one haven stared at him blankly i cannot for the life of me think who you must mean the tall one he snarled the english manageress or owner or whateverim telling you she knows more than she lets on you are chary by nature lady fayth suggested returning to her work it does you no good here we are flailing about uselessly when we could be getting on with the hunt that is surely more important than running down kit livingstone she was poking around the palace trying to ingratiate herself at court thats where i met her you knowthe first time i came here a right miss busybody haven drew the needle up through the button are we talking about the woman from the coffeehouse again she implied she knew about my travels or something of the sort burleigh continued i warned the wench in no uncertain terms to keep her nose out of my affairs then i am certain she has taken your good advice to heart concluded haven sweetly anyway she can have no idea about any of this living here in prague and running a coffeehouseone is hardly liable to stumble across anything of value to our cause perhaps we should go talk to her he said find out what she knows haven lowered her work into her lap and gave the exhausted earl a look of sharp appraisal the woman is hardly going to cooperate after your heavyhanded intimidation if she does know anything you would be the last person in whom she would confide burleigh frowned then brightened as a new thought came to him you could go me lady fayth feigned disapproval i cannot see what good that would do i can think of nothing worthwhile to say to her you could come alongside herwomantowoman be her friend gain her confidence do you honestly imagine that will achieve some positive result haven asked still shaking her head she would talk to you insisted burleigh get her to confide in you a manageress haven made a wry face what could she possibly know that would be of the most remote interest to us or to the success of our venture that declared burleigh decisively is what you must discover he thought for a moment no no he said slowly better still gain her confidence and invite her to dinner tomorrow lure her here and i will take care of the rest once we get her upstairs alone well find out what she knows soon enough lady fayth having given an entirely believable performance of the reluctant accomplice agreed to take on the chore and took herself to the grand imperial the next afternoon she was there waiting when wilhelmina returned from another unsuccessful attempt to locate kit the two exchanged a knowing glance and wilhelmina after greeting etzel filled a pot with fresh coffee and sat down with her ally to share information on the state of the game so far i cannot understand the black earls interest in kit lady fayth mused on the one hand he insists that kit knows nothing useful to the quest on the other hand he refuses to simply let him go we have already stayed in prague far longer than originally intended and there are no plans at present to leave burleigh is not being entirely truthful observed mina no doubt the shock of seeing kit here in prague when he thought him dead and buried in egypt revived his interestat least insofar as he assumes kit must have had help to escape the tomb she thought for a moment has he said anything about this he has vouchsafed nothing specific or germane to the issue at hand his lordships hirelings have borne the brunt of his anger on that account and they have paid dearly for their lapse her lips curled in a conspiratorial smile nevertheless they have helped our causeunwittingly it must be saidby maintaining the fiction that the prisoners were in the tomb when the wadi was abandoned to admit anything more would merely bring even greater approbation down upon their sorry heads poor things wilhelmina said without the least shred of pity as it stands kit is the object of the earls present obsession the quest i suspect will not go forward until kit is found as to that our nemesis intends on casting the net wider he intends to find out what you know about this affair lady fayth sipped her coffee and watched wilhelmina for a response mina took this information in stride he is grasping at straws she thought for a moment what form would this interrogation take you might well ask he has prevailed upon me to be the agent of his inquiry she offered a cheerful smile i am to gain your trust and induce you to confide in me under the guise of a dinner invitation he would lure you to the inn take you prisoner and menace you into revealing your secrets wilhelminas brow creased with concern of course haven continued quickly it goes without saying that we must decide between ourselves what we want him to know then we must think very carefully what to tell him agreed wilhelmina she reached for the little pewter pot more coffee lady fayth the young lady made no move to hold out her cup i suspect he knows you are a ley traveller and i have no doubt he intends you harm wilhelmina returned her gaze steadily he will have to catch me first it would be unwise to make light of the threat lord burleigh is fully capable of carrying out his nefarious designs as we both know only too well lady fayth gave her a solemn nod in regards to the dinner tomorrow nightyou dare not for a moment even contemplate actually going but if i refuse countered mina wont that make him even more determined and suspicious perhaps haven pursed her perfect lips in thought she glanced out the window at a man carrying a wicker basket why not go away for a few days leave the city go somewhereanywhere stay out of his way completely run away you mean why not only for a few days mind his lordship will soon grow tired of waiting and leave prague we would have departed long since if not for kit wilhelmina thought for a moment i could go away she agreed i have been wanting to go back to do not tell me warned haven it will be better for both of us if i do not know only make some excuse and depart as soon as possible leave at once wilhelmina regarded her coconspirator for a moment in silence unable to tell if she was keeping something back please urged lady fayth reaching across the table she clutched wilhelminas hand and squeezed it for emphasis please go very well mina rose and pushed back her chair if you will excuse me i think i have some packing to do part two the jagged mountain chapter in which a new god is extolled chaos is loosed upon the black land my brother declared anen second prophet of amun with a solemn shake of his head pharaoh pursues a dangerous course he takes counsel only from his habiru advisors and listens not to the voice of his own people he taxes the land heavily to pay for the building of his new city in the desert he paused and added there is even talk of closing amuns many temples arthur flinderspetrie shook his head in sympathy i am sorry to hear it it is believed by many that unless he is stopped akhenaten will bring all the country to ruin benedict reclining at table next to his father cleared his throat he leaned close and whispered what is he saying excuse me a moment anen arthur put his head near his son and replied he is telling me that there is trouble in egypt just nowthe new pharaoh is pursuing a reckless course the new pharaohamenhotep you mean arthur nodded he has taken the name akhenaten and is building a new city in the desert to honour his god the people are unhappy perhaps we should leave suggested benedict if theres going to be trouble you may be right arthur turned once more to his friend it was my hope that my son could abide here awhile to study your language with the priests in the temple schoolas i did all those years ago but it seems that the flinderspetrie visit has come at an awkward time perhaps it would be best if we made other plans you will not want us underfoot never think that said anen taking a handful of dates onto his gold plate as always your visit gladdens my heart to see you and your son once more is a potent medicine to this old man the troubles of which i speak are but wisps of smoke on the winds of time he made a sweeping gesture with his hand but true friendship is carved in stone it endures forever it does indeed my friend agreed arthur he dipped a scrap of bread into the olive oil and then into the salt put it into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully i treasure our friendship anen raised a finger and a temple slave stepped silently to the table with the wine jug benedict swallowed the dregs and held up his cup for more while the two older men talked he contented himself with taking in the wealth of exotic sights around him they had been in egypt less than two days and already he felt himself forgetting any other life but the one he saw around hima life that seemed to flow as easily and effortlessly as the great green river nile on which the high priests palace was built benedict fingered the blue lapis scarab he had been given as a token of anens esteem and gazed around the intimate banquet hallthe smaller of the palaces festive chambersmarvelling at the richly painted walls the elegant statues and carvings the stately columns and regal sphinxes the tall darkskinned servants in their embroidered white robes the exotic scent of sandalwood on the air the sumptuous banquet spread on the low table before him all of itfrom the endless marble corridors to the gold chains round the priests neckseemed fantastical and far beyond what he had imagined from his fathers stories yet here he was reclining at table in the presence of egyptian nobility the way benedict understood it anen as second prophet ranked a step below high priest but was nonetheless accorded all the benefits of royalty because of his blood ties to the royal family as a child of six benedict had visited egypt his father had brought him to meet anen but other than being very ill the day of the journey and very hot the rest of the time he could remember almost nothing about it this time however he was determined to soak up as much of the experience as he possibly couldall the more since the current troubles meant their visit might be curtailed he listened to the sibilant susurration of his elders speech and wondered how he would ever learn it that was why they had come to allow benedict to further his education by learning the language much as they had done a couple years ago when he spent time in china with his mothers sister and her family then again if the troubles his father and anen were just then discussing were to deepen or spread he would not have to worry about it since they would not be staying the habiru are hard workers and keep to themselves pharaoh has given them land in the gesen and they live there most peaceably we have no difficulty with them nohe shook his smooth shaved headno the difficulty is that akhenaten has taken up their curious doctrine that their god a formless spirit called el is the only god worthy of honour and worship by anyone why why should this be anen demanded it makes no sense we do not say that only amun must be worshipped or only horus or only anubis there is room for all you may venerate sekmet or ra if you like while i am free to revere ptah or hathor or isis as it suits me there is room in egypt for everyone and each is free to follow the decrees of his own heart the priest smiled sadly but it is not so with the habiru their god el makes many demands and one of these is that there must be no other gods worshipped by those who call on his name this i think is because the habiru do not recognise that all the gods are but expressions of the one the absolute god i have heard this said remarked arthur like the english gentleman he was arthur did not argue with his various hosts about religion whatever world or epoch he visited he kept his own views to himself it was one of the rules he lived by as a ley traveller but these habiru must make even simple thingslike sacrifice and offeringvery difficult anen continued i do not understand it unfortunately pharaoh has become infatuated with the precepts of the habiru and has turned his back on the gods of his own people he shuns certain foods and will not cut his hairall to appease this new god that he has named aten the priests lips twisted with disapproval but this is merely el under a different name this is where the difficulty lies i see the problem arthur offered but what will you do about it in two days the temple of amun is sending a delegation to aten city to discuss matters with pharaohto see how this present difficulty may be resolved you are welcome to come along anen glanced at benedict who was now nodding on his cushion it seems as if we have exhausted our young traveller with our talk he raised a hand and one of the servants stepped up and knelt beside him the priest spoke a few words and the servant moved to the side of the sleeping youth and gave him a gentle nudge benedict came awake with a start oh he flushed sorry father no matter said arthur you are tired he nodded and spoke a command to the servant itara here will take you to our lodgings i will follow shortly benedict rose and with a respectful bow to his host said thank you for the wonderful dinner i enjoyed it very much he then wished his two elders good night and followed the servant from the room you must be very proud of him anen observed when arthur had translated his sons thankyou he has grown into a fine young man since i last saw him indeed he has arthur said i am very fortunate it is good for a man to have a son to carry his name into the world and continue the work he has begun that my friend is my fervent hopethat my son should succeed me one day we must hope that day is long in coming anen rose and instantly a servant stepped forward the priest waved him away to arthur he said come let us walk around the pool a little before we go to our beds anen led his guest out into a private garden the balmy air was sweet with the fragrance of jasmine and hibiscus they strolled the garden lit by the lambent glow of candlelit lanterns set along the paths around the sacred pool which seemed radiant with the reflected light of a ripening moon and a bright spray of stars the garden with its scented air and glowing pool the blue starfilled sky and even the presence of anen himself put arthur in mind of that fatefilled night years before when ravaged by fever his dear lovely wife xianli succumbed to disease and died the presence of his visitor must have brought the event to mind for anen too because after the two had walked awhile in silence he asked do you ever think about what happened arthur smiled every time i look at xianli they walked a little farther and he added i think i mentioned benedicts troubled birth i seem to recall something about it yes replied anen you took him to etruria to be bornbecause the physicians in your country had not the skill to effect his birth he thought for a moment and added in this etruria the high priest is also king not so that is so confirmed arthur one day you will be high priest think where you would be if you lived in etruria anen laughed gently i would not want to be kingtoo many wars too much fighting all the time it is not good for the soul i agree yet somehow turms has been able to thrive and his people with him have you ever returned to the spirit well the well of souls arthur nodded two or three times there is a mystery there i have yet to penetrate the secret of its lifegiving spring wondered the priest do not be forgettingyou have promised to show me this marvel one day i have not forgotten arthur assured him one day i will solve the mysterybut until then i think it best it remain a secret known to a trusted fewas few as possible i understand two days later the delegation of priests departed for the holy city of aten some distance north of the high temple at niwetamun they travelled by bargefive of them two for the priests and three smaller boats for the servants and attendants while those around him tended to their businessthe priests to their discussions and the servants to their choresbenedict sat perched on the wide low rail with his legs dangling over the side of the barge for hours he watched the panoply of life unfold along the greatest river in the world the slow progression of the boats was mesmerising the river world seemed to glide effortlessly by revealing wonders around every bend tiny islands filled with snowwhite birds basking crocodiles the colour of jade buffalos being washed by brownskinned boys lazy grey hippos waggling their ears and yawning towering palms with golden branches laden with shiny black dates and on and on without end owing to the sluggish summer current it took three days for the wide flat boats to reach the pharaohs new city the servants and minions disembarked first to prepare the landing place they were followed by the priests in order of rank the high priest a wizened old man named ptahmose who to benedicts eyes appeared as wrinkled and dried up as a walking mummy came last assisted by anen his secondincommand dressed in simple kilts of starched white linen and the broad multileaved collars of gold that were a symbol of their office they walked up the avenue lined by their servants some of whom held banners while others carried trumpets still others bore clothcovered baskets on their heads as the delegation approached the low whitewashed walls of the city the trumpeters began to sound loud rousing blasts on their instruments heralding the arrival of their masters arthur and benedict as guests of anen walked directly behind workers in the fields outside the city walls paused to watch the procession as it passed at the gates they halted and waited while the guards hurried to push open the huge cedar trunks that formed the entrance bound in iron and painted red each of the two enormous doors took five men straining at the rings to open once the way was clear the parade resumed its stately progress the stonepaved streets of the new city were wide and straight the buildings low the inhabitants on the streets paused to watch the spectacle others came out of their dwellings to see what was happening the streets were soon lined with curious onlookers as the priests made their way deeper into the new city it became obvious that construction was still at an early stage most of the structures while roughed out in mud brick and plaster had yet to be finished in stone only the templesof which there were several of varying sizeswere complete even the royal familys residence waited to receive its gleaming white facade nevertheless work seemed to be hastening on builders swarmed the various construction siteshundreds of them organised in gangs each with an overseer the squat swarthy labourers were all stripped to the waist oozing sweat as they chiselled or plastered or carried bricks to and fro with a cloth headdress the only concession to the pitiless sun the appearance of the workers was so unlike that of the taller more graceful egyptians benedict guessed that these must be the habiru that anen had mentioned that they were skilled masons and artisans was clearly seen in the reliefs and statues and paintings that appeared at regular intervals along the streets of the royal city everywhere benedict looked there was an image of pharaoh akhenaten with his wife the beautiful nefertiri akhenaten with his children akhenaten receiving the lifegiving rays of the sun akhenaten mediating his gods justice to the people of egypt some of the statues appeared grotesque and misshapenakhenaten with big blubbery lips a round pot belly and spindly bowed legsabsurd caricatures of the strictly codified official portraits look there he said nudging his father with a discreet elbow the pharaohs face looks like a camel did they do that on purpose apparently arthur whispered back ive never seen anything like that before is he sick perhaps but i think well soon find out he nodded past the priests leading the parade as into the street ahead swept a chariot with a phalanx of spearcarrying soldiers trotting easily behind drawn by two white horses with ostrichplume headdresses the chariot gleamed golden in the bright sunlight the procession halted as the speeding vehicle came hurtling headlong towards them its ironrimmed wheels clattering on the pavement the driver lashed the horses to greater speed and drove on his long black hair streaming in the wind as the vehicle closed on them the leading line of priests broke ranks and moved aside at the point of collision the servants threw down their banners and ran suddenly the decorous procession was a mad scramble as priests fought to get out of the way arthur and benedict some little distance apart beat a quick retreat to one side and watched the mayhem with a clatter of hooves and a whirl of dust the chariot skidded to a stop the priests outraged at their treatment began shouting and calling down curses upon the belligerent driverwho merely put back his head and laughed his teeth a flash of white behind the rich black of his braided beard the soldiers came pounding in their heavy sandals slapping the stones the commander an imposing fellow in a plumed helmet of gleaming bronze and a chest plate made of overlapping leaves of bronze scales called an order and the soldiers formed up coming to attention with a smart crack of their spears on the pavement this is an outrage shouted one of the senior priests shoving forward his robe in disarray and smudged with dust a curse on your house the chariot driver merely gazed down grinning through his beard benedict edged closer for a better look he saw a compact wellmade man in the prime of life cleanlimbed and cleareyed his skin bronzed a robust hue from the sunthe symbol of the god he served he had a high forehead strong jaw and fine white teeth that fairly gleamed through the dark forest of his beard this only served to enrage the priest all the more spitting with anger he shook his fists in the air threatening your reckless behaviour and thoughtless treatment will not go unpunished pharaoh will hear about this the charioteer laughed again then passed the reins to his commander and climbed down from the vehicle as he came around to face the angry priests he raised his hand to reveal that he held a rod of gold and lapis the mere sight of this implement brought gasps from the assembled priests who instantly bowed from the waist the palms of their hands extended at the knee pharaoh i think has already heard your complaint said the cheerful charioteer o mighty king forgive your servants intemperance the priest bent low and remained in an attitude of extreme supplication forgive me my king i did not know you you did not know your king wondered pharaoh mildly how is that is not my image engraved upon your heart great of renown it has been so long the priest flustered now began backing away mumbling as he went you have changed my king i did not benedicts eyes grew round that is akhenaten he gasped under his breath so it would seem whispered arthur what are they saying shh i cant hear be still now the high priest on the arm of anen moved forward the priests around him moved aside to open a way for the old man he came to stand before the supreme king and after the merest pause bowed and then rose mighty ruler of two houses supreme son of horus heavenly warrior lifegiver of nationsthe first prophet of amun greets you he intoned in a thin reedy voice at this akhenatens smile dissolved and his features took on a stony cast i know who you are old man he cast a glance at anen who is this great of glory said anen bowing nicely i am anen second prophet of amun two prophets observed the king with a snide curl of his lip it seems i am doubly blessed today gesturing to the assembled priests who had quickly gathered around he said and are these all prophets of your god as well o wonder of the visible world may you live in health forever began the high priest pharaoh cut him off with a flick of the rod in his hand why are you here he demanded mighty king said anen we have come with gifts for you he signalled to the servants carrying the baskets they came forward to offer their gifts but the king raised his hand and halted them do you think pharaoh desires anything you have to give he demanded am i one of your gods that you can placate with trinkets and sweetmeats by no means wisdom of osiris replied anen smoothly we give you but your own from the largess your enlightened rule has ordained and made manifest humph sneered akhenaten turning away he walked back to his chariot and climbed in priests of false idols hear me the king called his voice loud in the silence this place is holy to the god aten the only wise supreme creator and ruler of the heavenly realms if you have come to forswear your worship of lesser gods you may stay if you have come for any other purpose you are no longer welcome here if our presence offends you great one allow us but a word and we will depart in peace be gone roared the king gathering the reins in his hands he levelled a cold gaze at the high priest who stood openmouthed in disbelief at his insolent dismissal remove these people from my sight upon pharaohs command the commander of the soldiers raised his spear and shouted an order to his troops the soldiers levelled their weapons and spear tips glinting bright in the sun they all moved forward as one the priests and their attendants fell back with much grumbling and muttering they turned and began making their way to the city gate come benedict said arthur he tugged on his sons arm pulling him away stay close to me and keep your wits about you if anything should happen run for the barge fuming with frustration and humiliation the priests retreated pursued by the soldiers who not content with compliance began calling taunts and threats to provoke a response the jeers were taken up by the citizens lining the streets growing more angry and aggressive with every step though benedict could not understand the insults he knew trouble when he saw itand this was trouble pure and deep looking neither right nor left he kept his head down and walked quickly behind his father as they came into sight of the city gates they saw that the way was blocked by a gang of habiru workers the procession slowed and then juddered to a stop the priests demanded to be allowed to pass the labourers refused to move and make way for the priests some waved their fists and some holding hammers and mallets began pounding on the ground the first stone sailed up from the ranks of onlookers striking a priest in the front of the procession he let out a startled cry clutched his shoulder and whirled around to see who had thrown the missile those next to him began demanding that the perpetrator be punished arthur moved to benedicts side and took his hand hold on he told him whatever happens hold on to me even as he spoke another rock struck a nearby priest who crumpled to the ground this missile was followed by a brick from one of the building sites it hit the pavement hard and shattered scattering chips and fragments the crowd cried its approval and more stones and bricks swiftly followed anen pushed his way to the fore rank with his arms raised above his head he called on the habiru to cease their assault and let them pass when this failed to elicit a response he turned to appeal to the commander of the soldiers to halt the stone throwing and allow them to depart in peace his pleas went unheeded more stones followed coming faster now as the crowd took encouragement from the lack of intervention by soldiers who merely stood by and watched were going to have to run for it arthur advised his son dont let go of my hand anen was struck next receiving a grazing blow to the side of his head blood oozed from the wound drawing a cheer from the crowd priests frightened and confused charged the labourers blocking the way some of the workmen stood asideonly to strike at the holy men as they passed others challenged them outright shoving them or swinging hammers and fists the retreat became a rout everyone ran for the gate and the barges waiting at the wharf now shouted arthur pulling benedict with him run dodging and weaving through the angry throng they scrambled the mob closed in behind them pelting the fleeing priests with stones and bricks they gained the gates and pushing past the last of the workers were free once beyond the city walls they paused to wait for anen and the high priest when they failed to emerge arthur pulled benedict close go get on board he ordered ill join you in a moment i wont go without you obey me son go arthur released his son and pushed him towards the barge he had only just turned and started back into the crush at the gates when a brick sailed out and with uncanny accuracy struck him on the left temple the blow spun him sideways and he fell unconscious when he struck the ground father shouted benedict he ran to his fathers side and knelt taking the wounded head onto his knees there was little blood the brick had barely broken the skin but already an ugly redblue welt was rising father wake up urged the youth cradling the wounded head can you hear me father can you hear me wake up priests were running past them benedict called out help one of those running past stopped my father is hurt shouted benedict help me the priest realised instantly what had happened he snagged one of his fellow priests and with benedicts help lifted the unconscious arthur and dragged him to the barge where they laid him carefully on the deck the next events would always be something of a distant confusion to benedict he remembered other priests joining them on the deck and anen himself taking command and directing the wounded man to be carried to the roofed pavilion in the centre of the barge and laid upon the cushioned platform there when benedict looked around again the barge was already under sail and the royal city receding into the distance chapter in which wilhelmina pursues a mountaintop experience with lady fayths timely warning to crystallise her thoughts wilhelmina decided her best course of action she had been itching to put the new model ley lamp through its paces and discover its full potential leaving prague for a few days was the perfect excuse she needed and having made a clean breast of it with etzel she was now free to travel whenever she pleased much as before of course but now without the nagging guilty conscience for misleading her partner her champion for indeed dear engelbert could not have been any more gallant a defender if he had worn a suit of shining armour and carried her colours into the joust on the back of a galloping steed never had she known anyone who so selflessly and consistently took her part and put her welfare and interests first etzel did all that and more and mina had no doubt that when the quest for the skin map was finished she would happily settle down to life in the grand imperial with him indeed the more she thought about it the more certain she was that she wanted nothing else just now however she had other duties and entanglements that he could not share first on the list was to elude burleigh then she could devote herself entirely to discovering what had happened to kit the first task was simple and easily accomplished thanks to havens timely warning for the second chore she would need help having come to the end of her own expertise she determined it was time to go back to the one who had helped her find kit the first time brother lazarus with any luck at all she might still be able to stay a step or two ahead of burleigh and his brute squad the chief problem among many was the risk of exposure knowing how burleighs new device worked she now realised just how vulnerable she would be when ley travelling if the treacherous earl ever took an interest in her specifically the result could well be catastrophic once the decision was made wilhelmina wasted no time in putting her plan into action she bade etzel farewell promising to hurry back as soon as humanly possible and then set off the ley she needed was half a days journey from prague and from previous experience mina knew it to be particularly timesensitivethat is offering only a very narrow window of activity twice each day a few minutes either side of sunrise and sunset miss either opportunity and the ley traveller would have to wait until next time this was not unusual many ley lines and portals operated in a similar fashion she had found some were more lenient and forgiving some less so why wilhelmina had no clue with the hostler near the city gates she arranged for a carriage and driver to take her to her destination an empty stretch of countryside a kilometre or so north of the tiny farming village of podbrdy her plan was to disembark outside the settlement and walk to the ley unobserved if possible two further jumps would put her in the southern pyrenees within a stones throw of her destination once there she would assume the guise of a nun on pilgrimage and seek out her mentor in accordance with his wishes and her most solemn and sacred vowhe had made her swear on a handcopied bible not to reveal either his identity or whereabouts to another living soulshe had never breathed a word of brother lazarus existence to anyone the cautious monk was in effect her very secret weapon a quaint arrangement but it suited them both wilhelmina dozed through much of the coach ride to the village so that she would be well rested for the next leaps in her journey in the end she need not have bothered because she arrived too late and the ley was dormant she had to wait until sunrise she begged a bed for the night in the barn of a nearby farmer and spent a pleasant if odorous evening with two cows four ducks and a blackspotted pig just before sunrise she returned to the ley and made the leap the next two were accomplished without incident and pausing before the last jump she took refreshment at a small cafe on the via bassomondo the dusty road winding down the gently sloping hillside to the abbey of santantimo she was she thought somewhere in the last century perhaps wilhelmina couldnt tell her italian was strictly confined to buongiorno signor rinaldi un cappuccino e una brioche per favore she drank her coffee and ate her pastry making comparisons with her own brew and baking paid the bill from her little stash of coins obtained on her various travels and then walked on to the next ley which ran through the valley outside the abbey this part of the journey was always her favourite and mina often lingered a little while to enjoy the sublime view of the broad olivegroved and cypresslined valley tradition had it that emperor charlemagne had been a major benefactor of the monastery in earlier days and often used it as a convenient stoppingoff place on his various journeys from rome to his palace at aachen sometimes when she had time to spare she paused to take in the abbey church itself a handsome romanesque structure in rough white limestone with beautiful carvings inside and out the location had been chosen because like so many sites that now hosted churches of various kinds it had been a holy place long before the monastery had been contemplated that it remained a pilgrimage destination worked to wilhelminas favour in that the monks were used to strangers in their midst and welcomed them as best they could thus wilhelmina blended in with the general comings and goings of the place and her odd appearances and disappearances went unnoticed and unremarked more importantly however it was at santantimo that she had first learned of the man to whom she owed much of her acumen and skill in ley travel this is the story of how she first came to meet brother lazarus and travel to his world wilhelminas experiments with burleighs first device had provided her with a ready means of recognising active ley lines as well as guiding her to them she had made a number of test jumpscautious to the point of timidity at first but with growing confidence as she gained experiencebeginning with a series of single jumps then a few doubles before progressing to what were for her the very daring triple jumps in each of these experiments she noted the place and time of the ley activity and memorised the destinations on one of those early triple jumps she had landed in the pleasant italian valley near montalcino on a narrow dirt road that passed a grand old church and monastery the datelocal timewas may surrounded by ancient cypress trees welltended fields and a little pasture for sheep the place seemed to speak to her she felt drawn to it and decided to indulge herself with a little sightseeing passing through the handsomely carved archway she entered the quiet sanctuary the cool air was heavy with the scent of frankincense from somewhere near the altar at the front of the highceilinged chancel a small bell chimed there were a few other visitors walking the aisles quietly thoughtfully and in spite of her oldfashioned clothes wilhelmina blended right in as she made her first circuit of the church she came upon a large handpainted sign with a diagram of the floor plan seeing the explanation was in english as well as french and italian she paused to read it and discovered that according to a series of measurements carried out some years earlier no fewer than seven separate lines of electromagnetic force met at a point directly beneath the churchs altar these force fields were not leys at least not like any wilhelmina had previously encountered they were not straight and culminated at a single pointunlike normal ley lines nor was that term used in the fragmented english translation provided on the sign by the mapmaker were these lines of force something similar or something else entirely mina determined to find out all she could of these mysterious lines of telluric energy flowing beneath the church immediately hailed one of the monks going about his business scusi padre parla inglese si signora a leetle pointing to the sign showing the map of the curious lines she said this priestshe tapped the neatly lettered name at the bottom of the signfra giambattista becarria fra giambattista si agreed the monk is he here may i speak to him it may be important no signora is not possible fra giambattista he no longer with us mina frowned he is dead you mean si many years now may i see his grave alas signora is at abbazia di montserrat i think montserrat is that far si signora is in spagna wilhelmina thanked the priest for the information and continued her exploration of santantimo by the time she reached the altar rail she was in the grip of a conviction as potent as it was absurd the unanswerable certainty that the knowledge she so desperately needed would be found at a place that thirty seconds ago she had never even heard of moreover this conviction entailed an insistence of such urgency that she plopped down in the front pew and stared at the light streaming in through the high narrow windows behind the stunningly lifelike crucifix her mind reeling with the single thought that she must drop everything and get herself to the abbey at montserrat by the fastest means possible at the time her ley mapping skills did not yet extend to the spanish peninsula and she wanted to make no mistakes so she decided to travel by train in a typically canny move wilhelmina decided that if she was to visit a spanish abbey she would present herself as a german nun in montalcino she purchased a plain skirt and blouse and with the addition of a giftshop cross of olive wood and a wellarranged dovegrey headscarf she was a passable sisterif of the modern variety upon arrival in barcelona she found a convent and arranged to join a group of visiting french nuns on pilgrimage to the abadia de santa maria which was located high in the jagged mountain range northeast of the city it was a threeday trek on foot but wilhelmina enjoyed the fresh air and easy company of the nuns who sang as they went and stopped in every village chapel and shrine along the way to pray and prepare for their sojourn at the abbey the little party finally arrived late in the afternoon of the third day they entered the narrow gorge into which the abbey and its various buildings had been painstakingly shoehorned the soaring peaks of the surrounding mountains rose sheer on every side save one which gave onto a shimmering vista stretching from the sloping foothills all the way to the coast as the covey of nuns stood marvelling at the magnificence of the abbey and its situation the bell for vespers rang so they followed the general flow of monks and visitors up the steep incline to the church at the top of the esplanade rose ranks of steps that terminated in a courtyard the end of which opened to a gateway beyond the gates was a handsome atrium lined with statues of apostles and saints and paved with inlaid marble of many colours that marked out a geometric swirl of intersecting lines at the centre of which was a circular mosaic representing the four rivers flowing out of eden the courtyard thronged with visitors behaving in a most peculiar way they stood in a long line snaking back into the courtyard and one at a time each waiting patiently for the other they took it in turn to step forward and stand in the central disc of the mosaic then they prayedsome in the classic attitude with hands folded and heads bowed but many in apparent wild abandon with arms outstretched and faces turned to the clear blue sky above the faithful would stand like this for a time before moving off to join the general population making their way into the sanctuary this curious activity was not lost on wilhelmina how very odd she thought clearly there was something going on here and she took it as a sign that vindicated her own decision to come she followed the others as they moved slowly towards the entrance and upon approaching the centre of the mosaic circle experienced the subtle but unmistakable frisson of pent energy that she always felt in the presence of an active ley it was there marked out in stone in the middle of the atrium where apparently pilgrims in their hundreds and thousands also perceived the latent energy in some way once in the chapel she sat through the service listening to the ethereal voices of the choir and wondering how to make sense of it all the end of the service found her in a pensive mood of rapt contemplation for overarching all other considerations was a feeling of peace and if not contentment then at least a sense of rightnessshe felt that all was as it should be she took a light supper in the convent refectory with sisters from a dozen different nations and was given a cot in the dormitory wilhelmina slept well and awoke at the sunrise bell to attend prayers with them as soon as the service was finished she set off to find the grave of fra giambattista and to learn more about him if she could she waited until most of the congregation had left then approached one of the monks who acted as usher and guide por favor habla ingles lo siento hermana no he said shaking his head he turned then pointed across the spacious expanse of the sanctuary to a blackrobed monk stacking blue service books excuse me brother she said upon approaching him i am told you speak english the monk straightened turned and smiled when he saw her i have a little how can i help you i am looking for the grave of a former priest by the name of giambattista beccaria wilhelmina replied and went on to explain how she had been directed to the abbey to find it she watched a thoughtful frown form and deepen on the priests smoothshaven face i am sorry sister he replied at length i have never heard that name are you certain he is buried here that is what i have been given to understand he was a former astronomer hereat least that is what i was told ah then you must go to brother lazarus he is astronomer now if anyone knows about this he will wilhelmina thanked him for his help and asked where she might find this brother the monk who had resumed stacking books shrugged at the observatory where else she hurried off and after asking directions found a signboard painted with a map of the extensive abbey grounds the observatory was clearly marked according to the sign it was at the top of one of the peaks soaring above the abbey all she had to do was climb the winding path leading to the summit this she did and discovered a small tower with a bulbous top perched on a pinnacle of stone an iron rail enclosed a circular walkway around the base of the building and a simple handrail of knotted rope assisted the ascent up a steep flight of narrow stairs leading to the door there appeared to be no one around but as she started up the stairs she heard the sound of someone humminglow and rhythmically if not exactly melodically mina could not see who was making this sound but as she mounted to the top step and started around the base of the tower she found a monk in the black robes of the benedictines down on his knees surrounded by gardening toolsa small hand trowel a rake a pruning knife an assortment of clay pots and a sheaf of cuttings the gardener was clutching a double handful of dirt and humming tunelessly while he worked as she watched he placed the dirt in a clay pot and pressed it firmly around a geranium cutting a canvas bag of soil stood open beside him wilhelmina cleared her throat excuse me please she said announcing her presence hello the priest gave such a start that wilhelmina was ashamed of startling him oh i am sorry she apologised i did not mean to frighten you the gardeners hand described a strange gesture around his head and he whipped something out of sight in a fold of his robe then steadying himself he rose and turned to meet his visitor que he said rubbing dirt from his hands buenos dias hermana sorry no habla espanol she replied then out of force of habit she said sprechen sie deutsch ja tu ich his smile widened a small man with short snowwhite hair and quick dark eyes his face was nicely browned by the sun his hands made strong by the long hours he spent gardening in all he reminded wilhelmina of one of the seven dwarfs guten morgen schwester he said in a rich almost operatic baritonethe voice of a much larger man good morning brother she answered in the sturdy german of old prague then offered him a little bow she had seen the other nuns make when addressing a priest of the order i am looking for the one they call brother lazarus then god smiles upon you sister he bent to brush dirt from the knees of his robe he straightened again the top of his head coming only to minas shoulder you have found him you are brother lazarus she asked unable to keep the note of incredulity out of her voice the astronomer he laughed and wilhelminas face went red with embarrassment why he asked is that difficult to believe oh i am sorry mina said quickly i took you for a gardener she explained indicating the assembled tools and pots he looked where she was pointing yes wellhe gave a little shrugsuch is a good grounding for stargazing he reached out a thickly muscled hand and placed it gently on her sleeve an astronomer can only practise his craft at night what is he to do with the rest of his time forgive me brother i meant no disrespect he swatted away the apology with an impatient flick of his hand now that you have found brother lazarus what do you want with him i am searching for the burial place of one of your colleagues a monk of this order i have been told that he was once the astronomer here and that his grave is nearby can you tell me where it is perhaps yes he replied turning to resume his work if you will tell me his name i can tell you if he is buried at the abbey his name is fra giambattista at the name the monk stopped straightened and went very still fra giambattista beccaria he asked without turning around yes thats the one i am sorry sister he said stooping once more to his tools your search has come to nothing his grave if it exists is not herenot at this abbey he made a show of beginning to work again good day to you and godspeed wilhelmina pursed her lips alarmed at the swift change in the mans demeanour the mere mention of the name had brought about an abrupt and disagreeable transformationthe same as if he had slammed a door in her face good day she said quietly i am sorry to have bothered you she took a step backward but as she prepared to take her leave a force of will rose up inside hera determination to hold her ground come what may at the very least she owed it to herself she had come this far and it would be a rotten shame to go away emptyhanded in a moment the monk still on his knees peered back over his shoulder at her youre still here i am why i think she began feeling her way into it that i am waiting for a better explanation than the one i have just heard then you must resign yourself to waiting a very long time he declared there is no other explanation i beg to disagree i think there is she said and even as she spoke the answer came to her oh you do he snapped his voice taking on a brusque and officious tone since you know you have no need to ask me when she hesitated he added nothing else to say then i will ask you kindly to remove yourself there is no grave wilhelmina ventured because she drew herself up and casting all caution to the wind said because you are giambattista beccaria chapter in which false identities are exposed you are him arent you wilhelmina maintained growing more certain by the moment you are fra giambattista do not be absurd young lady he scoffed what a ridiculous notion he gave a choked little half laugh utter nonsense wilhelmina said nothing his protest sounded contrived and that fine mellifluous voice had become pinched and tight the very idea is preposterous he blustered shaking his head absurd why asked wilhelmina why is it absurd brother beccaria lived in italy long ago if he were alive today he would behe paused to do a rough calculationwell it is impossible the monk made a dismissive wave and offered what was supposed to be mirthful chuckle preposterous young people are so credulous yet i do not hear a denial she observed why is that i insist you go away before we both say something we will have need of confessing my conscience is clear wilhelmina told him is there something you would like to confess the priest became very still then slowly rose to his feet once more stood and turned to face her he studied the woman before him closely his eyes moving over her face and form who are you he said at last my name is wilhelmina klug she said fraulein klug i think despite present appearances i suspect you are not a nun nor ever have been he remarked am i right i believe we are both somewhat other than we appear please do me the courtesy of a truthful answer are you a sister of the order no mina told him i am a traveller a traveller he made a face dismissing her claim you are disingenuous he replied traveller ha he raised a hand to her and wilhelmina thought he meant to send her away once more but thought better of it instead he asked how did you learn about fra giambattista i was visiting the abbey at santantimo in tuscany she replied i saw the name on a placard one of the brothers told me he had been appointed astronomer here and that he was buried here she cast an appraising glance over the man before her but that is not true there is no grave because he never died in fact he is standing here before me astonishment horror but also relief played across the priests round goodnatured face but how could that possibly be he said his voice growing small how could it be that you are that old she wondered or how could it be that i know this either he mumbled rocking back on his feet both it is possible she replied taking a step closer because you are a traveller toolike me and like me your travels are not entirely confined to this world madre di dio he said making the sign of the cross over his chest and kissing his clasped hands without another word he darted to the door of the observatory tower put his hand on the brass knob and pushed open the door wilhelmina expected that fleeing her presence he would shut her out but as he disappeared inside he motioned for her to follow she mounted the steps and entered a tiny vestibule a narrow corridor led straight ahead to a pair of doors and a staircase led to upper levels brother lazarus went to the door on the lefthand side of the corridor and passed through wilhelmina followed him into a tidy little kitchen with a simple woodburning stove a square wooden table and four chairs a curtained window opened to a view of the surrounding peaks and the lowlands beyond the room was tidy and well kept there were flowers in a chipped pottery mug on the table and the rag rug on the floor was clean the flustered monk went directly to the little cupboard and removed a short glass beaker a cup and a jug of wine which he carried to the table he gestured to one of the chairs sit wilhelmina obeyed and was presented with a tot of wine the priest sat down across the table and taking his cup in both hands guzzled down a healthy slug he looked at wilhelmina who raised her beaker to him then sipped and he took another great gulp so i am discovered at last he shook his head slowly what is to happen now i really dont know replied mina gently i certainly did not come here to frighten you or harm you in any way why did you come here she did not know where to begin to answer thatthere was just too much she wanted to know how to manipulate the leys how they worked what caused them where they led there was the nagging matter of kit and getting in touch with him again so that she could tell him to stop worrying about her and then there was the whole business of the skin map and the burley men and so on wilhelmina decided to skip all that for now and settled for a much simpler i came here seeking knowledge knowledge repeated the monk what do you want to know wilhelmina gazed at the wine in her glass there is so muchi hardly know where to begin i have so very many questions pick one replied fra giambattista perhaps it was wilhelminas softspoken assurance or the soothing influence of the wine but the priests fractured attitude seemed to be on the mend it does not matter where one starts it is where one finishes that makes all the difference she seized on one of the many questions wheeling around in her head like a flock of noisy seagulls for an italian living in spain why do you speak such good german he laughed some of his former good humour returning that is what you have come here to ask i thought it would be about the holy grail king arthurs holy grail is there another charmed by the idea she gave a small laugh why should i ask about that that is what everyone wants to know he cried we have no end of seekers looking for the grail of king arthurand the brothers always send them to me legend has it that the fabled cup is buried here on montserrat is it i have no idea fra giambattista laughed again and was his former self why ask about my german as you say we must begin somewhere mina took a drink of wine who knows where we shall end up well it is obvious all the best physics is german he declared i learned it in order to read and converse with my fellows in bonn and berlin hamburg vienna he shrugged it helps to know a little of the language of science i can well appreciate that agreed wilhelmina how did you discover ley travel ley travel he wondered is that what you call it it is how it was described to me she answered i suppose you could say i fell into it by accident dear lady offered the priest with a smile there are no accidents he took another sip of wine and refilled their cups but i know what you mean i suppose i came to it in the same way in the course of my various experiments i had become aware of the lines of force operating beneath santantimo in the course of mapping them for further study i was caught in a storm and in trying to run to shelter inexplicably found myself his voice trailed off remembering where asked mina after a moment here he said at montserrat the two places are connected you mean indeed they are of course i thought i was going mad he chuckled it took me years to work out what had happened and still more to learn how to manipulate it for my purposesas much as anyone can ever impose ones own purposes on such an elemental power he shook his head again that was a very long time ago yet i remember it all as if it were yesterday they talked then sharing their observations of and experiences with the unconventional properties of ley travel and the more they talked the more wilhelmina was convinced that she had found someone who could do more than simply provide her with information in fra giambattista she had found a mentor someone whose knowledge was extensive and who could capably guide her search why did you change your name wilhelmina asked they had moved their conversation to the cloister garden where they could be seen by those who cared to noticethis was to avoid any discussion about a nun visiting a monk in his quarters well dear lady he had replied with a laugh it was because i was living so long you see travelling between worlds affects the aging process i was outliving all my contemporaries and it was beginning to be noticed i can see that would be a problem he nodded one dayafter the funeral of our dear old sacristan and in the company of everyonethe abbot of sant antimo was heard to remark brother giambattista you must have more lives than lazarus everyone laughed but i got the hint something had to be done the priest spread his hands he gazed up at the clear cloudspeckled sky for a moment then shrugged what could i do what did you do asked wilhelmina chin on hand fascinated well it was obvious no brother beccaria could not go on one spring i received permission from my abbot to go on a pilgrimage to montserrat and on arrival to stay and use the observatory of course i had been here before but none of the brothers at sant antimo knew that once here i contrived to become ill and reported this to my brothers eventually i sent back a message that poor fra giambattista had succumbed to his maladies and gone to his heavenly reward fra giambattista died mina concluded and brother lazarus was born a deception i admit but all this has been confessed and god will forgive for my heart is pure and the work i do i do in the service of the almighty he nodded satisfied with this arrangement after that i travelled many years in germany learning the language and reading physics talking to my colleagues and studying studying all the while studying he brushed a bit of fluff from the lap of his fine black robe when i had learned enough i came back here as astronomer oh no all my contemporaries here had passed away by then that was part of the plan you see fra giambattista was remembered of course but no one then at the abbey knew brother lazarus i worked in the gardens at first and helped at the observatory in time i became assistant to the chief astronomer and climbed my way up the ladder once more he put a rough gardeners palm on wilhelminas hand and confided patience was ever a virtue wilhelminas first visit extended to more than two weeks every other day or so she met brother lazarus in the cloister garden to discuss some particular aspect of ley travel its uses and attendant problems and implications the astronomer monk proved himself a thoughtful and erudite instructor his study of astronomy and physics embraced cosmology philosophy and being a priest theology as well as a patient and capable teacher he was second to none and wilhelmina the eager and willing student was soon firmly under his spell his enthusiasm she suspected derived from the fact that he had previously had no one with whom he might share his greatest discoveries and insights in wilhelmina he had at last found someone who not only understood but could partake in the wonder of the enterprise at the deepest level and inasmuch as her experience of ley travel although undisciplined was no less extensive in its way than his own wilhelmina was someone who could help further his inquiries nor did it hurt that he genuinely liked her and enjoyed her company that first fortnight passed in a blink wilhelmina could have stayed much longer but to do so would draw unwanted suspicion instead the two conspirators agreed that she should leave soon but return in the spring when they could continue minas education to the point where she could eventually collaborate on brother lazarus work of mapping the intersecting dimensions of the cosmos many people make annual pilgrimage to the abbey he said your presence need not draw suspicionand if anyone should ask you can always say it is in fulfilment of a vow for answered prayer that is nothing more than the truth after all wilhelmina decided the day of departure came and she took her leavebut not before learning the whereabouts of the nearest ley and how it connected with santantimo what about the circle in the sanctuary atrium she remembered asking is that a ley threshold there is a force there very powerful i have measured it but never attempted to use it i believe it to be unstable unpredictable it must be studied further besides it is too public the monk told her nevertheless these mountains are seamed through and through with lines of powerthese leys as you call them the one nearest the observatorythe one i showed you that one joins santantimo that is how you got here the first time exactly he raised a finger in warning use it but use it carefully we never know who may be watching wilhelmina thanked him for his care and departed returning the next spring and then again the following autumna pattern that was to repeat until she became a familiar sight around the monastery grounds her friends there were happy to see her and she slowly became attached to the place do you know thomas young brother lazarus asked mina on that first visit a physician in london have you ever crossed paths with him at all i feel certain i would know if i had she replied but no is he a fellow traveller i have never heard that he was but it would not surprise me his experiments in established the foundation on which the edifice of quantum physics is constructed brother lazarus went on to explain in almost reverential tones about the man who had discovered the dual nature of light as both particles and waves if that was not enough he also helped establish archaeology as a science and in succeeded in cracking the code of egyptian hieroglyphic writing he sounds fascinating she concluded he lives in london you say he did the monk nodded a most fascinating man is thomas young that was the first time wilhelmina heard of dr young it would not be the last chapter in which tracks are made and covered i agree it is something of a coincidence allowed lady fayth judiciously then again why should this bakery woman not go wherever she likes i find it highly suspicious declared burleigh on the eve of receiving our dinner invitation she picks up and flees the city coincidence i think not she can hardly be said to have fled the city haven countered smoothly the baker said she had business in vienna there is nothing odd about a woman of commerce travelling on business some would say that such an eventuality was an inevitable consequence of trade burleighs expression hardened why are you always taking her part his tone was dark and insinuating the way you talk haven sighed lightly and rolled her lovely brown eyes i take no ones part my leery lord i merely point out the folly of your insistence on viewing even the most perfectly innocent event as part of some vast conspiracy to overthrow your plans watch your mouth girl growled burleigh he glared at her i grow sick of bickering with you over every step i take haven knew she had pressed the matter far enough it was time to make amends oh dear i have angered you she said suddenly contrite i am sorry she lowered her head in a submissive gesture offending you was the last thing i intended get out he shouted i cannot think with you simpering on like that go to your room until i call for you i will decide what to do without another word she turned and moved to the door glad to escape the black earls foul mood do not imagine that i will forget your insolence he called after her no my lord she answered shutting the door behind her to herself she added i imagine you will soon have cause to long remember it she stalked off down the corridor seething with rage against burleigh against wicked circumstance that forced her to behave like a debauched wanton against the guilt she felt for abandoning her uncle and the others to die in the tombrage against the powerlessness and humiliation she felt every moment of her waking day it was bad enough that she had been made into a plotter of plots and a schemer of schemesit was the price paid for joining the quest so be itbut that she must travel with the brute be seen by one and all as his confidante nay his paramour the sound of his voice his supercilious manner his handsome featureswhich might have been admired in a better manturned her stomach the pretence of obedience was wearing on her she detested the odious man and his bestial morality and it was now almost impossible to hold her tongue in his presence burleigh himself sensed that all was not as it seemed with her soon if not already he would decide to sever their partnership and she would become another victim sacrificed to his insatiable ambition aside from simple survival she had hoped to learn from himat the very least learn his methods plans his ultimate aims but beyond burleighs obsession with the skin map she had learned very little what he wanted why he drove himself what he hoped to gain from his ruthless exploitation of everyone who crossed his path she still did not know but she sensed she had learned all he was willing to teach her now as she stood in the darkened corridor staring at the door to her room of this fetid buginfested inn she knew she had reached the end of her endurance the inn the grandest prague had to offer was insufferable the stink the noise the squalid surroundings did not befit a lady of her station she refused to spend one more night listening to cats rummaging through garbage in the street beneath her window listening to the drunk and snoring sleepers in the rooms on either side of hers smelling the slops as they were sluiced into the gutters the moment she closed the door behind her she changed into her travelling clothes and taking only her coat crept from her room once in the corridor she slipped like a sprite down the stairs and tiptoed across the inns hall risking a glance into the common room to see that burleigh was still sitting where she had left him brooding a drink at his elbow she moved to the entrance and with a last look around to see that she was unobserved departed she moved through the streets of prague descending the palace hill towards the old town and the city walls rising beyond the square the sun was already down but the sky held a glimmer of light she hoped there would be no difficulty in departing the city she did not care to leave behind any witnesses who might be interrogated later this as much as the fact that her german was nowhere good enough to concoct a plausible story for inquisitive guards determined another slightly less desirable course of action quite simply she would linger in the shadow of the gates until a departing wagon or coach rumbled through using the vehicle to shield her from view she would slip through and then disappear into the countryside upon approaching the gatehouse she slowed her pace keeping to the far side of the street watching the activity and trying to determine the whereabouts of the guards she found a narrow alleyway within sight of the gate crept in and perching herself on an upturned crate beside a rain barrel settled back to wait for her chance a short time later she heard the clipclop of horses hooves on the cobbles she eased herself off her perch and moved to the mouth of the alley the torches had been lit on either side of the big timber doors and one of them was open a wagon loaded with barrels was just then negotiating with the guards to open the other half to let the wagon through plucking up her courage haven darted from her hiding place moving alongside the boxy vehicle just as the driver flicked the reins and called to the horses to walk on both haven and the wagon passed through the portal out onto the road at the same time to the best of her knowledge the gatekeepers had not seen her nor had anyone else casting one last glance over her shoulder she satisfied herself that she was indeed free then turned and hurried to the jumpingoff placethe site burleigh used to reach prague she had memorised the location and had no difficulty finding it again a brisk walk through the chilly grey countryside brought her to a secluded spot in the hills north of the city there amidst farms of beets and turnips was a preternaturally straight creasea shallow ditch marking the boundary between two fields these were ancient features she knew her uncle called them hollow ways and they were older than the farms and fields they marked as old as the hills themselves sir henry said at the fleeting thought of her beloved uncle haven felt another stab of guilt for having failed him i am so sorry uncle she murmured then shoved the feeling aside revenge she decided would drive her from now on she would avenge her uncles death and punish the black earl for his needless cruelty and for the humiliation he had inflicted on her the stars were alight in the eastern sky when haven reached the ley without a moment to spare she hurried across the highfurrowed field to the hollow way stepped down into the ditch and aligned herself with one of the stones that served for field corners then putting her feet in the centre of the path she started down the narrow trail within four determined paces she felt the familiar tingle on her skin a breeze gusted over the crest of the bank and swirled around her long skirt three more steps carried her to the next stone marker the banks of the hollow way grew hazy the twilight dimmed and she felt the path fall away beneath her feet for an instant her ears were filled with the howling screech of the void and misty rain spattered her face and neck by now a more experienced leyleaper she was ready for the awkward lurch as the trail came up beneath her once more the ground level slightly higher this time taking the jolt in her knees she managed to remain upright took two more steps and stopped to look around the world around her had changed the gentle hills and ploughed fields of bohemia were gone and in their place was a chilly mistcovered wilderness of wide valleys and treeless heightssomewhat like yorkshire she thought but it was not yorkshireas least not the one she knew burleigh maintained that it was like so many other worlds only a connecting place a waypoint between one dimension of the multidimensional universe and another two more leaps would bring her back to england haven had no doubt she could reach london but there was some uncertainty in judging the leap just right in order to achieve the desired time without the benefit of the black earls little device to aid her she would have to rely on her native wits nevertheless she was happy to have successfully made her escape and to be on her own at last the next ley line was some distance awaya peaty upland nearly half a day distant on foot and as this was a remote and deserted landscape there was nothing for it but to walk she started off at once making what time she could likely she would have to wait for sundown once she got there but she would rather wait than miss it and have to spend the night out on the desolate moor as she walked along she rehearsed in her mind what she would do when she got to london and how she might proceed to further the quest clearly she could not conduct the search for the skin map alone no doubt she should have made plans to meet wilhelmina in london thinking of it now that would have been the perfect solutionthey could have evaded burleigh and furthered their alliance but in the urgency to get out of prague neither of them had thought of that it was late in the day by the time she reached the leya nameless trackway high on the crest of a broad headland where two valleys met above a grey river she found a stone beside the trail and sat down to watch the lowriding sun sink farther below the line of barren hills to the west shivering in the chilly damp air as night came on she comforted herself with the thought that she would soon be home again dry and warm then as the evening shadows darkened the valleys and wraithlike vapours snaked along the river below she stood and carefully pacing off the distance from the beginning of the ley once again composed herself for the jump this one like the first was accomplished without undue discomfortwhich haven took as a sign that she was perfecting her abilities the thought pleased her and filled her with confidence as the battering rain shower announced her arrival in england on a lonely hilltop somewhere on the southern downs when her vision cleared she made out the line of the london roadflanked by barley fields in neat rows the thatched houses of farmers the mail coach rumbling up the long chalk hills haven took in the sight and her heart leapt she had done it she had successfully navigated the journey home all by herself it was early in the day yet the sun was high in a cloudflecked sky the air soft and balmy haven paused to catch her breath and let the incipient nausea pass she drew the sweet fresh country air into her lungs and gazed down the smooth green slope of the hill she could see wagons and some foot traffic on the road below as soon as she felt stable once more she hiked up her skirts and hurried down the hillside secure in the knowledge that she would soon beg a ride with a passing merchant or farmer or better still a carriage heading for the city in any event she had to make do with a hay wain an ox cart and a brewers wagon pulled by a team of heavy horseseach slower than the last as a result it was already nightfall by the time she reached london and made her way to clarimond house sir henry fayths london home through streets intermittently lit by torchlight she flitted like a ghost keeping to the shadows a young woman alone on the streets of the city after dark was asking for troublehaven fayth had not come this far only to end up at the end of a footpads knife darting along the houses fronting the wide cobbled boulevardsometimes so close she brushed the doors with her elbowshe heaved a sigh as she came in sight of the stately redbrick mansion a few last running steps carried her through the iron gates and she was safe within the grounds hurrying up the drive she bounded up the front steps and rapped sharply on the door at her second knock the door opened slowly a servant dressed in black barely deigned to glance at her a frown of disapproval on his face his lordship is not receiving visitors he informed her in tones that left her in no doubt that she was not welcome he made to close the door do you not know me villiers she said putting her hand to the door my lady the door opened again more widely and the servant produced a candle lady fayth he gasped holding the candle high to see her you should have sent word of your arrival am i to spend the night on the doorstep i am dreadfully sorry my lady he stepped aside bowed and ushered her quickly into the vestibule closing the door firmly behind her pray forgive me we were not expecting anyone if i had known you were coming i would have sent a carriage for you there was no time she told him i am starving is there dinner cook is preparing it now villiers replied i will have a place set in the dining room he gazed at her intently i can see your travel has fatigued you i will have hot water and towels sent up to your room if you care to freshen yourself i will inform the household that you are in residence thank you villiers i leave it in your hands but first i have to see giles is he here indeed my lady mr standfast is convalescing he has suffered a gunshot yes i know terrible accident it should never have happened she turned to the staircase i must see him straightaway i believe the doctor has ordered bedrest and quiet i shant disturb him overmuch she replied ascending quickly which room is he in the plum room my lady allow me to announce you no need i would prefer that you see to dinner i will announce myself abandoning propriety she took the candle and ascended the stairs quickly reached the gallery and hurried to the landing off the staircase used by sir henrys staff and retainers she paused at the third door along composed herself then knocked enter came a familiar voice from the other side she turned the brass handle and pushed open the door giles lay in bed the entire upper left side of his torso bound in white bandages a lighted lamp glowed on the bedside table and beside it a jar and cup on the floor was a chamber pot at the first glimpse of his visitor standing in the corridor the wounded man started upright miss wilhelmina have you fo he began haven stepped across the threshold and into the room coming into the light hello giles she said he slumped back against the pillows lady fayth i never thought then realising the implications of her presence he bolted upright once more threw aside the blanket and made to climb out of bed is burleigh here he asked the effort made him wince with pain as he struggled to rise is he calm yourself giles haven said gently all is well i am alone like you i have escaped him with the slow measured movement of an aching man he lay back once more then why are you here he said his tone sullen and unwelcoming you must know that i have nothing to say to you perhaps not she allowed she picked up the edge of the blanket and pulled it back into place over him but you might care to listen for i have something to say to you he glared at her his expression full of hurt and distrust at what he considered her former betrayal go on then he said at last curiosity overcoming his suspicion first she said i have to knoware you well enough to travel chapter in which kit learns the uses of a marmot skull the interior of the cave seemed warm to kit and drier than he would have imagined he followed the hunters carefully working his way over the jumble of rocks that littered the cavern floor the air was still and smelled of dry leaves laced with the sour scent of cat the deeper they probed into the side of the gorge the warmer it became sweating from the fight with the cave lion kit felt like shedding his shirtand maybe would have if he had not effectively sewn himself into it of greater concern at the moment however was not to lose sight of the tiny light bobbing along a few steps ahead of him following the battle with the beast outside the hunters had climbed up into the hole in the wall of the gorge where dardok scrabbled around in a dark recess of the cave and extracted from a cleft in the rock three small marmot skulls the skulls had been broken down leaving just the brainpan that formed a shallow bowl these were quickly revealed to be primitive lampsleft there apparently the last time the clansmen had visited the cave using live coals from the wooden vessel retrieved from the snow bank where kit had dropped it dardok set about lighting the lamps with braided hair for wicks and animal fat for fuel the skull lamps stank and gave off a grudging oily light but in the absolute darkness of the deep underground passages they were surprisingly effective the lamps were handed out and the clansmen set off pushing deeper into the cave owing to narrow walls and cramped spaces they were forced to go single file and were soon strung out kit lost sight of the first two lamps and was desperate to keep the last in sight as the troop followed the passage ever deeper into the earth occasionally there would be level stretches where the channel became wider other times it was all kit could do to wriggle through the gap the rocks were damp and some were wet where water seeped from a seam or leaked from somewhere above where there was a continuous trickle and plink of dripping water stalactites hung from the cavern ceiling and these had to be avoidedlikewise the stalagmites erupting from the floor like giant teeth in a stony jaw kit followed the group trying to stay out of the standing water pooled on the floor at one point he slid over a boulder and suddenly found himself at the entrance to a large gallery both roof and walls opened out beyond reach of the crude lamplight up ahead he saw the reflection of dardoks lamp in a pool of water on the cavern floor the light had stopped moving and kit guessed big hunter was waiting for the group to gather once more before pushing on indeed when all were assembled dardok moved off they came to the end of the gallery and entered a tunnel they followed this a few hundred paces until it branched taking the righthand branch the band moved along a corridor that though he could not see the ceiling was nevertheless narrow enough for kit to touch either side with arms outstretched here they stopped taking his skull lamp dardok held it close to the wall and kit saw in the dull glow cast by the greasy light the unmistakeable bulk of a large longhorned aurochs painted on the stone wall the beast was rendered in ochre red and brown with black ears and eyes its mouth was open and its forelegs bent as if it was running as kit watched big hunter moved the little lamp back and forth below the image and to kits amazement the carefully drawn creature seemed to take on breath and life right before his eyes the flickering light rippled along the uneven surface of the stone lending the illusion of movement the trick of light was delightful and kit chuckled aloud which brought curious looks from his companions dardok gave a gruff snort and shifted the skull lamp to another position revealing an elk with huge splayed antlers the hunter with the second lamp stepped across to the other wall and held up his lamp kit saw a phalanx of earthcoloured horsessix chubby shortmaned thicknecked beastsall in profile each head in a slightly different attitude all running together their forelegs churning in unison there were morescores of them an entire panoply stretching down the gently arching wall of the cave a brown bison with its young one a pair of leaping antelope a cave lion roaring with its mouth open to show its fangs a bear on its hind legs an ox a bear a fatbellied cow with a skinny calf nuzzling up to suck and even the head and shoulders of a woolly mammoth with its highdomed head and red shaggy pelt all the paintings were drawn with exquisite skill but in something of a naive styleas if executed by highly skilled schoolchildren the way the artists had captured the demeanour of individual creatures with just a few linesa stroke here for a mouth a bit of shading there for a bulge of musclewas remarkable and revealed a long familiarity with the animal life depicted at the same time there was a distinctly fanciful element in the portrayalas if the artist were at play with his subjects or engaged in a lighthearted dance drawn deeper into the gallery kit saw that apart from the creatures on display there were sections consisting of symbolsspirals and wavy lines dots and circles of various sizes shapes that looked like eggs and many handprints the handprints were made the way a kindergartner makes a hand by outlining his own digits with a crayon on the cave wall however instead of drawing around the hand and fingers the pigment had been sprayed somehow over the hand leaving a shadow print on the surrounding rock a void where the artists hand used to be were these the painters signatures or were they simply a way of announcing a presencelike the bill woz ere graffiti one saw scrawled in london subways and then kit saw something that made his heart beat a little quicker there on the wall opposite him was a spray of smaller figures kit moved in for a closer look at the pattern of swirls and spirals squiggles and dotsthe strange characters of a deranged alphabet despite the crude tools used to make them each was precisely rendered and each unique bending near he peered at them in the dimly flickering light and knew he had seen these queer pictograms before on the skin map mind reeling with amazement kit gaped at the devious signs how could this be how was it possible he drew a deep breath and forced himself to rein in his racing thoughts okay think what does it mean the first thing that came to mind was that either arthur flinderspetrie had been here or someone who had access to his mapbecause on closer inspection kit noticed that the technique of the artist was very different from that displayed in the surrounding paintings each pictogram was precise and cleanly drawn with no false starts or smudged lines obviously the person who painted the symbols on the wall knew exactly what he was doing standing there in the quivering darkness of the cave kit heard again the words of sir henry fayth no coincidence under heaven no such thing as coincidence whispered kit brushing the stone with a trembling fingertip it was true the light shifted abruptly and kit glanced around to see that the clansmen were moving on wait he called instinctively his voice ringing hollow along the gallery walls the last clansman looked back but did not stop and kit was soon enveloped in darkness with a groan of frustration kit abandoned the skin map symbols and hurried after the light determined to return as soon as possible to study the symbols some more and try to commit them to memory dardok led them by winding turns deeper and ever deeper into the cavern until at last they came to a stretch of wall where there were few paintings placing his skull lamp on a flat rock big hunter busied himself with something in the shadows kit edged closer and saw that dardok was kindling several more lamps lighting them from the single flame of his own as soon as they were lit he handed them out giving one to kit as well besides the lanterns there was a supply of shells from river clams twigs and clumps of earth taking up smooth river rocks obtained from a little heap beside the place where dardok was lighting lamps the clansmen began pounding the dirt clods at first this activity appeared meaningless to kit but as he watched the men took up some of the clamshells also obtained from the river heaped some of the pounded earth into the shells and then added water from a dripping stalactite to make a thin mud its a workshop kit realised theyre making paint this mud was mixed on the half shell with a grubby forefinger each artist making his own when the paint was ready dardok produced hazel twigs these were handed around and promptly popped into their mouths the clansmen chomped away for a while gnawing on the sticks fraying the ends to form rudimentary paintbrushes every now and then they removed them for examination before chewing again when all was ready there followed a lengthy consultation that kit could follow only in part he sensed the buzz of thoughts flitting among the grouphe could always tell when they were discussing somethingbut the impressions did not settle and crystallise as when enul addressed him directly moments later the huddle broke and the clansmen took up places along the wall singly or in pairs and began to work kit found a comfortable perch on a low rock and settled back to watch as the huntersturnedartists sketched their designs each artist following contours of the rock only he could see roughed out a basic body shapean ox a deer or a bearand began filling in the body dabbing the paint with their crude brushes they worked quickly adding shade and colour to the shapes they created kit gradually became aware of an odd sounda low droning hum almost below the threshold of hearing rising and falling like waves washing on a distant shore the sound waxed and waned the clansmen were humming while they workednot vocalising exactly something more like purring the sound seemed to come not from their throats but from their chests and once it started it went on and on and on kit watched the progress of the painting and it occurred to him that if he made some paint he might imitate arthur flinderspetrie and copy the glyphs onto himself he could become his own skin map and thereby carry them out of the cave for further study taking one of the clamshells he filled it with some of the pounded earth mixed in some water and then started back to the main channel of the cave passing dardok he paused and whispered i need a drink he held the image of a man cupping water to his mouth dardok glanced around at him and gave a grunt of assent before resuming his work message delivered and received kit took his lamp and walked back along the tunnel leading to the main passage and the gallery of animals where he had seen the skin map pictograms he followed the twisting turning corridor of stone and came to a divide and paused he had not remembered that junction but then coming from the other side he would not have seen it he took the larger path and continued on after a few steps his decision was rewarded by the sound of water dripping into a poola solid almost metallic clink echoing along the stone corridor from somewhere just ahead kit resumed his slow progress along the passage the plinking sound however seemed to move with him remaining just a little ahead of him sometimes it seemed to be closer and other times farther away but curiously the sound seemed to remain just a little way ahead against all reason he picked up his paceas if he might overtake the sound somehow he felt a breath of air on his facethe merest touch of flowing air nothing more than a sigh against his cheek but it halted him once more the tiny breeze ceased must have imagined it thought kit moving on he had taken four or five steps when he felt it againa feathery light touch of warm on his skin he pushed on the singleflame lamp gave off little light but drawing closer to the metallic clinking sound kit imagined he saw a movement in the darkness just out of reach of his puny lampa low sinuous motion close to the floor it was therejust a flicker of shadow in the deeper gloomthen it was gone again yet the metallic clinking sound continued a little louder than it was before now air flowed over and around himfresh and clean not the stale still stuff that filled the cave at this kit felt the first flutter of worry had he taken a wrong turn somewhere kit stood for a moment frozen by indecision should he go back and try to find where he had gone wrong or continue on he felt the air on his face and decided to go forward if nothing else he reasoned following the fresh air would eventually lead him out of the cave he lurched ahead he heard the plinking sound again and sensed a rush of movement just ahead of him he glanced up to see a dark shape moving against the deeper darkness in the same instant his foot snagged something loose on the floor he felt a jerk lost his balance and went down the clamshell fell from his hand and clattered against the stone floor the skull lamps fragile flame snuffed out absolute darknessintense complete and impenetrabledescended on kit it felt as if the weight of the earth had collapsed upon him the darkness was so oppressive that for a moment he felt as if he might suffocate relax he told himself take a breath your lights gone out thats all it is only darknessyou wont smother with these and other thoughts he comforted himself as he lay on his side trying to decide if he was injured or merely unnerved other than utter blindness he seemed to be intact his best if not his only option was simply to keep following the fresh air until he came out of the cave and then wait at the entrance for dardok and the others who would eventually emerge to discover him rolling over onto all fours he climbed unsteadily to his feet and heard the clinking sound echoing off the rocks some distance away turning his head towards the sound he glimpsed a faint glow of pale light aheada ghostly gleam so weak it might have been imagined kit closed his eyes and counted to ten then opened them again the light remained he looked away looked back the pale cast of radiance persisted along with that maddening rattling clink kit pushed himself along with one hand on the wall beside him stumbling towards the distant glint of light after a few dozen steps the light seemed to grow brighter showing greywhite from an unknown distance ahead the sound was moving that way too it seemed then again perhaps the source of the plinkclink emanated from there given the reverberating nature of the cave there was no way to tell he shuffled forward holding the glow in the centre of his vision the shimmering radiance grew accordingly larger and brighter until kit realised he was looking at sunlight reflected off the stone sidewall of the passage ahead a few more steps carried him to the place where the tunnel twisted sharply to the right kit rounded the corner and the light grew brighter he worked his way along the uneven floor scrambling over rocks and loose rubble up ahead the passage turned again the plinkclink sound stopped as he rounded the corner he saw the cave mouth brilliant white streamed in through the irregular opening to kits lightdeprived eyes it was like looking into a blazing furnace or a miniature sun he squeezed his eyes shut then putting his hands over his face he allowed the light in a little at a time until his pupils had time to adjust he looked again the opening was still there still ablaze with radiance and sitting in that warm sunlight was the unmistakeable largerthanlife form of another cave lion looking more than anything like a grossly oversized housecat it sat on its haunches licking a forepaw the size of a soup bowl kit was already in midstep and could not stop himself in time his foot came down on a loose bit of rock which tipped and skidded under his weight the resulting clatter startled the beast and it turned its head towards him seen entirely in silhouette the animal appeared smaller than the one the hunters had killed earlier in the daya young one perhapsbut still big enough to fatally maul kit with a single swipe of its rapier claws kit could not see the creatures eyes but it was looking right at him he held himself perfectly still in the hope of being downwind of being invisible in the darkness the cave cat simply watched him for a moment then rose slowly slowly kit bent down and felt on the floor for a rock sweat beaded on his forehead and ran down his neck his sweaty hand closed on a ragged stone and he gripped it tightly at least he would not go down without a fight he straightened again the cave lion took a step towards him and kit drew a breath and shouted he ran forward screaming like a crazy man the big cat halted turned tail and fled as it leapt from the cave opening kit glimpsed something in its flash of movement that almost made his heart stop the cave cat was wearing an iron chain as the beast bounded away the chain swung out standing in the cave mouth kit saw the trailing links clearly in the light the end of the chain struck the rocks clinkplink clinkplink time telescoped how long had he been with river city clan how long since he had seen a fully evolved human being conversed in a modern language worn real clothes his mind reeled as he tried to place himself in an altered perspective for kit knew this cat he knew it from another time and another place another reality this cave cat was the property of the thugs known as the burley men this cat had a name baby and the last time he had seen baby that chain had been in the hands of a burley man named mal stunned kit hurried to the cave entrance and looked out the gorge was gone the snow vanished and winter with it instead he gazed out on a scrubby green hillside the slope fell away steeply and at the bottom far below he saw the cave cat streaking for the wide silver arc of a river and just beyond the river a twolane blacktop highway chapter in which an assault is launched sunrise was cassandras favourite time of day in sedona the air was fresh and cool from the previous night and the sky pale pink the rising sun still hidden from view behind the rim of towering red rock stacks that formed the horizon in every direction cassandra put the key into the ignition of one of the small white utility vans started the engine and eased out of the parking lot of the kings arms motel there were few cars on the road and she made the familiar drive out to the dig site in good time she pulled into the site staging area and parked behind the mound of rubble bags so the van would be less visible from the highway taking her hat sunglasses and camera she tucked the keys under the vehicles rubber floor mat cracked the windows and left the van in the little shade provided by a small canvas awning attached to the sorting shed she shouldered her day pack and wove her way through the excavation potholes and trenches moving towards the escarpment shielding the deep arroyo known as secret canyon she breathed in the morning air heavy with the scent of sagebrush and fell into an easy rhythmic stride enjoying the crunch of scree beneath her thicksoled boots cass had come dressed for action wearing her good wellworn hiking boots and thick socks her longsleeved chambray shirt her lightweight cargo trousers and the oversized cotton scarf she used as a sun shield in her day pack she carried two litres of water a margarine tub full of raisins peanuts m ampms and dried cranberries a tube of factor sunscreen a folding knife her emergency firstaid kit with snakebite accessories and lightweight travel binocularseverything she needed for a desert assault if what happened today was at all similar to what had happened the evening before she would be ready in any event she wanted to take some pictures and write some notes to begin documenting the phenomenon when her father arrived later in the day they could sit down together and design a more thoroughgoing investigation first however she intended to test her theory that the phenomenon that friday called the coyote bridge was actually a spacetime anomaly connected to or embedded in the physical landscape of the earth after speaking to her father cass had gone to bed but was way too keyed up to sleep so she spent the night online researching such things as shamanistic flight soul travel and astral projection most of what she read as she sat in bed hunched over her laptop was incoherent blathera mixture of new age tripe and bizzaro fantasybut she found enough levelheaded material to convince her that what she had experienced the day before was not a dream vision or mental aberration such as a hallucination or some kind of hysteria the violent storm sudden and shortlived the weird vertigo the abrupt arrival in a foreign placethese were apparently more or less common features of the phenomenon attested to in many cultures and times some writers ascribed mystical significance to the experience and others were quite workaday in their appraisal moreover while many outlandish claims and explanations were offered and there was very little agreement among people with startlingly divergent orientations to lifesome exhibiting an extremely loose grip on realitycass was able to tease out a few common threads a belief that travel to other dimensions or parallel realities was shared by many different cultures in many different ages and that such travel was not only possible it was a practise that could be taught learned and mastered the author of one intriguing article a woman with waistlength white hair who went by the name of star eagleoffered the observation that not only were specific locations on the landscape important for shamanic flight but the specified locations were time sensitive that is the wouldbe flyer would be most likely to achieve success if he or she embarked at sunrise or sunset dawn and twilight were the best times to fly she said hardheaded scientist that she was cass would have written off all this as so much malarkey and mumbo jumbo if not for her own firsthand experience the day before she would have consigned astral travel to the loony bin along with rainbow worship crop circles and almondeyed aliens yet something had happened and whatever it was she could not ignore it like a good openminded researcher she had come prepared to test and document her discovery however unsettling plus she wanted to have something tangiblea few photographs at leastto show her father she walked easily through the desert enjoying the stroll among the cacti and creosote bushes with the almost giddy sensation of a little girl on christmas eve that flutter in the stomach and a feverish anticipation when she reached the arroyo she paused for a moment to take a few snaps of the secret canyon entrance still deep in shadow she could feel the nightcooled air issuing from the mouth of the gorge wafting over her and dissipating the darkened opening yawned like a cave and seemed somehow forbidding cass hesitated taking a few more pictures finally as the rising sun cleared the ragged hill line to the east spilling light across the valley she drew a breath and whispered a simple prayer god dont let me break my neck she put her arm through the dangling strap of her pack and stepped into the canyon adding also please oh please dont let me get lost the walls closed around her she walked slowly placing her footsteps with exaggerated care as if measuring distance alert to whatever sensations she might feel aside from the sound of her own footsteps pinging off the high sandstone walls there was nothing she had reached the straight track and was a fair way into the gorge when it occurred to her that when she had been here the first time she had been chasing friday trying to catch him so she picked up her pace a cool breeze gusted down from the stony heights of the undulating walls she stepped up her pace still more from somewhere high on the canyon rim above her cass heard a sound like that of a hawka keening whinelike whistleand felt a spatter of rain strike the back of her hand she glanced up and got another raindrop smack on her brow a low mist cloud hung over the gap between the narrow rock walls she kept moving noting the sudden change in the weather as gusting wind whipped around her legs blowing loose sand and dry yucca leaves down the path ahead of her the mist descended enveloping her slicking her face with moisture in the same moment a queasy sensation squirmed through her and her step falteredas if the surface beneath her feet had dropped half a step lower she saw light ahead where the sun was burning through the allenveloping fog and moved towards it emerging to find herself on a vast plain stretching away in every direction to a horizon of black hills far away she had arrived in the ghost world the travel sickness hit her all at once slamming into her even as she stood looking at the emptiness opening around her she doubled over and retched into the dust at her feet hands on knees she stood for a moment breathing through her nose until the dizziness passed she dabbed her lips and rinsed her mouth with a swig from her water bottle thankful that this time there was no headache she swallowed some more water and then raising her camera began photographing the bleak monochrome landscape in a wide panoramic sweep to take in the open empty bonedry flatasaniron volcanic pan around her the sun stood low in the western sky almost touching the tops of the far distant hills illuminating the lines that covered the cinder plain stretched away arrowstraight across a totally featureless wastelandno cacti no boulders no rocks larger than any other nothing in any direction as far as the eye could see except the mysterious lines some of the lines were arrow straight others curved into immense spirals splayed across acres of empty landscape lowering her camera cass squatted down to take a few pictures of the path on which she stood then put down a hand to feel the gritty texture of the pumice and discovered that the layer beneath was lighter than that which was above oxidation she breathed to herself so thats how theyre made it was simplicity itself by moving the surface layer off to either side to expose the lighter material beneath a stripe of lightcoloured stone was created she remembered pictures of chalk drawings presented in prehistoric anthropology lectures at university where to create a drawing on a hillside primitive people simply removed the turf to expose the white chalk just below the surfacea technique requiring few tools but lots of manpower the principle here was the same cass stepped off the line and took a photo of the trail from another angle the light dimmed somewhat the sun was beginning its descent behind the hills cass decided that having done what she intended she should go back while the coyote bridge between the worlds was still open she stepped onto the track once more and started back the way she had come walking with quick purpose almost at once the wind sprang up it howled around her in whirling dust devils raising clouds of fine volcanic dust cass shut her eyes tight against the blowing grit and in a moment felt the sheen of moisture on her face she continued a few more paces and the wind died away with a last trailing shriek she was back in the canyon in the shadowed cool of early morning the tall stone walls rising sheer on either hand she managed a few more steps before the incipient motion sickness caught up with her it was dry heaves this time and she put a hand to the nearest wall to steady herself drawing deep breaths through her nose until the queasiness passedto be replaced by a surge of joy at having successfully navigated the coyote bridge between worlds without a guide and without a hitch wait until dad hears about this she thought hell be so amazed wiping her mouth on her sleeve she moved on her moment of blissful triumph ended abruptly as she stepped from the mouth of the canyon and was met by the sight of a wide green valley with a broad river flowing through it in graceful arcs beneath a sky dappled with small white powderpuff clouds a line of stately poplar trees rose above the rich brown earth of newly ploughed fields on the hills either side of the river the gentle rural scene met her astonished gaze and her heart clenched in her chest wherever she was it was definitely not arizona her brain thrummed with a single thought now what now what now what casss first inclination was to promptly sit down hug her knees to her chest close her eyes against the sight and wish it all awayas one would with an ordinary nightmare her second thought was to calmly carefully enumerate and categorise her options she did neither of those things instead she gave in to a far more instinctual urge and simply turned and fled the way she had come darting back into the canyon once more she raced along the sandstone walls her heart in her mouth hoping against hope that the coyote bridge was still accessible before she had taken a dozen flying steps her vision grew misty and a blast of hot wind swept down upon her driving her forward the ground gave way beneath her and she lurched a falling half step stumbled and pitched forward her camera banged into her forehead causing her eyes to water all knees and elbows she landed in a heap raising a cloud of dust as before the light filtering down from on high was dim the air cool on her skin and she sighed with relief at the sight of the secret canyons familiar sandstone walls but as her eyes adjusted to the faint light and she looked around the walls turned out to be whitewashed plaster and the path was a cobbled stone alley just ahead a low and narrow archway opened onto a brighter sunlit way beyond oh great she muttered between gritted teeth now where am i determined this time not to give in to panic but to approach this admitted setback in a calm rational scientific way cass dragged herself to her feet swatted the dust from her clothes and moved towards the archway with a calming breath she stepped through a white sun blazed in a cloudless sky of intense blue beating down upon a street lined with ruined columns and bounded by tiny shops sporting colourful striped awnings and directly before her a cobbled thoroughfare straight as a plumb line and squeezed to near impassibility by a formidable gauntlet of street merchants selling from carts and stalls and barrows she stood at the entrance to the alleyway and gazed down along the avenue clutches of people moved among the vendors examining the merchandise bargaining buying and bearing away their purchases all were dressed in billowy garments long headtoheel robes of black brown or blueandwhitestripes for the women and for the men baggy striped trousersballooned around the legs and tight at the ankleswith floppy white shirts and truncated waistcoats in yellow green or blue every head was covered the women wore scarves or veils of netted lace the men wore hats in brick tones or blood red cass took one look at the feztopped heads and came to the conclusion that she had arrived in turkeyistanbul maybe in any case it was a city she had never visited before and had no wish to be in right now glancing quickly right and left to make sure no one was watching she ducked into the alley from which she had just emerged and strode back the way she had come passages opened on either hand but she continued straight on until reaching a blank wall the old track had once passed through the wall she could see the outline of an arch framed in stone but the opening had been bricked up some time in the past she spun on her heel and headed back the opposite way moving with the same swift purposeful steps that had brought her this far this time however they did not produce the desired result the air remained still the alleyway did not grow misty there was no sudden gust of wind or rain or mist no momentary lurch into another world she paused drew a deep breath and repeated the attempt with no better result cold sweat beaded between her shoulder blades no she whispered under her breath fear will get you nowhere turn around and lets try this again after one more effort cass concluded that she was stuckat least until sunset or failing that early the next morning in the meantime she would find somewhere to hide and lie low until nightfall that would keep her out of sight and out of trouble looking around she decided to hunker down in one of the little passageways branching off the alley it was shady and cool and though other doors opened onto it there was no one around slipping off her backpack she sat down on the ground and settled in to wait an hour or so passed during which she grew bored and she was rethinking her strategy when a pack of dogs came wandering down the alley they saw her and began barking cass did not like dogs all that much and disliked being barked at even more she tried to hush them and made shooing motions with her hands to drive them away while she was doing this one of the alley doors opened and a man put his head out to see what had stirred up the pack he saw her and started towards her calling out in a language cass could not identify and cass to avoid an explanation or a confrontation shouldered her pack gave him a cheery wave and hurried away leading her doggy escort back on the street once more she decided that she might as well make the best of it and at least explore the place while she was here she had taken but a few steps from the alley entrance when she heard a shout and spun around in time to avoid a man on a motor scooter bearing down on her balanced on the handlebars was a tray of pomegranates cass scrambled out of the way as the scooter spurted past the man still shouting and weaving wildly narrowly missing a donkey cart carrying crates of live chickens stacked in a high unsteady tower the dogs followed the cart yapping at the donkey and cass proceeded on her way down the street looking for any hints that might tell her where in the world she was the signs she saw on the shops and in windows or hanging over the streets on wires were all in some form of arabicwhich did not entirely square with her scant knowledge of turkey the snatches of language she caught as she passedfrom those nearby and the street sellers who called out to hersounded to her like arabic too so not turkey then but somewhere in the middle east this impression was immediately strengthened when a group of women emerged from a side street each wearing a black veil and carrying a parcel on her headbags bulging with fruit or neatly folded sheets of flat bread one of the women saw cass nudged her neighbour and pointed the group stopped turned towards her and stared my clothes cass suddenly felt very conspicuous and vulnerable her first thought was to buy something from one of the street merchants but realised she had only a handful of loose change in a foreign currency ducking behind one of the marble pillars lining the street she hastily readjusted her wardrobe buttoning her floppy shirt to the top and pulling out the shirttails she put her belt around the outside to make it look like some sort of short tunic she could not do much about the trousers but unfolded the cuffs and pulled them down over her boots then taking her scarf she arranged it to cover her hair roughly in the manner of the other women in all this thin disguise was not the best way to pass unnoticed by the locals but it would have to do when she ventured into public view once more she kept to the shadows and tried to remain inconspicuous carrying her backpack like a parcel under her arm rather than wearing it she slowly made her way along pausing now and again to take surreptitious photos of the placefor future reference if nothing else for some reason she was especially drawn to doors and doorwaysthese and even some of the walls of surrounding buildings were of a distinctive blackandwhite stone in wide alternating bands basalt for the black cass decided and pale limestone or marble for the white on closer inspection there were traces of other periods of architecture mixed in here and there a melange of styles each distinctive of an empire pastgreek and roman from the classical period byzantine arabic and though cass was no expert what looked to her like ottoman she passed beneath a ruined roman arch still standing with distinctive acaciatopped columns on either side and a few yards or so farther on another arch in the characteristic arab onion shape framing a byzantine bronze door she walked on eventually coming to the city wall set with a huge triple gatetwo smaller doors flanking a large central portal all three doors were open wide and through them she could see a wide boulevard of palm trees with traffic passing to and fro outside the wall oddly for a busy city there were few vehicles plying this thoroughfare cass would have expected moreand all of them appeared as if they belonged in a museum for vintage motors with lowslung chassis and small windows and fat whitewalled tires below wide rounded fenders that swooped into running boards these automobiles and small trucks were definitely from another era cassandra had the sensation of having wandered onto a movie set of a film about the s so as well as moving through space she had also travelled in time the scientist in her rose up in a cry of impossible even as this thought entered her head another voice asked more impossible than travelling from one place to another in a pretty good imitation of beammeupscotty the possibility of chronological migration had simply never occurred to her and it took her a moment to adjust to yet another radical new paradigm shift clearly everything she knew was wrong a new theory would have to be created to account for this new reality cass turned and gazed back down the street nothing she saw contradicted the timetravel premise neither did anything readily confirm it the architecture certainly was archaicbut that was true of most places throughout the region the people were dressed in simple garb that might belong to any decade in the last two hundred years or moreagain that was inconclusive the vehicles alone gave her a clue one or two might be explained away but every single one of them belonging to the same era no so taken together these clues led to the conclusion that in addition to moving through space she had somehow slipped backward in time reluctant to wander any farther from the one street she knew cass turned around and started back the way she had come walking along taking in the simple brickandtimber style construction mingled with more substantial stone structures she passed a church behind a gate of iron filigree and across the street from it a mosque with a green dome topped with a crescent moon in brass she walked beneath the roman arch once more and noticed immediately on the other side a generous gated doorway contained within an arch of alternating blackandwhite stone the huge wooden doors were open revealing the entrance to a covered marketplace veiled and shrouded women were congregating around the entrance chatting to one another they darted glances at her but did not stare and for that cass was grateful beyond them she could see merchants selling vegetables and cloth from stalls either side of a long aisle that disappeared into the dark interior of the bazaar she moved towards the entrance keeping to the edge of the milling throng as she neared the archway wall her eye fell upon a signa single sheet of orange paper printed in neat black letterswritten in english and pasted to the plaster of the wall she stopped automatically and read lost lonely looking for something to believe in we can help for information ring damascus or come to hanania street nr beit hanania the zetetic society she read the words again with the uncanny feeling that in some inexplicable and wholly improbable way the message on the sign was meant for her she stood transfixed by the simple orange sign as by the dancing flame of a fire while the conviction hardened within her that she must go to this place at once and that if she could only find the zetetic society all her questions would all be answered already one question had been answered she now knew that she was not in turkey but in syria what else could this mysterious society tell her part three the street called straight chapter in which some things are not to be the nile flowed on without so much as a ripple beneath the barges carrying the priests of amun back to niwetamun and the temple though the sun blazed high in the clear egyptian sky and life along the river continued serene and quiet as always benedicts small world was shaken to the very core he looked upon the lush green banks sliding silently by and all he saw was desolation in his mind moment by moment he relived the riot in akhenatens holy city he heard the angry cries and saw the stones striking the priests striking his father refusing to leave his injured fathers bedside he sat in misery rarely stirring filled with dread and fear while a succession of ministering priests came and went i will not swear falsely anen told him your fathers injury is very grave benedict turned anxious uncomprehending eyes upon the priest but know you anen continued our skills are great and every possible remedy will be availed for him take courage in this knowledge he placed a comforting hand on the young mans shoulder on this i have made my vow in the name of amun it shall be unable to understand the language of those around him benedict derived little comfort from this assurance still he heard the sound of hope in the priests voice and felt his encouragement in the gentle touch he did take courage and he prayed as he had never prayed before using the only prayer he knew well and saying it over and over until it became only our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done amen it took two days for the barge to sail upriver to amuns holy city by the time they reached the temple arthur had rallied somewhat he was able to sit up and take a little water and though the priests were reluctant to give him too much food they allowed him a little of the flat bread sprinkled with salt benedict was relieved and took this as a good sign upon arrival at niwetamun a cadre of servants carried arthurs pallet from the dock to the house of wholeness and healing a large square structure occupying the eastern quarter of the temple compound there the injured man was placed on a low bed in a cool dark room to be watched night and day the temple physicians busied themselves with a thorough examination of the livid wound which had swollen the entire left side of arthurs head arthur endured their gentle probing groaning and grinding his teeth youre going to be all right benedict assured him when the physicians finished arthur sank back into a deep sleep and did not awaken again until sunset water he said his voice a croaking whisper the priests in attendance did not know what he said so benedict repeated it and mimed drinking from a cup one of the younger physicians poured a shallow bowl of water infused with honey and herbs here drink this benedict said bending near how do you feel hurts whispered arthur inside it hurts he made to turn his head but the effort defeated him where are we we are back in the temple there are doctors here they are taking care of you benedict told him they are going to make you well youre going to be all right good arthur offered the bare hint of a nod well done son the young physician offered the cup once more and arthur was given a little more to drink after taking a few sips he tried to sit up the movement brought him pain and he lay back panting with the effort just rest now benedict told him they will take care of you arthur slept then and awoke in the night complaining about the noise in his ears benedict tried to convey to the priest in attendance what his father was saying he pulled on his ears and made a sound like the buzzing of angry bees the doctor nodded and hurried away returning with two senior physicians he pointed to benedict and gestured for him to perform the pantomime again which he did the elder doctors nodded and one of them stepped close to the patient holding his hand before arthurs face he clicked his fingers when this failed to elicit a response he clapped his handsfirst in front of his face and then next to his ear arthurs eyelids fluttered and he opened his eyes did you hear that asked benedict when his father did not reply he asked again more loudly ah yes i heard he opened his mouth and swallowed mouth is dry benedict took up the cup of honey water and gently raising his fathers injured head gave him another drink arthur seemed to relax somewhat he closed his eyes and went back to sleep the next time he awoke he called out for benedict who asleep beside him rose and bent near i am here father he said what do you need arthur raised a trembling hand and pawed the air i cant see you he gasped i cant see benedict took his hand and held it i am here my eyes i cant see the young physician hearing the exchange appeared and benedict explained as best he could what his father had said the night doctor ran to fetch the two senior physicians and they examined arthur carefully lifting his head and feeling the massive discoloured lump and gazing long into the injured mans left eye using a candle and disk of polished bronze they exchanged a few words over their patient then sent the younger one away he returned a short time later with anen and the three held close consultation for a moment then anen nodded and turned to benedict what is wrong said the young man what does it mean i am sorry anen said placing a hand on the young mans shoulder there is bleeding inside his head it is making a swelling and a pressure in the brain benedict did not understand a word of what he was being told but he understood the priests grave tone hes going to be well isnt he hes going to get better we must open his skull to let out some of the blood and relieve the pressure what are you saying demanded benedict frustrated at not being able to comprehend the priest i dont understand anen gestured to the young physician who came forward and offered his own head for examination anen proceeded to demonstrate what he was talking about by way of indicating on the young mans head what he intended he drew a small circle on his subjects scalp then lifted it away and proceeded to tap and pick at the centre of the imaginary circle you are going to open my fathers skull wondered benedict aghast at the very idea anen caught the disbelief in the youths tone and shocked expression he sought to reassure him it is dangerous truly all such procedures carry great risk yet this treatment is well established among us and our physicians are skilled in its application he gazed intently at benedict we must begin at once benedict could only nod helplessly he gazed at his fathers inert form do what you must anen led the youth to his fathers bedside and with a gentle touch roused the suffering man we will treat you my friend using a special procedure i have every confidence in its success but if you have anything to say to your son you should speak now arthur understood what benedict did not he stretched out his hand to his son and gripped it hard i am not afraid he whispered they are going to make you better insisted benedict clasping his fathers hand tight in both his own do you hear they are going to make you well again i love you son replied arthur take care of your mother tell her i i am sorry anen stepping near took benedict by the arm and drew him away we must begin at once if we are to save him the senior priest clapped his hands and four physicians appeared they wore white linen robes and small white caps and each carried a tray of instruments jars and vials temple servants scurried behind them with stands on which to place the trays other servants brought torches on high stands which they placed around the bed still others appeared bearing basins of water and piles of folded cloths they went straight to work while one of the priest physicians shaved the left side of arthurs head one administered a tincture of herbs mixed with opium and a third undressed him his shirt had to be cut off the priest applied the scissors pulling the cloth away in strips to reveal a torso decorated with bright blue tattoosall in the same neat hand all of them utterly incomprehensible symbols when the last shreds of his shirt had been removed the priest spread cloths under arthurs head and shoulders and washed his neck shoulders and chest while all this was going on the fourth priest prepared the instruments rinsing them in a special mixture of distilled vinegar when everything was ready and in order anen gestured to one of the attendant servants who turned to benedict bowed low and taking him by the hand led him to a far corner of the room where the youth could watch but would not interfere then at a nod from anen the operation began the foremost of the priest physicians knelt down beside the bed and took up a small knife with an obsidian blade he clicked his fingers before arthurs eyes then tapped him lightly on the cheekraising no response then with quick decisive strokes he applied the blade and cut into the scalp around the discoloured lump above the left eyeonce twice and again blood flowed freely from the deep cut instantly wet cloths were applied that had been soaked in some astringent solution because the gush of blood ceased almost at once the physician made another quick incision and then pulled back the flap of scalp to reveal a black clot of blood and tissue with white bone beneath a cloying sweet smell wafted into the room while the first physician held back the flap with a little bronze prong a second moved swiftly forward with a pair of long golden tweezers and began picking out bits of clot and dead flesh when the area was clean he turned his attention to tweezing out fragments of crushed bone and dropping them into a small silver bowl anen stood by arms folded across his chest supervising the procedure when the priest finished removing the splinters of bone anen motioned to the third priesta short stocky man with a shaved head and round cherubic facewho stepped to the bedside and took up a bronze instrument that to benedict resembled a carpenters auger as the first priest carefully held back the flap of scalp he had freed the auger was applied to the freshly scoured bone the fourth priest moved in to steady the patients head and benedict heard a sound like that of a millstone grinding corn unable to watch he turned his face and looked away the grisly sound seemed to go on and on and when it finished benedict glanced around to see that a neat round hole had been bored in his fathers skull in the centre of the hole was a ghastly clot of blood glistening redblack and virulent anen turned and offered benedict a knowing smile to tell him that all was going well the stocky priest stepped back from his work and another moved into his place taking up a tiny golden knife the physician began gently scraping at the clot cutting it away pausing now and then to dab away the blood oozing from the fresh wound and to remove the scrapings and rinse his blade in a bowl of vinegar solution it was soon finished and the golden tweezers applied once more to remove every last fragment sliver and fleck of broken bone greyish pink flesh glistened through the hole anen stepped forward then the other priests stood back to allow him to examine their work he bent close and with the most delicate touch probed the neat incision and felt the smooth edges of bone he inspected the wound and spoke to his fellow priests they held close consultation for a moment whereupon anen crossed the room to join benedict there has been much bleeding beneath the bone the priest said willing the youth to understand the bleeding is stopped and pressure is relieved now we can but watch and wait benedict heard in the priests tone a note of reassurance and clung to it thank you anen squeezed the young mans shoulder then returned to supervise the binding of the wound a small disk of gold was washed in the vinegar solution and then applied to the naked skull working with deft efficiency the priests closed the wound replacing the scalp and sewing the edges back together they then wrapped strips of clean linen around and around the patients head when they finished arthurs head was swathed in a turban all four doctors stepped back bowed to the patient and to anen then took up their trays and instruments and departed leaving one behind to watch the patient anen released benedict to approach his father once more despite the ordeal just endured his father seemed to rest peacefully his breathing though shallow was regular and even benedict took this as a good sign he settled onto his bedside stool to resume his vigil sometime before morning there arose a commotion out in the temple courtyard benedict dozing on his chair awoke to the sound of raised voices and running feet glancing around he saw that the priest keeping vigil was gone he went to the door of the healing house and looked out priests with torches were running here and there they seemed to be barring the gates no sooner was this accomplished then they raced away and the courtyard grew quiet once more benedict returned to his fathers room taking up a lamp he moved to the bed and examined his father although it was difficult to tell he sensed a change his father seemed to rest more peacefully the lines of tension in his face relaxed his features composed benedict turned to replace the lamp on the stand and heard a faint clicking sound looking back he saw his fathers mouth move but no sound emerged he leaned close once more i am here father what is it again the dry lips moved and benedict heard the merest ghost of a breath utter a word i did not hear you father say it again the voice rising to a hoarse whisper repeated the words the spirit well arthur sighed and seemed to sink deeper into the bed what father tell me again benedict stared at his father fear twisting his gut into a knot what did you say receiving no response benedict leaned closer father i cant hear you he put a tentative hand on his fathers shoulder and jostled him in an attempt to keep him awake just a little longer please tell mewhat did you say the spirit well the words came out as a moan with the last of his strength arthur moved his hand to his chest benedict observed where the hand came to rest i have marked it he gasped his voice trailing into silence benedict gazed at the tattooed symbols on his fathers chestthe familiar spray of curious emblems he was only just beginning to learn how to navigate he shook his fathers shoulder again there was no response father benedict growing frantic shouted please i dont understand what you mean turning from the bed he ran to the door and called for help the priest assigned to bedside duty reappeared almost at once hurrying across the yard he bowed to benedict then pushed past him and moved quickly to kneel beside the bed placing a hand on arthurs chest he put his ear close to his patients nose and mouth and paused as if listening he was just began benedict the physician raised a palm for silence and then placed his fingertips against arthurs neck rising he retrieved a small rectangle of polished bronze from his tray of instruments and held it beneath the stricken mans nose benedict his heart in his throat knew what this meant dreading what he would see yet unable to look away he stared with growing apprehension as the physician turned the little square of bronze towards him there was not the slightest smudge of fog or moisture on the polished surface his father was no longer breathing the physician shook his head then stood and raising his palms shoulder high bent at the waist and began chanting in a low droning voice benedict slumped back against the wall his eyes on his fathers body no it cannot be he murmured pounding his fist against the wall he was just talking to me he cannot be de the boy refused to say the word rushing to the bed benedict threw himself down upon his fathers body there was no movement no resistance he clasped his fathers face in his hands and was surprised to feel the warmth there dont leave me his voice cracked please dont leave me strong hands gripped the young mans arms and pulled him away upon release arthurs head rolled to one side benedict shook off the priests hands and struggled forward once more i think hes unconscious he insisted we should try to wake him the priest said something to him and shook his head then went back to his chanting an almighty walloping thump sounded in the courtyardsomething had crashed into the temple gates benedict turned towards the sound and a servant burst into the room the servant took one look at the praying priest and disappeared again benedict sinking under the weight of grief rising within him clasped his hands and began to pray as well he squeezed his eyes shut and prayed as he had never prayed in his life the next thing he knew anen was standing before him his expression grim sadness filling his dark eyes the priest gestured to the body of his friend and said something benedict could not understand the young man shook his head whereupon anen took him by the hand and led him to the bed placing the young mans hand against his fathers body he held it there the flesh was cooler now anen spoke again his voice gentle with sorrow we tried to heal him but it was not to be his soul has entered the house of the dead and has begun the journey into the afterlife he pointed to the body in the bed and seemed to expect a response benedict gazed upon that inert form the transformation had begun the animated presence he had known all his life was no longer there all that was left was a shell a rather sad and damaged husk the man he knew and loved was gone chapter in which old haunts are revisited wilhelmina enjoyed her visits to the abbey at montserrat and looked forward to them with an anticipation that far exceeded any expectation she held for the journey or destination itself in some ways it was reminiscent of the feeling she had had as a schoolgirl the night before the annual field trip to the british museum a place she loved or maybe it was the way a pilgrim felt when after weeks or months of preparation the day came to set foot on the peregrine path leading to a sacred destination perhaps by a little stretch that was what she wasa pilgrim just thinking about working with brother lazarus at his kitchen table in the observatory high on the mountaintop sipping his sour wine and talking astronomy cosmology and physics in an attempt to unravel the mysteries of ley travel made wilhelminas heart beat that little bit faster she had found himor had been guided to him as he insistedto further her education for the work ordained for her to do she was stretched and challenged always but also comfortable in his presence he was the wise uncle she had never had and so it was that on one of those early visits it was decided that as a test of brother lazarus theory of time calibration between alternate dimensions wilhelmina should return to london to find kit and as she put it settle her affairs aside from explaining what had happened to her during that first illconsidered jump she wanted to tell him not to worry about her that she had found her bliss running a coffee shop in prague and was making a better life for herself in the seventeenth century than she had ever known in the twentyfirst and incidentally that whatever romantic attachment they might once have shared was now irrevocably severed time had passed events had transpired and as a consequence they were no longer what they had once been selflessly magnanimously with every blessing for his future happiness she graciously freed him from any entanglements real or imagined he might feel for this last part she rehearsed various scenarios all of them ending with a tearful regretfilled kit bidding her farewell as she strodeshoulders back head held highout of his life forever the inevitable breakup was not owing to any vindictiveness or hard feelings towards kit she bore him no ill will whatsoeverjust the opposite in fact she was extremely grateful to him for introducing her to the wonders of ley travel if accidentally and any resentment or bitterness she initially feltand there was plenty of that in those first traumatic dayshad long since evaporated in the sunny prospect of a far brighter future than she could have imagined much less engineered on her own that it was a future taking place in a postmedieval version of prague gave her no end of pleasure the paradox was delicious i guess im just an oldfashioned girl at heart she mused happily now that she was familiar with ley travel in its broadest most general sense and growing in confidence by leaps and bounds as it were wilhelmina was keen to master the finer points and intricacies and so had become a willing guinea pig for brother lazarus experiments getting the time period right he said during one of their sessions that is most crucial if were ever to effect a reunion between you and your friend or any other useful purpose for that matter suggested mina to be sure he tapped his fingers on the table are you certain you wish to try why not she shrugged what have we got to lose i know how to get back here if anything goes wrong i can always return and who knows whatever happens might prove useful there is rarely advance without experiment he observed then leaned forward elbows on the table in the posture of a lecturer instructing a pupil if this experiment is successful we will add a great deal to our store of knowledge see here now listen carefully thomas young was active in london between and he was a president and member of the royal society so you should be able to make contact with him through the society secretaryproviding you can get back to london in the first place the ley that took you to prague should lead you back to londonalthough this is far from certain mina agreed that it was worth a try i just wish there was a way to calibrate the time frame more precisely that my dear is what the experiment is designed to explore he said with a smile if my theory is correct each physical point along any particular line corresponds to a specific time reference that being so he smiled and shook his head well youll just have to try making a jump and see where that gets you a leap or two along the same ley should give you the means of comparison again this is assuming you end up in london i have my ley lamp to help me she pointed out an extraordinary instrument brother lazarus enthused i would give my right arm to know how it works he regarded her across the table are you certain you wish to try this going home again could be distressing i was born and raised in london ill be all right when will you go im ready now mina told him theres no time like the present as the sun began to sink beyond the crags to the west brother lazarus walked with her to the high mountain ley to see her away vaya con dios he called as wilhelmina embarked on her longdelayed return to london her attempt employed the line she now called the bohemian ley the landscape was as she remembered it from that first traumatic leap and visiting the place again brought a curiously nostalgic feeling the little blue lights on the lamp confirmed the presence of an active ley and her first jump proved marginally successful in that she reached the outskirts of a sizeable town set in a place that in most ways resembled the english countryside at first glance the landscape looked familiar but as she stood on a bluff overlooking a wide generous valley with a small village of thatchedroof cottages the absence of paved roads and motorways gave her to know that if it was anywhere near london the day of the combustion engine had yet to dawn immediately turning around she doubled back before the ley closedand tried again in all it took her two days and no fewer than seven leaps before she happened to strike the winning formula roughly a metre every four hundred years or thereabouts she worked out that if one paced off the stride and matched stride to leap so to speak one could home in on englands capital city in a particular epoch her seventh attempt brought her to a suitably modern period the sound of the gusting wind receded blending into the whine of an ambulance siren echoing down the brick canyon of stane way the alleyway looked familiar and she was mightily encouraged it remained to be seen precisely when she had arrived but that mystery was cleared up the moment she emerged onto grafton street a bus bearing an advertisement for virgin mobile phones was the first vehicle to pass and it was quickly followed by a british telecom van advertising their speedy mb service fori a month i made it trilled wilhelmina i actually made it she shivered with equal parts excitement and dread at the prospect of a return to her old haunts then started down grafton street her progress soon had her reeling with the brute force assault on her senses the ordinary sights of the city were garish and gaudy the sounds strident and confusingeverything blared and screamed and contested for her attention after the relative peace of a lessmechanised time the modern pace of the world seemed an ordealtoo loud too fast too rough she had the feeling of running an obstacle course full of unnecessary shock and alarms everywhere she looked the view appeared designed to deliver a blow a lowslung black car with blacktinted windows cruised by booming out a bass beat designed to disturb a motorbike zipped past in the opposite direction buzzing like an oversized hornet the pavement teemed with french language students lugging matching orange backpacks and drifting along in amorphous crowds like multiheaded amoebas a tower block undergoing renovation was a gutted noise box echoing with the clatter of jackhammers and diesel generators filling the air above with a noxious pollution of highdecibel clashing and blue fumes the signs in shop windows screamed in fluorescent letters sale and ultra discount everything must go yet and yetthese streets heaving with traffic bristling with advertising and thronged with oblivious pedestrians bowling along in pursuit of their own private agendas were exactly the same as she remembered the bleak skyline of grey apartment blocks the dreary sky crisscrossed with vapour trails of roaring jetliners the litter and garbage discarded in the gutter the thrum and thrust of a busy metropolitan streetall of it was precisely the same as it had always been funny she had never noticed the casual brutality of it before well she noticed now and she did not like it the assault on her senses staggered her she felt the city closing in on her and her stomach grew queasy at the first opportunity she ducked into a side street and slumped onto the bottom step of a townhouse to gather her wits and regroup you dont live here anymore mina she told herself just let it wash over you after a few minutes she was able to regain her composure enough to continue on to her old neighbourhood since leaving wilhelmina had had plenty of time to consider what she would do if she managed to return to london again her first inclination was to avoid giovannis bakerytoo many memories too much explaining to dobut now as she entered more familiar streets she changed her mind part of settling her affairs involved making a clean break with her old life so that there would be fewer questions left unanswered fewer loose ends left dangling if nothing else she reckoned she had back pay coming and she could use some ready cash for getting around the city first however she had to find out the present day month and year so she would know how much time had elapsed since that first fateful journey she passed a w h smiths and stepped inside moving directly to the wall of magazines and newspapers a quick examination of the times caused her to do a double take a glance at the dateline on the nearby guardian confirmed it the newspapers were dated the month and year she had left and the day what day had she departed a sundayyes sundayshe and kit had planned to go shopping on her day off it was mondays edition of the times that she held in her hands flabbergasted she stumbled back onto the street her mind spinning with the implications by the time she reached her old workplace wilhelmina was slightly dazed and not at all certain what her reception would be she paused across the street from the little shop and watched for a moment nothing seemed to have changed the greenandwhite striped awning was the same the sign on the window proclaiming artisan breads our specialty was exactly as she had last seen it fixing a smile to her face she crossed the street and pushed through the door the bell over the door tinkled announcing her arrival and the girl behind the counter looked up mina screeched tatyana the cashier youre here i uh what are you wearing wilhelmina glanced down at her travelling attire clothing crisis she explained dont ask you didnt come in this morning tatyana pointed out what happened before mina could answer she continued we tried to call you we were worried its been crazy here all morning sorry said wilhelmina just then john the bakery owner bustled into view carrying a tray of sticky buns whos sorry he asked then glanced around mina what happened you didnt open this morning the sight of her employer the shop the warm yeasty smell of baked goods in the display cases brought a surge of emotion mina had not anticipated she had not spared a single thought for the place in all the time she had been gone i think i ate a bad shrimp she muttered sorry i couldnt get my phone to work no kiddin i tried to call you he set down the tray and regarded her closely you look different you okay actually i need a sick day she replied gamely if thats okay sure agreed john take a couple days if you need to ill cover for you tomorrow thanks i appreciate it she hesitated then said i dont suppose i have any pay coming isnt it direct deposited right said mina i wasnt thinking her salary would have been deposited electronically into her account to get any money would require a visit to the bank and production of her bank card which she no longer possessed well id love to chat john was saying but ive got another tray of buns coming out see ya later he turned and retreated to the kitchen go up and see rachelmaybe she hasnt done the endofmonth stuff yet wilhelmina called her goodbye as he disappeared around the corner two women customers entered the shop followed by a mum with a pram the place was suddenly filling up hope you feel better mina said tatyana turning to serve the newcomers hi can i help you wilhelmina backed toward the door somehow now that she had seen them she could not make herself say goodbye for good a cheery see you later was all she could manage a quick visit to johns wife in the office upstairs confirmed that her paycheck had been as always deposited directly into her account is anything wrong mina asked rachel um nonot really it just that i seem to have lost my card its a huge bother she sighed oh well i can give you last weeks suggested rachel if thats any use that hasnt gone in yet you can that would be a big help she waited while the middleaged woman took out a key and opened the bottom desk drawer and withdrew a metal cash box ill need you to sign for it said rachel she withdrew a handful of bills and began counting them out onto her blotter you sure everythings okay never better said mina why i dont knowyou look different is all she handed a tidy stack of bills to wilhelmina six hundred here you go thanks she stuffed the money into her pocket and scribbled her signature on the slip rachel offered thanks a lot ill see ya a minute later she was back on the street next stop kits flat the walk to his front door gave her time to think about what she might say to himhow she might explain not being able to see him for a while if ever there was no easy way to do that so she decided a clean break was best taking a deep breath she gave the door a few solid raps and waited then knocked again she tried two more times before giving up kit was out typical she thought and considered leaving him a note but she had nothing to write with or on so she let it go she could break up with him some other time back on the street again and buoyed by the thought that it had only been a day since she was last in london she resumed her walk and her feet directed themselves to her old flat why not she wondered she could at least check on the place and see if there was anything worth taking away with her and while she was there she could let the landlord know she might be gone for a while ten minutes later mina turned onto the street and a few minutes after that was bounding up the steps of the building she paused briefly to collect her spare key from the old lady who lived in the apartment below did you lock yourself out dear asked mrs parker as she handed over the key silly me replied wilhelmina ill put this back through your letter box when im finished you do that cheerio mrs parker mina moved away and climbed the stairs to her flat she slid the key into the lock and stepped inside one look at her cosy little nest and she was overcome by a surge of melancholy that weakened her at the knees there was mail on the doormat which she collected and tossed on the hall table she stepped into the lounge and took in the sight of her couch and pillows and the fleece blanket she used to curl up in the book she had been readingit was almost too much to bear she went into the kitchen and one glance at the flowers still fresh in the vase on the windowsill and she lost it tears welled up in her eyes and she stood in the centre of the room and bawled if anyone had asked her why she was crying she would not have been able to provide a reasonable answer in fact even as the tears flowed she told herself she was being a big baby and that she was far happier with her life now than she had ever been and that she would not trade her new life for anything still the tears flowed when she was finally able to drag her ragged emotions together she went into her bedroom emptied the stale water from the glass beside her bed and straightened the duvet then proceeded to look around for anything that might be useful to her in her new life from her wardrobe she selected a lightweight black wool jumper and a pair of smart laceup ankle boots she had worn only once the rest she could live without closing the door to the wardrobe her eye fell on the jar of pennies and obsolete coinsshillings and hapennies and the likeshe kept on the bureau she carried the jar to the kitchen and upended it into a plastic carrier bag then went to check out the bathroom one look at the gleaming white tile and she knew she had to have a shower she turned on the taps stripped quickly and stepped into the freeflowing hot water and lathered up oh such luxury it had been so long since she had had a proper shower she had all but forgotten just how truly delicious it could be she washed her hair and then just stood and let the water run over her until the room filled with steam with a sigh of regret she turned off the water and dried herself on a fluffy towel she brushed her teeth keeping the toothpaste and brush to take with her she used the toilet flushed and turned out the light okay it wasnt all bad she thought as she padded back into her bedroom to dress there was a lot to be said for the convenience of modern plumbing then having wallowed enough she decided it was time to be about her business she bundled the items she was taking with her into the carrier bag of coins and had a last look around as she locked the door she drew some comfort from the idea that she did not really have to abandon anything just now she could keep the flat just the way it was now that she knew how to reach london again and arrive within a day or so of her initial leaving her home in this particular world would always be there waiting for her she could come back anytime she chose what is more it would be a bolthole for her should she ever need a safe house pleased with herself for having generated this consoling thought she proceeded in a much better mood and treated herself to a wild shopping spreewhich to her practical mind meant a visit to the big marks amp spencer flagship store on oxford street she took her time browsing the ladies section and eventually settled on a long flowered skirt three goodquality cotton tshirts two of them longsleeved a thin leather belt an assortment of utilitarian foundation garments a smart white overblouse a short wool jacket in navy blue two pair of thick tights and a tripack of cotton socks she dressed in the changing room and then continued to selfridges a few doors down where she indulged in the splurge purchase of a fine cashmere pashmina in radiant sky blue at a smart boutique called sweaty betty she found a lightweight multipocketed suede bag with strap handles that could be worn as a day sack into which she bundled her purchases and the plastic carrier bag satisfied with her new gear she popped into the nearest pret a manger and bought a chickencaesarandbacon baguette a threebean and couscous salad pot grapes a packet of sweet potato crisps and a bottle of pure pret pomegranate drink as the day was still fair she crossed the street to hanover square park and found a shady bench on which to enjoy a leisurely lunch and watch the world go by while waiting for the stane way ley to become active this simple lunch was followed by a long lingering coffee at cafe nero with a slice of millionaire shortbread for desert she dawdled over the coffeepartly to kill time but also out of professional interest observing the operation of the coffee shop closely critiquing the service and savouring the hot black brewanalysing the entire experience in a way that never would have occurred to her before on the street once more she passed a waterstones bookshop and on a whim worked her way up to the fourth floor where in a littlevisited side room she pulled science books off the shelf spread them on the floor and chose three for brother lazarus the new physics a guide to life the universe and everything quantum physics for dummies and advanced cosmologycomprehending the cosmos she resumed her promenade along oxford street windowshopping when at last the sun began to lower in the west wilhelmina bade farewell to the city and turned her steps towards stane way in preparation for phase two of her plan a rendezvous with dr thomas young while she did not entertain any notions that it would be easy to locate a man who had in the present world been deceased for almost two hundred years she could not have predicted just how crooked that particular path would prove chapter in which a longpromised tea is taken the blue light on the newmodel ley lamp indicated the presence of an active line it was time to go wilhelmina tightened the laces on her new boots and tucking the lamp into a pocket of her new blue jacket started down the narrow service alley the wind kicked up suddenly and a few errant raindrops spattered around her the world grew dimas if she had passed into deep shadow a few steps more and she emerged from the darkness and into a passage in every way similar to the old stane way yet different this alleyway was bounded by wooden walls not brick and the path was paved not with tarmac but with uneven cobbles she moved quickly towards the end she could see ahead and emerged into the light of a sunbright seaside village a tallmasted schooner stood docked at the wharf a short distance away and in the harbour another lay at anchor a few smaller fishing boats plied the waters farther out rocking in the gentle swell and sea gulls filled the soft saltscented air with their highpitched chatter her immediate thought was that the jump had gone wrong she had expected to connect with the bohemian ley and this place was definitely not bohemia pulling the ley lamp from her pocket she detected only the faintest glint of light a sign that the ley activity had indeed waned the sun was high overhead so there would be a few hours to kill before she could resume her journey in the meantime she might at least find out when and where she had arrived and make a note of it for future reference stepping out onto the street she moved along the waterfront trying to appear inconspicuous in her new clothes and alert to any clues that might help determine the time and place along the wharf the warehouses and stores were open and either receiving or dispatching cargo in the form of barrels crates and bundles bound in burlap and hempall of it toted one way or another by stevedores in short trousers and long floppy shirts everyone she saw wore a hat the men wore either shapeless knit caps straw hats or felt constructions with round crowns and wide brims the few women she saw wore bonnets they also had shawls or scarves tied around either their shoulders or hips and all wore long skirts and blouses with scooped necklines and short sleeves wilhelmina pulled her blue pashmina from her bag if only m amps carried bonnets in its new line id be set she mused and draping the scarf over her head and shoulders continued with her amble along the harbour and soon found herself enjoying the fresh air and the relaxed and peaceful atmosphere of the little fishing villagea welcome relief after modern london as she strolled along she became aware of the feeling that she knew this place although she was certain she had never seen or set foot in the town before there was something vaguely familiar about itsomething that eluded her ability to pin down yet persisted in her awareness what was it come from the indies the voice startled her out of her reverie she spun around to see a dirtyfaced girl of perhaps ten or so watching her with a keen and vaguely disapproving expression excuse me yer from the indies ent ya you speak english said wilhelmina aye agreed the girl herebouts we does and are ye speakin the kings english in the indies how do you know im from the indies asked wilhelmina its yer rags the girl raised a filthy hand and extended a slender finger at wilhelminas shawl and blouse her own clothes were bedraggled and dirty her long brown hair was lank and clearly had not been brushed for some time we dont wear aught like herebouts no agreed wilhelmina i suppose not directing her attention to the wharf and docklands she made a sweep of her hand and asked where am i what is this place this be sefton the youngster replied thats it she thought sefton that was the name of the place kit had told her aboutthe place he had been taking her to see when they had become separated on that first climactic leap she gazed up and down the seafront taking in the harbour and village with new eyes so this was the little seaside town kit had wanted to show her it was much as he had described itat least the little she could recall of his description on that fateful day kit had promised to take her to tea at the seaside to demonstrate the truth of his nutty claim about ley lines and alternate dimensions seftononsea aye confirmed the girl i be maggie my name is mina i am pleased to meet you maggie wilhelmina extended her hand to the girl who after a moments hesitation took it and gave it a halfhearted shake can you tell me what year it is ye dont ken the year no answered wilhelmina ive been travelling a long time the girls round face scrunched up in thought the answer forced its way to her lips and she proclaimed this be the year of our lord and king william i and i wilhelmina smiled no doubt the youngster was simply parroting back something she had heard but it was enough wilhelmina thanked her and asked if she was hungry the girl hesitated i was thinking of having some tea and a bun maybe would you like to take tea with me mina invited maggie frowned i never my lady she said growing suddenly shy and polite i ent allowed something else a glass of milk maybe mina offered i have money and no one to talk to maybe there is someplace you could show me where we might get something to eat and drink the girl thought for a moment theres the old ship she said extending a grubby finger she pointed to a storefront a little farther along the street wilhelmina glanced around and saw a low building painted white with a black door a sign overhead bore the image of a ship under full sail on a stormy sea the waves crashing against its prow well said mina im going to go there i hope youll come too she turned and started towards the public house maggie watched her for a moment then followed a few steps behind the door of the pub pushed open easily and wilhelmina entered a dim lowceilinged room the air redolent of stale beer and coal smoke was thick and muggy but not unpleasant and unlike anything of wilhelminas experience a plump young woman stood behind the heavy oak bar drying thick glass jars with a rag gday mlady she called cheerfully what can i get ye good day replied mina i would like a cup of tea is that possible to be sure mlady replied the barmaid her eyes flicked to the youngster who had entered behind wilhelmina you havent i told you bout comin in here now get on wi ye sorry said wilhelmina quickly shes with me i asked her to join me thats as may be mlady but younguns ent allowed in tpub an she knows better that one oh yes of course youre right i wasnt thinking you ent from around here are you mlady said the young woman behind the bar no ino im not just off tship then travelling yes wilhelmina keen to change the subject glanced around the pub do you think i could have my tea outside and maybe some cake if you have it we have some nice oat cakes just come out toven i can give ye o that wi some good jam would you said mina that would be perfect bring me a pot pleaseand a glass of milk ill be waiting outside wilhelmina stepped back onto the seafront and with maggie in tow found a pleasant spot on a wharfside bench to wait the sun was warm on her back and she gazed out on the peaceful little harbour the sea glinting blue and silver beneath a cloudless sky presently the tea cameserved in a brown crockery pot with two chunky cups one filled with milka plate of small round oat cakes and a tiny bowl of red jam will there be anything else mlady asked the serving girl this is lovely said mina thank you no that will be all just now just bring the tray back when youre done she cast a last dubious glance at maggie then returned to the pub after a moment wilhelmina poured her tea sefton seems a pleasant place she observed passing the cup of milk to her young companion have you lived here long all me life long replied maggie an have ye always lived in the indies no replied mina i used to live in london london mused the girl the way she said it made it sound as exotic and far away as china but then wilhelmina reasoned being a deepwater port little sefton probably saw more folk from foreign climes than from the capital the two chatted amiably and then a bell in a church tower somewhere in the town tolled the hour three oclock maggie jumped up and curtsying awkwardly took her leave saying my da will be comin home wi the catch then youd better run along wilhelmina agreed i wouldnt want you to get into trouble goodbye she called as the girl scurried away maybe ill see you again sometime wilhelmina sat for a while longer enjoying the day and thinking what a strange life she now led her experience in london far from arousing any lingering feelings for her life there merely confirmed what she had known or at least suspected all alongthat she did not miss the place and no longer cared to live there when the clock in the unseen church tower tolled four mina gathered up the tray and took it back inside the old ship inn she paid for the tea and cakes holding out an assortment of coins from her penny jar from which the barmaid selected a few coppers she then returned to the alley to see if the ley was active yet with a quick glance around to see that she was unobserved she drew the ley lamp from her pocket and ascertained from the absence of blue lights that the ley was still dormant stuffing the device back into her pocket she stepped back from the mouth of the passage and as she did so her eye fell upon a word scrawled low down on the wooden siding of one of the walls the mere glimpse rooted her to the spot she blinked her eyes to make sure she was indeed seeing what she thought she saw there written in black grease pencil was a name wilhelmina there was morea brief message that read simply collect letter from molly at the old ship inncosimo what on earth she stared at the unexpected communication cosimo that was the name of the man kit had met in the alley his greatgrandfatherthe one kit had tried to tell her about the day they made that fuddled jump wilhelmina made quick strides to the pub the roundfaced girl was still there still behind the bar was there something else she asked yes are you molly aye i am my name is wilhelmina i forgot to ask earlier but did someone leave a letter for mesomeone by the name of cosimo molly the barmaid disappeared into the room behind the bar and returned a moment later with a thick yellow envelope ye be a friend o cosimos yes i think i am whats yer full name then wilhelmina klug replied mina then spelled out her last name so there would be no misunderstanding molly peered at the writing on the envelope then passed it to mina who thanked her and went outside she resumed her place on the bench and carefully tore open the envelope inside was a single tightly folded page written in smudgy pencil she opened it to find a handful of shillings two guineas and a large silver fivepound coin she scooped up the money and quickly scanned the note it read my dear wilhelmina i can well imagine how confused and frightened you must be but take heart in the knowledge that we are looking for you i urge you to stay here take a room at the old ship on my account and remain in sefton until we come for you kit is with me and sends his greetings your servant cosimo livingstone pocketing the money she read the message again then turned the page over on the back scratched hastily in one corner of the page was a little list of sortsas if someone had been quickly jotting down ideas there were six items and three of those had lines drawn through them the six were mansell gamage seftononsea wern derries much markle crosses black mixen tump and capelyfin they were place namesemploying odd oldtimey wordsand certainly none that wilhelmina had ever heard before the first three on the list had been crossed outapparently considered and then discarded for whatever reasons the list maker had deemed appropriate but why even as she considered the question it occurred to her that if kit and his greatgrandfather were searching for her and obviously leaving messages for her in likely places this might be a list of such places the inclusion of sefton clinched it in her opinion the three crossed out were places already visited and presumably where messages had been left the last three then were next on the list the thought that they were worried about her and looking for her made her smile bless em she thought but they were not to know what she had been up to since she and kit had parted company the situation had changed and she certainly did not need rescuing mina returned to the letter and list once more and noticed something else beside three of the place names was a tiny equal sign a simple as found in mathematical equationswritten in lighter pencil as one might make when thinking on paper taking these additions into account the list read mansell gamage china wern derries ireland black mixen tump egypt how very interesting she said to herself tucking the note away rising from the bench she went back to the old ship and inquired of molly whether there might be a carriage or coach she could hire to take her to london anything at all really she added i dont mind mail coach comes through at six the barmaid replied going up tlondon from plymouth it stops here for the driver to wet his whistle be in london by morning splendid said wilhelmina ill just wait outside suit yeself mlady said molly resuming her work of lining up clean jars for the evenings custom mina returned to her bench in the sun to await her transport and determine how to make best use of her new information by the time the mail coach arrived in a clatter of hooves trailing plumes of dust wilhelmina had a new plan firmly in mind sorry cosimo she said as the carriage came rattling down the street but ive got a better idea chapter in which an unwanted partnership is forged burleighs fortuitous return to london after his disappearance

what is it swain a letter has arrived from sothebys the gentlemans gentleman extended a small silver tray with a creamcoloured envelope addressed to the earl of sutherland there was no stamp it had been hand delivered i thought you would rather be apprised sooner than later sir to be sure burleigh took the envelope and while the servant waited he opened it and scanned the few lines then placing the letter and envelope on the table beside him he rose inform dawkin to ready the carriage i am going out very good sir within the hour burleigh was sitting in the office of mr gerald catchmole the principal broker at sothebys auction house he had been offered whiskey and a cigar but declined owing to the hour of the day accepting tea instead while waiting for the tea they chatted about the dismal lack of quality among the items currently coming out of the levant we are obliged to auction them of course sniffed catchmole but it does go somewhat against the grain not that your average punter knows the difference replied burleigh you make your commission all the same i daresay but you do know the difference my lord asserted catchmole in an ingratiating tone which is why i contacted you as soon as this came in there was a knock on the door and a middleaged woman entered with a tray of tea things you may pour mrs rudd instructed the broker and leave the tray if you please well help ourselves she poured handed out the cups then withdrew without a word when she had gone catchmole took a sip from his cup then set it aside i thought you should be the first to see this he said rising he crossed to his desk retrieved a wooden cigar box and passed it to burleigh have a look lord burleigh took the box and opened the lid inside nestled in tissue paper were three small objects an egyptian scarab a small statue of a woman in a long multitiered skirt holding two writhing snakes and a carved cameo of a man with a laurel wreath they were in fact exactly the kind of objects currently in fashion imitations of which were flooding the antiques market throughout europe just then burleigh glanced up at the broker yes take a closer look invited catchmole with a smile balancing the box on his knee the earl picked up the statue it was about six inches high and painted with painstaking skill the womans eyes were large and open wide her dark hair piled in an elaborate braided style and the snakes she held in either hand curled up around her arms their mouths open the tiny statue had been painted green and her long highwaisted skirt was blue and green striped the figurine had been glazed to a fine standard i see what you mean said burleigh softly sixteenth century bcthe minoan snake goddess votive figure extraordinary preservation it looks as if it could have been made yesterday was it raising his eyebrows he glanced up at the broker who merely indicated the next piece burleigh picked up the scarab it was crafted from a single flawless piece of lapis lazuli of deepest blue and the carving was exquisite the hieroglyphs fresh and clean a cartouche contained the name nebmaatra on the underside a tiny carved eye surmounting a rod and flail identified the maker his lordships brow wrinkled in thought nebmaatra he mused sounding the name aloud as he tried to place it upon my word he gasped glancing up at catchmole who was watching with interest this is from the royal workshop of amenhotepthe pharaohs own craftsmen i knew you would be impressed chortled catchmole nodding and smiling if anyone can tell gold from glister it is yourself lord burleigh where did you get these burleigh demanded he flipped down the lid of the box it was an ordinary wooden container for a middling brand of cigarsa crude carrier for such treasure may i direct his lordships attention to the remaining piece burleigh flipped open the lid and lifted out the tiny stone cameo like the scarab it was an elegant and finely worked piece of deep red carnelian the profile was of a man wearing the laurel leaf crown of a roman emperor there was no doubt but that it had once been owned by an ancient citizen of great wealth and no doubt taste there was an inscription on the backside gjca burleigh stared at it extraordinary he breathed caesar augustus none otheror so i am told by searlewilson our resident classicist assures me there cannot be more than a dozen of these in existence i suppose not the earl held the cameo to the light it would make a splendid ring or a broach set in gold where did you get these he asked again i can take it that your interest has been sufficiently piqued said catchmole smugly they are genuine artefacts of the highest qualityof course im interested but i must know how you came by them as to that i am not presently at liberty to say replied the broker taking possession of the box once more i can say that i am authorised to offer them for auction he paused his eyes shifting involuntarily towards the door as if he feared being overheard lowering his voice he said i wondered if we might come to a more private arrangement ill have them said burleigh rising from his chair yes of course ill have them ill have the lotbut under the condition that you tell me where you got them catchmole hesitated i gave my word the transaction would remain in strictest confidence and so it shall countered burleigh the transaction necessarily involves three peoplethe seller the broker and the buyerand only those three people need ever know about it the auctioneer regarded the box longingly one does not like to disappoint a client there is no need for anyone to be disappointed tell me where you got these items and i will authorise a draught on my account at once i can tell you that they came from a young man up at oxford catchmole replied placing his fingertips atop the box a university student i do not know how he came by them one doesnt ask such questions be that as it may if we are to agree on a price i must ascertain the provenance of these artefacts declared burleigh they could be stolen from a private collection after all upon my word sir the broker protested if it was known that i was party to it has been known to happen suggested the earl removing his leather wallet from the inside pocket of his frock coat i am afraid i must insist on having the fellows name he withdrew two fivepound notes and laid them on the desk charles sighed the broker giving in charles flinderspetrie where can i find him asked burleigh adding two more notes to the stack he is a student at christ church i believe the broker pushed the cigar box across the polished top of his desk towards the earl and collected the bank notes i was told they are heirlooms from a family collection im certain that they are burleigh scooped up the cigar box and tucked it securely under his arm then turned on his heel to go you will do well out of this catchmole i will see to that i am only too glad to be of service my lord good day to you burleigh opened the door and stepped from the office as always it has been a singular pleasure i assure you the pleasure is mine replied the broker folding the bank notes and slipping them into his pocket outside sothebys burleigh climbed into the waiting coach by the time he reached his belgravia townhouse the earl had determined his next course of action do not put the carriage away dawkin i will be leaving again within the hour he dashed up the steps and burst through the front door shouting swain come here at once i need you the servant appeared momentarily the only alteration in his customary nonchalance the lift of one eyebrow was there something sir im off to oxford on the next train ready a valise this instanta change of clothes and necessities for one night go as the senior servant padded off burleigh amended the order wait better make provision for two or three days in case i run into difficulty of course sir before the clock in the foyer had struck the hour his lordships travelling case was packed and the earl was on his way to paddington station to catch the next train to oxford a pleasant journey through the rolling countryside brought him to the university city late in the afternoon he sent his valise along to the randolph hotel with instructions for booking a room then walked from the railway station to the centre of town taking in the warm glow of the rich cotswold stone that made up the greater buildings of the towns architecture he arrived at christ church and finding the gate open stopped to inquire at the porters lodge good day porter he said i have come to see my nephew yes sir replied the porter stepping up to his window and who might that be flinderspetrie replied burleigh charles flinderspetrie the man scanned a ledger book i dont see that anyone is expected surprise visit he removed a calling card from his wallet and passed it to the porter who upon seeing the title and name engraved upon the card instantly became obsequious do you think you could tell me where to find him of course my lord the porter put on his black bowler and stepped from the lodge i shall take you there myself right this way sir if you will right this way he led the earl across the wide expanse of the quad through a warren of corridors gardens and hallways and to a narrow stone staircase this way sir said the porter right up these stairs the college official started for the door a moment my good man said burleigh he fished out a handful of coins from his pocket and stacked them in his palm i have a question or two first of course sir replied the porter trying not to look directly at the silver in his lordships hand if i can help in any way i promised charles father i would render a report upon my return it is late and i dont particularly care to go to the trouble of hunting down tutors and whatnot he fingered the stack of coins i was hoping you could enlighten me well sir i can tell you that he is a good lad cheerful always a smile or a joke for the porters and bulls i will accept that for what it is worth observed burleigh dryly what about his studies i wouldnt know about those sir you would have to ask his tutors about any of that and how is charles regarded about town at the porters hesitation he pressed quickly the truth now i wont land you in the soup dont worry i dont like to speak ill of anyone noted said burleigh but but well sir there have been occasions when i have had call to fetch the young man from some shall we say less than salubrious places he laid a finger beside his nose if you know what i mean i think i can guess anything else lately there have been men calling round to collect debts what sort of debts food drink clothingthe usual things gambling sir i say burleigh feigned surprise are you certain of this i fear so sir there are several gaming clubs around town it is difficult to keep the young gentlemen out of them and are they very great these debts im sure i dont know sir we dont let them past the gate you see and they decline to leave a message well harrumphed burleigh we shall certainly have a serious talk about that oh i wouldnt be too hard on him sir said the porter apologetically a young gentleman must sow a few wild oats that seems to be the way of the world no doubt is there anything else burleigh became officious come if i am to have any influence in the matter i must know all what else there is just the matter of the battles sir youve lost me the battlesaccounts sir repeated the porter the bursar can give you the pertinent details but there is a debt owing for drink and such within the college i see would you like me to take you up now thank you but no i can find my own way burleigh smiled and dropped the stack of silver coins into the servants hand let us keep this a surprise eh very good sir the porter pocketed the coins its the first room on the right at the top please feel free to make your way up in your own good time good evening replied burleigh the servant lingered i will just mention sir he may be in hall at dinner just nowthat is if hes chosen to eat early most of the young men do if you like i can send for the gentleman i dont mind waiting said burleigh waving the servant away if charles is out i will simply make myself at home until he returns he started up the staircase again my thanks porter youve been most helpful when the man had gone burleigh made his way up the stairs at the top of the staircase he found two doors on one a calling card in a neat brass holder indicated that the occupant was indeed one charles flinderspetrie burleigh knocked quietly when there was no answer he tried the door found that it was unlocked and let himself in to a large square room with a window overlooking christ church meadow and beyond it a willowlined stretch of the isis river there were cows in the meadow and a herder with staff and dog moving them towards a barn for the night burleigh stood for a moment studying the interior two large overstuffed leather chairs sat on either side of a generous fireplace and between them a small round table bearing a silver tray with a crystal port decanter and four glasses there was a painting on the wall of a country scene and clothes spilled from an untidy wardrobe a coat rack beside the wardrobe held a black student gown a satin waistcoat a long overcoat two hatsone black beaver skin one grey feltand the distinctive striped scarves of several colleges none of them christ church one wall was taken up with a floortoceiling bookcase half full of books the lower shelves held items of clothing a pair of shoes a battered straw hat a cricket bat ball and gloves he moved closer to scan the shelves judging by the titles the subjects were mostly to do with history the tops of the books were dusty across the room the bed had been made but was rumpled a small pile of clothingtrousers a shirt a waistcoat a black tielay on the floor beside it a reading table at the window held a dirty plate with a rind of cheese and crumbs of bread an empty mug with tea stains a halfeaten apple a bottle of wine empty stood on the floor beneath the table hanging from a strap on a peg by the door was a leather satchel in all it was the room of a fellow who spent little time in it and less time studyinga more or less typical student burleigh decided as taking in his surroundings one last time he lowered himself into one of the worn leather chairs at the fireplace little by little the light grew dimmer as evening settled a chill crept into the room and burleigh was considering whether to light a fire in the grate when he heard voices on the staircase presently there was a click at the doorknob the door opened and in stepped a sandyhaired youth with his dinner jacket slung carelessly over one shoulder he was tall but not gangly slender but not gaunt his features were regular and wellformed and would have been fairly unremarkable if not for his eyes which were subtly ovalshaped and ever so slightly aslant giving them an almost oriental appearance the youth threw his jacket on the bed and began unbuttoning his shirt hello charles said burleigh the young man jumped and spun around good lord who the devil are you forgive me for startling you said his visitor rising slowly to his full imposing height my name is burleighearl of sutherland i think we share a common interest oh said charles warily he made no move to come nearer and what might that be antiquities oh that sniffed charles dismissively yes that affirmed his dark visitor why what did you think i was going to say i dont knowbear baiting dog fighting i suppose gambling what have you nothing quite so exciting burleigh turned and poured out two glasses of port from the crystal decanter on the table come said burleigh and held out one to the young man sit with me a little let us talk about artefacts ancient artefacts i think you have the wrong fellow protested charles he moved to accept the proffered glass i know nothing whatsoever of antiques he flopped into the chair not my line at all dont you see but it is mine said burleigh seating himself once more i am a dealer in such things bully charles raised his glass yum sen burleigh drank and then set aside his glass i will not impose on you any more than necessary but as a courtesy i will insist that you attend me in a matter of some importance with this burleigh reached into his coat pocket and retrieved a black velvet wallet which he unrolled to reveal the lapis scarab the sumerian votive figure and the carnelian cameo of augustus he lined them up on the table beside him charles glanced at the objects and feigned indifference charming he said but i feel it only fair to warn you that if you mean to sell me these baubles it is a rum go from the start he took another sip dont have any dosh you see fresh out skint as a lizard burleigh regarded the young man with intent his manner was not what he had expected clearly the fellow was playing at something you are disingenuous observed the earl could it be that you still cling to the mistaken belief that i have not guessed the provenance of these items the erstwhile scholar put back his head and offered a tepid laugh provenance sir why how you talk ive never seen the trinkets in my life we both know that is a lie burleigh countered keeping his voice level his temper cool how dare you charles began but the objection lacked force i will have you know spare me please interrupted the earl i have been dealing with antiquities of this sort longer than you have been alive and i know whereof i speak burleigh picked up the votive figure of the snake goddess and held it to the light these are genuine what is more they are in almost perfect conditionuntouched by the ravages of time or the grave in short they were not dug out of the deserts of egypt or babylon nor recovered from any tomb he fixed the young man with a stern gaze i will ask you in plain languagehow did you come by them charles threw back his drink then poured himself another he slouched further into his chair and with a forced nonchalance said that is none of your business i have just told you that it is very much my business burleighs voice though calm took on a steely note why do you persist in this feeble attempt at dissembling it is a waste of time the young man glared at his visitor but remained silent let us begin again burleigh replaced the figurine and picked up the scarab i am happy to pay a fair price for this pieceand for the others as well more than you would have made at auction at this charles perked up how much more burleigh gave him a sour smile enough to give me the right to come here tonight with an offerand a very handsome offer i might add well then i am prepared to buy all the pieces in your collection singly or in a job lotsubject to examination of courseat fair market value plus fifteen percent no let us make it twenty percent an auction house would take at least that much in commission you might as well have the benefit instead twenty percent above market value repeated charles and who might i ask determines market value you i suppose anyone you like burleigh answered but if you want my opinion catchmole at sothebys will not steer you far wrong i trust him the profligate young man frowned as he mulled over the offer there are conditions burleigh continued after a moment you will tell me how you came by these objectsand any others i acquire through our arrangement further you will agree never to sell any such artefacts to anyone else impudent rascal see here from now on i am your sole partner in the antiquities trade burleigh gave him a cold smile fair price plus twenty percent and a ready sale you will never have to chance the whims of a fickle public dont want much do you sneered charles anything else only that you will not breathe a word of our partnership to another living soul charles dashed down the rest of his drink then arranging his features in an expression of defiance he said i wont do it i refuse with the grace of a pouncing cat burleigh leapt from his chair he snatched the young scholar by the throat and yanked him to his feet listen to me you prodigal prig i know very well what you have been up to i know about the gambling the drinking the whoring i know the places youve been and the company youve been keeping unhand me rogue began the frightened charles in a somewhat strained voice burleigh tightened his grip and cut off any further protest you owe money all over town and men have been sniffing around to collect your debts it is only a matter of time before they catch you and you end up dead in a ditch with a broken head or a knife in the back charles scrabbled at his attackers hand but burleigh held firm listen very carefully you will agree to the terms i have outlined and you will keep your mouth shut nod your head if you understand charles his face growing red gave a feeble nod burleigh released him then and threw him back into the leather chair the young man bent forward clutching his neck and gasping for air in a moment his colour and breathing returned to normal no need to glare at me like that you arent hurt burleigh said standing over him tell me how you got these pieces private collection muttered charles still rubbing his neck been in the family for donkeys years who collected them my grandfathertheres a whole chest full of the stuff where did he get them havent the foggiest charles began then seeing burleigh flex his hands quickly amended his reply he travelled a lotspent most his time on ships to foreign parts had an eye for the odd trinket he collected them he thrust out his chin satisfied or are you going to choke me again his name this grandfather of yourswhat was his name arthur answered the young reprobate arthur flinderspetrie where can i find him you cant charles shook his head died before i was born caught an ague or something on one of his travels thats all i know and your father what is his name what does he say about you selling off the family heirlooms my father passed away last year but i doubt he would approve he didnt approve of much my fatherat least where i was concerned his name was benedict anything else arthur and benedict flinderspetrie said burleigh making a mental note thats all for now he stepped away i will contact you if i require anything more what about the money you will get your money it has already been arranged through catchmole at sothebys all we need do is agree on a price i will tell him and he will do the rest he is being paid for his silence and discretion how much do you owe in gambling debts charles frowned fifty pounds give or take and your battles another twenty perhaps well make it an even hundred then decided burleigh and dont look so disappointed it is more than any decent labourer earns in a year and more than you would have made at auction there you see ive saved you no end of trouble the young man frowned thats it then do cheer up think of it this wayyou now have a new and supremely influential partner in business and your pecuniary worries are over he moved towards the door still i wouldnt go running up any more whacking great debts about towni may not feel so generous next time what if i dont want a partner burleigh put back his head and laughed farewell charles he opened the door and stepped out onto the landing until we meet again how do i contact you asked charles following him onto the staircase you dont if i should need to see you i will contact you when i want to sell something suggested charles how do i reach you whenever you wish to sellburleigh started down the steps you will send to catchmole he will do the rest why are you doing this charles called after his visitors disappearing form i already told you answered burleigh receding down the steps it is my business just business nothing more burleigh gave a laugh as he disappeared into the shadows you have no idea how far my business interests take me chapter in which kit takes a detour cupping his hands to his eyes kit blinked at the black stretch of highway as it shimmered gently in the full sun of a blistering summer day the shock of seeing that road rocked him backwards a step an image so drearily commonplace in his home world in this world the sight jolted through him like lightning it was a moment before he could properly frame his thoughts and then the best he could manage was a feeble and ineffectual how the narrow passage in the cave contained a ley linethat was the only explanation he had unwittingly crossed over and was now where judging solely by the highway it was somewhere reasonably modern in other words a world about as far away from the stone age as marylebone from mars kit gazed at the asphalt artery as it curved through the valley hugging the sinuous curve of the river and the sight filled him with dread bordering on despair why he wondered why now there was a time when his first instinct would have been to run to that dusty band of tarmac fall on his knees and kiss it for everything it signified but he was past that now he wanted nothing more than to dive back into the cave and take the leap back to rejoin his clansmen in the cave his clansmen being part of river city clan learning their ways discovering all the little mysteries of their existence of another form of human life this was his life and he was not done with it yet and he was in no way prepared to leave them without so much as a so long see ya later no he muttered with a determined shake of his head not now not like this he glimpsed a burst of motion far down on the slope below as the cave lion disappeared into the thick brush of the riverbank byebye baby he murmured you go your way and ill go mine with that he turned right around and scrambled back into the cave kit fumbled his way along the interior of the cavern leaving the world of air and light behind it was a slow and nervewracking process but stubborn resolve kept his feet moving when it grew too dark to see anymore he steadied himself with one hand on the near left wall and worked his way along until he felt the passage straighten out and reckoned that might be the end of the ley bracing himself for a blind leap he started off trying to walk normally and with purpose in total darknessone hand on the rough rock wall beside him and the other waving out in frontwas more difficult than he expected after a bit of practise he was able to achieve a respectable gait but to no discernible effect he stumbled over the uneven floor willing the transition to happen when he reached the end of the straight section he turned around and hobbled back to start again after two failed attempts to make the leap he remembered wilhelminas ley lamp in the inner pouch sewn into this shirt he fished it out and waved it around the little blue lights flashed gave off a dying flicker and winked out turning this way and that in the passage he held the lamp before him but could not raise another signal and was forced to conclude that any ley activity present in the cave was now dormant with a grumble and grinding of his teeth kit turned on his heel and headed back to the cave entrance to wait until the ley grew active once more the day outside was hot and bright it took him awhile to get used to sunlight again and heat he was soon sweating in his furs and wishing he had something else to wear he shed the long heavy tunic shirt rolling it up and stashing it carefully under a rock just inside the mouth of the cave he would need it later returning to the hillside he took the opportunity to more properly spy out the land it was fairly arid hill country with a ridge of jagged grey mountains rising to the northwest a river winding through a green valley below and what appeared to be olive trees dotting the hillsides within view the mountains looked vaguely familiar but he could not place them aside from the olive trees he might be almost anywherenot that it mattered because he did not plan on hanging around long enough to find out more it irked him that he had been transferred to this place just his luck he moaned when he wanted to leave the ley line he knew refused to open now that he had a reason to stay a little longer he had been ejected by a ley he had not known was there consoling himself with the thought that knowing a way back to his clan was the main thing and he could return later kit sat down in the shadow of an overhanging rock to wait for the sun to go down even sitting in the shade the heat began to wear on him the abrupt change from winter to high summer was a shock to the system he closed his eyes and was soon dozing sometime later a distant sound roused him from a deep sleep he opened his eyes and looked around everything was as before but now he was aware of a burning thirst looking down towards the river he saw the gleam of shining water and decided that nothing would be gained by allowing himself to get dehydrated so he rose and started down the hillside he reached the riverbank and keeping an eye out for the young cave lion began searching for a place where he might be able to access the water scrambling through the brush growing thick on the bank he came to a flat stretch of pebbled shingle on the bank and kneeling scooped up handfuls of fresh water still cool from the mountain springs he drank his fill and was just about to rise when he heard a tremendous commotion in the brush behind him fearing that baby had found him kit grabbed a goodsized stone from the strand and crouched ready to fight out from the brush bounded two big houndslean longlegged beasts one grey one brownand both of them extremely surprised to see him they halted in midchase and froze heads low ears flattened hackles raised easy fellas said kit raising his free hand to show it empty good boys stay at the sound of his voice the brown dog raised his snout and gave a single long yowl the other remained fixed on him snarling gently as if in answer to the first hounds yelp kit heard a thrashing in the wood and into the clearing stepped a man in a red shirt and leather hunting vest he was wearing a black beret and carrying a doublebarrelled shotgun he took one look at kit and breathed madre de dios kit still clutching the stone said okay lets not get excited lets stay cool at this the man in the black beret raised the shotgun and pointed it at kits chest que english countered kit anglais neither word had any effect the man still goggleeyed at the apparition before him remained unmoved the gun unwaveringly aimed at kits chest this standoff seemed to last an age and then the man gestured with the gun barrel for kit to throw down the rock kit complied without hesitation dont shoot okay he said raising his hands slowly im just a traveller you can put the gun down i wont cause any trouble see the man gestured for kit to move away from the riverbank which he did and kit was then led at gunpoint out of the brush and into the field beyond once in the open the man gave out a long rising whistle it was answered by another in kind a moment later a second man appeared from out of the bushy scrub along the river like the first he was dressed in a red shirt and black beret he also had leather leggings on his trousers and wore a pouch for birds or rabbits or other small game slung over one shoulder the second hunter took one look at kit and said santa maria the first hunter nodded the second hunter approached kit cautiously donde consiguio usted eso english said kit he thought for a moment how to frame the next question but found that his own facility with english had all but dried up after so long a time with river city clan he could barely make his mouth say the words speak english was all he could manage the two men looked at each other and then at kit the second hunter shrugged and said padre tadeo si agreed the other padre tadeo lo sabra the first hunter motioned with the shotgun once more and kit was marched away with the two men behind him and a dog on either side they followed the curve of the river around a wide bend and came to a bridge joining a dirt road to the highway parked at the side of the road was a tiny threewheeled vehicle of muddy green it had a cab for the driver and an open bed for haulage one of the men got into the drivers seat and the other motioned kit into the back then the man and hounds climbed in with him the engine fired up and they juntered off they drove a few miles to a village just off the highway the place was the centre for a small farming community boasting a single main street lined with a few simple shops a watering tank for livestock a greengrocer and a post office the signs kit saw on the sides of buildings and in the store windows were all in spanish the main street ended at a town square with a large stone church on one side and facing it across the square a rambling stucco edifice with white pillars and black doors the town square had a large marble fountain but the fountain was dry the threewheeled truck pulled up outside the church and the driver beeped the horn and went on beeping it until a priest in a long black cassock emerged and stood on the steps the driver got out and ran to the priest the two exchanged a few words and the clergyman approached the little pickup where kit sat under guard in the back a short man with heavy dark eyebrows above deepset black eyes the priest took one look at kit and crossed himself hello said kit having decided his best option was to remain calm and quiet and try not to alarm folk unnecessarily do you speak english the priests eyebrows shot up he glanced at the two holding the shotguns who nodded knowingly then said i speak english yes good said kit he made to get out of the vehicle then glanced again at the two men who still held their shotguns at the ready and decided to stay put for the moment the priest hesitated but the hunter who had discovered kit nodded his encouragement this is el bruc senor replied the priest who are you my name is christopher he considered asking where he was and the year but decided those questions could wait until he knew his captors better you can call me kit he smiled in what he hoped was a reassuring manner who are you i am father tadeo waving an expressive hand at the patchwork of furs kit wore the little priest said de donde ah where came you from where did i come from echoed kit he paused considering how to answer i am from england i have been um i have been exploring explorar echoed the cleric turning to the others es un explorador he explained the guntoting hunters nodded explorador they murmured the second one loosed a volley of rapidfire spanish at the priest who then turned to kit and said ricardo wishes to know why you dress like this kit glanced down at his shaggy handmade trousers the fur was matted and rattylooking his stitchedtogether shoes caked with mud he stank and his hair was a mass of wild tangles his beard a bushy thicket around his face he suddenly felt very silly wearing this ludicrous outfit i lost my clothes the priest relayed this to the hunters one of them answered and all three men laughed whereupon father tadeo replied we think you have lost more than your clothes senor christopher yes agreed kit running a hand through his beard you might be right about that this small convocation outside the church did not go unnoticed for long a portly man in a brown suit and white shirt appeared from the large pillared building and hurried across the square to join them what is this he demanded in spanish father tadeo explained briefly and the man turned and commanded one of the hunters go and bring diego tell him we have a problem the hunter hurried off and father tadeo said to kit this is senor benito he is alcalde the mayor of this town tell him i am pleased to meet him replied kit his tongue seemed to be working better now as it loosened with use the man in the brown suit gave a curt officious nod and spoke again watching kit narrowly father tadeo translated for kit alcalde benito wishes to know if you are loco crazy please tell him that so far as i know i am in my right mind the priest and mayor conferred over this the mayor shook his head and frowned he crossed his arms over his paunch of a stomach and watched kit a moment later the hunter returned with a policeman in a blue uniform with guardia on a shoulder patch he wore a white bandolier to which was attached a holster with a large revolver he greeted the mayor and priest and the three briefly conferred in spanish as kit sat looking on ramon and ricardo have found this man at the river below the cave said father tadeo it is true said ramon we were hunting rabbits and i found him we think he is crazy added the mayor has he been making trouble asked the policeman no trouble yet said ramon but he added he speaks only english the policeman nodded then directed a question at kit which father tadeo translated senor diego wishes to know why you are living in the cave ah replied kit trying to maintain his placid demeanour despite the stakes which seemed to be rising by the minute please tell senor diego that i was not living in the cave i was exploring it he shrugged and raised his palms i lost my way this explanation was duly repeated and was discussed by the five townsmen gathered around the threewheeler where kit sat like a dishevelled dignitary conducting an al fresco audience do you have papers asked the priest at one point to which kit shook his head the men conferred again with much gesturing and head scratching what shall we do with him asked father tadeo he has broken no laws that i know of suggested diego i do not think i can arrest him for getting lost in a cave arrest him i dont want him arrested said the mayor i want him gone look at him he is a barbarian he is an englishman said ricardo he was exploring and got lost added ramon to the priest he said you should give him a bath and a meal me i should do this madre de dios this is none of my affair father tadeo put up his hands it is none of my concern what you do with him but you are the priest of this town asserted mayor benito what has that got to do with it countered father tadeo the duties of hospitality fall to you said the mayor no such thing replied tadeo you are mayorhospitality is yours to provide we must do something insisted ramon he cannot live in my truck i have to go home and feed the cattle he has no papers said the mayor does he need papers wondered the policeman all respectable people have papers suggested the mayor another reason he cannot stay here where can he go asked ricardo he is lost i know said father tadeo take him to the abbey they are always having so many visitorspilgrims from everywhere they will know what to do with him he is not a pilgrim said ramon he is an explorer no matterit is the same thing replied the mayor making an executive decision padre you will take him to the abbey and they will deal with him me father tadeo put up his hands i have no automobile as you know i cannot possibly take him i have my homily to compose all eyes turned to the policeman diego my friend said the mayor putting his hand to the policemans shoulder this is official business you must take him in your vehicle he glanced at kit then added use the siren so it was that kit was transferred from the back of the threewheeled truck to the official police cruisera dented blueandwhite tin can that spewed acrid smoke as it rattled along the policeman kept a wary eye on his unusual passenger for his part kit smiled a lot and tried not to make himself appear any more of a problem than he was already they passed through another village and another before the highway turned and headed up into the mountains the road snaked higher and higher following a series of rising switchbacks into the sharpangled peaks the police car chugged ever more slowly straining at the steep incline eventually rolling to a halt before a high iron gate overarched by a sign in wroughtiron letters painted white that read abadia de montserrat chapter in which a sisterhood is joined with the warmth of a dazzling damascus sun on her back cassandra stood outside a shiny blacklacquered door bearing a small brass plate engraved with the words zetetic society in a fine flowing script the doorknob was also brass and both were polished bright the close little street was quiet and shaded by high whitewashed walls and the grey stone flanks of beit hanania the house of the man known to the western world as saint ananiaswho first healed and then befriended the murderous zealot saul of tarsus and helped ease him into his role as the apostle paul a sign on the wall outside the shrine had informed her in three languages as if she had not already guessed that she was in the citys ancient christian quarter the doorway before her like many damascene portals was constructed in the distinctive blackandwhitebanded stonework a small and extremely dusty window enclosed by thick iron bars opened onto what appeared to be a pokey little bookshop cass saw unkempt shelves and a table stacked high with books and pamphlets and her heart sank a bookshop was that all there was to it some kind of weird cult pushing their odious literature and trying to convert unsuspecting suckers to their occult beliefs disappointment turned down the corners of her mouth how dare they she thought pasting up signs promising help as a way to lure in gullible travellers they ought to be ashamed of themselves these and other thoughts were riffling through her mind as thoroughly disgustedwith them for lying and with herself for letting her hopes get so high on the basis of such flimsy evidence as a handwritten postershe turned to go no doubt all this bouncing around between worlds or dimensions or whateverfinding herself in new places every other minutehad momentarily thrown off her judgement that could not be allowed to continue she had to apply the rigour of her scientific mind to the situation at hand and she would begin this very moment with a last disdainful glance at the shop she stepped away and started down the street when there was a click behind her and the glossy black door opened a stout older woman with straight white hair cut in a short bob stuck out her head oh she said i have company i thought i heard someone on the step dressed in a longsleeved blouse with a large jade brooch at the throat a green tartan skirt and sensible brown shoes she peered at her visitor through small wirerimmed glasses offering the thin smile of a strict elder aunt or a scottish school mistress a la miss jean brodie who in her prime tolerated no nonsense in her classroom the woman opened the door a little wider you must come in dear you speak english cassandra observed with some relief i meanthat is i was looking for the zetetic society and you have found us the lady stepped to one side please this way no ii was just leaving i think i made a mistake if you have come all this way the woman said her enunciation precise and slightly clipped it is certainly no mistake she said it with such simple conviction that cass was persuaded to agree well just for a moment perhaps she allowed cassandra crossed the threshold and entered the bookshop the interior was mutedthe only light came from the window and that was filmed with age and dust but the shop itself was reasonably clean and the soft furnishings of sofa and overstuffed chairs gave it the feel of an oldfashioned reading room or private library the woman shut the door and regarded cass over the top of her glasses cass caught a whiff of lavender water what brings you here if i may be so bold to damascus to the society corrected the woman stressing the word for emphasis before cass could answer a shrill whistle sounded from another room theres the kettle would you like a cup of tea um cass hesitated i was just going to have one myself please make yourself comfortable i shant be a moment she hurried away leaving cassandra to gaze around the little shop in addition to the bookshelves lining the walls there was a round brass table of the kind much favoured in the middle east consisting of a tray balanced on a carved olivewood stand two large easy chairs sat on either side of the table and between them a floor lamp with a purple silk shade there was no counter or cash register which cass thought odd for a bookshop nor any other accoutrements of commercial enterprise cass moved to the nearest shelf and took in some of the titles the history of the assyrian empire a walk in old babylon life in the ancient near east the lost treasury of nebuchadnezzar and other tomes of history their leather spines creased and cracking with age she moved along to a section of religious writing the habiru of palestine the collected writings of josephus the desert fathers a sojourn in the carpathians sumerian culture who were the hittites the tombs of catal huyuk and so on presently the woman returned carrying a wooden tray laden with a brass teapot glass beakers half filled with fresh green leaves and a plate of tiny almond cookies she placed the tray on the table and invited cass to join her i hope you like it with mint she said and began pouring the hot tea over the leaves it is a local custom of which ive grown quite fond she passed a glass to her guest settled back in her chair took a sip and sighed there thats better mm cass remarked after an exploratory sip delicious there is sugar if you like the woman nudged a tiny china bowl where are my manners she said replacing her cup i am mrs peelstick my name is cassandra replied cass what a pretty name im very glad to meet you cassandra i dont believe i heard your answer when i asked what brought you here today she blew on her tea while waiting for a response well i guess i was just curious the woman nodded and said curiosity does no less than devotion pilgrims make pardon a scrap of old poem she stirred sugar into her tea swirling the green leaves around and around after all we are pilgrimsare we not help yourself to biscuits cass reached for one of the small round cookies it was a relief just to sit and do something normal for a momentif one considered taking mint tea with an english expat in damascus in any way normal thank you the two sipped their drinks for a moment in silence from somewhere in the next room a clock chimed the hour i hope im not keeping you from anything said cass i was only curious about the society the old woman made no reply so cass to fill the silence continued zetetic is an odd word i dont believe i have ever heard it what does it mean it comes from the greek zetetikos to seek the zetetic society is a society of seekers what do you seek ah that is the question the old woman smiled and sipped her tea at first cassandra did not think she would answer but the woman put down her glass and said i suppose one could say something pompous and embroidered if brendan were here he would no doubt offer up a phrase such as we seek not the treasures of knowledge but the treasury itself she paused to frame a more considered answer perhaps the simplest way to put it is that we of the society seek answers to lifes biggest questions which questions are those the usual questions why are we here where are we going the woman paused leaned a little forward and regarding cass meaningfully added what is the true nature of reality i wish i knew sighed cass under her breath the womans continued gaze made her uncomfortable she seemed to be expecting cass to say something so she asked these booksare they for sale then oh dearie me no the woman replied retrieving her tea they are resource materials i see cass nodded sipping thoughtfully but you do have some literature no im very much afraid that we do not nothing about the societyits aims beliefs membership requirements you make us sound very grandvery grand indeed no im afraid were just a small congregation of oddballs and eccentrics dedicated to the quest there are no formal requirements she hesitated again regarding cass with that direct appraising look no formal requirements other than finding your way to our door thats it thats all a potential member only has to find his way to this shop what made you think this was a shop she asked picking up the brass teapot more dear cass offered her glass thank you as i was saying there are no membership requirements because you see we find that only those who wish to become members of the society would bother inquiring at all your membership is selfselecting mused cass then i suppose it must be a very large society why would you think that wondered the woman true seekers are very rare those willing to pay the price to join the quest are rarer still she shook her head no we are a small rather exclusive group but the exclusion is not on our side i assure you people either choose to join us or not mostly we find they do not thats a shame quipped cass at very least theyd get a nice cup of mint tea they would indeed dear cassandra finished her cup and placed it on the tray she stood thank you for the chat and for the tea youre very kind but i really must be going i didnt intend to take up your morning didnt you wondered the woman then why did you come the poster explained cass i saw the posterthe orange one at the entrance to the bazaar i thought it sounded interesting so i came the old woman placed her glass on the tray and faced her visitor her gaze pointed and uncomfortably direct after a moment she said would it surprise you very much if i told you that not everyone can see that poster because its written in english you mean i did not say they could not read it replied the woman adopting a pedantic tone i said they cannot see it our little advertisement is effectively invisible to all who are not ready and willing to see it you my dear are readyotherwise you would not be here cass felt a queasy apprehension squirm over her im not sure i understand what you mean i mean exactly what i said no more no less her smile became tight and sharp do you think i cannot tell who and what you are anxious now to terminate the interview and leave cass said well i really must be going she rose and stepped backward edging towards the door it was nice meeting you and you as well the old woman rose and followed her but i have a suspicion that we shall be meeting one another again very soon cassandra nodded moving quickly to the door she fumbled with the doorknob twisted it pulled open the door and stepped outside the woman followed her as far as the threshold there is a convent not more than a hundred paces farther on it is run by the sisters of saint tekla and they offer beds and simple fare to pilgrims of all faiths or none she gestured vaguely farther along if you have no place to stay i recommend them without reservation thank you said cass goodbye god be with you cass stepped away quickly and started off down the narrow meandering street aware that the woman was watching her until she was out of sight a few dozen paces later she saw a small redandwhite sign hanging into the street from its place over a wrought iron gate the sign read le couvent des soeurs de sainte tekla and had a cross in the shape of a capital t with crossed palm fronds beneath it in small letters at the bottom were the words troisieme section another sign in arabic featured the same crossed palms and capital t slowing her pace as she neared the gate cass heard children laughing the sound drifting up over the convent walls although she had no intention of asking for a bed in a convent cass paused to look through the gate she saw a plain paved stone courtyard surrounding a neat white church with small stainedglass windows and wide brown nailstudded doors in one corner of the courtyard a handful of young girls were playing some sort of game with an older woman dressed in a voluminous blue gown topped with a long white headscarf one of the sisters cass decided two other nuns were sweeping the already cleanswept courtyard with branches of natural green broom bound together around short handles the scene looked so homely and happy that cass lingered longer than she intended puisje vous aider the voice and face suddenly appearing at the gate startled cass she took a step back sorry noi was just passing the face was that of a young woman about her own age with large dark eyes and dark hair beneath a tightfitting white scarf she was dressed in the habit of the nuns parlezvous langlais she asked her voice rising gently oui confirmed cass mon francais is um est tres petit the nun offered a blithe smile then we speak english together she declared in a workmanlike if heavily frenchtinted accent would you like to come in mon amie the invitation was so kindly and innocently offered that as the iron gate swung open cass found herself stepping into the courtyard to one side of the church grew a palm tree a fig tree with broad green leaves shaded a simple wooden bench upon which another nun sat shelling peas into a big brass bowl welcome to saint teklas said the nun closing the gate once more i am sister theoduline i am glad to meet you sister replied cassandra please call me cass she glanced around the neat yard what kind of church is thisif you dont mind my asking non replied the sister we are not only a church as you see we are also a couvent an order of nuns and some lay sisters we belong to a syriac order very old one of the oldest would you care to take some refreshment with me thank you no declined cass i had some tea at the zetetic society then feeling the need to explain she added actually i am just passing through i wont be staying no wondered the nun that is a pity damascus has many wonderful places to visitincluding saint teklas come i will show you cass spent a pleasant half hour examining the church with its garish icons and in the buildings behind it the orderly little school and dormitory we operate an orphanage for girls sister theoduline explained so many children lost their parents in the revolt and to disease we have twentyseven girls with us and thirtythree more at maaloula our parent couvent i see replied cass they seem happy here i am sure you are doing a very good work pray god this is so agreed the nun but caring for orphans is a secondary service you might say we were originally charged with aiding and providing hospitality to pilgrims on their way to and from the holy sites here in damascus and beyond she sighed we get so few pilgrims these daystimes being what they are if you have nowhere else to go you are most welcome to stay here with us during your sojourn in damascus she offered a hopeful smile it would support our mission simply to have you here cass thanked her but said i dont expect to be in syria very long oh i thought you said you had been visiting the zetetic society nestce pas i did yes but she paused then changed tack excuse me why do you ask we have from time to time extended hospitality to the society members they are very fascinating people if you are with them you must be fascinating too i think i dont know about that replied cass diffidently im not really with themthat is im not a member of the society oh remarked theoduline forgive my presumption her smile returned instantly but you are still very welcome to stay with us if you wishhowever long your visit thank you said cass considering that she had nowhere else to go and no money anyway she surprised herself by saying i think i would like that this pleased the young nun who offered to show her to a room at oncea small clean celllike apartment with a bed and table a chair and a bright persian rug on the floor beside the bed on one wall was a plain wooden cross and on the other a painting of a young woman in a flowing robe a halo around her head cass took one look at the painting and felt her stomach tighten the young woman in the painting was making her way between two towering walls of stoneunmistakably a canyon it was such a vivid depiction of what cass herself had experienced that she felt an instant connection to the woman she stepped closer to inspect it in more detail sister theoduline who had been instructing her about soap and clean towels noticed her interest and moved to her side that is saint tekla she explained do you know the story cass confessed that she did not it is quite interesting the sister said and went on to tell the legend of the syrian saint who as a young woman became a christian and was baptised by saint paul one day she was being pursued perhaps by a ruthless suitor because of her exceptional beauty or perhaps owing to her refusal to abandon her faith and bow to the emperorthe reason was not entirely clear but having fled into the wild hills she found her way blocked by a steep impasse of stone tekla offered up a prayer and miraculously a way opened through the stonea sentier you know this word cass shook her head it is like a patha small roada crevasse i see murmured cass transfixed by the picture a path through the rocks oui agreed the nun tekla fled into the rocks and disappeared her pursuers were never able to find her later she returned to establish one of the first churches in syria and it is still there concluded theoduline it is at maaloula the same place as the orphanage the same yes it is our mother church a fine story replied cass her mind racing freely along trajectories of extreme improbability later after a nap and a ramble through the city then a simple supper of soup bread olives and hummus followed by a sung evensong by the nuns and their young charges cass retired to her room and ended her eventful day sitting on the edge of her bed and meditating on the painting of the beautiful young christian fleeing through the canyon of stone she went to sleep thinking she knew very well the makings of teklas miracle the neophyte saint had stumbled upon her own secret canyon and like cass herself had travelled a sacred road to become a world walker chapter in which a good doctor is hard to find london in the year took some getting used to but thankfully the layout of the main thoroughfares had not been altered since the romans first laid them down over the footpaths made by the celts along the wide rolling river known to the locals at the time as afon tamesas but now known as the thames river wilhelmina did not know the original name of the river but not many did as the coach rumbled over the engineering marvel that was the london bridge mina shook her head at the multitude of water conveyances on show below boats of every size and description filled the grey water ferry boats both oardriven and coalpowered steamboats pulling barges loaded with cargo sailboats from oceangoing schooners with crews of a hundred to singlemanned ketches ironclad warships bristling with guns sleek pleasure boats with striped canopies tug boats tenders and taxis plying the waters looking for employment so many boats that mina imagined she could have hopscotched across the water from the embankment to south bank one boat deck at a time nor were the city streets less crowded as with the water every manner of land vehicle ever invented seemed to want to cross the bridge at the same time horsedrawn coaches and carriages accounted for most of the traffic but there were also carts aplenty wilhelmina counted no fewer than fortynine handcarts seventeen donkey carts nine mule carts eight goat carts five horse carts and a dozen or so pulled by dogs foot traffic filled in every available gap and mina thought it a wonder pedestrians were not continually falling beneath moving wheels of one sort or another when the coach finally reached its destination wilhelmina disembarked and was pleased to find that she recognised some of the more familiar city landmarks such as blackfriars bridge and the tower of london navigating her way around would not pose undue difficultyproviding she knew where to find thomas young the only scrap of information she possessed was that he was a member of the royal society find the society she reckoned and with any luck that would lead to the good doctor thanks to her judicious purchases at m amps she blended in well enough with the other pedestrians as she walked along the road she knew as victoria street heading towards whitehall as she came in sight of the palace of westminster she saw a line of street vendors selling everything from tortoise shell combs to sugared almonds they were standing by their handcarts pestering passersby with their sales pitches the nearest one was selling ribbons he like many of the others had bushy sideburns and a droopy moustache and was plying his wares with gusto good day to you sir wilhelmina said nicely a bit of the red please she pointed to a glistening spool of crimson satin right away miss he fetched the spool and produced a pair of scissors from his apron pocket how much would ee like oh aboutso much she held out her hands a few inches apart how much would that be well this red is very dear it is comes all the way from china dont you know he held the shears ready to snip how much thruppence miss aright mina nodded she fished around in her sack of coins for three penniesgrateful once more for cosimos thoughtfulness in providing some ready cash the ribbon man snipped and rolled the ribbon carefully thatun wont run in the rain miss thank you she paid the man and pocketed the ribbon i was wondering if perhaps you could tell me how to find the royal society eh royal society is it please she batted her eyelashes if you could point me in the right direction i would be much obliged much obliged is it removing his cap he looked her up and down well if i was wantin to find the royal society i would just trot along the way youre going like and when i got a little way past whitehall palace id start asking folk around there the way to somerset house it ent far somerset house echoed wilhelmina thats where they keep it my darlin my thanks sir you have been a gentleman the compliment made the fellow smile he raised his hat to her which brought a hoot from his near neighbour hoo lookit sweet william there wilhelmina blew the fellow a kiss and resumed her walk and following the ribbon sellers advice was soon standing outside the pale stone facade of the sprawling edifice of somerset housean impressive imposing pile built right on the thames so that visitors could arrive and depart by boat the size of the place and the overpowering grandeur took her aback somewhat and she spent a moment planning her assault then with a plan firmly in mind she made her way to the nearest of several doors off the street pushed through and found herself in a large garden an arched entrance stood across the courtyard which she crossed before entering the main building she was immediately met by a man in the black livery of a servant who demanded to know her business i am looking for dr thomas young she replied simply the doorman regarded her sceptically women are not permitted entry he intoned dryly i do not wish to join the society mina said crisply i merely wish to speak to dr young i have it on good authority that he is a member of the society indeed madam confirmed the servant dr young is the current president of the royal society he tilted his head so that he looked down his nose it is my opinion that he would not wish to be disturbed i thank you most kindly for your opinion to be sure countered mina sweetly but i believe that the good doctor himself will be the best judge of whether he wishes to see someone who brings him valuable scientific information she had made up that last bit but thought she could back up the claim in any case now if you will be so kind as to tell me where i might find him we will put your illconsidered theory to the test she gave the man a superior smile shall we perhaps unaccustomed to dealing with such stroppy headstrong females as the one standing before him the doorman quickly acquiesced saying i regret to inform you that dr young is not in residence madam but if i were of a mind to locate him i would inquire at his medical practise the offices of which are to be found in harley street there now said wilhelmina that wasnt so difficult was it she thanked the fellow for his help and was soon making her way to harley street the traditional home of londons medical establishment she located dr youngs offices by reading the large brass nameplates outside the doors and went inside where she was politely informed that dr young was away on one of his scientific expeditions he is in egypt this time of year the woman explained we do not expect him to return before the autumn that was that wilhelmina was back on the street within two minutes and heading for the nearest cafe or restaurant where she could collect her thoughts she found a tidy little eatery on a nearby cross street where she sat with a warm pork pie and pot of tea contemplating her next move a visit to black mixen tump that was the next place listed on the back of the note cosimo had left for her at the pub in seftononsea she reasoned that if she went there she might find another note or another clue of some kind though where black mixen tump might beor even what she had no idea but reckoned a visit to the british library would give her access to whatever maps or geographical guides were to be found nor was she disappointed the ordnance survey recently published contained an exhaustive index that did indeed list the place it gave precise coordinates to said feature in oxfordshire which wilhelmina copied down drawing a neat little map of the area for future reference the day was advancing as she left the library and the sun having long since crossed the midday meridian was now beginning to fade in the west as clouds drew in to save time and shoe leather she hailed a hansom cab and told the driver to take her to the nearest overland coaching office as the cab jostled its way across cobbled streets wilhelmina marvelled again at the amount and variety of street life previctorian london was veritably awash with a restless tide of surging humanity and a multitude of wheeled conveyances in her time in prague she had grown used to a more mannered less frenetic pace and she much preferred it still the sights sounds and smellsgarbage and horse manure chief among themoccupied her until she reached her destination the office was in the stable yard of the george street inn across the river in southwark where a clerk in a short green jacket and long brown apron advised her that she could go to oxford and take another coach from there to banbury and then prevail upon the locals there to help her find the place theres only a day coach to oxford the clerk told her it leaves at crack odawn youre welcome to wait for it here but if youve got a penny or two youll find more comfortable accommodation at yonder inn mina purchased her ticket and taking the clerks advice crossed the stable yard and took a room at the inn she endured a rather loud supper in noisy company and a rather sleepless night in a fleainfested bed but was waiting washed and breakfasted when the coachman called for passengers to board there were five of which wilhelmina was the only woman she slept some and made polite conversation with her fellow passengers the coach reached high wycombe late in the afternoon which necessitated another night at an inn before undertaking the final push to oxford early the next morning after a third night at a coaching innthis one a cut above the others in the centre of oxfordshe hired a private carriage to take her to banbury where at the fox and geese public house she was given directions to the tump and a bit of friendly advice from the landlord i wouldnt go up there after dark if i was you miss it aint safeleastwise not for respectable folk whyever not wondered wilhelmina strange happenings up there he frowned and laying a finger beside his nose added say no more mina thanked him for his advice and took a light dinner and an early night the next morning she attempted to hire a coach to take her to the tump but when that failed she set off on foot armed with her sketched map and a packed lunch provided by the innkeeper and aided by a wellmarked track and a fresh bright day she had no difficulty finding her way seeing it for the first time as a shadowy hulking mass against the yellow sky gave the place a weird menacing cast that brought her up short she stood in the farmers track and stared at the dread black mixen as at an apparition something about the shapeso unnaturally perfect with its smooth tapering sides and perfectly flat level top surmounted by three aged oaks twisted and gnarled by timesuggested sinister rites and unspeakable practises despite the fine afternoon sunlight all around the tump itself seemed steeped in perpetual shadow brooding and ominous mina retrieved her ley lamp from a pocket and held it up as if it were a flashlight and black mixen a darkness to be illuminated there was no sign of activity from the device so she stowed it away again and found a dry place under a tree to sit down and relieve her feet there was no telling what she might find on the other side it was best to rest while she could she opened the cloth square containing her lunch and started in on the brown bread and thick slab of pale cheese the innkeeper had prepared for her after that she peeled the boiled egg and had a bit of the pork pie she also had a bottle of small beer and an apple she ate slowly and the afternoon dwindled around her then much refreshed by the meal she resumed her assault on black mixen tump upon reaching the base of the hill she saw a narrow footpath spiralling up the side of the mound and followed it to the top the way was steep but she soon reached the summit and paused a moment to catch her breath the high plateau gave unobstructed views of the countryside all around and wilhelmina walked all the way around the perimeter but saw no one about so much the better she thought if she was going to experiment with ley travel on the tump she did not want an audience she took out the ley lamp once morestill no activity so she conducted a closer examination of her surroundings this was quickly accomplished apart from the three old oaks fascinating as they were there was not much to seeexcept for a single stone she found embedded in the turf near the centre of the hill broad and flat as a paving stone from someones garden there was nothing at all remarkable about it as twilight was a little way off yet she decided to sit down and wait to see if anything might happen she sat her legs drawn up her chin resting on her knees and closed her eyes tired from her long walk she was soon asleep fragments of dreams disjointed and disturbing flitted through her subconscious she awoke with a start to the sound of raucous laughter looking around she saw that the sun had gone down and the sky above was filled with circling rookstheir cackling call the disembodied laughter of her dream having grown stiff sitting on the stone she unfolded herself and stood and instantly became aware of a warmth emanating from her pocket she took out the ley lamp it was not only warm to the touch but the little blue lights were all aglow within the filigreed metallic carapace on her initial survey of the tump top wilhelmina had detected no indication of a ley line anywhere not only that but there did not seem to be room enough for a line of any length but the blue lights were aglow and they did not lie so holding the lamp in front of her she began walking slowly first one direction then another watching the lights she quickly noticed that the little blue indicators glowed more brightly as she neared the centre of the mound and dimmed as she moved away the strongest reading came when she stood directly on the flat stone marker this is it she murmured now what how did one traverse a ley that was not a line but a point as she was considering this she caught a movement out of the corner of her eye and glanced around to see two dark shapes racing towards her across the level plain of the tump shielded by the trees until they were almost upon her she had but a glimpse but it was enough to know that they were after her whipping the ley lamp out of sight she turned to meet her pursuers oi shouted the nearest one stand right there dont you move a muscle me darlin wilhelmina felt a sudden surge of energy flash up around her the hair on her arms and the back of her neck stood erect she could feel the tingle on her skin and a faint crackling of static snapping around her ankles the very air tingled the men rushed closer dressed in long dark cloaks and widebrimmed hats their faces grim and determined they closed on her with swift strides one of them produced a pistol put your hands up girly he ordered his companion threw out a hand caught his arm and spun him around dont tell her that he cried that sets it off but it was already too late at the sight of the gun wilhelmina had instinctively raised her hands her fingers tingled with the pent power flowing around her she raised her arms higher the air grew misty and she saw the disbelief register on the mens faces one of them let out a shout but his words were lost in the scream of the wind suddenly swirling around her the world grew hazy and her vision quavered and she was enveloped by the shimmery glowing halo of highenergy photonsan earthbound aurora borealis at the same time she became aware that pressure was building around her crushing down squeezing the air from her lungs instinctively she resisted holding herself upright burleighs two thugs made a rush towards her she gave a little hop and the world winked out in a fizzing pop like that of a firecracker tossed into the air mina blinked and when she opened her eyes again she was standing in the dazzling white light of a blistering sun on a wide stonepaved path lined on either side with statues hundreds of them stretching for a thousand metres or more each one with the head of a man and the body of a lionan avenue of sphinxes one look at the impassive granite face gazing at her from the nearest statue and wilhelmina klug knew beyond any doubt that she had arrived in egypt part four the omega point chapter in which time is measured in empires crumbled to dust somewhere between shutting her eyes and opening them again on the new day cass had changed her mind and decided that instead of trying to find her way home by herself she would to return to the zetetic society they were offering help after all and help was what she needed right now if they could describe for her what was happening and how it workedwell that was well worth hanging around an extra day to find out while she still had no intention of joining them or getting mixed up in their mysterious machinations whatever they were simply getting a few answers to some questions like what was the best and quickest way homewould be no bad thing that decided cassandra shared a noisy breakfast with the nuns and orphans of saint teklas and helped with clearing and washing the dishes then free to follow her bliss for the day she started off for her visit to the society at the convent gate one of the sisters approached with a thin cotton robe of drab green pour vous mon amie she said holding out the garment for me wondered cass but s il vous plait insisted the nun cest mieux ma soeur she pointed to casss clothes and held out the gown for her to put on it came to cass that it was the same kind of drab robe she had seen on women going into the bazaarless than a burka but more than a housedress that would in her case be useful for keeping her modern dress covered she understood then that the sisters having noticed her odd garb were trying to protect her from difficulty merci said cass accepting the robe she allowed the nun to help her into it cellala est bonne ma soeur merci smiling the nun also arranged casss cotton scarf into a more convincing head covering then opened the gate for her bonne journee cass wished her a good day and stepping through the gate and into the street beyond the walls made her way back to the societys black lacquered door she knocked once waited then knocked again when there was no answer she knocked a third time and waited some more still too early she thought and deciding to try again later she spun on her heel and started off to explore a little more of damascus deep in thought she reached the end of the lane and rounded the corner onto the busy main streetwhere she collided heavily with a tall thin man in a threepiece suit of pale cream linen topped off with a natty white panama hat cass was thrown backward into the road the man hooked her elbow to keep her from falling steady there he helped her to right herself then moved back a step and regarded her with the disinterested concern of a stranger are you quite all right miss yesfine she said embarrassed very sorry i wasnt watching where i was going he glanced beyond her in the direction from which she had come youve been to the society i have yes she said as if this explained everything she made to edge past him and move on rosemary said there was someone yesterday was that by chance you he spoke matteroffactly and cass placed a soft irish accent i suppose it was she allowed are you one of them he chuckled were not as bad as all that i hope before cass could draw breath to apologise the thin man smiled and offered his hand brendan hanno at your service he said his light irish burr going down like butter she took the offered hand and clasped it diffidently and you are he asked my name is cassandra yes he replied pleasantly i expect it would be i was on my way to the society just now would you like to accompany me we can have a cup of tea and see if we can find answers to all your questions he gestured towards the lane shall we cass fell into step beside him how do you know i have questions everyone who comes to us has questions he observed mildly i have a few myselfsuch as how do you find damascus its nice replied cass lamely ive never seen any place like it then again ive only been here a day and i havent seen very much well we must do something about that he said to know syria is to love syria they reached the society entrance and brendan fumbled a key out of his pocket and into the lock opened the door and beckoned her in snapping on electric lights as he went from somewhere they could hear a warbly humming that will be mrs peelstick making tea we live on tea it seems take a seat and i will tell her were here cass sat down in one of the damaskcovered overstuffed chairs and took in the room once morethe shelves of books the oldfashioned sitting room furniture the dusty windows barred to the street a moment later brendan poked his head back into the room to announce that they would take their refreshment in the courtyard this way please it is far more pleasant outside he led her along a highceilinged corridor to a door that opened onto a commodious enclosed courtyard of the distinctive blackandwhitebanded stone the square paved yard was open to the sky but half shaded by a striped canvas awning the air was cool and fresh and alive with the gentle tinkling splash of a small octagonal fountain standing in the centre of the courtyard the bowl of the fountain was covered in a blanket of red rose petals floating on the surface of the water a tall potted palm stood in a large terracotta pot in one corner and in another stood a round teak table beneath a square blue umbrella it is so very pleasant this time of day brendan observed waving cass to a seat presently the woman from the day before appeared with a tray full of tea things i think you have met mrs peelstick announced brendan yes good morning mrs peelstick replied cass please call me rosemary rosemary then i am sorry if yesterday i seemed somewhat brittle i am still a bit uncertain about all this understandable dear replied the woman think nothing of it rosemary has been with the society since its inception explained brendan with a teasing smile nonsense scoffed the woman lightly not by a long chalk she bent to the teapot and began the ritual of pouring black tea into glasses containing fresh mint leaves passing a glass to cass she said i want you to know that you are among friends from now on we will treat one another like the friends we hope to become in short continued brendan completing the thought we will speak frankly please replied cass taking a sip of hot minty tea i welcome it the sun was warm and the palm fronds rustled gently in the light breeze small white butterflies flitted here and there among the jasmine strands growing up the courtyard wall cass felt the anxiety and trepidation that had marked her first visit melting away inexplicably everything seemed right and in order all was as it should bealthough nothing much really had changed at all they drank their tea and cass listened to the irishman talk about the courtyard and the building the society maintained and how they had come to own it he described what it was like to live in damascusa place that as he said in the immortal words of mark twain measured time not in hours or days or even years but in empires that arose and flourished and crumbled to dust finally they came back around to the reason for cassandras visit we know you are a traveller mrs peelstick said a traveller for whom time and space are little impediment otherwise you would not be here that is a fact it is also a fact that there are only two ways to become such a traveller either you are initiated by another traveller or you are simply born with the abilitypassed on perhaps genetically the former is the usual way the latter is more rarely the case brendan nodding slowly added one means confers no great benefit over the other although those born with the ability to leap from one dimensional reality to another may be physically more sensitive to the active mechanisms involved he fixed her with a quizzical expression which sort of traveller are you cassandra so far as i know she answered thoughtfully no one in my family has ever experienced anything like this i think i would have heard about it if they had i guess i was initiated by whom may i ask were you initiated a mana native american we call him friday you knew this fellow well did you not well no we worked together sometimes is all he was a member of an archaeological dig that i wasthat i am involved with in arizona she thought a moment but i dont think you could call it an initiation at all she said i followed him into a canyon near the site one day and it just happened brendan sipped his tea that must have been something of a shock for you it was cass agreed it still is i dont even know how i ended up here you have a giftor have been given one said rosemary either way it amounts to the same thing in the end you are now an astral traveller i like the term interdimensional explorer put in brendan because it carries no unfortunate occult overtones you simply cannot imagine the amount of blather and nonsense that has crept into the subject over the years and always it seems by people who do not know the first thing about it mrs peelstick said extending a plate of tiny round sesameseedand pistachio biscuits try one they are delicious much of that nonsense is useful of course observed brendan his irish lilt dancing for it obfuscates the subject sufficiently to protect our work protect it wondered cass why does your work need protecting this would merely be a somewhat arcane not to mention foolhardy pursuit if it did not serve a far greater purpose brendan told her it is not too much to say that the future of humankind may depend on the work of the society we are engaged in a project of such importance to humankind that its success will usher in the final consummation of the universe gosh remarked cass to her embarrassment it sounded like sarcasm which she had not intended brendan paused gauging her receptiveness to hear what came next i suppose it does sound a little overblown he admitted but it is true nonetheless in short the zetetic society was formed to offer aid and support to our members who are engaged in a very particular project our aim is nothing less than achieving gods own purpose for his creation and what purpose would that be again cass hoped her response was not an offense to these kind and hospitableand probably delusionalpeople mrs peelstick fielded the question why the objective manifestation of the supreme values of goodness beauty and truth grounded in the infinite love and goodness of the creator she concluded her tone suggesting that this should be obvious human beings are not a trivial byproduct of the universe brendan continued rather weyou me everyone elseall humankind is the reason the cosmos was created in the first place i am familiar with the anthropic principle cass replied it was a favourite hobbyhorse of her father the theory that the universe was designed to bring about human lifethat the universe exists not only for us but because of us succinctly put commended brendan you do know your cosmology my dad is an astrophysicist cass lifted a shoulder diffidently i might have picked up a few things we go further said mrs peelstick we extend the principle to say that the universe was conceived and created as a place to grow and perfect independent conscious agents and fit them for eternity independent conscious agents echoed cass softly human beings you mean yes dearhuman beings why one might ask said brendan what is the aim the purpose for such an elaborate scheme that cass suggested is where all the controversy begins truly agreed brendan our view is that the aim of the process of creating all these independent conscious agents is to promote the formation of harmonious communities of selfaware individuals capable of knowing and enjoying the creator and joining in the ongoing creation of the cosmos he paused then added with a shrug in a nutshell cass bit her lip this sort of talk always made her uneasy the grand claims of visionaries charlatans and madmen sounded very much alike to her she had had a bellyful of that in sedona and before that from various cranks with whom her father had at one time or another in his career chosen to entertain she was fed up with their quasiscientific and irrational beliefs i see were confusing you brendan observed perhaps we should start again he bent his head in thought pressing his fingertips together beneath his chin then brightening suddenly he asked have you ever heard of the omega point not as such cass replied she searched her memory then shook her head no the omega point is conceived as the end of time and the beginning of eternity the point at which the purpose of the universe is finally and fully realised when the universe reaches the point where more people desire the union harmony and fulfilment intended by the creator then the balance will have been tipped so to speak and the cosmos will proceed to the omega pointthat is its final consummation the universe will be transformed into an incorruptible everlasting reality of supreme goodness heaven in other words cass concluded yes but not another realm or world corrected mrs peelstick this world this universe transfiguredthe new heaven and the new earth it will be a place of eternal celebration of gods love and goodness where we will live and work to achieve the full potential for which humanity was created which is wondered cass acutely aware that she had managed to sound sarcastic again mrs peelstick returned her wondering glance as if to say dont you know im not trying to be difficult blurted cass id really like to hear your theory human destiny replied mrs peelstick lies in the mastery of the cosmos for the purpose of creating new experiences of goodness beauty and truth for all living things and added brendan quickly extending those values into the rest of the universe at large you see the universe as it exists now is but phase one you might sayit is where living human souls are generated and learn the conditions of consciousness and independence the ultimate fulfilment of the lives so generated however will only be found in the next phase of creationa transformation we can hardly imagine cass shook her head clearly she had paddled into deep water but what did any of it have to do with interdimensional travel or come to that with her the quest for the skin map is merely the beginning said mrs peelstick but there is so much more the skin map wondered cass has no one mentioned that asked brendan cass shook her head not in so many words well then i will tell you a story shall i many years ago a man named arthur flinderspetrie mrs peelstick put up a hand please spare the poor girl mrs p has heard all this a time or two before brendan confided yes and i dont need to hear it again now she gave them both a sunny smile if you two will excuse me i am going to pick up some things at the grocersand if you will take my advice you will get out and enjoy this beautiful day cass has never seen damascus why not show her around the old quarter brendan that is a splendid idea rosemary ill do just that good rosemary started away dont wear her out with your ramblings brendanyou know how you areand try not to be too late ill have a nice supper ready when you return chapter in which despair gives birth to audacity the journey to black mixen tump always filled charles flinderspetrie with dread although the gentle hills of the cotswold countryside appeared benign enough it was the destination that cast a pall over all that went before he felt it nowand he could not even see the great mound from the window of his carriage but it was there hidden from view waiting for him the thought made his heart skip a beat almost fifty years had passed since his father benedict had introduced him to the infamous moundand still the thing occupied a baleful place in his psyche an earthwork of incalculable age the tump had been raised by the hands of primitive labourers using nothing more than deerantler picks and reed baskets why this primitive society thought it necessary to build yet another hill in a landscape of nothing but hills remained a mystery the age of the monument builders murmured charles to himself an age so far as he could tell that was rife with mysteries of every kind the carriage lurched and took the turning in the road leaving behind the village of banbury and charles regretted his decision to come to this godforsaken place even more he regretted that the decision was necessary but something had to be done his last exchange with douglas had made that abundantly clear the boy had always been headstrong as a child he had been willful wayward intractable charles bereft after the death of his dear wife in childbirth despaired of the boys rebellious and destructive nature and packed him off to boarding school in the hope that a stern institution would instil the discipline he himself was unable to generate stoneycroft school had made the lad more mannered and well behaved to be sure but it had also made him far more devious that combined with a selfconfidence bordering on reckless audacity cast douglas as a most formidable adversary to anyone or anything that crossed him in short from a selfish unbearable youth douglas was fast becoming a cunning implacable and dangerous young man i do not see what difference a piece of paper makes anyway douglas had complained during their last in a long series of confrontations nothing they teach is any use on the quest anyway it is my birthright he glared at his father or will you deny me thatas you have denied me everything else charles exploded ingrate how can you say that in all good conscience how can you possibly even think it i have denied you nothing rising from his chair he began pacing about the parlour all i ask is that you gain a little more learning apply yourself to your studies show me you can achieve something through your own efforts he looked at douglas sullen face and saw he was not getting through to his unruly son he tried another tack you are not stupid douglas in fact in many ways you are amongst the most intelligent persons i know if you were to apply even the smallest portion of your native wit and mind to your studies you would achieve wonderful things listen ive secured your place at christ church and all is arranged charles continued three years is nothingyoull be busy make new friends and establish associations that will serve you through the rest of your life if you apply yourself time will pass just like that charles clicked his fingers on the day you finish your exams i will personally place the map in your hands why should i believe you grumbled douglas how do i know youll keep your word now sonthats not fair you should knowyoure the one who sold grandfathers collection and gambled away the money was that fair that was wrong it was a sad and terrible mistake and ive been paying for it all my life he thrust out pleading hands douglas please try to understand i know i have kept it from youi admit as muchbut the last thing i wanted was to see you make the same mistakes i made when i was your age so just because you failed now i have to make up for it isnt that what you mean all i want is for you to be prepared i want you to be better at the quest than i was he paused and yes i failed but you have it in you to succeed to do that you must be thoroughly grounded in language and history oxford can give you that and if i refuse to go what then it is not as if i am asking the impossible charles pointed out it is for your own good after all since when have you ever known what was good for me father the question was a slap in the face douglas there is no cause for i see it now father he sneered you get sent down in disgrace so now i have to go and restore the family name you tried the quest and failed so now you want to keep everyone else from even trying this discussion is over declared charles collapsing behind his desk i have told you what i expect and what you must do to inherit you either take up your studies or suffer the consequences douglas rose from his chair his fists balled at his sides you dont frighten me with your threats old man he turned and stormed from the room slamming the door so hard it rattled the lamps on the mantle douglas called charles after his son come back another door slammed in the hall and the house was quiet once more why does it always have to be like this wondered charles shaking his head sadly that was a twoyearold argument and still it rankled douglas had taken up his place at christ church but from all charles was able to learn his son rarely attended lectures and was never seen in any of the universitys libraries douglas might as well have been a ghost as far as his tutors were concerned then when the demands for money from the towns merchants and publicans began arriving charles read the writing on the wall he sent pleading letters one after another letters that went unanswered never a reply then came the straw that broke the longsuffering camels back an urgent message from the college chaplain stating that along with two other students douglas had been arrested for being drunk and disorderly and starting a public affray the rev philpott indicated that the young miscreant could be released on bail of fifty pounds otherwise he would be forced to spend time in gaol until the case was called to court filled with despair charles had made up his mind before he had even read the signature on the letter douglas would remain in gaol and take his chances with the magistrate he could not count on his father to save his worthless hide this time it might even do the boy some good to suffer the consequences of his actions but gaol was at best merely a stopgap not a solutionand a solution was desperately needed if charles was ever to have any peace he would have to be bold and ruthlessmore audacious than he had ever been in his life to now he spent three days and nights in intense cogitation thinking up and then discarding one desperate plan after another until he hit upon an idea that offered the perfect solution thus as the sun rose early in the morning on a clear may day charles made the decision that would solve his immediate problem unfortunately this decision born of despair would also confound the quest for generations to come the carriage jolted back and forth over the rutted road moving deeper into the countryside when charles stirred and looked out the window once more he saw the dark unnaturally conical shape of the mound looming in the near distance and felt the skin on the back of his neck tingle with apprehension black mixen tump was only a portal he told himself he had used it before there was nothing to fear charles drew a deep breath and glanced at the flat wooden box beside him on the seat he pulled the box closer and rested his hand on the polished lid if ever he needed assurance that he was doing the right thing he needed it now god help me he whispered give me a sign he turned his gaze to the imposing dark mass of the tump and saw the three trollsthe ancient oaks growing from the flattened top of the mound as he watched three crows rose from the uppermost branchesone from each tree was it the sign he had requested charles shrugged it would have to do chapter in which kit plays the waiting game they have all gone you say wondered abbot cisneros he raised his eyes from the work on his desk and pushed his glasses up his nose yes your eminenceall are gone replied brother antolin the abbots secretary where have they gone the abbot put down his pen and blew on the ink still wet on the page before him to the ecumenical conference eminence replied the brother the one convened by cardinal bernetti the lucerne conference yes i remember the abbot picked up his pen once more and waved it in the air is there no one else it would seem not holiness the abbot replaced his pen on the desk once more am i to believe that no one else speaks english in this entire abbey one of our many international visitors perhaps we considered that of course replied brother antolin but it was thought unwise to involve outsiders in what may turn out to be a sensitive matter ah the abbot picked up his pen yet again you are right best keep this to ourselves until we know what the outcome might be he paused thought for a moment then wondered have you asked at chapter i did eminencebefore bringing it to you but it seems those possessing a fluency with english are all in attendance at the conference how extraordinary the abbot resumed writing the secretary folded his hands before him and awaited the result of his superiors deliberation presently the abbot of montserrat finished the sentence he was writing and asked have you seen this fellow yes eminence he appears ordinary enoughthough he is dressed very oddly some would say the same of us observed abbot cisneros indeed eminence you say the local police merely dropped him off at the gate with the porter is that right brother antolin nodded that is what i understand and no one can be found to speak to him it is thought that brother lazarus knows someonean occasional assistant a german nun i believewho speaks english aha the abbot raised his pen triumphantly summon the sister and proceed accordingly he returned to his writing ohand brother i think prior donato should deal with this from now on see that he is informed of all pertinent details tomas is in lucerne at the conference eminence of course he is the abbot waved him away bring word when the matter has been successfully concluded it will be done brother antolin backed from the office closing the doors as he went and returned to his own desk in the outer vestibule where a young novitiate was waiting addressing the monk he said abbot cisneros has decided to leave the matter in my hands for the time being take word to brother lazarus that i wish him to meet me at the porters lodge he is to bring his assistantthe german nun she will serve as our translator after being dropped at the gate by the policeman kit had been left in the care of the porter a squat spaniard with pudgy hands and the face of a cherub kit spent the next few hours idling in the gatekeepers lodge as a sort of quasicaptivehe was not locked up nor was he free to go for every time he got up and tried to leave the porter came running after him scolding in spanish and he was pushed back into the lodge kit was given to know that he was being made to wait until adequate provision could be made for him in the meantime he was given cool lemon water to drink and some small dry biscuits occasionally church bells sounded and once a priest came to look at him exchanged a brief word with the porter and disappeared again kit none the wiser was left to himself once more there was no point in getting stroppy with the fellow kit decided and in any case getting stroppy in spanish was quite beyond his abilities his best option was simply to remain pleasant and compliant and wait for whatever providence would toss his way the waiting continued and the day drew on towards evening then shortly after the bells in the abbey tower sounded for the third time kit heard voices in the gravel yard outside the door opened and the gatekeeper motioned for kit to come out he was met by three priests two very large hulks in dusty worn habitsmanual workers kit decidedand the priest who had looked in on him earlier gracias he said marshalling the little spanish he possessed the priest smiled patted him on the bare shoulder and motioned him to follow happy to oblige if it meant he could at last leave the confines of the gatehouse kit stepped out into a day fading towards evening the jagged grey peaks blushing pink in the light of the setting sun soared high above the abbey precinct casting all in shadow the air was already starting to cool with the approach of night the little delegation climbed a long winding boulevard to an enclosed courtyard one side of the courtyard fronted the great abbey church which seemed to be carved into the very stone of the mountain on another side was a grand stone edifice with a baroque facade kit was conducted into the building where a tiled vestibule gave way to a long panelled corridor that smelled of beeswax and wood polish he was marched to a waiting room that contained nothing but wooden chairs lined up around the perimeter sientense por favor said the priest kit entered the room and the door was closed behind him what a palaver he muttered having spent most of the day sitting he decided to pace instead and occupied himself with the same questions he had been asking since his arrival what were they doing why couldnt they just let him go what were the chances of getting a proper shirt and trousers his animalskin clothing in this setting made him look and feel ridiculous he was on his fourth or fifth circuit of the room when he heard voices in the corridor outside he turned to the door just as it opened to admit an elderly whitehaired priest in a black cassock and a young woman in a crisp grey nuns habit mio dio cried the priest upon confronting the wild man standing in the doorway he gave a little jump colliding with the woman entering behind him she steadied the priest with a hand and moved around him into the room taking in the hairy apparition before her the nuns mouth fell open and her eyes went wide wilhelmina gasped kit she leaned forward studying his face kitis that really you under all that hair its me mina he started forward his arms outstretched to embrace her i cant tell you how glad i am to see you her hands flashed up she reeled back kit hesitated what are you wearing she said her face wrinkled what is that smell its a long story replied kit what are you doing here where are we anyway dont you know he shook his head nobody tells me anything the whitehaired priest having overcome his shock stepped forward wilhelmina he said in german do you know this this man mina turned grinning with joyful disbelief let me introduce you to my dear friend kit livingstone the priest let out a little gasp of amazement he gaped at kit letting his astonished gaze sweep from head to toe and back again unglaublich he breathed shaking his head in wonder i know wilhelmina agreed watching kit as if he might suddenly vapourise before her eyes it is unbelievablebut here he is all this time we were trying to find him andvoila he finds us incredible then turning suddenly she grabbed kit in a fierce hug where have you been my dear filthy wildhaired man kit kissed her cheek and then buried his face in the hollow of her neck oh mina he sighed surrendering to an overwhelming relief it is so good to see you you dont know come on she said pushing him away and taking his hand lets get out of here she cast a glance over her shoulder and spoke german to the priest who answered offering his hand which kit shook this is brother lazarus she said making a quick introduction he is the astronomer here well go up to his quarterswe can talk and we wont be disturbed up there she said something else in german and the priest replied with a nod to kit she said brother lazarus will take care of the details he will fix things with his superiors and make the necessary arrangements you are to be his guest okay agreed kit but could we eat something first i havent eaten since i dont know when sureill fix you a nice meal she told him but first were going to get you a bathand a haircut if possible ill have to find some clothes she regarded kits furry trousers and laughed how do you feel about a monks robe they moved into the corridor where a few curious brothers had gathered outside to catch a glimpse of their unusual visitor brother lazarus called to the onlookers and conducted a brief conference while wilhelmina steered kit away dont worry she whispered hell take care of everything he has a fair bit of seniority around here they all love him and trust him completely youll like him too kit nodded they reached the vestibule and stepped out into a balmy evening where the stars were just beginning to kindle for the night the ethereal sound of singing reached them on the soft night airthe monks were chanting evensong once out of sight of the others wilhelmina looped her arm through kits and pulled him close are you really a nun wilhelmina laughed her voice full of delight the sound was delicious in the evening twilight dont be silly its a role i play when i come here the habit just makes everything so much easier she gave his arm an affectionate squeeze a lot less explaining to do it suits you indeed she was more attractive than everand it showed in her figure as well as her face she had filled out a little and now had curves where before there had been only angles her dark eyes fairly gleamed with health and wellbeing you look wonderful you think so she smiled enjoying the compliment theres a lot to be said for the convent life what about youwhats the explanation for what youre wearing what do you mean this is the height of fashion where ive come from she laughed again look at you i hardly recognise you under all that hair you look like a big old bushy bear whatthey didnt have clippers or razors where you were actually no kit said running his fingers through the tangles of his beard and those muscles she hooted giving his biceps a squeeze no more puppy fat youre positively brawnya lean mean fighting machine she said approvingly whatever they were feeding you it didnt do you any harm thanks i guess he looked down at his torso beneath the layer of smudgy dirt he could see the ripples of a sixpack and his arms were corded muscle now that she mentioned it he supposed he had trimmed down and bulked out a bit oh kit it is so good to see you and have you back safe and sound ive been worried about you where have you been anyway you wont believe the half of it kit replied im not entirely sure i believe all of it myself he fell silent thinking about where to start or even how to begin to frame an explanation well she said after a moment are you going to keep a girl in suspense nono i dont mean to its just i dont even know where to start well she said the last time i saw you burleigh was hot on your tail he chased you and giles out of the city and you made for the river she went on to describe the chain of events as she knew them giles is okay by the way the bullet did no irreparable harm and as soon as he could move i took him home he should be good as new very soon if not already good im glad hes okay mused kit and explained how he had come under gunfire but found the ley and made the jump landing in the place mina had told him about but the time was all off and i ended up in what i guess you could call the stone age that would explain the fur trousers i was found and well more or less adopted by a tribe of peopleriver city clan i call them they live in this enormous gorge the one ive visited surmised mina the same one but in a different timefar different anyway they are the most amazing people they dont speak muchthey have a very limited vocabulary they communicate mainly by a sort of telepathykind of like a mental radio wilhelmina gave him a sideways glance its true he insisted i could hardly believe it the first time it happened but one of them this incredibly old chieftain called enulhes a master at it and he taught me how to he stopped walkingso abruptly that wilhelmina took two more steps without him she turned and he blurted mina ive been to the well of souls you what the spirit well kit said his voice ringing in the empty plaza ive been there minai know how to find it chapter in which communication breaks down the death of arthur flinderspetrie could not have come at a worse moment the land was in upheaval and it was all pharaohs fault if the crisis did not pass soon the kingdom would descend into civil war you had the misfortune to die at a very bad time my friend anen sighed then smiled ruefully at the foolishness of his own thought for the young and healthy death always arrived at a bad time did it not as senior priest of the temple of amun he had scores of minions at his command yet anen took charge of the funeral preparations himself out of respect and honour for a friendship that had spanned decades in his mind there was no question but that arthurs body would be embalmed and a suitable tomb made ready the embalming procedurefrom the ritual washing of the corpse with water from the nile to its nitre bath and the final anointing with oils and swathing in linenwould require seventy days under the circumstances it would not be possible to build a tomb in such a short time therefore an extension of anens personal tomb would be carved out and painted and a wooden sarcophagus constructed to hold the earthly remains of the late arthur flinderspetrie this would also give time enough for young benedict to return to his home world and break the sad news of his fathers decease to his mother the two of them could then return to attend the grand funeral ceremony and oversee the entombment as head of the flinderspetrie family benedict would host the funeral feast this is how it was done this is how it had always been done since time out of mind observing the rituals of life and death in proper orderincluding the timehonoured rites of embalming and entombmentbrought order to the affairs of men which in turn led to order in the universe satisfied that he had thought of everything he summoned the boy and through the use of signs communicated to benedict all that must be done in the days ahead benedict appeared to understand whereupon anen ordered a mild sleepinducing herbal infusion to be prepared and commanded his personal servants to see the griefstricken lad to his rest he then turned his attention to readying arthurs corpse for transfer to pernefer the house of embalming to begin the process of readying it for life in eternity as the shroud was being wrapped to secure the body for transport however commotion erupted in the courtyardaccompanied this time by angry voices from beyond the wall anen stepped from the house of wholeness and healing the moon was high and bright spilling light into the sacred enclosure in the moonlight he saw priests and temple soldiers milling about the gates he hailed one of the servants just then hurrying past what is the reason for this uproar he demanded i was given to understand that the mob had gone away they dispersed my master answered the servant the temple guards drove them back to the river well demanded anen as if this should have been the end of the matter the servant lifted his palms they have returned with a flick of his hand anen sent the impertinent fellow on his way and proceeded to the gate where a group of priests and servants had gathered where is tutmose he demanded scanning the crowd quickly for the commander of the temple guard he should be dealing with this breach of the peace commander tutmose is out there explained the nearest priest he turned and saw that it was anen who addressed him he bowed low my master i did not know outside the gates he said cutting off his subordinates instinctive apology he went out to talk to them said the priest to find out why they are doing this and demand that they leave us in peace anen cocked his head to one side listening to the hubbub of voices from over the wall tell the commander i wish to see him as soon as he returns i will await him in my chamber the priest bowed low and anen took his leave returning to his rooms in the palatial prophets house he bathed and dressed in a clean robe then lay down on his bed he had just closed his eyes when he heard swift footsteps in the corridor outside his sleeping chamber his housemaster came padding into the room an instant later saying loath as i am to disturb you my master commander tutmose has returned with word of the uprising bid him enter anen rose and stood ready to receive the chief of the guards the wisdom of amun ascendant be yours master said tutmose entering on the heels of the servant he bowed and waited to be addressed what news said anen impatiently come man speak we are besieged by a rabble of common labourers from akhenatens city said tutmose they are demanding that the temple be closed anen stared at his commander impossible are they insane it is likely affirmed tutmose but they say they possess an edict from pharaoh himself anen gaped in astonishment such a thing has never been known i do not say it is true tutmose added only tell you what they themselves have told me anen gazed at his chief of guards and saw that he was bleeding from a cut on the side of his face blood also trickled down his leg from a gash in his thigh you are injured commander he observed they did this to you they refused to show this decree to anyone but you master they demand an audience at once do they sneered anen he drew himself up i will speak to them but by the power of horus i will not have them run riot on holy ground tell them thus says anen second prophet of amun you are to choose four from among your number to represent you these four representatives and these alone will be admitted to the temple courtyard after morning prayers we shall sit down with the high priest and discuss this matter like civilised men this is what i have decided so shall it be done master tutmose bowed and hurried away to deliver anens message before anen could return to his rest the commander was back with word that the workers refused to enter the temple precinct because they considered it an unclean place they insist that you come out to them tutmose reported the demand was so audacious anen could only stare in disbelief at his commander that this should come to pass so swiftly after their confrontation with the workers at akhetaten could not be a coincidence it was a deliberate act of aggression but why send mere labourers it made no sense pharaoh commanded armies he had only to whisper a word and his royal bodyguard would march into the sea at his behest either the mob was lying about the edict which seemed only too likelyor there was some darker purpose at work that he did not yet perceive my master asked tutmose stirring him from his thoughts what is your will this rebellion must end i will go out and speak to them tutmose inclined his head the temple guard stands ready to attend you no countered anen i go out alone they should not feel threatened by a solitary priest return to your troops and see they are armed and stand ready behind the gates if anything should happen to me you are to march on them he began removing his robe and collar go a few moments later anen emerged dressed in the simple shendyt and belt of an ordinary priest at his approach those gathered at the gate bowed open the door he commanded the gatemen pulled and the gates swung slowly open anen stepped forward and was instantly confronted by a crowd of swarthy men who at sight of him began shaking fists and tools and shouting abuse he held up his hands to quiet them and waited to be heard after a moment a grudging silence came upon the throng and he said who speaks for you who among you is leader a longhaired fellow moved out from the rabble bearded in the habiru fashion dark from long hours in the sun muscled arms crossed over his massive chest he carried a hammer in his thick hands i speak for my people and carry the demands of pharaoh that this temple be closed and the priests dispersed the stones of these walls and buildings are to be carried off to akhetaten anen regarded the fellow with a dubious expression he paused to let his gaze travel around the closepacked ring of angry faces if that is so how is it that i have heard nothing of this until now i bring an edict from pharaoh the labourer proclaimed loudly glancing around at his men some of whom shouted in support of this assertion may i see this edict of yours the man nodded to one of those behind him a papyrus scroll was passed forward into the hands of the priest anen calmly unrolled the papyrus and read the contents what he saw there brought the blood to his head it was much as the habiru labourer had saidby decree of akhenaten the temple was to be dismantled and used for building stone at akhetaten pharaohs new city anen took a deep breath and forced himself to answer calmly if this is truly from pharaohs own hand it will have to be studied and verified i will take possession of it and begin an inquiry the belligerent fellow snatched back the scroll we have come to begin the work of tearing down this temple that is overhasty and premature anen told him his voice flat no one will be permitted to begin anything until we have made petition for clarification and received confirmation from pharaohs own lips he paused and added for all i know that is a false documenta fraud and a forgery by the living god swore the labourer his fellows muttered dangerously you dare accuse us so i make no accusations anen replied coolly i only state a simple fact since i was not present when pharaoh made this proclamation i cannot be certain it carries his true intent this argument might have continued some considerable time but the mob having heard enough began shouting that the temple must be pulled down at once someone threw a stone striking anen high on the chest the priest staggered back bleeding from a gash below his collarbone the angry crowd surged forward the commander of the guard having seen enough drew his sword and dashed to anens side raising his shield he thrust his master behind him and backed away as the crowd began hurling paving stones ripped from the street with picks and pry bars close the gates shouted tutmose and the gatemen leapt to obey as the stones smashed against the massive timbers what will you have us do my master asked tutmose as soon as the doors were sealed and barred once more if any of them should try to get inside the temple precinct said anen they are to be resistedby force if necessary he hurried off to have his wound dressed halfway across the courtyard he paused changed direction and proceeded to the guest lodge instead benedict was asleep but lightly and woke when the priest came bustling into his room trouble has come to the temple anen announced knowing the youth could not understand him he gestured for benedict to rise and follow him once outside he cupped a hand to his ear and said listen the young man heard the sound of voices raised and paving cobbles rattling the gate beams we must get you safely away from here said the priest he pointed to benedict and mimed the action of a bird flying away benedict caught the meaning on the second repetition and replied i understand it would be best for me to leave he mimed the birdflying motion nodded and pointed to himself i am ready anen turned and called for one of his senior priests to attend him you must take our guest from here by way of the hidden gate accompany him to the sacred road and see that he departs in safety as you command my master so shall it be replied the priest he turned to the young man bowed and gestured for him to follow benedict thanked anen for his care the priest put his hand on the young mans chest over his heart and then pressed it to his own heart benedict returned the gesture farewell anen he said and in that moment was a boy no longer but a man with alliances and responsibilities until we meet again the senior priest put a hand to benedicts arm and started to lead him away benedict hesitated the priest gave his arm a tug urging him to follow pointing at tutmose who was waiting to conduct them out of the temple by way of the hidden gate wait benedict said making a flattening motion with his hands there is something i must do he turned back and called to anen i am sorry but i cannot leave without copying my fathers map anen regarded the youth quizzically my fathers map see at this benedict opened his shirt and began drawing symbols on his chest with his finger in imitation of arthurs many tattoos he then pantomimed drawing them you see i must copy the map understanding broke across anens broad features you want the skin he said placing his own hand against his chest and making little curlicues with his finger the map yes benedict nodded confident that the priest had understood this will take time anen pulled on his chin and frowned but we must get you away from here now before the fighting starts he turned and spoke a rapid command to the priest he had placed in charge of benedicts safety a new commandtake him to the servants precinct beside the river go to hetap and tell him to watch over our guest until i send for him he will be rewarded the senior priest bowed in acknowledgment of the command and then beckoned benedict away the young man hesitated you will bring me the copy of the map he asked retracing the symbols on his chest anen smiled and pantomimed the symbols then made a motion with his hands as if folding a cloth which he then presented to benedict thank you anen benedict repeated i am in your debt at the far end of the temple in a dusty little corner was a small doorlarge enough to accommodate a goat or dog or a man on hands and kneesand after withdrawing the bolts and catches benedict was led out into the nightdark streets of niwetamun once away from the temple the city remained placid and quiet the people asleep in their homes they walked through a district of large housesthe homes of the wealthy nobilityand progressed by degrees through neighbourhoods of more modest means until they reached the humble mudbrick huts of the servant class that lined the river here there were people awake and already working hoeing or watering their gardens tending their chickens sitting at looms repairing tools and other choreslabouring for themselves before going off to serve in the houses of their masters they stopped at a house with a neatly tended garden and approached a squat fat old man sitting on a stool outside the front door the senior priest bowed and spoke to the man then indicated benedict the fellow rose bowed and made a lengthy reply to the priest then bowed again turning to his charge the priest indicated that benedict was to remain with the man the priest departed then and the old man addressed his guest hetap he said placing his fingertips against his pudgy chest benedict repeated the name then said his own whereupon the old temple servant took him by the hand and led him into the house to meet his wife a plump greyhaired woman with a ready dimpled smile benedict was given the only chair in the house and as the sun rose on a new day he was fed figs slices of sweet melon and flat bread fried in palm oil and dipped in honey then he was shown where he could sleep all this was accomplished with simple sign language and an impressive dose of goodwill at each transaction benedict thanked his hosts and hoped they would be richly rewarded for their kindness to him a stranger who could not even speak their language he lay down a little while but could not rest thoughts of his fathers last moments crowded out all other considerations it was still difficult for him to accept that his father was dead he continually relived the awful moment and wondered how he would break the news to his mother what would she do when she learned her husband of so many years would never return to her how would she bear it bereft lonely grieving unable to understand anyone or make himself understood save for blunt gestures that passed for sign language benedict spent the day in misery watching the road for any sign of anen bringing the copy of his fathers map but the priest did not come toward the end of the day he saw a barge approaching on the river as it passed the village he saw that it was filled with soldiers this he took as a sign that the trouble at the temple had come to the notice of the authorities and the situation would then be resolved by the end of that first day he went to his rest feeling certain that the map would arrive the next day and he would soon be on his way the second day dragged by and though benedict rarely took his eyes off the road no one came from the temple the third day passed similarlythe only change was that the commotion in the city seemed to be spreading the villagers were becoming restive and many seemed fearful there were furtive discussions amongst neighbours and everyone was wary almost beside himself with frustrated impatience the young man determined that he would not wait another day but come what may would return to the temple to see for himself what was happening obviously something had gone wrong how long did it take to make a simple copy of the tattoos on his fathers chest benedict berated himself for leaving without insisting on making the copy himselfmuch as he would have dreaded the task at least it would have been done he spent a last restless night and rose at first light the next morning to set out hetap and his wife attempted to prevent him but he remained adamant he thanked his guardians for taking care of him and departed he was halfway through the village when he saw a chariot speeding towards him he waited and as it drew near he recognised tutmose the chief of the guards had clearly been in a battle he wore bandages on his right arm and left leg just above the knee and his eye was black and discoloured from a nasty blow tutmose halted the horses and stepped from the chariot from a bag on a strap over his shoulder he produced a parcel wrapped in papyrus and bound with a band of linen dyed red the commander greeted benedict and placed the parcel firmly in his hands thank you said benedict the parcel flat and decorated with a row of hieroglyphic symbols in black along one side was so light as to weigh almost nothing as benedict tugged at the red band to untie the bundle the commander reached out and prevented him saying rewi rok no asked benedict tutmose shook his head and indicated that he was to get into the chariot at once clutching the parcel benedict climbed into the vehicle and with a jolt the horses clattered out of the village soon they were speeding past fields of beans and barley heading up into the hills and out into the desert by the time he had mastered his balance in the swerving jouncing vehicle the long avenue of ramheaded sphinxes came into view but a few moments later the chariot was drawing up at the end of the avenue where the sacred way leading to the temple commenced tutmose gestured for benedict to get out then turned his team and raising his hand in farewell sped off once more leaving benedict to make his departure alone and unseen it was early yet the sun was just rising above the line of hills to the east benedict knew which sphinx to mark in order to make the leaphis father had taught him well but first he had to look at the map copied from his fathers tattoos kneeling down where the stone pavement ended he carefully untied the red linen band and unwrapped the papyrus what he saw caused him to jump to his feet and take two involuntary steps back he stared at the parcel on the ground amazement and revulsion churning through him in waves that made him gasp and fight for breath for on the ground before him was no mere copy of the map made by the temple scribes but the map itself his fathers skin made into parchment his inability to communicate had led to this monstrous misunderstanding no mere copy the embalmers had preserved the original the horror of the deed overwhelmed him and benedict retched into the dust at his feet when the dry heaves subsided he stood gazing at the ghastly artefact wondering what to do he could not bear to take it neither could he leave it caught in a spiral of indecision he stared at the grisly thinga roughly rectangular piece of near translucent integument covered with the blue symbols applied during the life of its owner knowing he must decide and quickly the sun climbed higher above the hills time was fast approaching when the ley would cease its activity and he would be forced to spend another day in this hateful place benedict swiftly reached the conclusion that he had only one option he knelt down and gathered up the ends of the papyrus carefully folding them back into their original shape and retying the red band then tucking the packet into his shirt he turned and stepped to the centre of the avenue of sphinxes outside the halffinished temple he walked to the fifth sphinx from the end stopped cast a last look around at the unforgiving desert and with the even measured pace his father had taught him began making his long way home chapter in which the best theory is expounded brendan proved himself an able and erudite guide to the attractions of damascus he led his willing charge on a leisurely tour of the old city visiting the great umayyad mosque with its golden domes and shrine to john the baptist the pashas palace with its serene palmshaded fountains and room after room of ornate tile and scrollwork screens the chapel of saint paul on the very spot where he escaped the city in a basket from the city wall in the dead of night bab faradis or gate of paradise the great souq alhamidiyya with its miles of aisles and dizzying myriad of shops straight street and its marble columns and roman arches and while they strolled and took in the sights they talked and cass got a better grasp on the nature of ley travel to be sure as well as the work and philosophy of the society which she learned had all started with a man named arthur flinderspetrie an extraordinary fellowinquisitive resourceful fearless as the day is longan explorer of the highest order they were sitting at a tiny round table under a striped awning sipping sweet fragrant hibiscus tea from glasses in silver holders as the day faded around them ever come across that name at all asked brendan no never said cass pity but im not surprised that he is not now remembered in the annals of human achievement is due to the fact that his work was largely clandestine and confined almost exclusively to exploration of the lines of telluric energyley lines in other words that alone i suppose would be reason enough to found a society in which to carry on his work but there is more brendan paused and regarded her closely as if gauging her readiness to hear cass felt her pulse quicken im listening arthur discovered something brendan said lowering his voice on one of his many journeys he discovered something of such unimaginable magnitude that it changed the course of his life though he continued his travels he held his discovery a closeguarded secret refusing to speak of it to anyone what did he discover brendan leaned back frowning the truth is we do not know thats it blurted cass exasperation pinching her voice since were speaking frankly i dont mind saying that frankly i expected more and i truly wish i could tell you more members of our society have been working over many lifetimes to answer the riddle of what it was that arthur discovered and did not feel he could share with the rest of the world we have sworn life and blood to this quest and some have died in pursuit of it we trust their lives have not been given in vain cass leaned back in her chair and stared at the gentleman across the table fighting down her frustration and disappointment but you must have some idea what you are searching for we have no end of ideas theories notions suppositions and so forth brendan replied with a rueful laugh too many in fact but the very best theoryand this is not mine alone others share itis that arthur flinderspetrie discovered nothing less than the means to alter reality excuse me said cass disbelief edging into her tone once more scientific training and her own native scepticismhoned by years in academia fighting from her corner against considerable oddsmade her wary of anything that sounded even remotely oddball for a moment i thought you said alter reality what does that even mean brendan nodded i dont blame you for being dubious it took me years to accept it myself even now im not sure i fully grasp all the implications but it would seem to be bound up in the ordinary mystery of time arthur may have found a way to manipulate time itself that would be the greatest discovery in human history cass observed dryly your man flinderspetrie must have been one heck of a discoverer oh he was agreed brendan of course that is only a theorybut it is the best one we have so far consider he said what if just for example you possessed the ability to change the past then instead of a dirtsucking phd grunt i would be fabulously wealthy and living on a tropical island paradise and we would not be having this conversationthat is if i could change the past im afraid ive presented you with too much and all at once brendan sympathised he drew a deep breath and gazed at a sky fading from gold to violet as evening came on we should get back rosemary will wonder what has become of us he laid a few coins on the table and they resumed their walk through the old quarters rabbit warren of streets after a moment he said here in syria the grand panoply of the past is all around useverything from prehistoric to assyrian babylonian persian roman byzantineyou name itevery epoch of human existence has left its mark on the land here it is easy to imagine travelling to the past because the past is never far away you are talking to a palaeontologist cass said i spend a lot of time with my head in the past then you should have a good feel for the mystery that lies at the heart of time itself we live and move in time but none of us really knows much about it for example in normal experience time flows in only one directionfrom past to present we can visit the past at least vicariously through photographs the written word our memories the fossils you find and such like the past is always with us we carry it around with us in the form of memories we live in a world shaped entirely by it and it continually exerts a direct influence on the present yes the choices you made yesterday affect what happens to you today and the choices you make today will affect what happens to you tomorrow we all reach the future at the same rate and we have to live with what we find when we get there in large part because of the choices weve made said cass we shape our reality through the exercise of intention through the application of our free will as conscious beings correct agreed brendan with ley travel however the experience of time and reality is somewhat more fluid so ive noticed indeed ley journeys normally involve visits to a particular version of the pasta past where many things will be the same as we remember them but other things are different people events and in some cases even places will differ from those we recognise from our personal experience he paused and raised his eyes to take in her expression but what if the past was fully as malleable as ripe with potential as the future seems to be then by changing the past we might make a better future than we might otherwise have had cass suggested that is why you get to be fabulously wealthy and live on your island in tropical splendourbecause of the changes you made to your past reality brendan regarded cass with a knowing look in short by changing the past one also creates a future that might not have existed if things had stayed the way they were if only remarked cass the fly in the ointment of course is that you never know exactly what the outcome of any change might be since everything is intertwined with everything else even a small change in one tiny area might result in terrible or at least unwanted consequences somewhere elsechaos theory in a nutshell what if there was another way suggested brendan one hypothesis of time holds that the future exists only as a cloud of possibilityno form or substance just pure potentiality now then what if you had the ability to reach into that cloud of possibilitythat fog of all possible outcomes to any actionwhat if you could reach in and pluck out the particular outcome you desire choose the future you want mused cass which would alter the present reality and also by logical necessity change the past as well that declared brendan is what i believe arthur flinderspetrie discovered no more was said cass remained quietly thoughtful as they made their way back to the society headquarters where mrs peelstick welcomed them and said you two carry on suppers almost ready ill call you in a few minutes thank you rosemary youre a peach brendan told her crossing to the stairway he called to cass come i want to show you something cass followed her guide up two floors taking a key from his pocket the irishman unlocked a heavy door and stepped across the threshold he twisted a switch on the wall and lights in sconces flickered on to reveal an absolutely enormous room with a high beamed ceiling and small diamondshaped windows the room occupied the entire second floor of the building and appeared to be stuffed with books and scrolls and manuscripts and papers of all kinds there were books in wooden crates and crammed into the floortoceiling shelves lining the long wall on either hand books piled on the floor in unsteady towers books lying in untidy heaps in the corners cascading from under canvas sheets and spilling from disintegrating boxes three large library tables groaned under the weight of oversize volumes and another table was piled high with rolled parchment scrolls and bundled manuscripts tied with ribbon and string the air was musty with the scent of mouldering paper and dust come in come in he said ushering her inside cass took in the chaotic clutter this reminds me of the graduate reading room in the library of the university she said oh its not a library countered brendan nor a reading room this is a genizah genizah repeated cass she had never heard the word before the ancient jews considered it sinful to throw away a book and it was anathema to destroy any book bearing the tetragrammaton the four letters making up the name of god so when their holy texts or other materials became worn out they were consigned to a genizah to await official burial on holy ground he spread his hands to the room this is our genizah but we do not bury the books anymore they are far too valuable your treasure is books cass stepped to the nearest table the volumes were old and well worn it was true and most were in languages other than english where do they all come from they are gathered from here and there by society members on their various travels and donated to the cause those books we deem most worthy of preservation we keep who knows when something written in one of these pagessome little scrap of observation an obscure record of an historical event a word a name a report from a source now forgottensome little gem of truth will prove valuable to furthering our investigations then the book will be resurrected so to speak to fulfill its destiny he walked to a smaller table at one end of the room here i want to show you one of the rarest of those gems he reached for a large rectangular but very thin book bound in red leather the cover was stamped in gold with the words maps of the faerie brendan pulled the book to him and opened the cover this was compiled by a scottish eccentric writing under the name fortingall schiehallionnot his real name you think sniffed cass his real name was robert heredom and somewhere around he published this treatise on the cartography of what he called the faerie realms brendan began leafing through the book pausing now and again to show a page of elaborate drawings of strange landscapes with stranger names displayed on the yellowed pages cass saw tracts of enchanted forests with twisted trees magic fountains and rivers islands of glass and valleys ruled by immortal kingsall of it rendered with the precision and skill of a draughtsman as you can see from the maps he has drawn heredom had an active imagination brendan turned to a page and directed cassandras attention to an odd map unlike any of the others she had seen so far but this map he said this map is different he turned the book so she could see it clearly it was a drawing done all in sepia tones as if to evoke a bit of parchment made from the skin of a goat or sheep the piece was roughly oblong with irregular edges and crease marks a few tiny holes a number of cracks or tearsthe better to make it look as if the artist was actually copying an object from life the surface of the parchment was decorated with a number of fanciful markings spirals and whorls with dots intersecting lines and overlapping circles curious cryptic symbols that looked like primitive petroglyphs of the kind found on rocks in deserts or letters from an imaginary alphabet or stylised monograms from names in languages that never existed how very strange murmured cass maps to imaginary places the map before youhe brushed the page lightly with his fingertips this map is different it is a record of what must be one of the most remarkable discoveries in the history of the human race cassandra lowered her head and peered at the drawing more closely concentrating her attention on the arcane hieroglyphics she had seen such things before scratched or painted on rock walls by longextinct tribes the world over and like all the rest the symbols meant nothing to her parchment is it it is that confirmed the irishman but of a very rare and special kind what you are looking at is a drawing of the map arthur flinderspetrie kept to record his more significant discoveriesdiscoveries that he inscribed on his own skin theyre tattoos concluded cass that is exactly what they are when arthur died his skin was removed and made into parchment in order to preserve the map that the record of his discoveries should not be lost we call it the skin map and it is of central importance to the work of the society those symbols hide wonders for example somewhere on that map is the well of souls brendan glanced up i see you are not familiar with the legend not as such cass confessed it is a myth that finds expression in many cultures one of the most common is an arab belief associated with the dome of the rock in jerusalem the spirit well is known as a place of limbo where the souls of the dead await judgement day or maybe the chance to be reborn but the myth is far older than thatin fact it seems to be as old as the human race itself almost every culture has a similar talethe fountain of youth the elixir of eternal life the philosophers stone all variations on a theme you might saythe myth of the spirit well many other sources indicate that the well is located in the original paradise eden cassandras mind leapt ahead to the conclusion you believe that arthur found this spirit well and that this has something to do with manipulating time selecting the future changing the past and all thatis that what youre telling me we cannot prove it confessed brendan but some of our members have reason to believe that arthur discovered it and recorded its location on his map and this cass said indicating the open pages of the book before her you think this is a drawing of that map i do yes brendan pursed his lips in a frown as he contemplated the image on the page alas it is not a reliable copy of the original mapmerely an artists conception no doubt based on a verbal description of the mapperhaps someone who had seen it described it to heredom who made the drawing unfortunately heredom doesnt say but inadequate as the drawing may be it nonetheless serves to authenticate the original provenance of the map forgive me brendan objected cass lightly but who is to say this artists rendition isnt itself simply based on pure fantasylike all the other fairytale maps in this book is that not a more likely explanation the thin irishman smiled i shall very much enjoy working with you cassandra your scientific instincts serve you well cass brushed aside the assertion that they would be working together so far as she was concerned nothing was decided yet the simplest explanation is the most likely to be true in this case the simplest explanation is that schiehallion the fantasist merely dreamed up the mapin the same way he dreamed up all the others and you would be right of course if not for the fact that we have independent corroborating evidence that confirms the existence of the map i can assure you that it is much as you see it here he took a last look at the picture then closed the book and returned it to its place i have seen it with my own eyes you have the original skin map a piece of it yes he frowned unfortunately it has been stolen we are working to get it back missing evidence is no evidence at all thought cass and once again felt the worm of suspicion squirm in her gut yet here she was in damascus about eighty years out of joint and with no rational way to account for it i dont suppose you have anything else you could show me to convince you he laid particular stress on the word isnt that what you mean well if you put it that waywhat have you got to convince me one might be forgiven for thinking that your experiences up to now should have taken you a fair distance towards conviction he turned and gestured towards the door after you cass felt the mild reproach of his words as she moved towards the door do you travel brendan ley travel sadly no it is not for me brendan followed her out and locked the genizah again but like it or not cassandra you have become a traveller you have traversed the hidden dimensions of a universe far more vast and varied than present science imaginesalthough some enlightened thinkerslike einstein or neils bohr for instanceare beginning to theorise about it and describe it in ways that are strikingly close to our conception of the way things are brendan allowed these words to sink in a moment then said we are on the cusp of a monumental discovery i can feel it he paused on the landing and turned before starting down the stairs i have no doubt that we will do great things together assuming i agree to join you cass stated flatly i still have a choice you know oh of course you have a choice you can join us or not as you wish but ultimately knowing what you know i believe you will find it comes down to a choice between accepting your destiny or forever denying it either way you will choose and either way you will move forward because you see there is no turning back chapter in which astral dislocation finds explication snipe put down that toad shouted douglas flinderspetrie did you hear me the paleskinned youth paused in his experiments he glanced around at his master storming towards him across the stable yard and whipped the bloody knife out of sight stop torturing that creature and come here it is time to go with grudging reluctance snipe dropped the wounded toad and stood still hiding the knife he wiped the blade on his trousers come with me douglas started away snipe waited until his masters back was turned then stamped on the struggling animal and ground it beneath his heel now called douglas weve got work to do mouthing incoherent curses the truculent servant fell into step behind his master fists clenched at his sides weve got to cut your hair get you washed up and dressed douglas told him and weve got to get to the ley by sundown if we are to have any chance of meeting up with brother bacon tonight having established himself in the guise of a visiting monastic scholar from ireland douglas now felt free to come and go as he pleased on the streets of medieval oxford in the past six months he had consulted the learned professor twice on matters related to deciphering the mysterious text of a book he had stolen from the british museuman arcane little volume written in the form of an alphabet of intricate symbols which the monkish professor euphemistically termed the language of angels brother bacon had yet to admit to composing the manuscript but did allow that he had copied the text from another source douglas suspected the scholar was being overly modest if not disingenuous no doubt to protect himself from tooclose scrutiny by nosy church authorities who tended to see heretics under every bush the tome handwritten on fine vellum bore the intriguing title inconssensus arcanus which roughly translated as forbidden secrets a book like that would have spelt trouble for its author and no wonder its little pages were dense with closecrabbed inscrutable text detailing all sorts of secretsany one of which would have had the books owner tied to a stake in the marketplace with pitchsoaked kindling bundled around his naked feet if that is anyone had been able to read it roger bacon was no heretic but science and magic were uncomfortably close bedfellows in the thirteenth century douglas knew and so he did not press his prime source on the matter in any event he was more concerned with achieving practical results than arguing metaphysics with a churchbound mystic six months of migraineinducing labour and dogged persistence had paid off and douglas had finished his deciphering work it had not been easy and without the aid of master bacons keypurloined by snipe on their first visit to the scientists sanctumit would have been impossible he was now ready to test the accuracy of his work to that end the journey he planned now was to confirm all that he had learned about reading the code and how it applied to the symbols on the skin map as to the latter he was certain bacon knew more about interdimensional travel than he let on there were tantalising references scattered throughout the book and douglas already well versed in the subject was not slow to pick up the hints most of the text was devoted to a discussion of an abstruse philosophy of which douglas could make neither head nor tail but somehow embraced what the writer referred to as astralis dislocationem the treasure buried in pages of this obscure volume was a table delineating the symbology of the coded language itself a key of sorts showing how to interpret the symbols as they related to this socalled astral dislocation douglas pulled on his monastic robe and cowl and passed a critical eye over snipe who was now dressed as a lay brotheras far perhaps from angelic as the founders of the cistercian order could have reasonably anticipated but shorn of his pale wiry hair his oval face scrubbed pink he could pass for a being somewhat less diabolical than was his natural bent tighten your cincture douglas instructed and tie up your sandals muttering snipe obeyed douglas satisfied that they were ready locked the room and departed for the ley as it was a damp night in late autumn the streets would be dark and he hoped fairly deserted the weather was cold and a misty fog had seeped into town from the river so it was hoped that they could make the leap without drawing unwanted attention monks suddenly appearing or disappearing in plain sight tended to have a disconcerting effect on the citizenry the uninitiated were apt to make much of the eventeven in a city as sophisticated as nineteenthcentury oxford the less dramatic douglas could make their clandestine comings and goings the better they entered queen street from their rooms at the mitre and walked with purpose into the gloaming look for the mark instructed douglas it should be right about his gaze swept the pavement for the chalk mark he had placed earlier in the day there it is he reached around behind him your hand snipe the surly servant slipped his hand into his masters ready step lively on three douglas strode out one he took a step two and another three he felt his feet leave the ground and then the always slightly unnerving sensation of weightlessness and fallingbut only for a stepfollowed by the familiar jolt in his leg bones as the ground became solid beneath him once more the mist cleared and he saw directly ahead the same street as before only this time it was paved with cobbles and instead of traffic lights there were logburning iron braziers set up at the crossroads the streets of medieval oxford were patrolled by pikewielding bailiffs who could be expected to challenge strangers but douglas did not see any around he heard a retching sound behind him and glanced back to see snipe bent over with his hands on his knees when youre ready he sighed impatiently while he was waiting he heard the clock in saint martins ring it must be compline douglas mused aloud come on snipe wipe your mouth and be quick he started towards the crossroads and turned south onto the abbingdon road leading to the river and the bridge upon which stood the old defensive towera halfruined structure now known as friar bacons study or by those of a less charitable disposition as bacons folly the two walked along the road their sandals slapping the damp stones douglas wondered what day it was or even what month guesswork told him it could be any time between late november and midjanuary the light from the crossroad beacons faded and they walked in darkness until reaching the bridge where another set of braziers was set up to illuminate the passage under the tower douglas walked around to the side and climbed the few steps leading to the stout wooden door only to find that it was barred rough boards were nailed across the door frame what the bloody muttered douglas he had expected to find the scholar at work in his study as he invariably was every night snipe took one look at the boardedup entrance and uttered a sharp bark which was his attempt at laughter not funny growled douglas well have to go back into town and see if we can find out whats happened they trudged back up the street and this time were challenged by the bailiff at the crossroads pax vobiscum offered douglas in greeting he raised his hand in the sign of the cross and the town official seeing the gesture and monks habit raised his pike to let them through benedicimus te filius meus douglas pronounced in his best clerical tone and passed salve frater replied the bailiff in rough latin douglas nodded and moved on as the bells for compline had gone he decided to call in at saint martins and see if he might speak to one of the senior clerics with a muttered warning to snipe to be on his best behaviour the two slipped into the church quietly to stand at the back of the simple sanctuary a group of monks in white robes with black scapulas was standing below the altar at the front chanting the last prayer of the day they soon finished and began shuffling out some of them yawning others talking in low voices douglas identified one he thought he recognised from a previous visit and stepping out from the shadows said my apologies for interrupting brother the latin felt odd on his tongue but he remembered to dip his head in a slight bow to acknowledge the others seniority brother thomas is it not i was hoping to have a word the monk sent his brothers on ahead stopped and turned to douglas do i know you brother i am brother douglas he said smiling a visitor from tyndyrn ah yesi remember you how can i be of service brother pardon my rude speech douglas said the other gave him a nod of indulgence but as you may recall i have been engaged in scholarly consultation with friar bacona question of language and interpretation yes i have just arrived in the city and was hoping to find him at work in his study at the bridge but brother thomas completed the thought you have discovered that master bacons tower is boarded and barred verily brother i was hoping you might tell me the reason for this the senior monk pursed his lips as he thought how best to frame his reply brother bacon has been placed under arrest and confined to his living quarters douglas raised his eyebrows in surprise can you tell me the reason for his arrest pray permit me a moments consideration replied thomas the monk steepled his fingers and placed them against his lips in thought i can tell you that our brother has been charged with attempting to corrupt the students under his care and has been confined pending the outcome of an investigation into his teachings this is a very serious charge to be sure allowed douglas judiciously through his research he knew master bacon had once been placed under house arrest on flimsy charges of heresybrought it was thought by rivals jealous of his patronage by pope clement iv he had however not been able to find out when this house arrest began now he knew is he allowed visitors the elder monk shook his head slowly and offered a thin smile alas no it is a condition of his arrest that until the charges are tried and proven one way or the other brother bacon is not to see or speak to anyonelest he spread the contagion of his noxious teachings of course replied douglas sensing an underlying hostility in his informant no doubt that is as it should be to be sure the priest drew himself up now if there is nothing further i will wish you a good night he raised his hand in a parting blessing god speed you to your rest and you brother said douglas stepping aside to allow the other to depart the senior cleric joined his fellows who were waiting for him at the church door after the others had gone douglas drew snipe aside we wait here until everyone has gone to bed he said you sleep too i will wake you when it is time part five five smooth stones chapter in which a new recruit is canvassed the soft evening deepened around them as cassandra and her two guides sauntered along the quiet streets of old damascus listening to the sound of distant church bells cassa little dazed and dazzled by all she had heard that daywas in a quiet thoughtful mood from a minaret somewhere the droning sound of the muezzin arose echoing through the nearempty streets calling the faithful to prayer the purple twilight and the sound of the bells and quavering chant suited her perfectly i still dont know why youd want me to join your society she declared finally i have zero experience and know next to nothing of any of this i really dont think i have a single thing to offer my dear said mrs peelstick you have the one thing we need most youth all the rest can be learned the plain truth is that the zetetic society has been active a very long time and regrettably our membership has aged brendan pointed out we may age more slowly than our fellows but age we do the simple truth is that most of us are simply too old to go adventuring anymore it is a fact of life agreed mrs peelstick wistfully we do all get older these days our best and highest use is to recruit new members and provide support for the active questors continued brendan were all of us searching for young blood but its not easy for example we have several members hoping to pass the baton just now but handoffs can be awkward the travel itself can pose difficulties turning to mrs peelstick he added im thinking about cosimo and kit the older woman nodded knowingly then sighed they are in my thoughts constantly we mustnt give up rosemary until we know more we simply cannot allow ourselves to assume the worst youre right of course brendan she offered a sad hopeful smile still her voice died away leaving an uneasy silence cass glanced at brendan but he seemed lost in thought when she could restrain herself no longer she asked excuse me i dont mean to prybut who are cosimo and kit ah replied brendan coming to himself once more cosimo livingstone is one of our questors he has been intent on bringing his greatgrandson into the folda young man named christopher about your age i should think cosimo had tried unsuccessfully to enlist his son and grandson but in kit he had found someone who could carry on his lifes work handing such responsibility from one generation to another can be fraught with difficulty observed mrs peelstick cosimo had high hopes for kit brendan continued and he was preparing the young man to take a full and active part in the society they were to have attended our last convocation again the shadow passed over the two elder members faces they shared an anxious glance we were looking forward to meeting the young man continued mrs peelstick but we seem to have lost contact with cosimo completely it is feared they may have been taken missing in action corrected brendan our last communication with cosimo indicated that he and our dear friend sir henry fayth were on a mission and kit is thought to have been with them this is cause for concern because they are pillars of the society what has become of them is yet to be determined a queasy foreboding formed in the pit of cass stomach taken she asked turning to mrs peelstick she said you used the word taken just nowwhat does that mean i was speaking out of turn brendan stopped walking and looked around the dusky sky had faded to inky blue deepening the shadows on the street they were standing outside the gate of a tiny church a sign in english beside the gate read chaldean christian church shall we go in you deserve a full explanation and it will be best absorbed sitting down he opened the gate and they crossed the courtyard to the door of the church and stepped in the interior was dark and quiet the air fragrant with spent incense the only light came from candles which burned at stands set up beneath particular icons around the sanctuary to cass it felt like entering a cave or perhaps a womb an altar with a simple golden cross flanked by two enormous beeswax candles stood at the far end of the chancel the short pews were empty neither priests nor worshippers were to be seen i come here sometimes to think explained brendan it is a safe place and we wont be disturbed have a seat he ushered cass to a pew mrs peelstick continued towards the front of the sanctuary she paused genuflected towards the altar and then moved to a little stand set off to one side taking a candle from a bundle she lit it from one of the candles already burning and placed it in the holder with the others she bowed her head then crossed herself and returned to where cass and brendan were sitting cass remained silent letting the peaceful atmosphere wash over her after a moment mrs peelstick said go on brendan where to startthat is the question he frowned and gazed down at his clasped hands silly man sniffed mrs peelstick youre frightening the poor girl with your theatrics if you wont tell her outright then i will brendan nodded it comes to thisthere are forces that do not care to see our quest succeed they are against us and try to thwart us whenever and wherever they can they pose an extremely potent threat and a very real danger to life and limb she concluded with a grim smile there that wasnt so bad was it cass considered this you used the word forces just now you mean people human agents yes replied brendan rousing himself once more but spiritual agents as well lest we forget as our guide saint paul put it for ours is not a conflict with mere flesh and blood but with the despotisms the empires the forces that control and govern this dark worldthe spiritual hosts of evil arrayed against us in the heavenly warfare now you are scaring her chided mrs peelstick honestly do we sugarcoat it or tell it plain replied brendan turning once more to cass he said on the human level our principal adversary is a man who goes by the name of archelaeus burleigh he has in his hire several low thugs of varying intelligence none to match their leader in cunning and ability he is a clever and resourceful enemy and also it must be said completely ruthless added mrs peelstick i have little doubt he is behind the disappearance of cosimo and sir henryassuming they have come to harm and the spiritual forces you mentioned the same as have always sought to wreak havoc on humanity and obstruct gods good purposes in the world she replied in a soft voice as if reluctant to speak aloud ancient enemies they may be but we must never underestimate them on that account brendan pointed out they do not grow weak and toothless in old age rather they are particularly active in our special sphere of interest he saw cass uncertain expression do you doubt this not at all she answered with more conviction than she intended i was just wondering why these spiritual forces you mention might have any special interest in what youre doing brendan glanced around the church it is well we are talking about this here he said lowering his voice a church is the one place they cannot eavesdrop so to speak on our thoughts and prayers our plans and intentions remember that it could prove helpful to you one day as to why they take a special interest said mrs peelstick we believe it must be that we are probing very close to a very great spiritual breakthrough and they know that their time is running out the transformation of the universe we talked about earlieris that what you mean indeed whatever form it takes the fact is that opposition to our efforts has intensified out of all proportion to our somewhat meagre resources the array of weapons against us is formidable this leads us to believe that the quest so long and ardently pursued is nearing a critical stage the omega point you talked about said cass brendan nodded and if you fail brendan spread his hands the world will slide back into the chaos that you see rampant around us alreadywars and rumours of wars nation against nation brother at the throat of brother economic instability with the rich growing ever richer and the poor suffering on a scale heretofore unimagined but it will intensify the universe will continue on its long slow decline so concluded cass almighty god is not strong enough alone to bring about his purpose for the universe he needs you and your society to make it happen otherwise it has all been for nothing is that what youre saying brendan only smiled your cynicism is a wellhoned tool im not cynical countered cass maybe a little sceptical but believe it or not i want to understand i really do ive experienced something that two days ago i would have said was impossible and now here i am bouncing between arizona and this she gave a sweep of her arm to take in not only the ancient building in which they sat but the old quarter and city beyond so cut me some slack okay i want to believe but youre not making it easy brendan regarded her quietly mrs peelstick leaned nearer and said it is true that as a society we may be small and insignificant weak in the face of a monstrous and powerful opposition dwarfed by the towering magnitude of the task before us but you know god has always worked through the small the insignificant the powerlessit seems to be sewn into the very fabric of the universe if you consider it for a moment suggested the elderly woman you will see that it has only ever been that way over and over again we see that when anyone willingly gives whatever resources they have to himwhether it is nothing more than five smooth stones gathered from a dry streambed or five little loaves of bread and two dried spratsthen gods greater purpose can proceed small and insignificant undoubtedly but on the day of decision everything depended on those five smooth stoneswith them david killed goliath and saved a nation five loaves of bread became a banquet for five thousand hungry people cass said thoughtfully remembering the bible story nodding towards the front of the sanctuary where a wooden cross stood on the altar mrs peelstick concluded and one poor wandering country preacherhomeless penniless friendless and despised by all but a handful of noaccount fishermen and a few womengave himself so fully to god that the combined might of the two most powerful forces in his worldthe roman empire and the religious authoritiescould not stop him they crushed him and killed him murmured cass gazing at the empty cross on the altar and look what happened yes agreed mrs peelstick softly they killed him and look what happened chapter in which the moment of decision arrives cass gazed at the simple wooden cross pondering the depths of this sacred mystery five smooth stones gathered from a dry streambed changed the course of history a nation was saved and that other ladgiven a lunch of five small loaves and a couple of dried fish and packed off to hear the wandering rabbi preach before the day was half through he would provide the substance for a miracle he had been asked to give the little he had and in the hands of the master it became a feast for thousands did that boy suspect that would happen nohow could he all he knew was that he had been asked to choose which side he would servejust as cass was being asked now what do you say cassandra asked brendan at last we have told you about our work and how you can help it is time to make a decision will you join us despite all the outlandish claims and untethered assumptions all the convoluted and eccentric propositions she had heard throughout the day cass did feel drawn to the quest somewhere in the core of her being she knew that what she had been told was true still she hesitated joining them meant leaving behind everything she had ever knownher life her work her place in the world not to mention her father the thought of her father waiting for her back in arizonafrantic over her disappearancepulled her back to reality i cant she sighed at last i cant sign up to anything i dont fully understand besides that i have commitments elsewhere my father for onehe must be beside himself with worry wondering what happened to me if i told you that you could return to the place you left within a day or so of the time you left offered brendan would that make a difference he saw cass hesitate and pressed her further it is true travellers have been known to spend years away from home only to return within a few daysor even a few hoursof their departure well i you could join us and still alleviate your fathers worries perhaps if we dont badger the poor girl interrupted mrs peelstick she is intelligent reasonable and capable of making up her own mind to cass she said we will respect your decision my dear and consider that it was simply not to be we will of course help you get home again thank you murmured cass youve been more than kind the old woman turned and closing her eyes drew in a deep breath of the frankincenseladen air it is nice here isnt it so peaceful it is truly a shelter from the storms that rage across the world the three sat for a while soaking in the serenity of the ancient church then brendan stood and made his way out mrs peelstick followed stepping into the aisle she genuflected towards the cross and then paused to wait for cass they met brendan outside and the three walked slowly back to the convent the gate was closed but unlocked cass wished them good night and entered the silent courtyard halfway across to the dormitory building she shivered with a sudden chill paused and glanced around the courtyardstill and empty as before crickets chirped in the far corner and the scent of jasmine drifted on the night air all seemed well shaking off the chill she hurried on pulled open the door and shut it firmly behind her the corridor was dark save for a single candle burning in a red glass jar on the table outside her room she moved to the door and slipped inside taking the light with her she undressed quickly and climbed into bed but had difficulty falling asleep for a long time she thrashed about unable to make herself comfortable when sleep finally came it was troubled with odd incoherent and unsettling dreams towards morning cass experienced a dream that was more lucid than usual in it she saw herself as a little girl standing on a ledge of red sedona sandstone looking out across the desert wasteland in her dream she gazed far beyond earths atmosphere and into space beyond the moon to the very edge of the solar system itself and an endless heaven filled with stars and a multitude of galaxies all wheeling in harmony with the slow elegant rhythm of creation the magnificent extravagance of the display stole her breath away she sensed that her father was there and when she turned she saw him dressed in a black suit with his eye pressed to the lens of an enormous telescope i want to see she said in her dream she heard her father reply it is not for you she turned away and this time saw a wall of darkness at the distant edge of the cosmic horizon far beyond the spiral arm of the milky way somehow she understood that this was not the darkness of deep space but was instead an active and invasive darkness expanding and growing beyond the galactic boundaries cass watched as this alien darkness began to seep into the cosmos and swallow the nearer stars and galaxies growing expanding gathering strength and speed the darkness surged and with its increase came an unmistakable feeling of malevolenceas if the darkness were driven not by a mindless force of nature but by a burning hatred as vast and limitless as its galactic reach on and on it came devouring everything in its path growing expanding with every speck and morsel of light it swallowed the childlike sense of wonder cass had felt only moments before was obliterated by blind icy panic as the manifold lights of heaven dimmed faded and died annihilated by the insatiable darkness and still it came faster and faster gaining strength and speed as it gathered mass from all the ingested star systems now darkness filled her vision stretching from one end of the solar system to the other now the nearer stars blinked out now the sun grew cloudy as if covered by a shroud its light dimming and dimming until it was gone leaving only the moon then that too faded dimmed and was gone all that was left was darkness made visible cass looked into the gnawing void and her heart shrank within her breast she heard a howla disembodied shattering shriek of triumphas the darkness swooped to consume the earth and all living things death extinction the annihilation of the entire biosphere and everything in it followed with stunning swiftness cass felt an inexhaustible fathomless cold as the last light of life disappeared into the merciless abyss she woke up shivering beneath her blankets and aching with a sadness akin to grief her heart still racing drummed in her ears she glanced around the room terrified her breath coming in gasps never had she been so frightened dragging together the tattered shreds of her courage cass rose threw on her clothes and dashed across the convent courtyard to the nuns chapel she let herself in and hurried down the aisle to the front of the sanctuary she lit a candle at the little stand and then sat in the front pew candle clasped tight in her hands prayingfor peace protection she knew not whatuntil it grew light enough outside to see then leaving the church she crept out of the convent gate the empty street soon echoed to the sound of her running feet as she raced back to the zetetic society door standing on the step cass pressed the doorbell waited ten seconds and pressed it again the sky was showing a rosy hue as the sun lit up the heavens the streets of the city were quiet yet from somewhere a rooster crowed she was on the point of pressing the bell again when she heard muffled footsteps in the vestibule beyond there was a click and the door opened to reveal mrs peelstick in a lavender dressing gown you must be very keen to get home im not going home cass blurted im staying the old woman observed her for a moment something has happened to change your mind hasnt it dear as cass drew breath to answer mrs peelstick raised her hand no dont tell me well have some tea and toast first and then when brendan gets here we can all sit down together and talk about it she ushered cass inside then closed and locked the door behind her it will save repeating is that all right do come along to the kitchen she padded off in her slippers and cass exuding relief from every pore hurried after her chapter in which a debt is paid in candles douglas awoke to the sound of the bells of matins sore from his night in the cramped confines of the confessional cubical he stretched and then peeked out from behind the drape seeing that no worshippers had yet entered the church he quickly roused snipe and both crept away though the sky was light with the coming sunrise the streets of oxford were still steeped in shadow at the crossroads the bailiff was dozing at his post douglas gave him a wide berth all the same once past the guards station the two furtive figures proceeded along cornmarket street to the market square empty save for a bench in front of a butchers stall that was occupied by a sleeping man wrapped in a cloak with his hat over his face on the upper floor of a large house in one of the narrow side streets leading from the square roger bacon friar and professor had his private chambers douglas had marked the place on previous visits and assuming that was where the ecclesiastical authorities were holding the professor douglas reckoned he might be able to reach him the entrance to the lodging house was not locked so douglas and snipe slipped into the tiny vestibule and made their way up the wooden staircase that creaked with every step a single door at the end of the hall gave access to the only room at the top of the house surprisingly there was no lock on the door neither was it chained it like the door to the masters tower study was barred by simple board planks nailed crossways to the doorposts the door itself could be opened to allow food and drink and other necessaries to be passed through a determined captive could easily have escaped but the renowned doctor mirabilis was a captive of conscience no doubt honour held him more securely than iron douglas put his hand to one of the boards and pulled the resistance offered gave him to know that they would require tools if they were to gain entrynot an insurmountable problem but likely to be more noisy than he would prefer waking up people at the crack of dawn would not advance the cause come snipe he whispered turning away ive seen all i need to see outside they found a dry place to hunker down until a more convivial hour later when the town began to stir they crawled from hiding and joined the earlyrising folk douglas bought two savoury pies from a baker and two jars of beer from a brew mistress with a cask in a barrow they ate their pies and drank their ale and watched the square slowly trundle to life as they sat eating there arose a tremendous squawking and honking from the street to the east there appeared three figuresa man and two young girlsherding a flock of longnecked geese the man held a slender staff and the girls each wielded a bendy willow switch expertly keeping the flock together they moved into the square and began setting up a flimsy pen made of wicker hurdles pulled from a stack against a wall while they were about this chore another poulterer likewise set up his pen a little distance away the next arrivals were a farmer and his wife who carried a long pole between them on which a dozen or more live chickens were hung by the feet the two placed the pole on a simple wooden frame that appeared to be set up for this purpose the farmwife then produced a basket of eggs and settled herself on a stool to wait for customers other farmers appearedsome with chickens others with ducks or pigeonsand several folk bearing great billowing sacks of feathers the poultry market douglas mused finishing the last of his beer come snipelets go before i start sneezing douglas rose and returned the wooden jars then went back to the lodging house where master bacon was incarcerated as before no one was around so douglas simply knocked on the door it was opened a few moments later and the long unshaven face of the great scientist peered blearily out douglas was taken aback at the change in the masters appearance stoopshouldered in a filthy robe his flesh slack and pasty the eyes usually so keen with the bright light of an unquenchable intellect were now dull and watery indeed the scholars whole demeanour seemed bowed with a grinding fatigue of care yes he said his voice a creaking rasp was there something master bacon began douglas somewhat uncertainly do i know you indeed sir it is brother douglasfrom the abbey at tyndyrn there was no immediate response so he added we have spoken in the past about your work with a particular manuscript in which we share an interest this last produced a result as a glimmer of recognition lit the face briefly then flickered out once more ah yes i remember you the master replied vaguely god be good to you brother i hope this day finds you well and you brother douglas hesitated then asked are you permitted to receive visitors a faint smile touched the scholars lips strictly speaking no buthe peered beyond his guest into the narrow corridor and landing as you see visitors are not exactly clamouring for my attention it will do no harm to allow an exception i would not like to make trouble for you master or make your present difficulties worse the worst i fear has already happened the most intelligent man in oxford shook his head lightly a brief visit cannot further aggravate my present difficulties i assure you and a visitor is cheer itself to me just now pray speakand let me feast on the sound of a voice not my own as you will master replied douglas turning to snipe he gave a whispered command and the feral boy turned and started away a moment if you will called friar bacon after him he moved aside leaving the door ajar only to reappear a moment later bearing a large crock with a wooden lid if you would do me this kindness he said apologetically my night potit must be emptied and i so loathe tossing it out the window into the street i find the practise barbaric he offered the crock through the lattice of boards blocking his door i do most humbly beg your pardon but of course douglas took the crock and passed it to snipe empty this outside he said and stay at the bottom of the stairs give me a whistle if anyone comes in snipe uttered a low throaty growl of displeasure but took the crock and retreated into the shadows of the staircase they heard the door slam and all grew quiet once more i am indebted to you said roger bacon on the contrary master it is i who am in debt to you and i mean to repay you as best i can you are too kind brother too kind he offered his wan smile once more it is months since i had a visitor i have almost forgotten how to behave i could wish i had some refreshment to offer you but i have only what they bring me one day to the next and that is little enough what was it that you wanted to see me about it is about a manuscript replied douglas putting his hand into his sleeve pouch he withdrew a small scroll of parchment and passed it through the wooden bars friar bacon slipped off the binding ribbon and unrolled the scroll holding it before his face my eyes have been giving me difficulty of late he explained as he read these rooms are so dim and i never can get enough candles he scanned the scroll more closely yes he said his voice quickening i remember this you are the scholar from tyndyrn did you write this he shook the parchment in his hand i once made a simulacrum of this i believe yes master that is so confirmed douglas i cannot think what happened to it we discussed the origin of the text and you most generously provided a translation douglass offered quickly skating over the fact that he had ordered snipe to steal the professors notes to aid his deciphering work i came to ask you to ascertain if i have rendered the text correctly ah bacon returned to his scrutiny of the manuscript he read his lips moving slightly now and then nodding to himself well well he said looking up at last i think we shall have to begin calling you professor but is it accurate what i have writtenis it correct oh indeed correct in the main and in most particulars most there are a few small errors allowed the master falling naturally into the role of a teacher but considering the difficulty you faced it is a most worthy achievement you are to be congratulated brother thank you replied douglas relief unexpected as it was pleasurable swept through him it was better news than he had hoped to hear but would you mind showing me where i have gone astray not at all he held the scroll up to the makeshift bars of his cell you see this symbolhow it curves to the left what does a leftcurling spiral indicate a retrograde interval answered douglas bacon nodded and the four small points along its length those represent physical way markers to be used for calibrating time just so said bacon he raised a cautionary finger when such marks as these are above the line or on the outer side of a curve they represent way markers as you say yes but the meaning changes when such marks are to be found below the line or on the inner side of the curve the priest smiled what have we here he tapped the symbol in question with a long finger three dots on the inner curve replied douglas and what does this configuration represent douglas stared at the tiny symbol and wracked his brain to remember intersections portals would be more precise i believeconjunctions of several pathwaysa nexus if you will portals sighed douglas in agreement of course as for the rest the orientation and location alignmentsthese are all rendered correctly he rerolled the scroll and passed it back through the barrier of course i would need access to my papers in my tower study before i could offer a definitive judgement on your work but for purposes of discussion i think we can conclude that you have translated the cypher with admirable success it is a most subtle and demanding art but you have plumbed the depths of the mystery set before you i salute you brother my congratulations your praise means more to me than i can say master i hope i do not have to remind you that the knowledge you have gained is to remain the province of your own keeping it is not to be shared by a wider public he regarded douglas with solemn urgency as you can seehe indicated his own predicament with a wave of his handthe authorities do not treat kindly truths that confound their own more limited understandings the stake awaits anyone who ventures too far into realms deemed unacceptable for investigation he paused nodding for emphasis do i make myself clear completely douglas assured him i hasten to assure you that no one shall hear of our inquiry from me i intend to guard the secret most jealously indeed i have already destroyed all my notes and jottings regarding the phenomenon and its delineation in theory roger bacon offered a sad smile that is for the bestthough one could well wish otherwise one day perhaps the world will be a place where knowledge such as this can be laudednot hidden there was a noise in the stairwell below and a moment later snipes pale moon face rose in the shadows he placed the chamber pot on the landing and made a hurryup gesture before disappearing again someone is coming said douglas he picked up the crock and passed it to the master i will leave you now yes you should go urged bacon my keepers are bringing me bread and water it would be best for both of us if they did not find you here unfortunately i must return to the abbey tonight but is there anything i can get you before i departanything at all the master shook his head my needs are simple and as such are supplied still he added as the thought occurred to him one could wish for a little more parchment say no more replied douglas moving away from the barred door i will see that it is in your hands before i leave and a horn of ink you shall have itand candles too thank you dear friend you are a very saint not at all douglas answered from the staircase it is i who should be thanking you farewell doctor baconuntil we meet again go with god my friend called bacon closing the door once more on the landing below douglas met a robed church official ascending the stairs and behind him a squat fellow carrying a pail in one hand and a pike in the other he could not avoid being seen so he smiled bowed and wished them both a good dayall the while moving towards the door he collected snipe who was hovering about the entrance like a sullen cloud and hurried off across the market square he lingered in town long enough to visit the chandlers and purchase a dozen large candles then went on to procure some parchment and a flask of ink some uncut quills and a new pen knife he arranged for all these things to be taken to master bacons lodgings when the church bells tolled prime come snipe he said we had best make ourselves scarce for a while he struck off down the street in search of an inn where they could wait for the oxford ley to become active and the assault on the skin map to begin in earnest chapter in which priorities are realigned incredible as kits unprecedented appearance seemed to everyone concerned the tale he unfolded for them was more incredible still sitting in the tiny kitchen of the mountaintop observatory kit held his listeners rapt over big bowls of brother lazarus spaghetti puttanesca wilhelminas floury bread and numerous glasses of the abbeys hefty red wine he described life in the stone age as he knew it river city clan and its organisation the order and rhythm of daily existence the flora and fauna the various individuals and their orientation to the clan and to their world their unstinting care support and respect for one another and their extraordinary means of communication wilhelmina leaning on her elbows with chin in hand her dark eyes wide kept up a steady murmuring stream of translation for the priest who shook his head in continual amazement shorn of his matted shaggy locks and shaved clean kit no longer looked like the wild man in a circus sideshow in his clean black cassock he might have passed for one of the abbeys resident monasticsexcept the things he was describing were things no monk had ever put into words story after story each more astounding than the last poured out in a flood of verbal astonishments every now and then brother lazarus would jot down a note for later reference or a question but neither he nor mina wanted to interrupt for fear of missing something amazing they talked long into the night and the next morning after broaching the subject of mounting a return expedition to explore the cave and retrieve the painted symbols from the walls brother lazarus beetled off to consult his superiors meanwhile kit and wilhelmina sat outside the observatory tower on a wooden bench taking in the bright morning sun i found that plaque in the church at santantimo in italy and followed the trail mina explained and it led me here to brother lazarus his real name is giambattista beccaria and he is a traveller like us her voice took on a nononsense tone that is a secret you will take to the gravefor his good as well as for ours no one must know about any of us she lightened again you can trust him kit he is one of us actually hes the one whos responsible for finding you the first time ive always wondered how you managed to pull that off its complicated i figured crossing his arms over his chest he stretched his feet out in front of him leaned his head against the back of the bench closed his eyes and tilted his face to the sun enjoying the warmth have a go okay she agreed turning her eyes to the valley lost in a blue haze of morning mist i dont know about you but my life has ceased to have linear chronology i seem to be here there and everywhere time gets a little fuzzy you got that right affirmed kit his voice hoarse from talking more in the last twelve hours than he had in the previous twelve months combined go on ive been coming to montserrat for a few years now on one early visit i actually arrived and realised that i had returned before the last time i was here from brother lazarus point of view we had not yet had the previous visit she gave a little laugh that was a real mind bender in the end i had to go away again because it was all just too weird kit gave a passable imitation of an enul grunt of agreement anyway it has taught me not to make any assumptions to keep quiet and observe whats going on around me and try to blend in so i dont alarm anyone ive also learned how to calibrate my jumps better i can leave right now go back to prague for a month or two and then come back here and you wont have arrived yet yeah murmured kit but you would know that i was going to arrive eventually right maybe sometimes she clasped her hands and unclasped them i dont always know what im going to remember you just said i found you in egypt right you do remember that dont you kit i have no memory of that at all for methe mina you are talking to right this momentit hasnt happened yet he raised his head opened his eyes and stared at her man that is weird he said after a moment mina you showed up in egypt just in the nick of time to break giles and me out of the tomb you were wearing something like army fatigues and your hair was tied up in a scarfit was light blue you got us out of that terrible crypt where burleigh had locked us and left us to die are you telling me you dont remember any of that i have the scarf but the rest of it she lifted a shoulder in a shrug sorry i dont have any memory of that well what is the last thing you recall i remember going to egypt to meet thomas young and to collect you and giles and the map she said slowly then we all went back to prague and ran into burleigh i sent you to the gorge took giles home and came here thats all but before thatyou dont remember coming to egypt the first time and breaking us out of the tomb sorry kit sat up and put his head in his hands rubbing his temples with his thumbs fearing she had caused an information overload mina put a comforting hand on his neck and massaged it gently but it happened he said his voice falling softly not to me she told him not yet kit nodded trying to penetrate this new mystery listen when were together we occupy the same time frame and the sequence of events is the same for both of us mina suggested but when we are separated we go to different times right so if we meet up again in a third place like we are right now why assume that well meet each other at the exact point where we left off we might be catching one another before or after some arbitrary point in the sequence of events she offered a reassuring pat does that help at all a little kit allowed maybe the silence stretched between them for long moments that seemed like hours cosimo said it wasnt time travel observed kit at last he was always at pains to point that out and i never understood why hed say remember kitthis isnt time travel i remember thinking when it so obviously is time travel why make such a big deal of denying it he looked around at wilhelmina and gave a half smile i think im finally beginning to understand why well it is time travel and it isnt when we make a leap we do travel in time after all but that isnt all we do thats right we leave one reality and enter another that is on a different time streamlike stepping from one merrygoround onto another maybe one merrygoround has not made as many revolutions as the other but everything else is more or less the same he considered this for a moment then said i once asked cosimo whether it was possible for you to meet yourself in another world you know suppose you popped into london and went to your house knocked on the door andtada there you are meeting yourself facetoface could that ever happen what did he say he said he didnt know if it could happen but that it somehow never did kit replied it must be that the same person cannot occupy the same reality in two different bodiessomething like that i went back to london and visited the bakery and my flat i even went around to your place but you werent there it was strange but it didnt occur to me to wonder if i would meet myself there she thought a moment so if i went to a place where there was another wilhelmina i would what she looked at kit i dont know but this idea that once we start jumping around in space and time our lives no longer maintain a linear chronology must be tied up with it somehow brother lazarus is convinced that it all has to do with consciousness mina said if that is true then it might be that you have only one consciousness and it cannot be in two places at the same time so youve been coming here and consulting with lazarus a lot hes the best mina said a trained astronomer with a deep knowledge of cosmology and physicsa huge asset all that plus he understands ley travel i wish i did sighed kit he regarded mina thoughtfully for a moment i wonder when were going to catch up to one another we have to get synchronised at some point dont we i suppose well just have to wait and see her gaze was earnest and sympathetic you endured such hardship i had no idea or i wouldnt have sent you there really its okay i looked for you every dayfor weeks why didnt you just stay put like i told you but i did kit insisted if id waited any longer i would have taken root i went back every day for as long as i could but the line never became active again i waved your little ley lamp around until i was blue in the face but could never raise a signal and here was i thinking youd just got bored and wandered off somewhere mina regarded him with a sympathetic look im really sorry dont be i feel responsible youre not hearing me mina he said force coming once more to his ragged voice i count it a privilege to have had the opportunity to spend time with the clan and to learn what i did id go back there any day he smiled knowingly besides if none of that had happened i never would have discovered the spirit well if it is the spirit well what else could it be there is no such thing as coincidence remember he turned his gaze to the bluemisted valley stretching into the distance far below their mountain perch i used to think that was just something sir henry and cosimo saidone of their little mottos and now now i know different his eyes lost focus as if gazing through a window into a wider more intricate landscape beyond everything happens for a reason you dont have to convince me im a believer kit fell silent for a moment lost in contemplation tell me again how you found the spirit well mina suggested at last kit nodded considering how best to explain i mentioned the bone house remember he began i remember she replied but i cant quite picture what it looks like or exactly what its for think of an igloo made of the skeletons of prehistoric animals a huge mound of intertwined bonesand thatll give you a rough idea the clansmen carried bones from a kill zone to a clearing in the forestits the dead of winter right then enuli told you about him remember well the bone house was made for himso that he could go and sleep in it he called it dreaming time the dreaming time repeated wilhelmina softly no corrected kit not the dreaming time just dreaming time minas face scrunched up in bewilderment what does that mean im not exactly sure but it seemed that enul went to sleep so that he could dream and what he dreamed was time like looking into the future something like that maybe kit allowed with a shrug i got the sense that he somehow entered into the flow of time and was able to manipulate it or create it maybe he saw the future and was able to shape it i dont know he was better at reading my thoughts than i was at reading his anyway he took me down there to sit with him while he did it and while i was there a ley portal opened up it registered on your ley lamp i fell through it and ended up in the most breathtakingly beautiful place ive ever seendefinitely not of this world the bone house created the portal either that or the clansmen built the hut there because they sensed the portal was there just like the mound builders who made black mixen tump concluded mina they knew it was there exactly agreed kit it seems that primitive humans were far more sensitive to earth energies and things like that than we are which is why they marked them suggested wilhelmina thinking of the standing stones wells dolmens mounds crosses cairns and such scattered willynilly across the whole wide world okay so you fell through the floor of the bone house and ended up in this amazing placewhat happened then i walked around a little taking it all in and i came to a pool of lighti dont mean an area of sunlight in a shadowy place i mean an actual pool filled with a sort of liquid lightthink of honey made of light or or words failed him so he shrugged youll just have to see it for yourself to understand i was standing there looking at it when i heard a noise on the other side of the pool once again kits eyes lost focus as he revisited the memory of a miracle then what happened asked mina softly i look up and this man appears and hes carrying the body of a woman his voice took on the reverent quality of one reporting a marvellous dream she was wrapped in a long white robe and had long black hair her skin was sickly pale like grey clay she was obviously dead in his arms he comes up to the pool and without a seconds hesitation he simply strides into the pool with the dead woman and sinks down into the liquid light he keeps walking until they are completely submerged in this syrupy liquid kit shook his head in awe at the memory they seem to be under for a long time but it must have been only a few seconds you know how time stands still but then when he surfaces again the woman is alive wilhelmina gave him a sceptical look are you absolutely certain she was dead you only saw her across the pondhow do you know she was dead mina she was deadstone cold dead you werent there you didnt see her but trust me arthur was carrying a corpse how do you know it was flinderspetrie because kit explained when he came up out of the pool with her and put her down on the grassy bank i saw his chest it was covered with tattoosthe man who is map just like in the tomb painting he was wearing the skin map mina he was the skin map and thats how you guessed the pool was the spirit well thats the first thing that popped into my mind i remember seeing those symbols and thinking thats arthur flinderspetrie at the well of souls he paused it is the spirit well i just know it wilhelmina considered this i wonder you doubt me said kit you think im making this up no no mina countered quickly its just that since we dont know exactly what the well of souls is supposed to be we cant say for certain that is what you saw kit stood come on lets go ill take you there and show you right now this instant why not i can easily find my way back he gazed down on her with an intensity mina had never seen in him what are you waiting for if im right were this close to solving the mystery of the skin map okay okay she said just pause a minute and lets think about this if we have to travel back to the stone age we should have some equipment knocking about in a cave in total darkness is not my idea of fun we should have torches at leastmaybe ropes too and i dont knowa weapon of some sort in case things get sticky sure whatever agreed kit then youll go with me yes and well take brother lazarus with us fine right so as soon as he gets back well start assembling the things we need it will take a bit of time to get everything and anyway if this is as important as we think it is then it is worth doing right kit had to admit that she had a point and in any case there was nothing to be gained by arguing about it so he let it slide theres something i havent told you he said taking his seat again i saw babythe cave lion i saw it in the cave in fact it sort of led me out you followed it mina regarded him askance brave man i didnt know i was following it at the time conceded kit i lost my light and then heard the chink of the chain and moved towards the sound youre sure it was baby positive that chain all the more reason to take a weapon with us mina concluded she thought for a moment then asked these cave paintingsare you sure you can find them again pretty sure why because we can copy the symbols in the cave and test them against those on our piece of the map but we may not need the map anymore kit pointed out i can find the spirit well again without the skin map dont get me wrong mina said im all for it but we dont know that the spirit well is the great treasure cosimo and sir henry were looking for it might be something else something even bigger in any case it wont hurt to spend a few minutes copying the symbols so well stop off on the way and make a copy no problem wilhelmina nodded do you think arthur flinderspetrie was really there he must have been how else did those marks get on the wall of that cave said kit either our old buddy arthur was there and drew them himself or somebody copied them off his skin we still dont know how to read them wilhelmina pointed out true agreed kit but we may not need them anymore they talked a little longer and then wilhelmina went in to make some more coffee she was just pouring the first cups when brother lazarus returned with the news that he had been granted leave to accompany wilhelmina and kit down the mountain to explore the cave how soon can we leave asked mina as soon as we have gathered the necessary supplies and equipment replied the priest wilhelmina translated for kit who observed we dont need all that much equipment how long will it take to gather a few torches some rope and some drawing paper and pencils he thought for a moment then added can brother lazarus get his hands on a camera of any kind we would need a flash too mina and lazarus exchanged a word he says he thinks brother michael at the library might have a camera we can borrow the rest of the equipment shouldnt take more than a couple hours to scrape together what kind of weapon are we looking for kit considered this nothing fancy a hunting riflesomething like that mina spoke to brother lazarus then said we wont be able to get our hands on one of those at the monastery then we can try in the town said kit he stretched and stood its nearly eleven mina told him ive got prayers in an hour and i am in charge of setting out the service books for vespers this evening kit regarded her with a quizzical look what are you saying wilhelmina are you really a nun no she said dismissing the comment with a laugh but i do try to fit in while im here i have duties she rose and faced kit that said i do find the daily office very meaningful i dont like to miss it okay but listen lets take the rest of the day get all the gear together and then set out tomorrow morning after matins and breakfasthows that well if you insist a day of rest wont hurt you she smiled and you can use the time to get to know brother lazarus better fine agreed kit regarding the smiling cleric as you know my spanish and italian are every bit as good as my german well have a ball chapter in which a familial connection is forged the journey to china had proved a trial of patience and endurance schooners however luxuriousand they were rarely thatmight be strong and reliable but they were slow even the swiftest of the new clipper ships took six months or more to reach hong kong from portsmouth and there was no faster way to make the journey at least there was no faster way charles flinderspetrie had ever found grandfather arthur might have discovered a ley line connecting britain to china but if he had that was yet another secret he failed to pass along to anyone the monumental inconvenience of sea travel was one of the main reasons charles had never made the journey and the only reason he was making it now was that cruel necessity had forced him from his beloved london garden now as the humped back of hong kong island slid into view beneath the low clouds hanging over the harbour it was all charles could do to refrain from leaping into the sea and swimming the rest of the way to shore the ship made port a few hours later and by midday charles was picking his slow way up the dusty steeps of wah fu road looking for the house of xianlis sister having shunned the clamour of rickshaw drivers at the harbour for the pleasure of feeling solid ground beneath his feet after so many weeks aboard ship he was enjoying his exotic surroundings as much as the physical exertion was making him sweat at the top of the hill he stopped and looked about him the houses in the neighbourhood were oddly out of placerambling englishstyle wooden bungalows with steep roofs deep eaves and large wraparound porchesbuilt as they were by european businessmen and bureaucrats for families accustomed to suburban sprawl they were painted white with red trim and as a concession to climate and decorum most of the porches and windows were screened with woven bamboo shades he had never met hanali but he had the number of the house and as the widow of a notable government official she was well known when he had caught his breath he continued on entering a wide treelined boulevard where the houses were larger and set back from the road by green lawns strewn with flower beds and ornamental shrubs tended by barefoot gardeners wearing wide straw hats at last he came to an iron post at the end of a winding driveway the post bore a sign with the number fortythree painted in gold he stood for a moment and gazed at the rambling house wondering whether he would find a welcome within there was only one way to find out charles walked up the drive and mounted the steps to the porch there was a bell pull beside the door which he employed once and then again and waited until he heard the quick patter of sandals on the other side of the heavy wooden door it opened to reveal a sprightly young girl with long black hair robed in a plain white shift with simple sea grass slippers on her feet hello said charles with a smile i have come to see hanali is she at home if his words made an impression on the girl she did not show it do you speak english asked charles the girl frowned then turned away abruptly and pattered off leaving the door open charles stood on the threshold gazing into the dark interior of a spacious vestibule lined with standing porcelain pots in green and blue he patted the parcel beneath his shirt and waited in a moment an old woman appeared her dovegrey hair was bound in a topknot beneath which a round face wrinkled as a walnut expressed a mild curiosity at what had fetched up on the doorstep her robe was threadbare and faded and she carried a dusting cloth in one hand taking her for the housekeeper charles replied i have come to see hanali is the lady at home she is at home answered the woman in careful colonial english with a whistling lisp who wishes to see her my name is charles flinderspetrie he said i am the honourable ladys greatnephew nephew wondered the old woman charles offered a reassuring smile my grandmother xianli was her sister he explained she is my greataunt the woman paused to consider this her quick dark eyes wary of this bold gaijin stranger charles grew uncomfortable under this scrutiny does hanali live here he asked finally may i see her as if making up her mind about him the old woman opened the door and stepped aside please come in thank you charles entered the foyer the room was dark a red silk rug carpeted the floor and two potted palms stood at the doorway into the sitting room the old woman gestured toward the second room sit down please she instructed from among the chairs available charles chose a lowseated rattan model with a red silk cushion the old woman remained standing in the doorway studying him as charles settled himself you like tea yes indeed said charles i do like a nice cup of tea the elderly housekeeper nodded and disappeared into the house left alone charles gazed around the room it was light and airy if cluttered with knickknacks of various kinds large and smallthe accumulation no doubt of a life in government service what sort of official hanalis husband had been charles did not knowonly that he had been involved with the british board of trade at some time in the past he wondered why after her husband had died his greataunt had not moved back to macau presently the old woman returned with a porcelain pot and two shallow cups and a plate of sugared almonds on a teak tray you are far from home she said yes i have come a long way to see hanali he replied is she coming soon do you think the woman bunched her wrinkled cheeks yes very soon she placed the tray on a table and began pouring it out she handed charles a cup and then offered the plate of almonds thank you said charles selecting a few of the sweets i am sister of xianli announced the woman taking a seat in the chair opposite my name is hanali she offered a broad gaptoothed smile enjoying her little jest at his expense hello greatnephew charles sat up so quickly he almost spilled his tea oh i am sorry he blurted i took you for the housekeeper she laughed i know little tamling is housekeeper please forgive me she batted away the apology you honour me with your presence nephew charles made a little bow the honour is mine dear aunt did you know my sister indeed i did replied charles remembering when i was a little boy she used to let me feed the chickens on the farm she was always very proper hanali nodded over her tea did she have a happy life yes very happyquiet but happy i think she was a joy to all who met her hanali laughed you would not say that if you knew her when she was young she used to pull my hair and scream like a monkey when we fought she laughed again and we were always fighting i brought you something said charles standing up he fished in the pocket of his jacket and brought out a small parcel wrapped in blue paper i thought you might like this the old woman took the present unwrapped it and opened the box to reveal a jade brooch skillfully carved to resemble a lotus flower oh exclaimed hanali tears came to her eyes do you like it she swallowed hard do you know what this is xianli wore it often i expect it was her favourite piece it was our mothers favourite too explained hanali dabbing at her eyes we were very young when she died and we were very poor we had almost nothing from herbut this brooch and a few other small things father gave it to xianli when she was married then i am glad i could return it to you do you have children a son he is grown now no daughters hanali held out the box give it to him to give to his daughter when the time comes charles shook his head lightly that is a kindly thought but i think it means more to you than it ever will to him i insist you keep it thank you she sighed you make an old woman very happy i have something else for you he said excuse me a moment he turned away and unbuttoned the top three buttons of his shirt to withdraw a cylindrical parcel no bigger than the palm of his hand it was wrapped in fine suede leather and bound with a leather strap of the same material he buttoned his shirt and turned offering the package to his aged relative this is also very precious but for a different reason he said hanali took it and regarded the green suede bundle curiously you may open it he instructed and i will explain the old woman gently closed the box containing the brooch and set it on the table beside her chair her wrinkled fingers worked at the leather lace and in a moment had unwrapped the package to reveal a tightly wound scroll of semitranslucent parchment she gently unrolled the scrap and spread it on her lap her eyes playing over the oddly ornamented surfacea spray of fine blue swirls and lines and tiny dots she lifted the thin papery material and held it up against the light from the window to study the richly patterned design more closely have you seen anything like this before asked charles after a moment these are tattaus she said i have seen them many times as you must surely know for my father was a tattau maker charles nodded and you know that he created many tattoostattaus for my grandfather arthur the old woman held the parchment across her palms that is true he would have come many times to have his tattaus made but i met your grandfather only oncewhen he came to take xianli for his wife after that we never saw them again what you hold is a parchment made from arthurs skin charles explained placing his hand reverently on the map the old womans mouth formed a perfect o of wonder it was made to preserve the marks you see on its surface and it has been in our family for many many years charles went on to tell her how his father benedictthen only a young boyhad tried to secure a copy of the special map when arthur had died unexpectedly while on one of their travels the parchment had been made by wellmeaning priests in order to preserve the map it has been in the family ever since concluded charles it has proven its worth many times over the old woman nodded uncertain what to make of this revelation why do you wish me to have it what you hold in your hands is but one small piece of a larger map i have divided it up into sections and i bring this portion to you for safekeeping why me because you are the only surviving member of my grandmothers family charles replied and because no one will ever think to search for it here he smiled no one knows about you hanali but me she rolled the scroll once more and rewound it in its leather wrap then handed it back to charles i will think about it very well he agreed but made no move to take the map from her whatever you think best you will stay here with me and i will tell cook that tonight we celebrate the good fortune of your arrival she said lightly we will eat together and you will tell me stories of my sisters life in england i would be delighted the old woman rose and crossed the room she lifted a tiny brass bell from a table and rang tamling appeared and the two exchanged a brief word she will take you to the guest room where you can rest from your journey i will have hot water brought to you you are most thoughtful aunt he said taking her hands in his he pressed them and added i knew that coming here was the right thing to do they enjoyed a sumptuous dinner together and while tamling ferried various dishes from the kitchen to the table charles regaled his aged relative with stories remembered from his childhood and other family stories passed down through the years tales of arthurs daring travel exploits his mothers winsome slightly otherworldly ways his and his fathers childhood memories of the farm and country life in rural oxfordshire and much else hanali relished the tales clapping her hands with pleasure from time to time as a particular story unfolded she added her own recollections of her and her sisters childhood growing up in macau the two went to bed that night sated in body and soul charles arose the next morning to a light rain pattering on the roof tiles he dressed and went downstairs to find his greataunt waiting for him in the sitting room she had the leather roll in her lap and was gazing at it intently he greeted her with a kiss and then as she clearly had something on her mind he stood and waited for her to begin i have been thinking she said still gazing at the bundle on her lap i am a very old woman and i will not live many more years you are the very picture of health she raised a hand and cut off his objection no it is true therefore i am not prepared to accept this duty before charles could interrupt she continued however i understand your desire to keep this she hesitated this remnant safe and secure she raised her eyes to charles for the first time i have a proposal to make to you i am eager to hear it i want you to take me to macau she said it is many years since i visited my home and i should like to see it again before i die there is an old family shrine outside the citymy fathers and mothers ashes are there we will visit the shrine and there i think you will find a place to keep thisshe lowered her eyes to the object on her lapin all safety charles considered this for a moment a splendid idea aunt i think you have devised the perfect solution indeed hiding the pieces in tombs and shrines seemed not only appropriate but inspired he stooped near and gave her a kiss on the cheek it would be my pleasure to escort you to macau to visit the family shrine we could also see the old tattoo shop if you would likei know i would then i will make arrangements replied hanali she took the parcel and offered it to him once more we will visit the shrine first and you will place this inside charles made a little bow and accepted the leatherwrapped scroll holding it on the palm of his hand he said that will be a most fitting resting place for this particular piece of family history chapter in which the newest member is feted chairs had been set up in a neat semicircle in the genizah to accommodate the small but select group the centre of the big room had been cleared for the special meeting at which cassandra clarke was to be inducted into the zetetic society becoming its newest and youngest member in point of fact she would become its first new member for over a hundred and twentyfive yearsa detail she would have found astonishing but wholly in keeping with the odd group she was still struggling to embrace it had taken five days damascus time to gather the membership and for them to arrive the last to appear was a bluehaired birdlike geriatric named tess spry as a spring lamb and feisty as a terrier she wasted no time informing cass that she was eightyfour years of age in one world and a hundred and twentynine in her home world how old are you she asked bluntly her voice betraying the remnants of a french accent twentyfive admitted cass the little womans grey eyes narrowed and became piercing in their intensity fascinating she pronounced thats when it usually happens you see when what happens cass had asked this exclaimed tess regarding casss puzzled expression she leaned close and confided enlightenment ma cherie enlightenment true knowledge of the way the world works insight into the nature of reality oh the palegrey eyes grew keen every religious figure in history achieved enlightenment between the ages of twentyfive and thirtyfive that seems to be when human consciousness comes fully into its own and acquires a finer spiritual perception perhaps it simply takes that long to develop in any case its a welldocumented phenomenon look it up sometime i will agreed cass at first opportunity knowledge of the hidden engines of the universe and the spiritual foundation of all that exists she winked most people never tumble to it poor things i find it tremendously exciting dont you i think im beginning to tess grabbed her arm and gave it a squeeze with a bony hand you are in for the time of your life ma cherie youll never look back she laughed as if one could there were others tooeleven in all seven ladies and five gentlemen all of them goldenaged senior citizens who should have been in their dotage yet all of them full of beans and vinegar and fizzing with rare vitality it seemed to be the nature of ley travel that not only did it extend life but those who practised it enjoyed health and vigour beyond any normal expectation mrs peelstick introduced cass to the various members one by one as they arrived for the meeting which would be followed by a gala supper to welcome the new inductee after a pleasant tea in the courtyard brendan called the group to order and everyone trooped up to the genizah to observe the ceremony when the august members had been seated brendan looking dapper in a creamy white suit took his place beside a raised table on which an unlit candle and bible had been placed he welcomed the members and banged his gavel on the table calling the meeting officially to order before we get to this evenings festivities i must ask if there is any new business to be discussed one of the gentlemenwhom cass identified as partonraised his hand i have a question about finance he said oh dickie chided the one called maude you always have a question of finance the financial health of the society is important maude darling i agreewhich is why i have placed my entire portfolio in brendans capable hands she smiled sweetly i have more money than godmore than i will ever need anyway it might as well be put to good use by the society there were murmurs of hear hear and most generous and well done from the other members a full report will appear once ive had a chance to ascertain the value of the williams portfolio brendan continued as will an official thankyou from the society maude batted away the idea like a bothersome fly bosh i do not need a thankyouofficial or otherwisefor something im only too happy to do the society has been my passion for more than half my life and it is only right that i might in some smaller measure give back to the institution that has given so much and meant so much to me again there were affirmations of hear hear and quite right and maudie you are a treasure and the like cass was touched by the simple sentiment of the exchange the old woman gazed around the ring of faces well i didnt mean to get up on my high horse and make a speech but there it is suddenly flustered by the attention she made a shooing motion with her thin hands thats enough lets get on with the reason were all here if there is no more businessbrendan paused and looked around the room then banged his gaveldone we will proceed with the induction of our new member he held out his hand and asked cass to join him before the group as she took her place beside him he smiled and placed a fatherly hand on her shoulder fellow members it gives me the greatest pleasure to introduce to you miss cassandra clarke late of sedona arizona in the united states of america a palaeontologist by training and trade she brings to our gathering a keen mind honed in the rigorous cut and thrust of the academy she brings also a thirst for a more thorough understanding of the universe and its manifold splendours combined with a healthy scepticism in service to an exacting search for truth it made cass feel selfconscious to hear herself described this way accurate though the words were she smoothed the front of the smart blue dress that she and mrs peelstick had bought for the occasion caught herself fidgeting and folded her hands in front of her cassandra brendan continued picking up the bible place your right hand on the holy bible and repeat after me he then led her through a litany of phrases in which she solemnly promised to promote the interests aims and objectives of the society to further the search for knowledge through study and exploration to use such gifts as she was given and that came to her for the good of her human family to offer immediate aid to any of her fellow members in need to provide counsel and contribute to the material welfare of the society and its members to keep herself in perpetual preparedness to further the quest at every opportunity to safeguard all that would be placed upon her and expected of her and finally to fight valiantly against evil in all its insidious forms to the glory of the creator who made andby perpetual loving carecontinually sustains the omniverse and everything that lives moves and has being within it with her palm firmly on the bible cass repeated the phrases mentally agreeing with each one and concluded by saying i cassandra clarke make this vow in good conscience and of my own free will pledging life health and strength to the quest set before me so help me god as she spoke these last words it really did seem as if she had taken on a new and different dimension to her personality indeed to her very soul the feeling was confirmed when brendan handed her an unlit candle and asked her to light it from the larger candle on the table as she held her candle to the flame he said may this light be a symbol of the great light on which you may rely as you make passage through the darkness of ignorance evil and death towards the neverending light of eternity the unlit wick caught and the candle flared to life with a bright yellow flame cassandra turned to face the gathered members once more ladies and gentleman of the zetetic society brendan announced please welcome our newest member cassandra clarke to the accompanying applause he shook her hand and then each of the other members came forward to shake hands and welcome her into the fold then it was overa simple ceremony but satisfactory in every regard cass did feel as if she had joined a band of fellow travellers and friends on whom she could rely in the days ahead a fine meal of syrian delicacies followedflat bread with hummus baba ganoush roast lamb with rice broad beans with tomato and mint fatoush and chicken kabobswhich cass enjoyed but not as much as the company of her fellow diners who all made it a point to approach and offer her special words of wisdom for travelling the leys wear loose clothing and carry a change of underwear gold is the universal currency always have a few sovereigns or krugerands at the ready a swiss army knife with a corkscrew is a lifesaver a nononsense cotton scarf can work wonders sturdy hightopped leather shoes wont let you down secure a broadbrimmed hat and so on each comment was delivered with the best wishes of the giver along with a pledge to help their newest member in any and every way possible cass thanked them all for their good advice later as they were having their coffee out in the courtyard under the stars tess sidled up to her smell the jasmine she said inhaling the sweet heady scent absolutely heavenly its always been one of my favourites cass replied drawing in the perfumeladen night air ever since i was a little girl you seem distracted tess observed has someone said something to upset you no not at all on the contrary replied cass quickly its just she hesitated then confessed i feel a little daunted is all overwhelmed so much has happened all at once and i know so little about any of it i feel like ive got a mountain to get over the old lady regarded her with a sudden intensity then announced im going to adopt you dear heart i hope you dont mind not at all cass replied but do i look like i need adopting not in the least tess answered i do it for purely selfish reasons i am far too old to pursue the quest anymore but i can still be involved in my way i can uphold you in prayer for example prayer is our greatest and most salutary weapon in the eternal battle put in the man called schecter joining them he took a sip of coffee and continued no less than gravity prayer is one of the elemental forces that moves the world we underestimate it at our peril keep your sermons to yourself robert tess told him i saw her first she took cass by the arm come well go where we can speak a little more privately you cannot keep her all to yourself robert called as cass was pulled away we all hope to get to know her better they found chairs in a leafy corner of the courtyard and sat down together robert is right of course but he will pontificate so said tess they settled themselves and tess leaned close are you a believer she asked in her forthright way in prayer wondered cass in godcreator and sustainer of the universe well yesever since i was a little girl cass regarded her elderly companion it was not easy to believe that she was as old as she claimed to be the vitality radiating from her was almost contagious why do you ask because it means there is so much less that one must unlearn she leaned back and a smile spread across her wrinkled face i should knowi was the most obnoxious atheist you ever met in my unenlightened years i positively relished playing the cat among the pigeons with my godfearing acquaintances i thought it great sport to poke holes in their reasoning and rhetoric to point out all the inconsistencies and to ridicule their muddled thinking although so much religious dogma serves only to buttress power and befuddle the masses it really deserves to be ridiculed i mean you hear these socalled revivalists banging on about heaven and hell and what notwhat do any of them reall y know about such things they claim to know what god wants and what he demands bosh she tapped cass on the arm anyone who tells you he knows the mind of god is selling something you can take that to the bank she looked at casss mildly perplexed expression and sat back good gracious mei seem to have gotten rather carried away this is not what i wanted to talk about at all i want to talk about your assignment has brendan mentioned it yet he hasnt said anything about any assignment no well in my day all new members were required to undertake a purposeful projectsomething of material value to the advancement of the society something we need doing he didnt mention anything like that if he did it failed to register maybe it has gone by the wayside the old woman sighed it has been so very long since we had a new member you see perhaps we dont do that anymore she passed her gaze around the courtyard i wonder what has become of cosimo i want to introduce you ive never known him to miss an inductionor a dinner for that matter he is usually the life of the party her voice trailed off cosimo livingstone wondered cass you know him brendan told me about him well i should very much like you to meet him i shall look forward to introducing you personally are you very good friends friends yes and something more her voice took on a wistful note cosimo and i were once engaged to be married cass raised her eyebrows oh it would never have worked out tess continued quickly we had just come off a particularly harrowing journey together exploring one of the leys on cosimos piece of the map we had grown very closeextreme danger can do that to you so take that as a word to the wise her voice quavered slightly taking on a wistful note dear cosimo and i had made all these grand plans and then the silence stretched what happened asked cass at last we came back tess laughed recovering her former good mood that is also much the way of things once we had returned we realised it was all a bit fervid and overwroughtpassion of the moment shipboard romance or what have you it was simply not to be oh i am sorry cass sympathised ive never been in love like that but i can imagine we were very fond of one another still are but i had my life and he had his and that was that marriage would have made us both miserable in the end besides it would probably have meant that i would have had to give up questingwhich in those days it did anywayand i was not about to do that but you did give it up eventually considered cass do you miss it sometimes sighed tess but one gets so old dont you know she gave cass a sad smile i have my memories and i still travel a bitlike coming to these society functions but it is for younger folk to shoulder the burdens now still while there is life and breath i can help and that is what i mean to do through you she reached for cass hand i want you to know that i pledge every resource at my command to aid you in the quest whatever you needmoney advice a soft place to land the expertise gathered from a lifetime of questingit is yours do not hesitate to ask thank you tess that is the best offer ive had in a very long time cass turned it over in her mind for a moment you said cosimo had a piece of the map she continued youve seen it tess nodded slowly seen it yes and held it in my handsa hundred times if once brendan also told me cosimos piece of the map has gone missing has it now that is interesting i had not heard about that she pursed her wrinkled lips i wonder if that is why cosimo isnt herehes out searching for his bit of the skin map not exactly countered cass gently it seems cosimo has disappeared too no the old woman gasped disappeared you say thats what ive been given to understand cass confirmed a man named sir henry is thought to be with himand also someone called kit his greatgrandson i think tess made a sour face oh i dont like that no i dont like that at allnot one little bit something will have to be done she leaned forward and took hold of cass arm finding them is a matter of highest priority the old woman leaned close i see it now this is why you are here pardon said cass i dont follow dear heart you are here for such a time as this someone is needed to find cosimo and kit and someone has been provided me tess gave her a solemn nod and released casss arm there is no such thing as coincidence all that happens to us happens for a reason im happy to help but i must tell you i dont know very much about cosimoor anything else come to that that is easily remedied declared tess cosimo doesnt have a permanent home but he keeps a flat in londona little bolthole where he has a bed and change of clothes and what not he spends a lot of time with sir henry fayth at clarimond house i would try there first brendan can give you the coordinates she stood abruptly wheres brendan got to ah there he is tess declared striding briskly across the courtyard come along there is no time to lose which is how cassandra clarke the newest member of the zetetic society found herself in the hills north of damascus walking along a path between two stones taking her first steps to find cosimo livingstone chapter in which haste makes hideous waste the french doors of charles flinderspetries study were open to the garden and the drapes pulled back to allow the fresh air into a room that had been sealed all winter whilst its occupant was away on his foreign travels those journeys completed charles had returned to a london in the midst of a glorious spring and he revelled in the balmy day outside he could hear a steady snip snip snip as cumberbatchhis caretaker gardener and menialtrimmed the box hedge with his longbladed shears the easy rhythm seemed to give shape to his thoughts as he pored over his ledger the household had functioned reasonably well in his absence but there were gaps and oversights to be reconciled and rectified had he known he would be so long away he might have made better arrangements still his plans had come right in the end and the trifling matter of the accounts was nothing that could not be put right with a visit to the bank and a few letters of apology all things considered he was more than satisfied with the result of his latest and most demanding labours he was ready now to rest and let nature take its course there was a stirring of the drapery but charles fully engrossed in his work thought nothing of it until he heard a brushing step and the creak of wood on the threshold glancing up from his reading he saw a long thin shadow on the persian rug and raised his eyes as the intruder stepped into the room douglas he gasped good heavens son you gave me a start sorry father replied the young man it was not my intention to startle you i daresay charles closed his book and stood what are you doing creeping around the garden anyway why are you here during term im done with oxford father said douglas he crossed to the leather wingback chair across from the desk and slouched into it or perhaps oxford is done with me oh douglas charles returned to his chair behind the desk do not tell me you have been sent down the young man made a sour face i have not been sent down i have left the place we have had this discussion before you must finish your studies must i father he sneered why must i you never did now see here no you see here douglas leapt to his feet and began pacing in front of the desk i have been taking orders from you all my life and i am heartily sick of it im not going back there i dont care what anybody says lower your voice douglas all those petty potentates swaggering about their tiny fiefdomsnothing but stuffed shirts gasbags and idiots the lot of them thats unfair it is a bloody waste of time mind your language in this house charles regarded his wayward son struggling to keep his temper in check what have you done this time boy dont patronise me douglas stalked in front of the desk restless bristling with anger i wont have it you cannot expect to live here as a guest you must have work what do you intend to do i am taking up the quest he replied haughtily after all it is the flinderspetrie stock in trade oh douglas his father sighed weve been over this before we agreed that you would wait until you finished your studies if you abandon them now you will be in no way prepared to meet the challenges you will face i am ready now charles studied him for a long moment you know that is impossible why because you say it is do we have to go into this all again charles said you know how i feel the slender young man stood with his hands at his sides tight as a coiled spring i have come for the map no it is out of the question im not leaving here without it it will do you no good you do not know how to read it ill learn charles gave a mirthless laugh that i heartily doubt he scoffed it is not like reading a road map you know you must know the code then tell me i willand gladlyon the day you finish your studies his father made a dismissive gesture with his hand go back to oxford apply yourself show me you can finish something for once in your life ill show you douglas said lurching for the desk he snatched up the bronze etruscan mask his father used as a paperweight ill show you what i can do the key douglas you may leave now this conversation is over give me the key old man douglas hefted the heavy artefact dangerously i dont know what youre talking about the key to the iron chest he snarled i want the map you think i dont know where you keep it dont be hasty douglas taking the map wont get you anywhere sit down let us talk this out all you ever do is talk im through talking i want the key to the chest douglas eyes bulging his long face red with anger raised his arm to strike put that down shouted charles i warned you father snarled douglas on his smooth forehead a vein throbbed visibly like a purple spear of forked lightning as he swung his arm in a murderous arc douglas charles put up his hands to ward off the attack no the weighty bronze smashed into the elder mans skull blood spouted from the gash that opened on the side of his head douglas no charles moaned he grabbed his head think think what youre doing dont be stupid i cant but the bronze mask landed a crushing blow to charles left temple charles lifted himself from his chair hands shaking he beseeched his son in pitiful tones begging him to stop again and again the brass weight slammed down the hard bone of the skull cracked under three savage blows charles slumped to his knees his eyes rolling up into their sockets showing only white he gave a little groan and toppled slowly to his side a tremor passed through him and he lay still goodbye father muttered douglas dropping the paperweight to the floor beside the body stepping quickly around to the desk he opened the wide centre drawer and removed the ring of keys he knew would be there then turning to the bookcase in the corner of the room he pulled out a row of volumes to reveal an iron strongbox which though it seemed to rest on the shelf was instead secured to the wall he put the first key into the lock and turned the key met with resistance and the second key was much too big so he moved on to the third the lock gave at once and he raised the heavy lid inside the strongbox was a giltedged leather folder tied with a green ribbon douglas snatched up the folder and moved back to the desk as his fingers fumbled with the satin binding he heard a sound in the hallway and there came a knock on the door douglas glanced at once to the body on the floor his mind racing how much could be seen from the doorway what if he were found with the body where could he hide the knock came again followed by a voice mr flinderspetrie sir theres a ragandbone man come to call do you have anything for him it was silas cumberbatch the caretaker send him away douglas growled in gruff imitation of his fathers tone im busy very good sir douglas waited until he heard the footsteps receding then unwilling to further risk being caught with the murdered corpse of his father he tucked the goldedged folder under his coat and moved to the french doors he stepped outside cast a swift glance around to make sure he was unobserved then darted across the lawn to the border hedge and a place he knew behind the holly bush where he used to climb over the garden wall as a lad once over the wall he proceeded down the service alley to the road and hailed a cab to take him to paddington station he bought a ticket and hurried to the platform where the train was waiting found an empty compartment in one of the carriages and let himself in it was only after the train had left the station and was past ealing and heading for slough that douglas removed the leather folder once more setting it on his knee he carefully untied the strip of green ribbon and opened the cover inside was a single piece of paper with a simple handwritten note it read forgive me douglas it is for the best your loving father the skin map was gone epilogue the three travellers hitched a ride down from montserrat abbey in the mail truck that called on the monastery every afternoon upon reaching the village of el bruc at the foot of the mountain they decided it would be prudent to procure a weapon of some description for the onward journey in the end the only thing they could find was a sheathed hunting knife from the little general store on the village square if thats the best we can do so be it concluded kit were wasting time attaching the knife to his belt kit led the other two back to the highway and started off along the verge following the tarmac strip as it wound along the river until after a mile or two they came to the place were kit had been found by the hunters happily there were no guntoting farmers around this time so they crossed the little stone bridge and headed up the rising slope towards the cliffs as they walked kit tried to set the scene it is the stone age more primitive than youve ever imagined no buildings no machines no metal glass or plastic skins not cloth he patted his clothes it is nature in the raw and it is man against the elements that said it is the middle of winter at least it was when i leftand that means there are loads of hungry animals around so well have to make contact with the clan pretty sharpish if we want to avoid getting eaten maybe we should have brought more clothessomething warmer wondered wilhelmina carrying all that extra stuff would only slow us down anyway i think well be okay he told her once weve rejoined the clan we can get some skins and furs and whatever else we need if its really cold we dont need to spend a whole lot of time faffing about we get to the bone house and make the jump to the spirit well brother lazarus said something in german which mina translated for kit he is worried that the primitives will be frightened by usthat they might attack us kit stopped walking and turned to his companions look i cant guarantee anything as ive already said but they never showed a trace of violence in my presence they accepted me straight away which is fairly amazing when you think about it and even if they are a little skittish theyll remember mei was adopted by the clan and youre with me i dont anticipate any problems so everyone just relax and follow my lead okay he looked at each of them in turn okay a few minutes hard slog up the hillside brought them to the mouth of a cave this is the place kit announced he glanced at the sun which had passed midday we may have to wait awhile for the portal to become active they put down their packs and wilhelmina consulted her ley lamp as expected the blue indicator lights were dark nothing she announced but its early yet ill keep an eye on it in the meantime show us this cave of yours brother lazarus opened his pack and handed around the flashlights kit switched his on and off to check it ready asked kit when they had shouldered their packs once more here we go watch your step moving into the mouth of the cave he switched on his torch and stepped into the interior the air was still and tepid with the faintly musty smell of mildew and fungus among a heap of rocks near the entrance kit retrieved his furry shirthidden where he had left it a few days earlier you were wearing that asked wilhelmina with a laugh ill have you know this is the height of fashion kit replied i made it myself youre lucky the hunters didnt shoot you she said kit rolled up the shirt and stuffed it into his pack this way he said and led them into the yawning dark they followed the tunnel deeper into the mountain their lights playing on the rough surface of the walls brother lazarus took a keen scientific interest in the tunnel shape and rock formation pausing now and again to examine a particularly interesting feature they reached the place where the winding passageway straightened out here kit stopped and flashed his torch along the path he identified as containing the ley line he had not previously seen it in such clear light and it appeared different than he remembered in his mind he had pictured the cave ley as a corridor of straight lines and right angles but although the floor of the tunnel was straight and even enough the walls bulged and wobbled along a length whose end was quickly lost in the darkness beyond is this the place asked mina adding her light to his i think so replied kit it seems about right he produced his ley lamp and held it out not so much as a flicker of light emanated from the device does your lamp show anything wilhelmina brought hers out and waved it around still nothing she said what do you want to do now wait i guess said kit the priest who had been examining a large crystalline seam in the wall joined them we have to wait a bit she told him in german the ley isnt active yet no he asked gazing at the object in her hand mina glanced down a faint blue sheen was visible in the tiny openings before she could open her mouth to tell kit the fickle glint faded and died she stared at the gizmo willing it to wake up again come on she whispered glow what are you doing asked kit shh she said watch even as she spoke the row of lights flickered to life kit dug out his ley lamp and held it up the device remained dark there is definitely something here said mina keep watching the indigo gleam deepened strengthening by the second kits ley lamp however remained dead the carapace a cold lump of metal minas ley lamp grew brighter how are you doing that kit asked im not doing anything she said its just that this new lamp is more powerful than the old one upgrades my friend the priest reached out and moved kits hand until the two devices were side by side slowly the lights in kits ley lamp began to glowa wavering gleam that gradually took hold and intensified until it matched the brightness of minas device now thats interesting said kit he glanced at minas face her features bathed in the cool blue glow brother lazarus tapped his temple with a forefinger s ehr interessant he says yes its very interesting mina translated i got that said kit thanks he flicked his flashlight down the passage well this is the place lets go wilhelmina held out her hand to him and lets try to stay together for once shall we good idea kit took her hand and brother lazarus put a hand on her pack and gave kit a nod right said kit forward march he started off with slow measured strides when he judged the others were in step he increased his pace slightly after a few metres he felt a flutter in the air a light exhalation of breeze on his skin as from an unseen vent at the same time he felt the ley lamp in his hand grow warm and the lights burned with a fierce intensity he shoved the device into his pocket and readied himself for the jump it came a few paces later and when it did it was so gentle as to be almost imperceptible the cavern floor shifted under his feet and the air shiveredas if someone had closed a door in another room suddenly he sensed he was standing in a much larger passageway the jump was complete kit slowed and then stopped to look around shining his torch over the grey stone walls the passage opened up a few metres ahead he stepped through the opening and found himself in a large gallery the extent of which his flashlight could not illuminate everyone okay he asked never better replied mina you can let go of my hand now brother lazarus you okay molto bene came the reply the priest lapsing into italian in his excitement gazed around the room shining his torch at a hanging cluster of pale stalactites dripping water like icicles from the roof fantastico we go on said kit theres a side passage up along here somewhere that leads to another chamber thats where the paintings are kit led his little team into the gallery staying close to the wall until they came to a gap where the tunnel branched off the opening was smaller than he remembered i think this is the place he said its a tight squeeze but it opens up a little farther on after you said wilhelmina kit shrugged through the breach and squeezed along the undulating corridor as predicted the channel grew wider by degrees until they could walk without touching either side they came to a sort of anteroom where kit paused i remember this place this is where i heard the clinkyclink sound i thought it was water but it turned out to be the end of babys chain while mina explained this to brother lazarus kit examined the walls with his torchlight the beam swept the uneven surface of the stone causing the dips and bulges to leap into sharp relief the markings are low down on the wall he told them moving farther into the chamber mina and brother lazarus likewise began searching sweeping the walls with their flashlights brother lazarus moved to the other side shining his light a few feet off the floor achtung sie sind hier he called waving them over hes found them said mina hurrying to the place where the priest was kneeling kit joined them and quickly confirmed that sure enough there they werea cluster of enigmatic symbols just as he had seen them on his first visit to the cave am i right or am i right he asked lets check removing her pack wilhelmina opened it and brought out a short cardboard tube from which she extracted a roll of paper which she opened and held up against the nearest symbols several seemed to form an identical match but most while similar were entirely different well he said after a moment what do you think i think you may have hit the jackpot here declared wilhelmina it certainly seems to be the real thing i wonder how they got there arthur himself maybe no way to tell bene bene sighed brother lazarus he put down his pack and extracted a beautifully crafted leica with exaggerated care he removed the lens cap and dusted the lens with a soft cloth then fitted a flash hood he directed mina to train her torch on the nearest symbols took a light reading set the aperture then created a human tripod by turning the camera upside down and bracing the bottom against his forehead as he knelt he refocused the lens and triggered the shutter there was a silky click and the flashbulb popped illuminating the entire chamber with brilliant white light that seared their eyes blinding them and causing large purple dots to obscure their field of vision einen moment he said then fitting another flashbulb he counted off three and snapped another picture each section of the wall was duly photographed and the camera stowed before continuing on the next chamber they visited was larger still and it contained the animals kit had seen i give you the hall of extinct animals he announced shining his torch onto a row of chubby horses below them was a grumpylooking rhinoceros and farther down a bison with forwardswept horns and a young one protected beneath its mothers belly a pair of delicate antelope leapt on the adjacent wall together with a bear on hind legs its claws extended oh wow cried wilhelmina rushing to the wall magnifico chimed brother lazarus with a clap of his hands straordinario it is extraordinary agreed kit they were working on this one when i was here he shined his torch on the woolly mammoth the body of which was now fleshed out in greater detail than when he had last seen it just then his light began to dim uh oh he said giving the flashlight a shake wed better move along we can always come back kit and mina switched off their torches to preserve the batteries and the three hurried on kit led them to the main passage and from there to the outer entrance of the cave pausing briefly a few metres from the opening here we are he said blinking in the relative brightness of the daylight streaming in through the ragged gap out there is nature in the rough it is strictly no frills from here on he told them is everybody still keen to meet the flintstones wilhelmina translated for the priest who nodded his head sole purpose of visit mina replied for both of them right lets do it kit stepped to the outer opening and into the light stay alert and be ready to run at all times kit went first taking a good look around before climbing through the opening wilhelmina came next followed by the priest and all three stood on the sloping escarpment shielding their eyes from sunlight as they took in the scene before them a verdant valley bounded by sheer cliffs of white limestone rising up on every side the trees and shrubs were in full leaf and the air was hazy full of insects and warm it was winter he said raising a hand to the faded greens and ripening golds of early autumn just a couple days ago it was winter a couple of days for you mina reminded him we obviously havent got the time frame calibrated for a proper match seeing the disappointment on his face she added brightly still with any luck were probably not too far off the mark i hope youre right he said in any case well soon find out he started down to the valley floor sliding on the loose scree with a last look around for lurking predators kit started towards the slowflowing river that was now but an oozy trickle at summers end they walked along keeping close to the wall of the gorge picking their way over the rocks now in bright sunlight now in shadow occasionally kit paused to get his bearings recognising various landmarks and bends in the river the sun was dropping behind the towering cliffs by the time they reached the place kit identified as the winter camp of river city clan his heart beat a little faster at the sight and he bounded up the narrow trail leading to the stony ledge where he had last seen enul and the others the ledge was empty now all signs of habitationrecent or otherwisecompletely scoured away all that was left were a few dried leaves and powdery white dust theyre gone he said his voice heavy brother lazarus took a look around then turned and said sie kommen im winter hierher richtig winter wenn sie hier kommen korrigiert yes mina confirmed they only come here in winterthat is correct she turned to kit thats what you said right kit nodded then they might be back at the river camp he thought for a moment thats miles from here and im afraid were going to lose the light much as id like to make contact right now that can wait i think we should press on to the bone house first things first whatever you say captain replied wilhelmina returning to the valley floor he led them along the river to a nearby trail that climbed up the cliffside and out of the gorge this is the way out he said the bone house is up on high ground in the middle of the forest just beyond the canyon rim kit pushed a relentless pace up and out of the gorge and wasted no time making for the place where he had helped the young clansmen erect the shelter made from the skeletal remains of animals he had no difficulty finding the place the crevice where they had gathered the bones was still there as was the wide circular clearing in the woods but the bone house itself was gone and in its place was an enormous yew tree with shaggy brown bark and short needles of deepest green the trees trunk was gigantica half dozen people or more would have been required to link hands to reach around it well concluded kit unhappily needless to say this was not here before he shook his head look at this thing he indicated the great spreading branches dark in the gloaming wood its a thousand years old if its a day mina and brother lazarus gazed at the tree and at the blue patch of sky above the light was fading fast dies ist der ort sind sie sicher asked the priest hes asking if youre sure this is the place translated mina she started pacing off the distance around the massive yew yesi mean i think so replied kit he gazed around the almost perfect circle of the clearing this is it this is where the bone house stood but obviously were way off course it looks like well have to go back and start over maybe not said mina what do you mean check your ley lamp kit he pulled the device from his pocket to see that it was shining with an intense blue light i knew it the ley is here all right that hasnt changed mina completed her circuit of the tree and came to stand beside kit ley lamp in hand they held the two gizmos together the blue lights combined to bathe their faces in a radiant glow s ehr gut murmured brother lazarus taking his place beside them a very good sign agreed mina the ley is here and it is highly active the electromagnetic force of the ley continued to build intensifying to an extent they had never witnessed before the indigo lights pulsed with an everincreasing strength and the ring of yellow lights on wilhelminas ley lamp flashed and blinked with random bursts as if tracing the violent surges of power swirling around them ow cried mina dropping her lamp and clutching her hand what happened said kit whayikes he dropped his device too the heat had suddenly spiked to an unbearable level mina held out her hand the palm was red where the flesh was burned thats never happened before even as she spoke there was a faint sizzling sound threads of white smoke emanated from the little holes in the brass carapace of minas ley lamp followed by a soft pop like that of a cork withdrawn from a bottle instantly the lamp went dark a second later kits lamp fizzled out too and the air carried the distinct whiff of ozone i guess thats that said kit brother lazarus took minas hand and examined the burn we know the ley is hereno doubt about that said kit taking in the yews massive trunk hard as iron and big as a house growing right in the middle of the ley now all we have to do is figure out what to do about this whacking great tree on the road again human beings are made to travel it seems and a lot happens on roads most ancient cultures revered the road as a sacred placethe celts for example considered the junction where two roads crossed a holy place certainly the road is a metaphor for change and transformationoriginating perhaps in tales such as homers odyssey and expressed in modern terms in books like on the road by jack kerouac in hollywood the road is enshrined in a genre all its own the road movie from the larky string of bob hope and bing crosby productions such as the road to rio all the way to thelma and louise and extending even to absurdities like dumb amp dumber the road movie is both a symbol and a celebration of the innate spiritual desire to change to be transformed as physicist werner heisenberg a man who knew something about the elusive nature of reality and its effects on the human spirit put it the human race seems to love nothing more than a long detour the road and its inherent detours dangers and disasters can be a forceful agent of change approaching the outskirts of damascus in the arab spring of i could easily recall the journey of the man who would become known to history as saint paul in the early first century however he was still known as saul and he was on his way from jerusalem with a heart full of hate when he was struck down by a flash of light so powerful it could not be ignored saul fell to the ground and god spoke ironically the purpose of his journey was to destroy the men and women who claimed to belong to the way the name given then to those we now call christians once in damascus saul was led down what the gospel of luke terms the street called straight where blinded humbled and desperate to make sense of what had happened to him the newest convert to the way was eventually taken to the house of a man named ananias while strolling down that famous straight street myself it became clear to me that my early familiarity with the biblical story of pauls dramatic journey on the road must have contributed to if not inspired my use of ley lines as portals between realms of existencean impression enhanced i expect by my surroundings damascus is one of the worlds timeless cities a place where the remnants of successive empires have each left their indelible marksa place where a traveller could easily believe he or she was two thousand years in the past the tale unfolding in the five books of the bright empires series has been growing in my mind for over fifteen years in common with the characters in the tale and by way of research to enable a more accurate atmosphere in the telling i have walked down canyoned alleyways in london strode between parallel ranks of sphinxes in egypt descended into the sunken sacred tufa roads of tuscanythe current name for old etruriaand followed the straight path through the dordogne syria arizona eastern europe and most recently lebanon placing my feet exactly where countless others have placed theirs often over many millennia i can easily imagine emerging at the other end of the passage a different person in a different time this is of course the imperative and the appeal of pilgrimage to change over the course of a journey as the landscape approaches and then disappears the traveller confronts his hopes and fears his questions and doubts and then leaves them behind as he walks it is hoped into a place of enlightenment and welcome walking on the camino de santiago in spain the venerable pilgrim route that begins almost anywhere in europe before finally merging on the french side of the pyrenees to cross over into northern spain i saw and experienced firsthand the power of the pilgrim path at the beginning of the journey many of my fellow pilgrims carried huge rucksacks stacked high and bulging with the necessities of travel with foam cushions and sleeping bags teddy bears tin cups and extra clothing flags and all sorts of bricabrac dangling from their massive backpacks as the trail wound through mountains and hills across arid plains and stretches of wilderness to santiago de compostela and as the days bled into weeks those same overstuffed packs tended to lose their bulk near the top of one particularly challenging mountain a day or two from journeys end i came upon a veritable cairn of tshirts and waterproofs paperback books socks trousers bedrolls andyesthose teddy bears and tin cups labouring up the mountain with my fellow pilgrims one weary foot in front of another it was clear that the sense of adventure with which we had all started out had now turned into something else altogether we were all on the road el camino but some of us were also clearly on the way and the road was growing difficult everything unnecessary had to be jettisoned everything that hindered that held back that weighed down and encumberedit all had to go entering santiago i observed triumphant pilgrims walking or dragging themselves into the city with flaccid packs a few carrying only what they had stood up in that morning a hat a stick a bottle of water stuck in a pocket everything else had been cast aside in order to complete the journey the destination was important to be sure the path was not an aimless wandering through the wilds of spain after all santiago had long gleamed like a city of gold in our imaginations and that image of safety rest and refreshment exerted a mighty pull but it was the journey itself the physical act of going that transformed the pilgrims for if there was to be any transformation in the spiritual orientation of the pilgrims soul that change would take place not on arrival as if by magic but in the long hard work of the way
