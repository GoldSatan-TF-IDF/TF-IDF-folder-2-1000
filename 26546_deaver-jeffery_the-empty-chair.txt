jeffery deaver the empty chair the third book in the lincoln rhyme series for deborah schneider no better agent no better friend from the brain and the brain alone arise our pleasures joys laughter and jests as well as our sorrow pain grief and tears the brain is also the seat of madness and delirium of the fears and terrors which assail by night or day hippocrates i north of the paquo she came here to lay flowers at the place where the boy died and the girl was kidnapped she came here because she was a heavy girl and had a pocked face and not many friends she came because she was expected to she came because she wanted to ungainly and sweating twentysixyearold lydia johansson walked along the dirt shoulder of route where shed parked her honda accord then stepped carefully down the hill to the muddy bank where blackwater canal met the opaque paquenoke river she came here because she thought it was the right thing to do she came even though she was afraid it wasnt long after dawn but this august had been the hottest in years in north carolina and lydia was already sweating through her nurses whites by the time she started toward the clearing on the riverbank surrounded by willows and tupelo gum and broadleafed bay trees she easily found the place she was looking for the yellow police tape was very evident through the haze early morning sounds loons an animal foraging in the thick brush nearby hot wind through sedge and swamp grass lord im scared she thought flashing back vividly on the most gruesome scenes from the stephen king and dean koontz novels she read late at night with her companion a pint of ben jerrys more noises in the brush she hesitated looked around then continued on hey a mans voice said very near lydia gasped and spun around nearly dropped the flowers jesse you scared me sorry jesse corn stood on the other side of a weeping willow near the clearing that was roped off lydia noticed that their eyes were fixed on the same thing a glistening white outline on the ground where the boys bodyd been found surrounding the line indicating billys head was a dark stain that as a nurse she recognized immediately as old blood so thats where it happened she whispered it is yep jesse wiped his forehead and rearranged the floppy hook of blond hair his uniform the beige outfit of the paquenoke county sheriffs department was wrinkled and dusty dark stains of sweat blossomed under his arms he was thirty and boyishly cute how long you been here she asked i dont know since five maybe i saw another car she said up the road is that jim nope ed schaeffer hes on the other side of the river jesse nodded at the flowers thosere pretty after a moment lydia looked down at the daisies in her hand two fortynine at food lion got em last night i knew nothingd be open this early well dells is but they dont sell flowers she wondered why she was rambling she looked around again no idea where mary beth is jesse shook his head not hide nor hair him neither i guess that means him neither jesse looked at his watch then out over the dark water dense reeds and concealing grass the rotting pier lydia didnt like it that a county deputy sporting a large pistol seemed as nervous as she was jesse started up the grassy hill to the highway he paused glanced at the flowers only two ninetynine fortynine food lion thats a bargain the young cop said squinting toward a thick sea of grass he turned back to the hill ill be up by the patrol car lydia johansson walked closer to the crime scene she pictured jesus she pictured angels and she prayed for a few minutes she prayed for the soul of billy stail which had been released from his bloody body on this very spot just yesterday morning she prayed that the sorrow visiting tanners corner would soon be over she prayed for herself too more noise in the brush snapping rustling the day was lighter now but the sun didnt do much to brighten up blackwater landing the river was deep here and fringed with messy black willows and thick trunks of cedar and cypress some living some not and all choked with moss and viny kudzu to the northeast not far was the great dismal swamp and lydia johansson like every girl scout past and present in paquenoke county knew all the legends about that place the lady of the lake the headless trainman but it wasnt those apparitions that bothered her blackwater landing had its own ghost the boy whod kidnapped mary beth mcconnell lydia opened her purse and lit a cigarette with shaking hands felt a bit calmer she strolled along the shore stopped beside a stand of tall grass and cattails which bent in the scorching breeze on top of the hill she heard a car engine start jesse wasnt leaving was he lydia looked toward it alarmed but she saw the car hadnt moved just getting the airconditioning going she supposed when she looked back toward the water she noticed the sedge and cattails and wild rice plants were still bending waving rustling as if someone was there moving closer to the yellow tape staying low to the ground but no no of course that wasnt the case its just the wind she told herself and she reverently set the flowers in the crook of a gnarly black willow not far from the eerie outline of the sprawled body spattered with blood dark as the river water she began praying once more across the paquenoke river from the crime scene deputy ed schaeffer leaned against an oak tree and ignored the earlymorning mosquitoes fluttering near his arms in his shortsleeved uniform shirt he shrank down to a crouch and scanned the floor of the woods again for signs of the boy he had to steady himself against a branch he was dizzy from exhaustion like most of the deputies in the county sheriffs department hed been awake for nearly twentyfour hours searching for mary beth mcconnell and the boy whod kidnapped her but while one by one the others had gone home to shower and eat and get a few hours sleep ed had stayed with the search he was the oldest deputy on the force and the biggest fiftyone years old and two hundred sixtyfour pounds of mostly unuseful weight but fatigue hunger and stiff joints werent going to stop him from continuing to look for the girl the deputy examined the ground again he pushed the transmit button of his radio jesse its me you there go ahead he whispered i got footprints here theyre fresh an hour old tops him you think who elsed it be this time of morning this side of the paquo you were right looks like jesse corn said i didnt believe it at first but you hit this one on the head it had been eds theory that the boy would come back here not because of the clich√© about returning to the scene of the crime but because blackwater landing had always been his stalking ground and whatever kind of trouble hed gotten himself into over the years he always came back here ed looked around fear now replacing exhaustion and discomfort as he gazed at the infinite tangle of leaves and branches surrounding him jesus the deputy thought the boys here someplace he said into his radio the tracks look to be moving toward you but i cant tell for sure he was walking mostly on leaves you keep an eye out im going to see where he was coming from knees creaking ed rose to his feet and as quietly as a big man could followed the boys footsteps back in the direction theyd come farther into the woods away from the river he followed the boys trail about a hundred feet and saw it led to an old hunting blind a gray shack big enough for three or four hunters the gun slots were dark and the place seemed to be deserted okay he thought okay hes probably not in there but still breathing hard ed schaeffer did something he hadnt done in nearly a year and a half unholstered his weapon he gripped the revolver in a sweaty hand and started forward eyes flipping back and forth dizzily between the blind and the ground deciding where best to step to keep his approach silent did the boy have a gun he wondered realizing that he was as exposed as a soldier landing on a bald beachhead he imagined a rifle barrel appearing fast in one of the slots aiming down on him ed felt an ill flush of panic and he sprinted in a crouch the last ten feet to the side of the shack he pressed against the weathered wood as he caught his breath and listened carefully he heard nothing inside but the faint buzzing of insects okay he told himself take a look fast before his courage broke ed rose and looked through a gun slot no one then he squinted at the floor his face broke into a smile at what he saw jesse he called into his radio excitedly go ahead im at a blind maybe a quarter mile north of the river i think the kid spent the night here theres some empty food wrappers and water bottles a roll of duct tape too and guess what i see a map a map yeah looks to be of the area might show us where hes got mary beth what do you think about that but ed schaeffer never found out his fellow deputys reaction to this good piece of police work the womans screaming filled the woods and jesse corns radio went silent lydia johansson stumbled backward and screamed again as the boy leapt from the tall sedge and grabbed her arms with his pinching fingers oh jesus lord please dont hurt me she begged shut up he raged in a whisper looking around jerking movements malice in his eyes he was tall and skinny like most sixteenyearolds in small carolina towns and very strong his skin was red and welty from a runin with poison oak it looked like and he had a sloppy crew cut that looked like hed done it himself i just brought flowers thats all i didnt shhhh he muttered but his long dirty nails dug into her skin painfully and lydia gave another scream angrily he clamped a hand over her mouth she felt him press against her body smelled his sour unwashed odor she twisted her head away youre hurting me she said in a wail just shut up his voice snapped like icecoated branches tapping and flecks of spit dotted her face he shook her furiously as if she were a disobedient dog one of his sneakers slipped off in the struggle but he paid no attention to the loss and pressed his hand over her mouth again until she stopped fighting from the top of the hill jesse corn called lydia where are you shhhhh the boy warned again eyes wide and crazy you scream and youll get hurt bad you understand do you understandhe reached into his pocket and showed her a knife she nodded he pulled her toward the river oh not there please no she thought to her guardian angel dont let him take me there north of the paquo lydia glanced back and saw jesse corn standing by the roadside yards away hand shading his eyes from the low sun surveying the landscape lydia he called the boy pulled her faster jesus christ come on hey jesse cried seeing them at last he started down the hill but they were already at the riverbank where the boyd hidden a small skiff under some reeds and grass he shoved lydia into the boat and pushed off rowing hard to the far side of the river he beached the boat and yanked her out then dragged her into the woods wherere we going she whispered to see mary beth youre going to be with her why lydia whispered sobbing now why me but he said nothing more just clicked his nails together absently and pulled her after him ed came jesse corns urgent transmission oh its a mess hes got lydia i lost him hes whatgasping from exertion ed schaeffer stopped hed started jogging toward the river when hed heard the scream lydia johansson hes got her too shit muttered the heavy deputy who cursed about as frequently as he drew his sidearm whyd he do that hes crazy jesse said thats why hes over the river andll be headed your way okay ed thought for a moment hell probably be coming back here to get the stuff in the blind ill hide inside get him when he comes in he have a gun i couldnt see ed sighed okay well get over here as soon as you can call jim too already did ed released the red transmit button and looked through the brush toward the river there was no sign of the boy and his new victim panting ed ran back to the blind and found the door he kicked it open it swung inward with a crash and ed stepped inside fast crouching in front of the gun slot he was so high on fear and excitement concentrating so hard on what he was going to do when the boy got here that he didnt at first pay any attention to the two or three little blackandyellow dots that zipped in front of his face or to the tickle that began at his neck and worked down his spine but then the tickling became detonations of fiery pain on his shoulders then along his arms and under them oh god he cried gasping leaping up and staring in shock at the dozens of hornets vicious yellow jackets clustering on his skin he brushed at them in a panic and the gesture infuriated the insects even more they stung his wrist his palm his fingertips he screamed the pain was worse than any hed felt worse than the broken leg worse than the time hed picked up the castiron skillet not knowing jean had left the burner on then the inside of the blind grew dim as the cloud of hornets streamed out of the huge gray nest in the corner which had been crushed by the swinging door when he kicked it in easily hundreds of the creatures were attacking him they zipped into his hair seated themselves on his arms in his ears crawled into his shirt and up his pant legs as if they knew that stinging on cloth was futile and sought his skin he raced for the door ripping his shirt off and saw with horror masses of the glossy crescents clinging to his huge belly and chest he gave up trying to brush them off and simply ran mindlessly into the woods jesse jesse jesse he cried but realized his voice was a whisper the stinging on his neck had closed up his throat run he told himself run for the river and he did speeding faster than hed ever run in his life crashing through the forest his legs pumping furiously go keep going he ordered himself dont stop outrun the little bastards think about your wife think about the twins go go go there were fewer wasps now though he could still see thirty or forty of the black dots clinging to his skin the obscene hindquarters bending forward to sting him again ill be at the river in three minutes ill leap into the water theyll drown ill be all right run escape from the pain the pain how can something so small cause so much pain oh it hurts he ran like a racehorse ran like a deer speeding through underbrush that was just a hazy blur in his tearfilled eyes hed but wait wait what was wrong ed schaeffer looked down and realized that he wasnt running at all he wasnt even standing up he was lying on the ground only thirty feet from the blind his legs not sprinting but thrashing uncontrollably his hand groped for his handitalkie and even though his thumb was swollen double from the venom he managed to push the transmit button but then the convulsions that began in his legs moved into his torso and neck and arms and he dropped the radio for a moment he heard jesse corns voice in the speaker and when that stopped he heard the pulsing drone of the wasps which became a tiny thread of sound and finally silence only god could cure him and god wasnt so inclined not that it mattered for lincoln rhyme was a man of science rather than theology and so hed traveled not to lourdes or turin or to some baptist tent outfitted with a manic faith healer but here to this hospital in north carolina in hopes of becoming if not a whole man at least less of a partial one rhyme now steered his motorized storm arrow wheelchair red as a corvette off the ramp of the van in which he his aide and amelia sachs had just driven five hundred miles from manhattan his perfect lips around the controller straw he turned the chair expertly and accelerated up the sidewalk toward the front door of the neurologic research institute at the medical center of the university of north carolina in avery thom retracted the ramp of the glossy black chrysler grand rollx a wheelchairaccessible van put it in a handicapped space rhyme called he gave a chuckle amelia sachs lifted an eyebrow to thom who said good mood take advantage it wont last i heard that rhyme shouted the aide drove off and sachs caught up with rhyme she was on her cell phone on hold with a local carrental company thom would be spending much of the next week in rhymes hospital room and sachs wanted the freedom to keep her own hours maybe do some exploring in the region besides she was a sportscar person not a van person and on principle shunned vehicles whose top speed was two digits sachs had been on hold for five minutes and finally she hung up in frustration i wouldnt mind waiting but the muzak is terrible ill try later she looked at her watch only tenthirty but this heat is too much i mean way too much manhattan is not necessarily the most temperate of locales in august but its much farther north than the tar heel state and when theyd left the city yesterday southbound via the holland tunnel the temperature was in the low seventies and the air was dry as salt rhyme wasnt paying any attention to the heat his mind was solely on his mission here ahead of them the automated door swung open obediently this would be he assumed the tiffanys of handicappedaccessible facilities and they moved into the cool corridor while sachs asked directions rhyme looked around the main floor he noticed a halfdozen unoccupied wheelchairs clustered together dusty he wondered what had become of the occupants maybe the treatment here had been so successful that theyd discarded the chairs and graduated to walkers and crutches maybe some had grown worse and were confined to beds or motorized chairs maybe some had died this way sachs said nodding up the hall thom joined them at the elevator doublewide door handrails buttons three feet off the floor and a few minutes later they found the suite they sought rhyme wheeled up to the door noticed the handsfree intercom he said a boisterous open sesame and the door swung wide we get that a lot drawled the pert secretary when theyd entered you must be mr rhyme ill tell the doctor youre here dr cheryl weaver was a trim stylish woman in her midforties rhyme noticed immediately that her eyes were quick and her hands as befitted a surgeon seemed strong her nails were polishfree and short she rose from her desk smiled and shook sachs and thoms hands nodded to her patient lincoln doctor rhymes eyes took in the titles of the many books on her shelves then the myriad certificates and diplomas all from good schools and renowned institutions though her credentials were no surprise to him months of research had convinced rhyme that the university medical center in avery was one of the best hospitals in the world its oncology and immunology departments were among the busiest in the country and dr weavers neuro institute set the standard for spinalcord injury research and treatment its good to meet you at last the doctor said under her hand was a threeinchthick manila folder rhymes own the criminalist assumed wondering what the keeper of the file had entered under the prognosis heading encouraging poor hopeless lincoln you and ive had some conversations on the phone but i want to go through the preliminaries again for both our sakes rhyme nodded curtly he was prepared to tolerate some formality though he had little patience for asscovering which is what this was starting to sound like youve read the literature about the institute and you know were starting some trials of a new spinal cord regeneration and reconstruction technique but i have to stress again that this is experimental i understand that most of the quads ive treated know more neurology than a general practitioner and ill bet youre no exception know something about science rhyme said dismissively know something about medicine and he offered her an example of his trademark shrug a gesture dr weaver seemed to notice and file away she continued well forgive me if i repeat what you already know but its important for you to understand what this technique can do and what it cant do please rhyme said go on our approach at the institute here is an allout assault on the site of the injury we use traditional decompression surgery to reconstruct the bony structure of the vertebrae themselves and to protect the site where your injury occurred then we graft two things into the site of the injury one is some of the patients own peripheral nervous system tissue and the other substance we graft is some embryonic central nervous system cells which ah the shark rhyme said thats right blue shark yes lincoln was telling us that sachs said why shark immunologic reasons compatibility with humans also the doctor added laughing its a damn big fish so we can get a lot of embryo material from one why embryo sachs asked its the adult central nervous system that doesnt naturally regenerate rhyme grumbled impatient with the interruption obviously a babys nervous system has to grow exactly then in addition to the decompression surgery and micrografting we do one more thing which is what were so excited about weve developed some new drugs that we think might have a significant effect on improving regeneration sachs asked are there risks rhyme glanced at her hoping to catch her eye he knew the risks hed made his decision he didnt want her interrogating his doctor but sachs attention was wholly on dr weaver rhyme recognized her expression it was how she examined a crime scene photo of course there are risks the drugs themselves arent particularly dangerous but any c quad is going to have lung impairment youre off a ventilator but with the anesthetic theres a chance of respiratory failure then the stress of the procedure could lead to autonomic dysreflexia and resulting severe blood pressure elevation im sure youre familiar with that which in turn could lead to a stroke or a cerebral event theres also a risk of surgical trauma to the site of your initial injury you dont have any cysts now and no shunts but the operation and resulting fluid buildup could increase that pressure and cause additional damage meaning he could get worse sachs said dr weaver nodded and looked down at the file apparently to refresh her memory though she didnt open the folder she looked up you have movement of one lumbrical the ring finger of your left hand and good shoulder and neck muscle control you could lose some or all of that and lose your ability to breathe spontaneously sachs remained perfectly still i see she said finally the words coming out as a taut sigh the doctors eyes were locked on rhymes and you have to weigh these risks in light of what you hope to gain you arent going to be able to walk again if thats what you were hoping for procedures of this sort have had some limited success with spinal cord injuries at the lumbar and thoracic level much lower and much less severe than your injury its had only marginal success with cervical injuries and none at all with a clevel trauma im a gambling man he said quickly sachs gave him a troubled glance because shed know that lincoln rhyme wasnt a gambling man at all he was a scientist who lived his life according to quantifiable documented principles he added simply i want the surgery dr weaver nodded and seemed neither pleased nor displeased about his decision youll need to have several tests that should take several hours the procedures scheduled for the day after tomorrow i have about a thousand forms and questionnaires for you ill be right back with the paperwork sachs rose and followed the doctor out of the room rhyme heard her asking doctor i have a the door clicked shut conspiracy rhyme muttered to thom mutiny in the ranks shes worried about you worried that woman drives a hundred fifty miles an hour and plays gunslinger in the south bronx im getting babyfish cells injected into me you know what im saying rhyme tossed his head impatiently his eyes strayed to a corner of dr weavers office where a spinal cord presumably real rested on a metal stand it seemed far too fragile to support the complicated human life that had once hung upon it the door opened sachs stepped into the office someone entered behind her but it wasnt dr weaver the man was tall trim except for a slight paunch and wearing a county sheriffs tan uniform unsmiling sachs said youve got a visitor seeing rhyme the man took off his smokey the bear hat and nodded his eyes darted not to rhymes body as did most peoples upon meeting him but went immediately to the spine on the stand behind the doctors desk back to the criminalist mr rhyme im jim bell roland bells cousin he told me you were going to be in town and i drove over from tanners corner roland was on the nypd and had worked with rhyme on several cases he was currently a partner of lon sellitto a detective rhyme had known for years roland had given rhyme the names of some of his relatives to call when he was down in north carolina for the operation in case he wanted some visitors jim bell was one of them rhyme recalled looking past the sheriff toward the doorway through which his angel of mercy dr weaver had yet to return the criminalist said absently nice to meet you bell gave a grim smile he said matter of fact sir i dont know youre going to be feeling that way for too long there was a resemblance rhyme could see as he concentrated more acutely on the visitor the same lean physique long hands and thinning hair the same easygoing nature as his cousin roland in new york this bell looked tanner and more rugged probably fished and hunted a lot a stetson would have suited him better than the trooper hat bell took a seat in a chair next to thom we have ourselves a problem mr rhyme call me lincoln please go on sachs said to bell tell him what you told me rhyme glanced coolly at sachs shed met this man three minutes ago and already they were in cahoots together im sheriff of paquenoke county thats about twenty miles east of here we have this situation and i was thinking bout what my cousin told me he cant speak highly enough of you sir rhyme nodded impatiently for him to continue thinking where the hells my doctor how many forms does she have to dig up is she in on the conspiracy too anyway this situation i thought id come over and ask if you could spare us a little time rhyme laughed a sound without a stitch of humor in it im about to have surgery oh i understand that i wouldnt interfere with it for the world im just thinking of a few hours we dont need much help im hoping see cousin rol told me about some of the things youve done in investigations up north we have basic crime lab stuff but most of the forensics work round here goes through elizabeth city the nearest state police hq or raleigh takes weeks to get answers and we dont have weeks we got hours at best for what to find a couple girls got kidnapped kidnappings federal rhyme pointed out call the fbi i cant recall the last time we even had a federal agent in the county other than atf on moonshine warrants by the time the fbi gets down here and sets up those girlsll be goners tell us about what happened sachs said she was wearing her interested face rhyme noted cynically and with displeasure bell said yesterday one of our local high school boys was murdered and a college girl was kidnapped then this morning the perp came back and kidnapped another girl rhyme noticed the mans face darken he set a trap and one of my deputies got hurt bad hes here at the medical center now in a coma rhyme saw that sachs had stopped digging a fingernail into her hair scratching her scalp and was paying rapt attention to bell well perhaps they werent coconspirators but rhyme knew why she was so interested in a case they didnt have the time to participate in and he didnt like the reason one bit amelia he began casting a cool glance at the clock on dr weavers wall why not rhyme what can it hurt she pulled her long red hair off her shoulders where it rested like a still waterfall bell glanced at the spinal cord in the corner once more were a small office sir we did what we could all of my deputies and some other folk too were out all night but fact is we just couldnt find him or mary beth ed the deputy thats in the coma we think he got a look at a map that shows where the boy mightve gone but the doctors dont know when or if hes going to wake up he looked back into rhymes eyes imploringly wed sure be appreciative if you could take a look at the evidence we found and give us any thoughts on where the boy might be headed were outa our depth here im standing in need of some serious help but rhyme didnt understand a criminalists job is to analyze evidence to help investigators identify a suspect and then to testify at his trial you know who the perp is you know where he lives your dall have an airtight case even if theyd screwed up the crimescene search the way smalltown law enforcers have vast potential to do thered be plenty of evidence left for a felony conviction no no its not the trial were worried about mr rhyme its finding them fore he kills those girls or at least lydia we think mary beth may already be dead see when this happened i thumbed through a state police manual on felony investigations it was saying that in a sexual abduction case you usually have twentyfour hours to find the victim after that they become dehumanized in the kidnappers eyes and he doesnt think anything about killing them sachs asked you called him a boy the perp how old is he sixteen juvenile technically bell said but his historys worse than most of our adult troublemakers youve checked with his family she asked as if it were a foregone conclusion that she and rhyme were on the case parentsre dead hes got foster parents we looked through his room at their place didnt find any secret trapdoors or diaries or anything one never does thought lincoln rhyme wishing devoutly this man would hightail it back to his unpronounceable county and take his problems with him i think we should rhyme sachs said sachs the surgery she said two victims in two days he could be a progressive progressive felons are like addicts to satisfy their increasing psychological hunger for violence the frequency and severity of their acts escalate bell nodded you got that right and theres stuff i didnt mention thereve been three other deaths in paquenoke county over the past couple of years and a questionable suicide just a few days ago we think the boy mightve been involved in all of them we just didnt find enough evidence to hold him but then i wasnt working the cases now was i rhyme thought before reflecting that pride was probably the sin that would do him in he reluctantly felt his mental gears turning intrigued by the puzzles that the case presented what had kept lincoln rhyme sane since his accident what had stopped him from finding some jack kevorkian to help with assisted suicide were mental challenges like this your surgerys not till day after tomorrow rhyme sachs pushed and all you have are those tests before then ah your ulterior motives are showing sachs but shed made a good point he was looking at a lot of downtime before the operation itself and it would be presurgery downtime which meant without eighteenyearold scotch what was a quad going to do in a small north carolina town anyway lincoln rhymes greatest enemy wasnt the spasms phantom pain or dysreflexia that plague spinal cord patients it was boredom ill give you one day rhyme finally said as long as it doesnt delay the operation ive been on a waiting list for fourteen months to have this procedure deal sir bell said his weary face brightened but thom shook his head listen lincoln were not here to work were here for your procedure and then were leaving i dont have half the equipment i need to take care of you if youre working were in a hospitalthom i wouldnt be surprised to find most of what you need here well talk to dr weaver im sure shell be happy to help us out the aide resplendent in white shirt pressed tan slacks and tie said for the record i dont think its a good idea but like hunters everywhere mobile or not once lincoln rhyme had made the decision to pursue his prey nothing else mattered he now ignored thom and began to interrogate jim bell how long has he been on the run just a couple hours bell said what ill do is have a deputy bring over the evidence we found and maybe a map of the area i was thinking but bell s voice faded as rhyme shook his head and frowned sachs suppressed a smile shed know what was coming no rhyme said firmly well come to you youll have to set us up someplace in whats the county seat again uhm tanners corner set us up someplace we can work ill need a forensics assistant you have a lab in your office us asked the bewildered sheriff not hardly okay well get you a list of equipment well need you can borrow it from the state police rhyme looked at the clock we can be there in a half hour right thom lincoln right a half hour the resigned aide muttered now who was in a bad mood get the forms from dr weaver bring them with us you can fill them out while sachs and ire working okay okay sachs was writing a list of the basic forensics lab equipment she held it up for rhyme to read he nodded then said add a density gradient unit otherwise it looks good she wrote this item on the list and handed it to bell he read it nodding his head uncertainly ill work this out sure but i really dont want you to go to too much trouble jim hope i can speak freely sure the criminalist said in a low voice just looking over a little evidence isnt going to do any good if this is going to work amelia and i are going to be in charge of the pursuit one hundred percent in charge now you tell me up front is that going to be a problem for anybody ill make sure it isnt bell said good now you better get going on that equipment we need to move and sheriff bell stood for a moment nodding hat in one hand sachs list in the other before he headed for the door rhyme believed that cousin roland a man of many southernisms had an expression that fit the look on the sheriffs face rhyme wasnt exactly sure how the phrase went but it had something to do with catching a bear by the tail oh one thing sachs asked stopping bell as he passed through the doorway he paused and turned the perp whats his name garrett hanlon but in tanners corner they call him the insect boy paquenoke is a small county in northeastern north carolina tanners corner roughly in the center of the county is the biggest town and is surrounded by smaller unincorporated clusters of residential or commercial pockets such as blackwater landing which huddles against the paquenoke river called the paquo by most locals a few miles to the north of the county seat south of the river is where most of the countys residential and shopping areas are located the land there is dotted with gentle marshes forests fields and ponds nearly all of the residents live in this half north of the paquo on the other hand the land is treacherous the great dismal swamp has encroached and swallowed up trailer parks and houses and the few mills and factories on that side of the river snaky bogs have replaced the ponds and fields and the forests largely oldgrowth are impenetrable unless youre lucky enough to find a path no one lives on that side of the river except shiners and drug cookers and a few crazy swamp people even hunters tend to avoid the area after that incident two years ago when wild boars came after tal harper and even shooting half of them didnt stop the rest from devouring him before help arrived like most people in the county lydia johansson rarely went north of the paquo and never very far from civilization when she did she now realized with an overwhelming sense of despair that by crossing the river shed stepped over some boundary into a place from which she might never return a boundary that was not merely geographic but was spiritual too she was terrified being dragged along behind this creature of course terrified at the way he looked over her body terrified of his touch terrified that shed die from heat or sunstroke or snakebite but what scared her the most was realizing what shed left behind on the south side of the river her fragile comfortable life small though it was her few friends and fellow nurses on the hospital ward the doctors she flirted futilely with the pizza parties the seinfeld reruns her horror books ice cream her sisters children she even looked back longingly at the troubled parts of her life the struggle with her weight the fight to quit smoking the nights alone the long absence of phone calls from the man she occasionally saw she called him her boyfriend though she knew that was merely wishful thinking even these now seemed fiercely poignant simply because of their familiarity but there wasnt a sliver of comfort where she was now she remembered the terrible sight at the hunters blind deputy ed schaeffer lying unconscious on the ground arms and face swollen grotesquely from the wasp stings garrett had muttered he shouldntve hurt em yellow jackets only attack when their nests in danger it was his fault hed walked inside slowly the insects ignoring him to collect some things hed taped her hands in front of her and then led her into the woods through which theyd been traveling now for several miles the boy moved in an awkward way jerking her in one direction then another he talked to himself he scratched at the red blotches on his face once he stopped at a pool of water and stared at it he waited until some bug or spider danced away over the surface then pressed his face into the water soaking the troubled skin he looked down at his feet then took off his remaining shoe and flung it away they pushed on through the hot morning she glanced at the map sticking out of his pocket wherere we going she asked shut up okay ten minutes later he made her take her shoes off and they forded a shallow polluted stream when theyd crossed he eased her into a sitting position garrett sat in front of her and as he watched her legs and cleavage he slowly dried her feet with a wad of kleenex he had pulled from his pocket she felt the same repulsion at his touch that had flooded through her the first time she had to take a tissue sample from a corpse in the morgue at the hospital he put her white shoes back on laced them tight holding her calf for longer than he needed to then he consulted the map and led her back into the woods clicking his nails scratching his cheek little by little the marshes grew more tangled and the water darker and deeper she supposed they were headed toward the great dismal swamp though she couldnt imagine why just when it seemed they could go no farther because of the choked bogs garrett steered them into a large pine forest which to lydia s relief was far cooler than the exposed swampland he found another path he led her along it until they came to a steep hill a series of rocks led to the top i cant climb that she said struggling to sound defiant not with my hands taped ill slip bullshit he muttered angrily as if she were an idiot you got those nurse shoes on theyll hold you fine look at me im like barefoot and i can climb it lookit my feet look he held up the bottoms they were callused and yellow now get your ass up there only when you get to the top dont go any farther you hear me hey you listening another hiss a fleck of spittle touched her cheek and seemed to burn her skin like battery acid god i hate you she thought lydia started to climb she paused halfway looked back garrett was watching her closely snapping his fingernails staring at her legs encased in white stockings his tongue teasing his front teeth then looking up higher under her skirt lydia continued to climb heard his hissing breath as he started up behind her at the top of the hill was a clearing and from it a single path led into a thick grove of pine trees she started along the path into the shade hey garrett shouted didnt you hear me i told you not to move im not trying to get away she cried its hot im trying to get out of the sun he pointed to the ground twenty feet away there was a thick blanket of pine boughs in the middle of the path you couldve fallen in his voice rasped you couldve ruined it lydia looked closely the pine needles covered a wide pit whats under there its a deadfall trap whats inside you know a surprise for anybody coming after us he said this proudly smirking as if hed been very clever to think of it but anybody could fall in there shit he muttered this is north of the paquo only ones whod come this wayd be the people after us and they deserve whatever happens to them lets get going hissing again he took her by the wrist and led her around the pit you dont have to hold me so hard she protested garrett glanced at her then relaxed his grip somewhat though his gentler touch proved to be a lot more troubling he took to stroking her wrist with his middle finger which reminded her of a fat blood tick looking for a spot to burrow into her skin the rollx van passed a cemetery tanners corner memorial gardens a funeral was in progress and rhyme sachs and thom glanced at the somber procession look at the casket sachs said it was small a childs the mourners all adults were few twenty or so people rhyme wondered why attendance was so sparse his eyes rose above the ceremony and examined the graveyards rolling hills and beyond the miles of hazy forest and marshland that vanished in the blue distance he said thats not a bad cemetery wouldnt mind being buried in a place like that sachs whod been gazing at the funeral with a troubled expression shifted cool eyes toward him apparently because with surgery on the agenda she didnt like any talk about mortality then thom eased the van around a sharp curve and following jim bells paquenoke county sheriffs department cruiser accelerated down a straightaway the cemetery disappeared behind them as bell had promised tanners corner was twenty miles from the medical center at avery the welcome to sign assured visitors that the town was the home of souls which may have been true but only a tiny percentage of them were evident along main street on this hot august morning the dusty place seemed to be a ghost town one elderly couple sat on a bench looking out over the empty street rhyme spotted two men who mustve been the resident drunks sicklylooking and skinny one sat on the curb his scabby head in his hands probably working off a hangover the other sat against a tree staring at the glossy van with sunken eyes that even from the distance seemed jaundiced a scrawny woman lazily washed the drugstore window rhyme saw no one else peaceful thom observed thats one way to put it said sachs who obviously shared rhymes sense of unease at the emptiness main street was a tired stretch of old buildings and two small strip malls rhyme noticed one supermarket two drugstores two bars one diner a womens clothing boutique an insurance company and a combination video shopcandy storenail salon the aok car dealership was sandwiched between a bank and a marine supplies operation everybody sold bait one billboard was for mcdonalds seven miles away along route another showed a sunbleached painting of the monitor and merrimack civil war ships visit the ironclad museum you had to drive twentytwo miles to see that attraction as rhyme took in all these details of smalltown life he realized with dismay how out of his depth as a criminalist he was here he could successfully analyze evidence in new york because hed lived there for so many years had pulled the city apart walked its streets studied its history and flora and fauna but here in tanners corner and environs he knew nothing of the soil the air the water nothing of the habits of the residents the cars they liked the houses they lived in the industries that employed them the lusts that drove them rhyme recalled working for a senior detective at the nypd when he was a new recruit the man had lectured his underlings somebody tell me whats the expression fish out of water mean young officer rhyme had said it means out of ones element confused yeah well what happens when fishre out of water the grizzled old cop had snapped at rhyme they dont get confusedthey get fucking deadthe greatest single threat to an investigator is unfamiliarity with his environment remember that thom parked the van and went through the ritual of lowering the wheelchair rhyme blew into the sipandpuff controller of the storm arrow and rolled toward the county building s steep ramp undoubtedly added to the building grudgingly after the americans with disabilities act went into effect three men in work clothes and with folding knife scabbards on their belts pushed out of the side door of the sheriffs office beside the ramp they walked toward a burgundy chevy suburban the skinniest of the three poked the biggest one a huge man with a braided ponytail and a beard and nodded toward rhyme then their eyes almost in unison perused sachs body the big one took in thoms trim hair slight build impeccable clothes and golden earring expressionless he whispered something to the third of the trio a man who looked like a conservative southern businessman he shrugged they lost interest in the visitors and climbed into the chevy fish out of water bell walking beside rhymes chair noticed his gaze thats rich culbeau the big one and his buddies sean osarian the skinny feller and harris tomel culbeaus not half as much trouble as he looks he likes playing redneck but hes usually no bother osarian glanced back at them from the passenger seat though whether he was glancing at thom or sachs or himself rhyme didnt know the sheriff jogged ahead to the building he had to fiddle with the door at the top of the handicapped ramp it had been painted shut not many crips here thom observed then he asked rhyme howre you feeling im fine you dont look fine you look pale im taking your blood pressure the minute we get inside they entered the building it was dated circa rhyme estimated painted institutional green the halls were decorated with finger paintings from a gradeschool class photographs of tanners corner throughout its history and a halfdozen employment notices for county workers will this be okay bell asked swinging open a door we use it for evidence storage but were clearing that stuff out and moving it down to the basement a dozen boxes lined the walls one officer struggled to cart a large toshiba tv out of the room another carried two boxes of juice jars filled with a clear liquid rhyme glanced at them bell laughed he said that there just about summarizes your typical tanners corner criminal stealing home electronics and making moonshine thats moonshine sachs asked the real thing aged all of thirty days ocean spray brand rhyme asked wryly looking at the jars shiners favorite container because of the wide neck you a drinking man scotch only stick to that bell nodded at the bottles the officer carried out the door the feds and the carolina tax department worry about their revenue we worry about losing citizens that batch there isnt too bad but a lot of shines laced with formaldehyde or paint thinner or fertilizer we lose a couple people a year to bad batches whys it called moonshine thom asked bell answered cause they used to make it at night in the open under the light of the full moon so they didnt need lanterns and you know wouldnt attract revenuers ah said the young man whose taste rhyme knew ran to st emilions pomerols and white burgundies rhyme examined the room well need more power nodding at the single wall outlet we can run some wires bell said ill get somebody on it he sent a deputy off on this errand then explained that hed called the state police lab at elizabeth city and put in an emergency request for the forensic equipment rhyme wanted the items would be here within the hour rhyme sensed that this was lightningfast for paquenoke county and he felt once more the urgency of the case in a sexual abduction case you usually have twentyfour hours to find the victim after that they become dehumanized in the kidnappers eyes and he doesnt think anything about killing them the deputy returned with two thick electrical cables that had multiple grounded outlets on the ends he taped them to the floor thosell do fine rhyme said then he asked how many people do we have to work the case ive got three senior deputies and eight line deputies weve got a communications staff of two and clerical of five we usually have to share them with planning and zoning and dpw thats been a sore spot for us but causa the kidnapping and you coming here and all well have every one of em we need the county supervisorll support that i talked to him already rhyme gazed up at the wall frowning what is it he needs a chalkboard thom said i was thinking of a map of the area but yes i want a blackboard too a big one done deal bell said rhyme and sachs exchanged smiles this was one of cousin roland bells favorite expressions then if i could see your senior people in here for a briefing and airconditioning thom said it needs to be cooler in here well see what we can do bell said casually a man who probably didnt understand the norths obsession with moderate temperatures the aide said firmly its not good for him to be in heat like this dont worry about it rhyme said thom lifted an eyebrow at bell and said easily we have to cool the room or else im going to take him back to the hotel thom rhyme warned im afraid we dont have any choice the aide said bell said not a problem ill take care of it he walked to the doorway and called steve come on in here a minute a young crewcut man in a deputys uniform walked inside thiss my brotherinlaw steve farr he was the tallest of the deputies theyd seen so far easily sixseven and had round ears that stuck out comically he seemed only mildly uneasy at the initial sight of rhyme and his wide lips soon slipped into an easy smile that suggested both confidence and competence bell gave him the job of finding an airconditioner for the lab ill get right on it jim he tugged at his earlobe turned on his heel like a soldier and vanished into the hall a woman stuck her head in the door jim its sue mcconnell on three shes really beside herself okay ill talk to her tell her ill be right there bell explained to rhyme mary beths mother poor woman lost her husband to cancer just a year ago and now this happens i tell you he added shaking his head ive got a couple of kids myself and i can imagine what shes jim i wonder if we could find that map rhyme interrupted and get the blackboard set up bell blinked uncertainly at this abrupt tone in the criminalists voice sure thing lincoln and hey if we get too southern down here move a little slow for you yankees youll speed us up now wont you oh you bet i will jim one out of three one of jim bells three senior deputies seemed glad to meet rhyme and sachs well to see sachs at least the other two gave formal nods and obviously wished this odd pair had never left the big apple the agreeable one was a blearyeyed thirtyish deputy named jesse corn hed been at the crime scene earlier that morning and with painful guilt admitted that garrett had gotten away with the other victim lydia right in front of him by the time jesse had gotten over the river ed schaeffer was near death from the wasp attack one deputy offering the cool reception was mason germain a short man in his early forties dark eyes graying features posture a little too perfect for a human being his hair was slicked back and showed off rulerstraight teeth marks from the comb he wore excessive aftershave a cheap musky smell he greeted rhyme and sachs with a stiff canny nod and rhyme imagined that he was actually glad the criminalist was disabled so he wouldnt have to shake his hand sachs being a woman was entitled to only a condescending miss lucy kerr was the third senior deputy and she wasnt any happier to see the visitors than mason was she was a tall woman just a bit shorter than willowy sachs trim and athleticlooking with a long pretty face masons uniform was wrinkled and smudged but lucys was perfectly ironed her blond hair was done up in a taut french braid you could easily picture her as a model for ll bean or lands end in boots denim and a down vest rhyme knew that their cold shoulders would be an automatic reaction to interloping cops especially a crip and a woman and northerners no less but he had no interest in winning them over the kidnapper would be harder to find with every passing minute and he had a date with a surgeon he absolutely was not going to miss a solidly built man the only black deputy rhyme had seen wheeled in a large chalkboard and unfolded a map of paquenoke county tape it up there trey bell pointed to the wall rhyme scanned the map it was a good one very detailed rhyme said now tell me exactly what happened start with the first victim mary beth mcconnell bell said shes twentythree a grad student over at the campus at avery go on what happened yesterday mason said well it was pretty early mary beth was could you be more specific rhyme asked about the time well we dont know for certain mason responded coolly werent any stopped clocks like on the titanicyou know had tove been before eight jesse corn offered billy the boy was killed was out jogging and the crime scene is a half hour away from home he was making up some credits in summer school and had to be back by eightthirty to shower and get to class good rhyme thought nodding go on mason continued mary beth had some class project digging up old indian artifacts at blackwater landing whats that a town sachs asked no just an unincorporated area on the river bout threedozen houses a factory no stores or anything mostly woods and swamp rhyme noticed numbers and letters along the margins of the map where he asked show me mason touched location g way we see it garrett comes by and grabs mary beth hes going to rape her but billy stalls out jogging and sees them from the road and tries to stop it but garrett grabs a shovel and kills billy beats his head in then he takes mary beth and disappears masons jaw was tight billy was a good kid really good went to church regular last season he intercepted a pass in the last two minutes of a tied game with albemarle high and ran it back im sure he was a fine boy rhyme said impatiently garrett and mary beth theyre on foot thats right lucy answered garrett wouldnt drive doesnt even have a license think it was because of his folks dying in a car crash what physical evidence did you find oh we got the murder weapon mason said proudly the shovel were real buttoned up about handling it too wore gloves and we did the chainofcustody thing likes in the books rhyme waited for more finally he asked what else did you find well some footprints mason looked at jesse who said oh right i took pictures of em thats allsachs asked lucy nodded tightlipped at the northerners implicit criticism rhyme didnt you search the scene jesse said sure we did just there wasnt anything else wasnt anything else at a scene where a perp kills one victim and abducts another thered be enough evidence to make a movie of who did what to whom and probably what each member of the cast had been doing for the last twentyfour hours it seemed they were up against two perpetrators the insect boy and lawenforcement incompetence rhyme caught sachs eye and saw she was thinking the same who conducted the search rhyme asked i did mason said i got there first i was nearby when the call came in and when was that ninethirty a truck driver saw billys body from the highway and called nineoneone and the boy was killed before eight rhyme wasnt pleased an hour and a half at least was a long time for a crime scene to be unprotected a lot of evidence could get stolen a lot could get added the boy could have raped and killed the girl and hidden the body then returned to remove some pieces of evidence and plant others to lead investigators off you searched it by yourself rhyme asked mason first time through then we got three four deputies out there they went over the area real good and found only the murder weapon lord almighty not to mention the damage done by four cops unfamiliar with crime scene search techniques can i ask sachs said how you know garrett was the perp i saw him jesse corn said when he took lydia this morning that doesnt mean he killed billy and kidnapped the other girl oh bell said the fingerprints we got them off the shovel rhyme nodded and said to the sheriff and his prints were on file because of those prior arrests right rhyme said now tell me about this morning jesse took over it was early just after sunup ed schaeffer and i were there keeping an eye on the crime scene in case garrett came back ed was north of the river i was south lydia comes round to lay some flowers i left her alone and went back to the car which i guess i shouldntve done next thing i know shes screaming and i see the two of them disappear over the paquo they were gone fore i could find a boat or anything to get across ed wouldnt answer his radio i was worried about him and when i got over there i found him stung half to death garrettd set a trap bell said we think ed knows where hes got mary beth he got a look at a map that was in that blind garrettd been hiding in but he got stung and passed out before he could tell us what the map showed and garrett mustve took it with him after he kidnapped lydia we couldnt find it whats the deputys condition sachs asked went into shock because of the stinging nobody knows if hes going to make it or not or if hell remember anything if he does come to so we rely on the evidence rhyme thought which was after all his preference far better than witnesses any day any clues from this mornings scene found this jesse opened an attach√© case and took out a running shoe in a plastic bag garrett lost it when he was grabbing lydia nothing else a shovel at yesterdays scene a shoe at todays nothing more rhyme glanced hopelessly at the lone shoe just set it over there nodding toward a table tell me about these other deaths garrett was a suspect in bell said all in and around blackwater landing two of the victims drowned in the canal evidence looked like theyd fallen and hit their heads but the medical examiner said they couldve been hit intentionally and pushed in garrettd been seen around their houses not long before they died then last year somebody was stung to death wasps just like with ed we know garrett did it bell started to continue but mason interrupted he said in a low voice girl in her early twenties like mary beth real nice good christian she was taking a nap on her back porch garrett tossed a hornets nest inside got herself stung a hundred thirtyseven times had a heart attack lucy kerr said i ran the call it was a real bad sight what happened to her she died slow real painful oh and that funeral we passed on the way here bell asked that was todd wilkes he was eight killed himself oh no sachs muttered why well hed been pretty sick jesse corn explained he was at the hospital more than at home was real tore up about it but there was more garrett was seen shouting at todd a few weeks ago really giving him hell we were thinking that garrett kept harassing and scaring him until he snapped motive sachs asked hes a psycho thats his motive mason spat out people make fun of him and hes out to get them simple as that schizophrenic lucy said not according to his counselors at school antisocial personalitys what they call it hes got a high iq he got mostly as on his report cards before he started skipping school a couple of years ago you have a picture of him sachs asked the sheriff opened a file heres the booking shot for the hornetsnest assault the picture showed a thin crewcut boy with prominent connected brows and sunken eyes there was a rash on his cheek heres another bell unfolded a newspaper clipping it showed a family of four at a picnic table the caption read the hanlons at the tanners corner annual picnic a week before a tragic auto accident on route took the lives of stuart and sandra and their daughter kaye also pictured is garrett who was not in the car at the time of the accident can i see the report of the scene yesterday rhyme asked bell opened a folder thom took it rhyme had no pageturning frame so he relied on his aide to flip the pages cant you hold it steadier thom sighed but the criminalist was irritated the crime scene had been very sloppily worked there were polaroid photos revealing a number of footprints but no rulers had been laid in the shot to indicate size also none of the prints had numbered cards to indicate that theyd been made by different individuals sachs noticed this too and shook her head commenting on it lucy sounding defensive said you always do that put cards down of course sachs said its standard procedure rhyme continued to examine the report in it was only a cursory description of the location and pose of the boys body rhyme could see that the outlining had been done in spray paint which is notorious for ruining trace and contaminating crime scenes no dirt had been sampled for trace at the site of the body or where thered been an obvious scuffle between billy and mary beth and garrett and rhyme could see cigarette butts on the ground which might provide many clues but none had been collected next thom flipped the page the friction ridge fingerprint report was marginally better the shovel had four full and seventeen partials all positively identified as garretts and billys most of them were latents but a few were evident easily visible without chemicals or alternative light source imaging in a smear of mud on the handle still mason had been careless when hed worked the scene his latex glove prints on the shovel covered up many of the killers rhyme would have fired a tech for such careless handling of evidence but since there were so many other good prints it wouldnt make any difference in this case the equipment would be arriving soon rhyme said to bell im going to need that forensics tech to help me with the analysis and the equipment id prefer a cop but the important thing is that they know science and know the area here a native masons thumb danced a circle over the ribbed hammer of his revolver we can dig somebody up but i thought you were the expert i mean isnt that why were using you one of the reasons youre using me is because i know when i need help he looked at bell anybody come to mind it was lucy kerr who answered my sisters boy benny hes studying science at unc grad school smart phi beta hes just well a little quiet i dont want him for his conversation ill call him good rhyme said then now i want amelia to search the crime scenes the boys room and blackwater mason said but he waved his hand at the report we already did that finetooth comb id like her to search them again rhyme said shortly then looked at jesse you know the area could you go with her sure be happy to sachs gave him a wry look but rhyme knew the value of a flirt sachs would need cooperation and a lot of it rhyme didnt think lucy or mason would be half as helpful as the alreadyinfatuated jesse corn rhyme said i want amelia to have a sidearm jesses our ordnance expert bell said he can rustle you up a nice smith and wesson you bet i can let me have some cuffs too sachs said sure thing bell noticed mason looking unhappy staring at the map what is it the sheriff asked you really want my opinion the short man asked i asked didnt i you do what you think is best jim mason said in a taut voice but i dont think we have time for any more searches theres a lot of territory out there weve got to get after that boy and get after him fast but it was lincoln rhyme who responded eyes on the map at location g blackwater landing the last place anyone had seen lydia johansson alive he said we dont have enough time to move fast we wanted him the man whispered cautiously as if speaking too loudly would conjure a witch he looked uneasily around the dusty front yard in which sat a wheelless pickup on concrete blocks we called family services and asked about garrett specifically cause wed heard about him and felt sorry but fact is he was trouble from the start not like any of the other kids we had we did our best but ill tell you im thinking he doesnt see it that way and were scared scared bad he stood on the weatherbeaten front porch of his house north of tanners corner speaking to amelia sachs and jesse corn amelia was here at garretts foster parents house solely to search his room but despite the urgency she was letting hal babbage ramble on in hopes that she might learn a bit more about garrett hanlon amelia sachs didnt quite share rhymes view that evidence was the sole key to tracking down perps but the only thing this conversation was revealing was that his foster parents were indeed as hal had said terrified that garrett would return to hurt them or the other children his wife who stood beside him on the porch was a fat woman with curly rustcolored hair she wore a stained countrywestern radio station giveaway tshirt my boots tap to wkrt like her husbands margaret babbages eyes often scanned the yard and surrounding forest looking for garretts return sachs assumed its not like we ever did anything to him the man continued i never whipped him the state wont let you do that anymore but id be firm with him make him toe the line like we eat on a schedule i insist on that only garrett wouldnt show up on time i lock the food up when its not mealtime so he went hungry a lot and sometimes id take him to father and sons saturday bible study and he hated that he just sat there and didnt say a word embarrassed me ill tell you and id nag him to clean that pigsty of a room he hesitated caught between anger and fear thosere just things you gotta make children do but i know he hates me for em the wife offered her own testimony we were mannerable to him but hes not going to remember that hes gonna remember the times we were strict her voice quivered and hes thinking of revenge ill tell you well protect ourselves garretts foster father warned speaking now to jesse corn he nodded to a pile of nails and a rusty hammer sitting on the porch were nailing the windows shut but if he tries to break in well protect ourselves the children know what to do they know where the shotgun is ive taught em how to use it he encouraged them to shoot garrett sachs was shocked shed seen several other kids in the house peering through the screens they seemed to be no older than ten hal jesse corn said sternly preempting sachs dont go taking anything into your own hands you see garrett call us and dont let the little ones touch any firearms come on you know bettern that we have drills hal said defensively every thursday night after supper they know how to handle a gun he squinted as he saw something in the yard tensing for a moment id like to see his room sachs said he shrugged help yourself but youre on your own im not going in there you show em mags he picked up the hammer and a handful of nails sachs noticed the butt of a pistol protruding from his waistband he started to pound nails into a window frame jesse sachs said go around to the back and check in his window see if therere any traps rigged you wont be able to see the mother explained hes got them painted black painted sachs continued then just cover the approach to the window i dont want any surprises keep an out for shooting vantages and dont present a clean target sure shooting vantages ill go do that and he nodded in an exaggerated way that told her that hed had virtually no tactical experience he disappeared into the side yard the wife said to sachs his rooms this way sachs followed garretts foster mother down a dim corridor filled with laundry and shoes and stacks of magazines family circle christian life guns ammo field and stream readers digest her neck crawled as she passed each doorway eyes flicking left and right and her lengthy fingers stroked the oak checkerboard of the pistol grip the door to the boys room was closed garrett tossed a hornets nest inside got herself stung times youre really scared hell come back after a pause the woman said garretts a troubled boy people dont understand him and i got more feeling for him than hal does i dont know if hell come back but if he does itll be trouble garrett dont mind hurting people once at school some boys kept breaking into his locker and leaving notes and dirty underwear and things nothing terrible just pranks but garrett made this cage that popped open if you didnt open the locker just right put a spider inside next time they broke in the spider bit one of the boys in the face nearly blinded him yeah im scared hell come back they paused outside a bedroom door on the wood was a handmade sign danger do not enter a badly done penandink drawing of a meanlooking wasp was taped to the door below it there was no airconditioning and sachs found her palms sweating she wiped them on her jeans sachs turned on the motorola radio and pulled on the headset shed borrowed from the sheriffs department central communications office she spent a moment finding the frequency steve farr had given her the reception was lousy rhyme im here sachs ive been waiting whereve you been she didnt want to tell him that shed spent a few minutes trying to learn more about the psychology of garrett hanlon she said only took us some time to get here well whatve we got the criminalist asked im about to go in she motioned margaret back into the living room then kicked the door in and leapt back into the corridor pressed flat against the wall no sound from the dimly lit room got herself stung times okay pistol up go go go she pushed inside jesus sachs dropped into a lowprofile combat stance several earnest pounds of pressure on the trigger she held the gun steady as a mountain at the figure just inside sachs rhyme called what is it minute she whispered flicking the overhead light on the gun sight rested on a poster of the creepy monster in the movie alien with her left hand she swung the closet door open empty its secured rhyme have to say though i dont really care for the way he decorates it was then that the stench hit her unwashed clothing bodily scents and something else phew she muttered sachs what is it rhymes voice was impatient place stinks good you know my rule always smell the crime scene first wish i hadnt i meant to clean it up mrs babbage had padded up behind sachs i shoulda before you got here but i was too afraid to go in besides skunks hard to get out unless you wash in tomato juice which hal thinks is a waste of money that was it crowning the smell of dirty clothes was the burntrubber scent of skunk musk hands clasped desperately looking like she was about to cry garretts foster mother whispered hell be mad you broke the door sachs said to her ill need a little time alone here she ushered the woman out and closed the door times wasting sachs rhyme snapped im on it she responded looking around repulsed by the gray stained sheets the piles of dirty clothes the dishes glued together with old food the cello bags filled with the dust of potato and corn chips the whole place made her edgy she found her fingers in her scalp compulsively scratching stopped then scratched some more she wondered why she was so angry maybe because the slovenliness suggested that his foster parents didnt really give a damn about the boy and that this neglect had contributed to his becoming a killer and a kidnapper sachs scanned the room fast and noticed that there were dozens of smudges and finger and footprints on the windowsill it seemed he used the window more than the front door and she wondered if they locked the children down at night she turned to the wall opposite the bed and squinted felt a chill slide through her weve got ourselves a collector here rhyme she looked over the dozen large jars terrariums filled with colonies of insects clustered together surrounding pools of water in the bottom of each one labels in sloppy handwriting identified the species water boatman diving bell spider a chipped magnifying glass sat on a nearby table beside an old office chair that looked as if garrett had retrieved it from a trash heap i know why they call him the insect boy sachs said then told rhyme about the jars she shivered with revulsion as a horde of moist tiny bugs moved en masse along the glass of one jar ah thats good for us why because its a rare hobby if tennis or collecting coins turned him on wed have a harder time pinning him to specific locations now get going on the scene he was speaking softly in a voice that was almost cheerful she knew hed be imagining himself walking the grid as he referred to the process of searching a crime scene using her as his eyes and legs as head of investigation and resources the nypds forensics and crime scene unit lincoln rhyme had often worked homicide crime scenes himself usually logging more hours on the job than even junior officers she knew that walking the grid was what he missed most about his life before the accident whats the crime scene kit like rhyme asked jesse corn had dug one up from the sheriffs department equipment room for her to use sachs opened the dusty metal attach√© case it didnt contain a tenth of the equipment of her kit in new york but at least there were the basics tweezers a flashlight probes latex gloves and evidence bags crime scene lite she said were fish out of water on this one sachs im with you there rhyme she pulled on the gloves as she looked over the room garretts bedroom was whats known as a secondary crime scene not the place where the actual crime occurred but the location where it was planned for instance or to which the perps fled and hid out after a crime rhyme had long ago taught her that these were often more valuable than the primary scenes because perps tended to be more careless in places like this shedding gloves and clothes and leaving behind weapons and other evidence she now started her search walking a grid pattern covering the floor in close parallel strips the way youd mow a lawn foot by foot then turning perpendicular and walking over the same territory again talk to me sachs talk to me its a spooky place rhyme spooky he groused what the hell is spooky lincoln rhyme didnt like soft observations he liked hard specific adjectives cold muddy blue green sharp rhyme even complained when she commented that something was large or small tell me inches or millimeters sachs or dont tell me at all amelia sachs searched crime scenes armed with a glock latex gloves and a stanley contractors tape measure she thought well i feel damn spooked doesnt that count for anything hes got these posters up from the alien movies and starship troopers these big bugs attacking people hes drawn some himself too theyre violent the place is filthy junk food a lot of books clothes the bugs in the jars not much else the clothes are dirty yep got a good one a pair of pants really stained hes worn them a lot they must have a ton of trace in them and they all have cuffs lucky for us most kids his aged wear only blue jeans she dropped them in a plastic evidence bag shirts tshirts only she said nothing with pockets criminalists love cuffs and pockets they trap all sorts of helpful clues ive got a couple of notebooks here rhyme but jim bell and the other deputies mustve looked through them dont make any assumptions about our colleagues crime scene work rhyme said wryly got it she began flipping through the pages therere no diaries no maps nothing about kidnapping therere just drawings of insects pictures of the ones hes got here in the terrariums any of girls young women sadosexual no bring them along how about the books maybe a hundred or so schoolbooks books about animals insects hold on got something here a tanners corner high school yearbook its six years old rhyme asked a question to someone in the room he came back on the line jim says lydia s twentysix shedve been out of high school eight years but check the mcconnell girls page sachs thumbed through the ms yep mary beths pictures been cut out with a sharp blade of some kind he sure fits the classic stalker profile were not interested in profiles were interested in evidence the other books the ones on his shelf which ones does he read the most how do i dirt on the pages he snapped impatiently start on the ones nearest his bed bring back four or five of them she picked the four with the most wellthumbed pages the entomologists handbook the field guide to insects of north carolina water insects of north america the miniature world ive got them rhyme therere a lot of marked passages asterisks by some of them good bring them back but theres got to be something more specific in the room i cant find a thing keep looking sachs hes a sixteenyearold you know the juvenile cases weve worked teenagers rooms are the centers of their universe start thinking like a sixteenyearold where would you hide things she looked under the mattress in and under the drawers of the desk in the closet beneath the grimy pillows then she shone the flashlight between the wall and the bed she said got something here rhyme what she found a mass of waddedup kleenex a bottle of vaseline intensive care lotion she examined one of the kleenexes it was stained with what appeared to be dried semen dozens of tissues under the bed hes been a busy boy with his right hand hes sixteen rhyme said itd be unusual if he wasntbag one we might need some dna sachs found more under the bed a cheap picture frame on which hed painted crude drawings of insects ants and hornets and beetles inside was mounted the cutout yearbook photo of mary beth mcconnell there was also an album of a dozen other snapshots of mary beth they were candids most of them were of the young woman on what seemed to be a college campus or walking down the street of a small town two were of her in her bikini at a lake in both of these she was bending down and the picture focused on the girls cleavage she told rhyme what shed found his fantasy girl rhyme muttered keep going i think we should bag this and get on to the primary scene in a minute or two sachs remember this was your idea being good samaritans not mine a shudder of anger at this what do you want she asked heatedly you want me to dust for prints vacuum for hairs of course not were not after trialquality evidence for the da you know that all we need is something thatll give us an idea where he mightve taken the girls hes not going to bring them back home hes got a place hes made just for them and hes been there earlier to get it ready he may be young and quirky but he still smells of an organized offender even if the girlsre dead ill bet hes picked out nice cozy graves for them despite all the time theyd worked together sachs still had trouble with rhymes callousness she knew it was part of being a criminalist the distancing one must do from the horror of crime but it was hard for her perhaps because she recognized that she had the same capacity for this coldness within herself that numbing detachment that the best crimescene searchers must turn on like a light switch a detachment that sachs sometimes feared would deaden her heart irreparably nice cozy graves lincoln rhyme whose voice was never more seductive than when he was imagining a crime scene said to her go on sachs get into him become garrett hanlon what are you thinking whats your life like what do you do minute by minute by minute in that little room what are your most secret thoughts the best criminalists rhyme had told her were like talented novelists who imagined themselves as their characters and could disappear into someone elses world eyes scanning the room once more im sixteen im a troubled boy im an orphan kids at school pick on me im sixteen im sixteen im a thought formed she snagged it before it swam off rhyme you know whats weird talk to me sachs he said softly encouraging hes a teenager right well i remember tommy briscoe i dated him when i was sixteen you know what he had all over his walls in his room in my day and age it was that damn farrah fawcett poster thats it exactly garrett doesnt have a single pinup a single playboy or penthouse poster no magic cards no pokemon no toys no alanis or celine no rockmusician posters and hey get this no vcr tv stereo radio no nintendo my god hes sixteen and he doesnt even have a computer her goddaughter was twelve and the girls room was virtually an electronics showroom maybe its a money thing the foster parents hell rhyme if i were his age and wanted to listen to music id build a radio nothing stops teenagers but those arent the things that excite him excellent sachs maybe she reflected but what did it mean recording observations is only half of the job of a forensic scientist the other half the far more important half is drawing helpful conclusions from those observations sachs shhhh she struggled to put aside the person she really was the cop from brooklyn the lover of taut general motors vehicles former fashion model for the chantelle agency on madison avenue champion pistol shot the woman who wore her straight red hair long and her fingernails short lest the habit of digging into her scalp and skin mar her otherwise perfect flesh with yet more stigmata of the tension that drove her trying to turn that person into smoke and emerge as a troubled scary sixteenyearold boy someone who needed or wanted to take women by force who needed or wanted to kill what do i feel i dont care about normal pleasures music tv computers i dont care about normal sex she said half to herself i dont care about normal relationships people are like insects things to be caged in fact all i care about are insects theyre my only source of comfort my only amusement she said this as she paced in front of the jars then she looked down at the floor at her feet the tracks of the chair what garretts chair its on rollers its facing the insect jars all he does is roll back and forth and stare at them and draw them hell he probably talks to them too his whole life is these bugs but the tracks in the wood stopped before they got to the jar on the end of the row the largest of them and one set slightly apart from the others it contained yellow jackets the tiny yellowandblack crescents zipped about angrily as if they were aware of her intrusion she walked to the jar looked down at it carefully she said to rhyme theres a jar full of wasps i think its his safe why its nowhere near the other jars he never looks at it i can tell by the tracks of the chair and all the other jars have water in them theyre aquatic bugs thiss the only one with flying insects its a great idea rhyme whod reach inside something like that and theres about a foot of shredded paper on the bottom id think hes buried something in there look inside and see she opened the door and asked mrs babbage for a pair of leather gloves when she brought them she found sachs looking into the wasp jar youre not going to touch that are you she asked in a desperate whisper yes oh garrettll have a fit he yells at anyone who ever touches his wasp jar mrs babbage garretts a fleeing felon him yelling at anybody isnt really a concern here but if he sneaks back and sees you bothered it i mean it could push him over the edge again tears threatened well find him before he comes back sachs said in a reassuring tone dont worry sachs put on the gloves and she wrapped a pillowcase around her bare arm slowly she eased the mesh lid off and reached inside two wasps landed on the glove but flew off a moment later the rest just ignored the intrusion she was careful not to disturb the nest stung times she dug only a few inches before she found the plastic bag gotcha she pulled it out one wasp escaped and disappeared into the house before she got the mesh lid back on pulling off the leather gloves and putting on the latex she opened the bag and spilled the contents out on the bed a spool of thin fishing line some money about a hundred dollars in cash and four eisenhower silver dollars another picture frame this one held the photo from the newspaper of garrett and his family a week before the car accident that killed his parents and sister on a short chain was an old battered key like a car key though there was no logo on the head only a short serial number she told rhyme about this good sachs excellent i dont know what it means yet but its a start now get over to the primary scene blackwater landing sachs paused and looked around the room the wasp that had escaped had returned and was trying to get back into the jar she wondered what kind of message it was sending to its fellow insects i cant keep up lydia told garrett i cant go this fast she gasped sweat streaming down her face her uniform was drenched quiet he scolded angrily i need to listen cant do it with you bitching all the time listen for what she wondered he consulted the map again and led her along another path they were still deep in the pine woods but even though they were out of the sun she was dizzy and recognized the early symptoms of heatstroke he glanced at her eyes on her breasts again the fingernails snapping the immense heat please she whispered crying i cant do this please quiet im not going to tell you again a cloud of gnats swarmed around her face she inhaled one or two and spit in disgust to clear her mouth god how she hated it here in the woods lydia johansson hated to be out of doors most people loved the woods and swimming pools and backyards but her happiness was a fragile contentment that occurred mostly inside her job chatting with her other single girlfriends over margaritas at tgi fridays horror books and tv trips to the outlet malls for a shopping spree those occasional nights with her boyfriend indoor joys all of them outside reminded her of the cookouts her married friends gave reminded her of families sitting around pools while their children played with inflatable toys of picnics of trim women in speedos and thongs outside reminded lydia of a life she wanted but didnt have of her loneliness he led her down another path out of the forest suddenly the trees vanished and a huge pit opened in front of them it was an old quarry bluegreen water filled the bottom she remembered years ago kids used to swim here before the swamp started to reclaim the land north of the paquo and the area got more dangerous lets go garrett said nodding toward it no i dont want to its scary dont give a shit what you want he snapped come on he gripped her taped hands and led her down a steep path to a rocky ledge garrett stripped off his shirt and bent down splashed water on his blotched skin he scratched and picked at the welts examined his fingernails disgusting he looked up at lydia you want to do this it feels good you can take your dress off you want go for a swim horrified at the thought of being naked in front of him she shook her head adamantly then sat down near the edge and splashed water on her face and arms just dont drink it ive got this he pulled a dusty burlap bag out from behind a rock where he mustve stashed it recently he pulled out a bottle of water and some packets of cheese crackers with peanut butter he ate a package of crackers and drank half of a bottle of water he offered the rest to her she shook her head repulsed fuck i dont have aids or anything if thats what youre thinking you gotta drink something ignoring the bottle lydia lowered her mouth to the water in the quarry and drank deep it was salty and metallic disgusting she choked nearly vomited jesus i told you garrett snapped he offered her the water again theres all kinds of crap in there quit being so fucking stupid he tossed her the bottle she caught it clumsily with her taped hands and drank it down drinking the water immediately refreshed her she relaxed some and asked wheres mary beth whatve you done with her shes in this place by the ocean an old banker house lydia knew what he meant banker to a carolinian meant somebody who lived on the outer banks the barrier islands off the coast in the atlantic so thats where mary beth was and she understood now why theyd been traveling east toward swampland with no houses and very few other places to hide he probably had a boat stashed to take them through the swamp to the intracoastal waterway then to elizabeth city and through albemarle sound to the banks he continued i like it there its really neat you like the ocean he asked her in a funny way conversationally and he seemed almost normal for a moment her fear lessened but then he froze again and listened to something holding a finger to his lips to silence her frowning angrily as his dark side returned finally he shook his head as he decided that whatever hed heard wasnt a threat he rubbed the back of his hand over his face scratching another welt lets go he nodded back up the steep path to the rim of the quarry its not far the outer banksll take us a day to get to more oh hell were not gonna get there today he laughed coldly as if shed made another idiotic comment well hide near here and let the assholes searching for us get past well spend the night he was looking away from her when he said this spend the night she whispered hopelessly but garrett said nothing more he started prodding her up the steep incline to the lip of the quarry and the pine woods beyond whats the attraction of the sites of death as shed walked the grid at dozens of crime scenes amelia sachs had often asked this question and she asked it again now as she stood on the shoulder of route in blackwater landing overlooking the paquenoke river this was the place where young billy stail had died bloody where two young women had been kidnapped where a hardworking deputys life had been changed forever perhaps ended by a hundred wasps and even in the relentless sun the mood of blackwater landing was somber and edgy she surveyed the place carefully here at the crime scene a steep hill strewn with trash led from the shoulder of route down to the muddy riverbank where the ground leveled off there were willows and cypress and clusters of tall grass an old rotting pier extended about thirty feet into the river then dipped below the surface of the water there were no homes in this immediate area though sachs had noticed a number of large new colonials not far from the river the houses were obviously expensive but sachs noticed that even this residential portion of blackwater landing like the county seat itself seemed ghostly and forlorn it took her a moment to realize why there were no children playing in the yards even though it was summer vacation no inflatable pools no bikes no strollers this reminded her of the funeral theyd passed a few hours ago and the childs casket and she forced her thoughts away from that sad memory and back to her task examining the scene yellow tape encircled two areas the one nearest the water included a willow in front of which were several bouquets of flowers where garrett had kidnapped lydia the other was a dusty clearing surrounded by a grove of trees where yesterday the boy had killed billy stail and taken mary beth in the middle of this scene were a number of shallow holes in the ground where shed been digging for arrowheads and relics twenty feet from the center of the scene was the spraypainted outline representing where billys body had lain spray paint she thought chagrined these deputies obviously werent used to homicide investigations a sheriffs department car pulled onto the shoulder and lucy kerr climbed out just what i need more cooks the deputy nodded coolly to sachs find anything helpful at the house a few things sachs didnt explain further and nodded at the hillside in her headset she heard rhymes voice is the scene trampled as bad as in the photos like a herd of cattle walked through it must be twodozen footprints shit the criminalist muttered lucy had heard sachss comment but said nothing just kept looking out over the dark junction where the canal met the river sachs asked thats the boat he got away in looking toward a skiff beached on the muddy riverbank over there yeah jesse corn said its not his he stole it from some folks up the river you want to search it later now which way wouldnt he have come to get here yesterday i mean when he killed billy wouldnt jesse pointed to the east theres nothing that way swamp and reeds cant even land a boat so either he came along route and down the embankment here or cause of the boat i guess he mightve rowed over she opened the crime scene suitcase said to jesse i want a known of the dirt around here known exemplars samples you know just of the dirt here right sure he said then asked why because if we can find soil that doesnt match whats found here naturally it might be from the place garretts got those girls it could also lucy said be from lydia s garden or mary beths backyard or shoes of some kids fishing here a couple of days ago it could sachs said patiently but we need to do it anyway she handed jesse a plastic bag he strode off pleased to help sachs started down the hill she paused opened the crime scene case again no rubber bands she noticed that lucy kerr had some bands binding the end of her french braid borrow those she asked the elastic bands after a brief pause the deputy pulled them off sachs stretched them around her shoes explained so ill know which footprintsre mine as if it makes a difference in this mess she thought she stepped into the crime scene sachs what do you have rhyme asked the reception was even worse than earlier i cant see the scenario very clearly she said studying the ground way too many footprints mustve been eight ten different people walking through here in the last twentyfour hours but i have an idea what happened mary beth was kneeling a mans shoes approach from the west from the direction of the canal garretts i remember the tread of the shoe jesse found i can see where mary beth stands and steps back a second mans shoes approach from the south billy he came down the embankment hes moving fast mostly on his toes so hes sprinting garrett goes toward him they scuffle billy backs up to a willow tree garrett comes toward him more scuffling sachs studied the white outline of billys body the first time garrett hits billy with the shovel he gets him in the head he falls that didnt kill him but then he hit him in the neck when he was down that finished him off jesse gave a surprised laugh staring at the same outline as if he were looking at something completely different from what she saw howd you know that absently she said the blood pattern therere a few small drops here she pointed to the ground consistent with blood falling about six feet thats from billys head but that big spray pattern whichd have to be from a severed carotid or jugular starts when he was on the ground okay rhyme im going to start the search walking the grid foot by foot eyes on the dirt and grass eyes on the knotty bark of the oaks and willows eyes up to the overhanging branches a crime scene is threedimensional sachs rhyme often reminded those cigarette butts still there rhyme asked got em she turned to lucy those cigarette butts she said nodding at the ground why werent they picked up oh jesse answered for her thosere just nathans who nathan groomer one of our deputies hes been trying to quit but just cant quite manage to sachs sighed but managed to refrain from telling them that any cop who smoked at a crime scene ought to be suspended she covered the ground carefully but the search was futile any visible fibers scraps of paper or other physical evidence had been removed or blown away she walked to the scene of this mornings kidnapping stepped under the tape and started on the grid around the willow back and forth fighting the dizziness from the heat rhyme there isnt much here but wait ive got something shed seen a flash of white close to the water she walked down and carefully picked up a waddedup kleenex her knees cried out from the arthritis that had plagued her for years rather be running down a perp than doing deep knee bends she thought kleenex looks similar to the ones at his house rhyme only this ones got blood on it quite a bit lucy asked you think garrett dropped it sachs examined it i dont know all i can say is that it didnt spend the night here moisture contents too low morning dew would have half disintegrated it excellent sachs whered you learn that i dont recall ever mentioning it yes you did she said absently your textbook chapter twelve paper sachs walked down to the water searched the small boat she found nothing inside then she asked jesse can you row me over he was of course more than happy to and she wondered how long it would be before he fired off the first invitation for a cup of coffee uninvited lucy climbed in the skiff too and they pushed off the threesome rowed silently over the river which was surprisingly choppy in the current on the far shore sachs found footprints in the mud lydia s shoes the fine tread of nurse sneakers and garretts prints one barefoot one in a running shoe with the tread that was already familiar to her she followed them into the woods they led to the hunting blind where ed schaeffer had been stung by the wasps sachs stopped dismayed what the hell had happened here god rhyme it looks like the scene was swept criminals often use brooms or even leaf blowers to destroy or confuse the evidence at crime scenes but jesse corn said oh that was from the chopper helicopter sachs asked dumbfounded well yeah medevac to get ed schaeffer out but the downdraft from the rotors ruined the site sachs said standard procedure is to move an injured victim away from the scene before you set the chopper down standard procedure lucy kerr asked abrasively sorry but we were a little worried about ed trying to save his life you know sachs didnt respond she eased into the shed slowly so she wouldnt disturb the dozens of wasps that were hovering around a shattered nest but whatever maps or other clues deputy schaeffer had seen inside were gone now and the wind from the helicopter had mixed up the topsoil so much that it was pointless to even take a sample of the dirt lets get back to the lab sachs said to lucy and jesse they were returning to the shore when there was a crashing sound behind her and a huge man lumbered toward them from the tangle of brush surrounding a cluster of black willows jesse corn drew his weapon but before he cleared leather sachs had the borrowed smittie out of the holster cocked to doubleaction and the blade sight aimed at the intruders chest he froze lifted his hands outward blinking in surprise he was bearded tall and heavy wore his hair in a braid jeans gray tshirt denim vest boots something familiar about him where had she seen him before it took jesses mentioning his name for her to remember rich one of the trio theyd seen outside the county building earlier rich culbeau she remembered the unusual name sachs recalled too how he and his friends had glanced at her body with a tacit leer and at thom with an air of contempt she kept the pistol pointed at him a moment longer than she would have otherwise slowly she aimed the weapon at the ground uncocked it and replaced it in the holster sorry culbeau said didnt mean to spook nobody hey jesse thiss a crime scene sachs said in her earphone she heard rhymes voice whos there she turned away whispering into the stalk mike one of those characters out of deliverance we saw this morning were working here rich lucy said cant have you in our way i dont intend to be in your way he said switching his gaze into the woods but i got a right to try for that thousand like everybody else you cant stop me from looking what thousand hell sachs spat out into the microphone theres a reward rhyme oh no last thing we need of the major factors contaminating crime scenes and hampering investigations reward and souvenir seekers are among the worst culbeau explained mary beths moms offering it that womans got some money and ill bet by nightfall the girls still not back shell be offering two thousand maybe more he then looked at sachs im not gonna cause any trouble miss youre not from here and you lookit me and think i must be just bad pay i heard you talking bout deliverance in that fancy radio gear of yours i liked the book bettern the movie by the way you ever read it well dont matter just dont go puttin too much stock in appearances jesse tell her who rescued that girl gone missing in the great dismal last year who everbody knew was gone to snakes and skeeters and the whole county tore up about it jesse said rich and harris tomel found her three days lost in the swamp shedve died it wasnt for them was me mostly culbeau muttered harris dont like gettin his boots dirty that was good of you sachs said stiffly i just want to make sure you dont hurt our chances of finding those women thats not gonna happen theres no reason for you to get all ashy on me culbeau turned and lumbered away ashy sachs asked means angry you know she told rhyme and told him about the encounter he dismissed it we dont have time to worry about the locals sachs weve got to get on the trail and fast get back here with what youve found as they sat in the boat on the way back over the canal sachs asked how much troubles he gonna be culbeau lucy responded hes lazy mostly smokes dope and drinks too much but hes never done worse than broke some jaws in public we think hes got a still someplace and even for a thousand bucks i cant imagine him getting too far from it what do he and his two cronies do jesse asked oh you saw them too well sean thats the skinny one and rich dont have what youd call real jobs scavenge and do day labor some harris tomels been to college a couple years anyway hes always trying to buy a business or put some deal together nothing ever pays out that i heard of but all three of those boys have money and that means theyre running shine moonshine you dont bust em after a moment jesse said sometimes down here you go lookin for trouble sometimes you dont which was a bit of lawenforcement philosophy that sachs knew was hardly limited to the south they landed again on the south shore of the river beside the crime scenes and sachs climbed out before jesse could offer his hand which he did anyway suddenly a huge dark shape came into view a black motorized barge forty feet long eased down the canal then passed them and headed into the river she read on the side davett industries sachs asked whats that lucy answered a company outside of town they move shipments up the intracoastal through the dismal swamp canal and into norfolk asphalt tar paper stuff like that rhyme had heard this through the radio and said lets ask if there was a shipment around the time of the killing get the name of the crew sachs mentioned this to lucy but she said i already did that one of the first things jim and i did her answer was clipped it was a negative if youre interested we also canvassed everybody in town normally makes the commute along canal road and route here wasnt any help that was a good idea sachs said just standard procedure lucy said coolly and strode back to her car like a homely girl in high school whod finally managed to fling a searing putdown at the head cheerleader im not letting him do anything until you get an airconditioner in here thom we dont have time for this rhyme spat out then told the workmen where to unload the instruments that had arrived from the state police bell said steves out trying to dig one up isnt quite as easy as i thought i dont need one thom explained patiently im worried about dysreflexia i dont remember hearing that temperature was bad for blood pressure thom rhyme said did you read that somewhere i didnt read it maybe you could show me where you read it i dont need your sarcasm lincoln oh im sarcastic am i the aide patiently said to bell heat causes tissue swelling swelling causes increased pressure and irritation and that can lead to dysreflexia which can kill him we need an airconditioner simple as that thom was the only one of rhymes caregiving aides whod survived more than a few months in the service of the criminalist the others had either quit or been peremptorily fired plug that in rhyme ordered a deputy who was wheeling a battered gas chromatograph into the corner no thom crossed his arms and stood in front of the extension cord the deputy saw the look on the aides face and paused uneasily not prepared for a confrontation with the persistent young man when we get the airconditioner up and running then well plug it in jesus christ rhyme grimaced one of the most frustrating aspects of being a quad is the inability to bleed off anger after his accident rhyme quickly came to realize how a simple act like walking or clenching our fists not to mention flinging a heavy object or two a favorite pastime of rhymes exwife elaine dissipates fury if i get angry icould start spasming or get contractures rhyme pointed out testily neither of which will kill you the way dysreflexia will thom said this with a tactical cheerfulness that infuriated rhyme all the more bell gingerly said gimme five minutes he disappeared and the troopers continued to wheel in the equipment the chromatograph went unelectrified for the moment lincoln rhyme surveyed the machinery wondered what it would be like to actually close his fingers around an object again with his left ring finger he could touch and had a faint sense of pressure but actually gripping something feeling its texture weight temperature those were unimaginable terry dobyns the nypd therapist the man whod been sitting at rhymes bedside when hed awakened after the accident at a crime scene left him a quadriplegic had explained to the criminalist all the clich√©d stages of grief rhyme had been assured that hed experience and survive all of them but what the doctor hadnt told him was that certain stages sneak back that you carried them around with you like sleeping viruses and that they might erupt at any time over the past several years hed reexperienced despair and denial now he was consumed with fury why here were two kidnapped young women and a killer on the run how badly he wanted to speed to the crime scene walk the grid pluck elusive evidence from the ground gaze at it through the luxurious lenses of a compound microscope punch the buttons of the computers and the other instruments pace as he drew his conclusions he wanted to get to work without worrying that the fucking heat would kill him he thought again about dr weavers magic hands about the operation youre quiet thom said cautiously whatre you plotting im not plotting anything would you please plug in the gas chromatograph and turn it on it needs time to warm up thom hesitated then walked to the machine and got it running he arranged the rest of the equipment on a fiberboard table steve farr walked into the office lugging a huge carrier airconditioner the deputy was apparently as strong as he was tall and the only clue to the effort was the red hue to his prominent ears he gasped stole it from planning and zoning we dont much like them bell helped farr mount the unit in the window and a moment later cold air was chugging into the room a figure appeared in the doorway in fact he filled the doorway a man in his twenties massive shoulders a prominent forehead sixfive close to three hundred pounds for a difficult moment rhyme thought this might be a relative of garretts and that the man had come to threaten them but in a high bashful voice he said im ben the three men stared at him as he glanced uneasily at rhymes wheelchair and legs bell said can i help you well im looking for mr bell im sheriff bell eyes still surveying rhymes legs awkwardly he glanced away quickly then cleared his throat and swallowed oh well now im lucy kerrs nephew he seemed to ask questions more than make statements ah my forensics assistant rhyme said excellent just in time another glance at the legs the wheelchair aunt lucy didnt say what was coming next rhyme wondered didnt say anything about forensics he mumbled im just a student postgrad at unc in avery uhm what do you mean sir just in time the question was directed to rhyme but ben was looking at the sheriff i mean get over to that table ive got samples coming in any minute and you have to help me analyze them samples okay what kind of fish would that be he asked bell fish rhyme responded fish what it is sir the big man said softly still looking at bell id be happy to help but i have to tell you i have pretty limited experience were not talking about fish were talking crime scene samples whatd you think crime scene well i didnt know ben told the sheriff you can talk to merhyme corrected sternly a rosy blush blossomed on the mans face and his eyes snapped to attention his head seemed to shiver as he forced himself to look at rhyme i was just i mean hes the sheriff bell said but lincoln heres running the show hes a forensics scientist from new york hes helping us out sure eyes on the wheelchair eyes on rhymes legs eyes on the sipandpuff controller back to the safety of the floor rhyme decided he hated this man who was acting as if the criminalist were the oddest kind of circus freak and part of him hated amelia sachs too for engineering this whole diversion and taking him away from his shark cells and dr weavers hands well sir lincoln is fine the thing is i specialize in marine sociozoology which is rhyme asked impatiently basically the behavior of marine animal life oh great rhyme thought not only do i get a cripphobe for an assistant but i get one whos a fish shrink well it doesnt matter youre a scientist principles are principles protocols are protocols youve used a gas chromatograph yessir and compound and comparison microscopes an affirmative nod though not as assertive as rhyme would have liked but looking at bell for a moment then returning obediently to rhymes face aunt lucy just asked me to stop by i didnt know she meant i was supposed to help you on a case im not really sure i mean i have classes ben you have to help us rhyme said curtly the sheriff explained garrett hanlon ben let the name settle in his massive head somewhere oh that kid in blackwater landing the sheriff explained about the kidnappings and ed schaeffers wasp attack gosh im sorry about ed ben said i met him once at aunt lucys house and so we need you rhyme said trying to steer the conversation back on track we dont have a clue where hes gone with lydia the sheriff continued and we hardly have any time left to save those women and well as you can see mr rhyme he needs somebody to help him well a glance toward but not at rhyme its just i have this test coming up im in school and all like i said rhyme said patiently we dont really have any options here ben garretts got three hours on us and he could kill either of his victims at any time if he hasnt already the zoologist looked around the dusty room for a reprieve and found none guess i can stick around for a little while sir thank you rhyme said he inhaled into the controller and swung around to the table on which the instruments rested he stopped and surveyed them he looked over at ben now if you could just change my catheter well get to work the big man looked stricken whispered you want me to its a joke thom said but ben didnt smile he just nodded uneasily and with the grace of a bison walked over to the chromatograph and began studying the control panel sachs jogged into the impromptu lab in the county building jesse corn keeping up the speedy pace beside her moving more leisurely lucy kerr joined them a moment later she said hello to her nephew ben and introduced the huge man to sachs and jesse sachs held up one cluster of bags this is the evidence from garretts room she said then held up more bags this is from blackwater landing the primary scene rhyme looked at the bags but did so with some discouragement not only was there very little physical evidence but rhyme was troubled again by what had occurred to him earlier he had to analyze the clues without any firsthand knowledge of the surrounding area fish out of water he had a thought ben how longve you lived here the criminalist asked all my life sir good whats this general area of the state called he cleared his throat i guess the northern coastal plain you have any friends whore geologists who specialize in the area cartographers naturalists no theyre all marine biologists rhyme sachs said when we were at blackwater landing i saw that barge remember it was shipping asphalt or tar paper from a factory near here henry davetts company lucy said sachs asked would they have a geologist on staff i dont know about that bell said but davett hes an engineer ands lived here for years probably knows the land as good as anybody give him a call will you you bet bell disappeared he returned a moment later i got davett theres no geologist on staff but he said he might be able to help hell be over in a half hour then the sheriff asked so lincoln how do you want to handle the pursuit ill be here with you and ben were going to go through the evidence i want a small search party over at blackwater landing now to where jesse saw garrett and lydia disappear ill guide the team as best i can depending on what the evidence shows who do you want on the team sachs in charge rhyme said lucy with her bell nodded and rhyme noticed that lucy gave no reaction to these orders about the chain of command id like to volunteer jesse corn said quickly bell looked at rhyme who nodded then he said probably one other four people thats allbell asked frowning hell i could get dozens of volunteers no less is better in a case like this whos the fourth lucy asked mason germain rhyme looked at the doorway could see nobody outside he lowered his voice whats masons story hes got some history i dont like cops with histories i like blank slates bell shrugged the mans had a tough life he grew up north of the paquo the wrong side of the tracks father tried to make a go of it at a couple businesses and then started running shine and when he got collared by revenuers he killed himself mason himself worked his way up from dust theres an expression round here too poor to paint too proud to whitewash thats mason hes always complaining about being held back not getting what he wants hes an ambitious man in a town that hasnt got any use for ambition rhyme observed and hes gunning for garrett you got that right why mason just about begged to be lead investigator on that case we were telling you about the girl got stung to death in blackwater meg blanchard truth be told i think the victim had you know some connection with mason maybe they were going out maybe there was something else i dont know but he wanted to nail garrett bad but he just couldnt make the case against him when it came time for the old sheriff to retire the board of supervisors held that against him i got the job and he didnt even though hes oldern me andd been on the force longer rhyme shook his head we dont need hotheads in an operation like this pick somebody else ned spoto lucy suggested bell shrugged hes a good man sure can shoot good but he also wont unless he for sure has to rhyme said just make sure masons nowhere near the search he wont like it thats not a consideration rhyme said find something else for him to do something that sounds important ill do the best i can bell said uncertainly steve farr leaned into the doorway just called the hospital he announced eds still in critical condition has he said anything about the map he saw not a word still unconscious rhyme turned to sachs okay get going hold up where the trail stops in blackwater landing and wait to hear from me lucy was looking uncertainly at the bags of evidence you really think thiss the way to find those girls i know it is rhyme answered shortly she said skeptically seems a little too much like magic to me rhyme laughed oh thats exactly what it is sleight of hand pulling rabbits out of hats but remember that illusion is based on on whatben the big man cleared his throat blushed and shook his head uhm dont quite know what you mean sir illusions based on sciencethats what a glance at sachs ill call you as soon as i find something the two women and jesse corn left the evidence room and so the precious evidence arrayed before him the familiar equipment warmed up internal politics disposed of lincoln rhyme eased his head back against the wheelchair headrest and stared at the bags sachs had delivered to him willing or coercing or perhaps just allowing his mind to roam where his legs could not walk to touch what his hands could not feel the deputies were talking mason germain arms crossed leaning against the hallway wall beside the door that led to the sheriffs department deputy cubicles could just hear their voices how come were just sitting here not doing anything no no no didnt you hear jims sent out a search party yeah no i didnt hear that goddamn thought mason who hadnt heard it either lucy ned and jesse and that lady cop from washington naw its new york you see that hair of hers i dont care bout that hair of hers i care bout finding mary beth and lydia i do too im just saying masons gut tightened further they only sent four people out after the insect boy was bell crazy he stormed up the corridor on his way to the sheriffs office and nearly collided with bell himself as he walked out of the storeroom where that weird guy the one in the wheelchair was set up bell glanced at the senior deputy with a surprised blink hey mason i was looking for you not looking too hard though dont seem i want you to get over to rich culbeaus place culbeau what for sue mcconnells offering some reward or nother for mary beth and he wants it we dont need him to mess up the search i want you to keep an eye on him if hes not there just wait at his place till he shows up again mason didnt even bother to respond to this bizarre request you sent lucy out after garrett and didnt tell me bell looked the deputy up and down she and a couple othersre going over to blackwater landing see if they can pick up his trail you musta known i wanted to be in the search party i cant send everybody culbeaus already been over to blackwater landing once today i cant have him screwing up the search come on jim dont bullshit me bell sighed all right the truth being as you got a hardon for that boy mason i decided not to send you i dont want any mistakes made therere lives at stake weve got to get him and get him fast which is my intent jim as you ought to know i been after this kid for three years i cant believe youd just cut me out and hand the case over to that freak in there hey enough of that come on i know blackwater ten times bettern lucy i used to live there remember bell lowered his voice you want him too bad mason it could affect your judgment did you think of that or was it himnodding to the room where mason now heard the eerie whine of the wheelchair it set him on edge like a dentists drill bell asking that freak to help them out could cause all kinds of problems that mason didnt even want to think about come on facts is facts the whole world knows how you feel about garrett and the whole world happens to agree with me well the way i told yous the way it is youre gonna have to live with it the deputy laughed bitterly so now im babysitting a redneck shiner bell looked past mason motioned to another deputy hey frank the tall round officer ambled over to the two men frank you go with mason here over to rich culbeaus gonna serve a warrant whats he done now naw no papers masonll fill you in if culbeaus not at his place just wait for him and make sure him and his buddies dont go anywhere near the search party you got that mason the deputy didnt answer he just turned and walked away from his boss who called thiss better for everybody dont think so mason thought mason but the man said nothing and strode into the deputies room frank followed a moment later mason didnt acknowledge the cluster of uniformed men talking about the insect boy and about pretty mary beth and about billy stails incredible yard runback he walked to his office and dug a key out of his pocket he unlocked his desk and took out an extra speedloader clipped in six shells he slipped the speedloader into its leather case and hooked it to his belt he stepped to the doorway of his office his voice cut through the conversation in the room as he gestured toward nathan groomer a strawberryblond deputy of about thirtyfive groomer im going to have a talk with culbeau youre coming with me well frank began slowly holding the hat hed fetched from his cubicle i thought jim wanted me to go i want nathan mason said rich culbeau nathan asked him and mere oil and water i brought him in three times for dui and hurt him some the last time id take frank yeah agreed frank culbeaus cousin works with my wifes dad he thinks im kin hell listen to me mason looked coldly at nathan i want you frank tried again but jim said and i want you now come on mason nathan said in a brittle voice theres no call to break your manners with me mason was looking at an elaborate decoy a mallard duck on nathans desk his most recent carving that man has some talent he thought then said to the deputy you ready nathan sighed stood up frank asked but whatta i tell jim without responding mason walked out of the office nathan in tow and headed toward masons squad car they climbed in mason felt the heat bristle around him and he got the engine going and the ac blasting full up after theyd belted up as the slogan on the side of the cruiser instructed all responsible citizens to do mason said now listen up i aw come on mason dont get that way i was only telling you what made sense i mean last year frank and culbeau just shut up and listen okay ill listen dont think you need to be talking that way okay im listening whats culbeau done now but mason didnt answer he asked wheres your ruger my deer rifle the m right in my truck at home you got the hitech scope mounted course i do were gonna go get it they pulled out of the parking lot and as soon as they were on main street mason hit the switch for the gumball machine the revolving red and blue light on top of the car kept the siren off he sped out of town nathan tucked some red indian inside his cheek which he couldnt do with jim around but mason didnt mind the ruger so thats why you wanted me not frank thats right nathan groomer was the best rifle shot in the department one of the best in paquenoke county masond seen him bring down a tenpoint buck at eight hundred yards so after i get the rifle we going to culbeaus house no where we going were going hunting nice houses here amelia sachs observed she and lucy kerr were driving north along canal road back to blackwater landing from downtown jesse corn and ned spoto a stocky deputy in his late thirties were behind them in a second squad car lucy glanced at the real estate overlooking the canal the elegant new colonials sachs had seen earlier and said nothing again sachs was struck by the forlorn quality of the houses and yards the absence of kids just like the streets of tanners corner children she reflected again then told herself lets not get into that lucy turned right on route then off onto the shoulder where theyd been just a half hour earlier the ridge overlooking the crime scenes jesse corns squad car pulled in behind the four of them walked down the embankment to the riverside and climbed into the skiff jesse took up the rowing position again muttered brother north of the paquo he said this with an ominous tone that sachs at first took to be a joke but then noticed that neither he nor the others were smiling on the far side of the river they climbed out and followed garretts and lydia s footsteps to the hunting blind where ed schaeffer had been stung then about fifty feet past it into the woods where the tracks vanished at sachs direction they fanned out moving in increasingly large circles looking for any signs of the direction garrett had gone they found nothing and returned to the place where the footprints disappeared lucy said to jesse you know that path the one those druggies scooted down after frank sturgis found em over last year he nodded he said to sachs its about fifty yards north that way he pointed garrettd know about it probably and its the best way to get through the woods and swamp here lets check it out ned said sachs wondered how to best handle the impending conflict and decided there was only one way headon being overly delicate wouldnt work not with three of them versus her alone jesse corn being she believed only amorously in her camp we should stay here until we hear from rhyme jesse kept a faint smile on his face tasting a morsel of divided loyalty lucy shook her head garrett had tove taken that path we dont know that for sure sachs said it does get a little thick round here jesse offered ned said all that plume grass and tuckahoe and mountain holly lot of creeper too you dont take that path theres no way to get through here and make any time well have to wait sachs said thinking of a passage from lincoln rhymes textbook on criminalistics physical evidence more investigations involving a suspect at large are ruined by giving in to the impulse to move quickly and engage in hot pursuit when in fact in most cases a slow examination of the evidence will point a clear path to the suspects door and permit a safer and more efficient arrest lucy kerr said its just that somebody from the city doesnt really understand the woods you head off that path itd slow your time by half he had tove stuck to it he couldve doubled back to the riverbank sachs pointed out maybe he had another boat hidden up or downstream thats true jesse said earning a dark glance from lucy a long moment of silence the four people standing immobile while gnats strafed them and they sweated in the merciless heat finally sachs said simply well wait sealing the decision she sat on what was surely the most uncomfortable rock in the entire woods and with feigned interest studied a woodpecker drilling fiercely into a tall oak in front of them primary scene first rhyme called to ben blackwater he nodded at the cluster of evidence on the fiberboard table lets do garretts running shoe first the one he dropped when he snatched lydia ben picked it up unzipped the plastic bag started to reach inside gloves rhyme ordered always wear latex gloves when handling evidence because of fingerprints the zoologist asked hurriedly pulling them on thats one reason the others contamination we dont want to confuse places youve been with places the perp has been sure right ben nodded his massive crewcut head aggressively as if he were fearful of forgetting this rule he shook the shoe peered into it looks like theres gravel or something inside hell i didnt have amelia ask for sterile examining boards rhyme looked around the room see that magazine there people ben picked it up shook his head its three weeks old i dont care how current the stories about leonardo dicaprios love life are rhyme muttered pull out the subscription inserts inside dont you hate those things but theyre good for us they come off the printing press nice and sterile so they make good miniexamining boards ben did as instructed and poured the dirt and stones onto the card put a sample in the microscope and let me take a look at it rhyme wheeled close to the table but the ocular piece was a few inches too high for him damn ben assessed the problem maybe i could hold it for you to look in rhyme gave a faint laugh it weighs close to thirty pounds no well have to find a but the zoologist picked up the instrument and with his massive arms held the scope very steady rhyme couldnt of course turn the focusing knobs but he saw enough to give him an idea of what the evidence was limestone chips and dust would thatve come from blackwater landing uhm ben said slowly doubt it mostly just mud and stuff run a sample of it through the chromatograph i want to see what else is in there ben mounted the sample inside and pressed the test button chromatography is a criminalists dream tool developed just after the turn of the century by a russian botanist though not much used until the s the device analyzes compounds such as foods drugs blood and trace elements and isolates the pure elements in them there are a halfdozen variations on the process but the most common type used in forensic science is the gas chromatograph which burns a sample of evidence the resulting vapors are then separated to indicate the component substances that make up the sample in a forensic science lab the chromatograph is usually connected to a mass spectrometer which can identify many of the substances specifically the gas chromatograph will only work with materials that can be vaporized burned at relatively low temperatures the limestone wouldnt ignite of course but rhyme wasnt interested in the rock he was interested in what trace materials had adhered to the dirt and gravel this would narrow down more specifically the places garrett had been itll take a little while rhyme said while were waiting lets look at the dirt in the treads of garretts shoe i tell you ben i love treads shoes and tires too theyre like sponges remember that yessir i will sir dig some out and lets see if it comes from someplace different from blackwater landing ben scraped the dirt onto another subscription card which he held in front of rhyme who examined it carefully as a forensic scientist he knew the importance of dirt it sticks to clothes it leaves trails like hansels and gretels bread crumbs to and from a perps house and it links criminal and crime scene as if they were shackled together there are approximately different shades of soil and if a sample from a crime scene is the identical color to the dirt in the perps backyard the odds are good that the perp was there similarity in the composition of the soils can bolster the connection too locard the great french criminalist developed a forensics principle named after him which holds that in every crime there is always some transfer between the perpetrator and the victim or the crime scene rhyme had found that second to blood in the case of an invasive homicide or assault dirt is the substance most often transferred however the problem with dirt as evidence is that its too prevalent in order for it to have any meaning forensically a bit of dirt whose source might be the criminal must be different from the dirt found naturally at the crime scene the first step in dirt analysis is to check known soil from the scene an exemplar against the sample the criminalist believes came from the perp rhyme explained this to ben and the big man picked up one bag of dirt which sachs had marked exemplar soil blackwater landingalong with the date and time of collection there was also a notation in a hand that was not sachs collected by deputy j corn rhyme pictured the young deputy eagerly scurrying off to do her bidding ben poured some of this dirt onto a third subscription card he set it beside the dirt hed dug out of garretts treads how do we compare them the young man asked looking over the instruments your eyes but just look at them see if the color of the unknown sample is different from the color of the known how do i do that rhyme forced himself to answer calmly you just look at them ben stared at one pile then the other back again once more and then once again come on come on it isnt that tricky rhyme struggled to be patient one of the hardest things in the world for him what do you see rhyme asked is the dirt from the two scenes different well i cant exactly tell sir i think ones lighter scope them in the comparison ben mounted the samples in a comparison microscope and looked through the eyepieces im not sure hard to say i guess maybe there is some difference let me see once again the massive muscles held the large microscope steady and rhyme peered into the eyepieces definitely different from the known rhyme said lightercolored and it has more crystal in it more granite and clay and different types of vegetation so its not from blackwater landing if were lucky it came from his hideyhole a faint smile crossed bens lips the first rhyme had seen what oh well thats what we call the cave a moray eel takes for his home the young mans smile vanished as rhymes stare told him that this was not the time or place for anecdotes the criminalist said when you get the results of the limestone on the chromatograph run the dirt from the treads yessir a moment later the screen of the computer attached to the chromatographspectrometer flickered and lines shaped like mountains and valleys appeared then a window popped up and the criminalist maneuvered closer in his wheelchair he bumped a table and the storm arrow jerked to the left jostling rhyme shit bens eyes went wide with alarm are you all right sir yes yes yes rhyme muttered whats that fucking table doing there we dont need it ill get it out of the way ben blurted grabbing the heavy table with one hand as if it were made of balsa wood and stashing it in the corner sorry i shouldve thought of that rhyme ignored the zoologists uncomfortable contrition and scanned the screen large amounts of nitrates phosphates and ammonia this was very troubling but rhyme said nothing just yet he wanted to see what substances were in the dirt that ben had dug out of the treads and shortly these results too were on the screen rhyme sighed more nitrates more ammonia a lot of it high concentrations again also more phosphates detergent too and something else what the hell is that where ben asked leaning toward the screen at the bottom the databases identified it as camphene you ever hear of that no sir well garrett walked through some of it whatever it is he looked at the evidence bag now what else do we have that white tissue sachs found ben picked up the bag held it close to rhyme there was a lot of blood on the tissue he glanced at the other tissue sample the kleenex that sachs had found in garretts room they the same look the same ben said both white both the same size rhyme said give them to jim bell tell him i want a dna analysis the drivethrough variety the uhm whats that sir the downanddirty dna the polymerase chain reaction we dont have time for the rflp thats the oneinsixbillion version i just want to know if its billy stails blood or somebody elses have somebody scrounge up samples from billy stails body and from mary beth and lydia samples of what rhyme forced himself once more to remain patient of genetic material any tissue from billys body for the women getting some hair would be the easiest as long as the bulbs attached have a deputy pick up a brush or comb from mary beths and lydia s bathrooms and get it over to the same lab thats running the test on the kleenex the man took the bag and left the room he returned a moment later theyll have it in an hour or two sir theyre going to send it to the med center in avery not to the state police deputy bell i mean sheriff bellthought that would be easier an hour rhyme muttered grimacing way too long he couldnt help wondering if this delay might be just long enough to keep them from finding the insect boy before he killed lydia or mary beth ben stood with his bulky arms at his sides uhm i could call them back i told em how important it was but do you want me to thats okay ben well keep going here thom time for our charts the aide wrote on the blackboard as rhyme dictated to him found at primary crime scene blackwater landing kleenex with blood limestone dust nitrates phosphate ammonia detergent camphene rhyme gazed at it more questions than answers fish out of water his eye fell on the pile of dirt that ben had dug out of the boys shoe then something occurred to him jim he shouted his voice booming and startling both thom and ben jim where the hell is he jim what the sheriff came running into the room alarmed something wrong how many people work in the building here i dont know bout twenty and they live all over the county moren that some travel from pasquotank albemarle and chowan i want em all down here now what everybody in the building i want soil samples from their shoes wait and the floor mats in their cars soil soil dirt mud you know i want it now bell retreated rhyme said to ben that rack over there the zoologist lumbered toward the table on which was a long rack holding a number of test tubes its a densitygradient tester it profiles the specific gravity of materials like dirt he nodded ive heard of it never used one its easy those bottles there rhyme was looking toward two dark glass bottles one labeled tetra the other ethanol youre going to mix those the way i tell you and fill up the tubes close to the top okay whats that going to do start mixing ill tell you when were through ben mixed the chemicals according to rhymes instructions and then filled twenty of the tubes with alternating bands of differentcolored liquids the ethanol and the tetrabromoethane pour a little of the soil sample from garretts shoe into the tube on the left the soilll separate and thatll give us a profile well get samples from employees here who live in different areas of the county if any of them match garretts that means the dirt he picked up could be from nearby bell arrived with the first of the employees and rhyme explained what he was going to do the sheriff grinned in admiration thats an idea and a half lincoln cousin roland knew what he was doing when he sang your praises but the half hour spent on this exercise was futile none of the samples submitted from the people in the building matched the dirt in the treads of garretts shoe rhyme scowled as the last sample of dirt from the employees settled into the tube damn was a good try though bell said a waste of precious time should i pitch out the samples ben asked no never throw out your exemplars without recording them he said firmly then remembered not to be too abrasive in his instructions the big man was here only by the grace of family ties thom help us out sachs asked for a polaroid camera from the state its got to be here someplace find it and take closeups of all the tubes mark down the name of each employee on the back of the pictures the aide found the camera and went to work now lets analyze what sachs found at garretts foster parents house the pants in that bag see if theres anything in the cuffs ben carefully opened the plastic bag and examined the trousers yessir some pine needles good did they fall off the branches or are they cut cut looks like excellent that means he did something to them he cut them on purpose and that purpose may have to do with the crime we dont know what that is yet but id guess its camouflage i smell skunk ben said sniffing the clothes rhyme said thats what amelia said doesnt do us any good though not yet anyway why not the zoologist asked because theres no way to link a wild animal to a specific location a stationary skunk would be helpful a mobile one isnt lets look at the trace on the clothes cut a couple pieces of the pants and run them through the chromatograph while they waited for the results rhyme examined the rest of the evidence from the boys room let me see that notebook thom the aide flipped through the pages for rhyme they contained only bad drawings of insects he shook his head nothing helpful there those other books rhyme nodded toward the four hardbound books sachs had found in his room one the miniature world had been read so often it was falling apart rhyme noticed passages were circled or underlined or marked with asterisks but none of the passages gave any clue as to where the boy might have spent time they seemed to be trivia about insects he told thom to put them aside rhyme then looked over what garrett had hidden in the wasp jar money pictures of mary beth and of the boys family the old key the fishing line the cash was just a crumpled mass of fives and tens and silver dollars there were rhyme noted no helpful jottings in the margins of the bills where many criminals write messages or plans a fast way to get rid of incriminating instructions to coconspirators is to buy something and send the note off into the black hole of circulation rhyme had ben run the polilight an alternative light source over the money and found that both the paper and the silver dollars contained easily a hundred different partial fingerprints too many to provide any helpful clues there was no price sticker on the picture frame or fishing line and thus no way to trace them to stores garrett mightve frequented threepoundtest fishing line rhyme commented looking at the spool thats light isnt it ben hardly catch a bluegill with that sir the results of the trace on the boys slacks flickered onto the computer screen rhyme read aloud kerosene more ammonia more nitrates and that camphene again another chart thom if youd be so kind he dictated found at second crime scene garetts room skunk musk cut pine needles drawings of insects pictures of mary beth and family insect books fishing line money unknown key kerosene ammonia nitrates camphene rhyme stared at the charts finally he said thom make a call mel cooper the aide picked up the phone dialed from memory cooper who worked with nypd forensics weighed in at probably half bens weight he looked like a timid actuary and he was one of the top forensic lab men in the country can you speaker me thom a button was pushed and a moment later the soft tenor of coopers voice said hello lincoln something tells me youre not in the hospital howd you figure that one out mel didnt take much deductive reasoning caller id says paquenoke county government building delaying your operation no just helping out on a case here listen mel i dont have much time and i need some information about a substance called camphene ever hear of it no but hold on ill go into the database rhyme heard frantic clicking cooper was also the fastest keyboarder rhyme had ever met okay here we go interesting i dont need interestingmel i need facts its a terpene carbon and hydrogen derived from plants it used to be an ingredient in pesticides but it was banned in the early eighties its main use was in the late s it was used for fuel in lamps it was stateoftheart at the time replaced whale oil common as natural gas back then youre trying to track down an unsub hes not an unknown subject mel hes extremely known we just cant find him old lamps so trace camphene probably means that hes been hiding out someplace built in the nineteenth century likely but theres another possibility says here that camphenes only present use is in fragrances what sort perfumes aftershave and cosmetics mostly rhyme considered this what percentage of a finished fragrance product is camphene he asked trace only parts per thousand rhyme had always told his forensic teams never to be afraid to make bold deductions in analyzing the evidence still he was painfully aware of the short time the two women might have to live and he felt they had only enough resources now to pursue one of these potential leads well have to play the odds on this one he announced well assume the camphenes from old lanterns not fragrances and act accordingly now listen mel im also going to be sending you a photocopy of a key i need you to trace it easy from a car i dont know house dont know recent no clue cooper said dubiously may be less easy than i thought but get it to me and ill do what i can when they disconnected rhyme ordered ben to photocopy both sides of the key and fax it to cooper then he tried sachs on the radio it wasnt working he called her on her cell phone lo sachs its me whats wrong with the radio she asked theres no reception which way should we go rhyme were across the river but we lost the trail and frankly her voice fell to a whisper the nativesre restless lucy wants to boil me for dinner ive got the basic analysis done but i dont know what to do with all the data im waiting for that man from the factory in blackwater landing henry davett he should be here any minute but listen sachs theres something else i have to tell you i found significant trace of ammonia and nitrates on garretts clothes and in the shoe he lost a bomb she asked her hollow voice revealing her dismay looks that way and that fishing line you founds too light to do any serious fishing i think hes using it for trip wires to set off the device go slow look for traps if you see something that looks like a clue just remember that it might be rigged will do rhyme sit tight i hope to have some directions for you soon garrett and lydia had covered another three or four miles the sun was high now it was noon maybe or close to it and the day was hot as a tailpipe the bottled water that lydia had drunk at the quarry had quickly leached from her system and she was faint from the heat and thirst as if he sensed this garrett said well be there soon its cooler and i got more water the ground was open here broken forests marshes no houses no roads there were many old paths branching in different directions it would be almost impossible for anyone searching for them to figure out which way theyd gone the paths were like a maze garrett nodded down one of these narrow paths rocks to the left a twentyfoot drop off to the right they walked about a halfmile along this route and then he stopped he looked back when he seemed satisfied that no one was nearby he stepped into the bushes and returned with a nylon string like thin fishing line that he ran across the path just above the ground it was nearly impossible to see he connected it to a stick which in turn propped up a three or fourgallon glass bottle filled with a milky liquid there was some residue on the side and she got a whiff of it ammonia she was horrified was it a bomb she wondered as a nurse on er duty shed treated several teenagers whod been hurt making homemade explosives she remembered how their blackened skin had actually been shattered by the detonation you cant do that she whispered i dont want any shit from you he snapped his fingernails im gonna finish up here and then were going home home lydia stared numb at the large bottle as he covered it with boughs garrett pulled her down the path once more despite the increasing heat of the day he was moving faster now and she struggled to keep up with garrett who seemed to get dirtier by the minute covered with dust and flecks of dead leaves it was as if he were slowly turning into an insect himself every step they got farther from civilization it reminded her of some story she was supposed to read in school but never finished up there garrett nodded toward a hill theres a place well stay go on to the ocean in the morning her uniform was soaked with sweat the top two buttons of the white outfit were undone and the white of her bra was visible the boy kept glancing at the rounded skin of her breasts but she hardly cared at the moment she wanted only to escape from the outside to get into some cooling shade wherever he was taking her fifteen minutes later they broke from the woods and into a clearing in front of them was an old gristmill surrounded by reeds cattails tall grass it sat beside a stream that had largely been taken over by the swamp one wing of the mill had burnt down amid the rubble stood a scorched chimney what was called a sherman monument after the union general who burned houses and buildings during his march to the sea leaving a landscape of blackened chimneys behind him garrett led her into the front part of the mill the portion that had been untouched by the fire he pushed her through the doorway and swung the heavy oak door shut bolted it for a long moment he stood listening when he seemed satisfied that no one was following he handed her another bottle of water she fought the urge to gulp down the whole container she filled her mouth let it sit feeling the sting against her parched mouth then swallowed slowly when she finished he took the bottle away from her untaped her hands and retaped them behind her back you have to do that she asked angrily he rolled his eyes at the foolishness of the question he eased her to the floor sit there and keep your goddamn mouth shut garrett sat against the opposite wall and closed his eyes lydia cocked her head toward the window and listened for the sounds of helicopters or swamp boats or the baying of the search partys dogs but she heard only garretts breathing which she decided in her despair was really the sound of god himself abandoning her a figure appeared in the doorway accompanying jim bell he was a man in his fifties thinning hair and a round distinguished face a blue blazer was over his arm and his white shirt was perfectly pressed and heavily starched though darkened with sweat stains under the arms a striped tie was stuck in place with a bar rhyme had thought this might be henry davett but the criminalists eyes were one aspect of his physical body that had come through his accident unscathed his vision was perfect and he read the monogram on the mans tie bar from ten feet away wwjd william walter wayne rhyme didnt have a clue who he might be the man looked at rhyme squinted appraisingly and nodded then jim bell said henry id like you to meet lincoln rhyme so not a monogram this was davett rhyme nodded back to the man concluding that the tie bar had probably been his fathers william ward jonathan davett he stepped into the room his fast eyes took in the equipment ah you know chromatographs rhyme asked observing a flicker of recognition my research and development department has a couple of them but this model he shook his head critically they dont even make it anymore whyre you using it state budget henry bell said ill send one over not necessary this is garbage the man said gruffly ill get a new one here in twenty minutes rhyme said getting the evidence isnt the problem interpreting it is thats why i can use your help this is ben kerr my forensic assistant they shook hands ben seemed relieved that another ablebodied person was in the room sit down henry bell said rolling an office chair up to him the man sat and leaning forward somewhat carefully smoothed his tie the gesture his posture the tiny dots of his confident eyes coalesced in rhymes perception and he thought charming smart and one hell of a tough businessman rhyme wondered again about wwjd he wasnt sure hed solved the puzzle this is about those women who got kidnapped isnt it bell nodded nobodys really coming right out and saying it but in the back of our minds he looked at rhyme and ben were thinking garrett mightve already raped and killed mary beth dumped her body someplace twentyfour hours the sheriff continued but weve still got a chance to save lydia were hoping and we have to stop garrett before he goes after somebody else the businessman said angrily and billy that was such a shame i heard he was just being a good samaritan trying to save mary beth and got himself killed garrett crushed his head in with a shovel it was pretty bad so times at a premium what can i do davett turned to rhyme you said interpreting something we have some clues as to where garretts been and where he might be headed with lydia i was hoping you might know something about the area around here and might be able to help us davett nodded i know the lay of the land pretty well i have geology and chemical engineering degrees ive also lived in tanners corner all my life so im pretty familiar with paquenoke county rhyme nodded toward the evidence charts can you look at those and give us any thoughts were trying to link those clues to a specific location bell added itll probably be someplace they could get to by foot garrett doesnt like cars he wont drive davett put on eyeglasses and eased his head back looking up at the wall found at primary crime scene blackwater landing kleenex with blood limestone dust nitrates phosphate ammonia detergent camphene found at secondary crime scene garetts room skunk musk cut pine needles drawings of insects pictures of mary beth and family insect books fishing line money unknown key kerosene ammonia nitrates camphene davett scanned the list up and down taking his time eyes narrowing several times a faint frown nitrates and ammonia you know what that could be rhyme nodded i think he left some explosive devices to stop the search party ive told them about it grimacing davett returned to the chart the camphene i think that was used in old lanterns like coaloil lamps thats right so we think the place hes got mary beth is old nineteenth century there must be thousands of old houses and barns and shacks around here what else limestone dust thats not going to narrow things down much theres a huge ridge of limestone that runs all the way through paquenoke county it used to be a big moneymaker here he rose and moved his finger diagonally along the map from the southern edge of the great dismal swamp to the southwest from location l to c you could find limestone anywhere along that line that wont do you much good but he stepped back crossed his arms the phosphates helpful north carolina s a major producer of phosphate but its not mined around here thats farther south so combined with the detergent id say hes been near polluted water hell jim bell said that just means hes been in the paquenoke no davett said the paquos clean as well water its dark but its fed by the dismal swamp and lake drummond oh its magic water the sheriff said whats that rhyme asked davett explained some of us oldtimers call the water from the great dismal magic water its full of tannic acid from decaying cypress and juniper trees the acid kills bacteria so it stays fresh for a long time before refrigeration theyd use it for drinking water on sailing ships people used to think it had magic properties so rhyme said never much interested in local myths if they couldnt help him forensically if its not the paquenoke where would the phosphates place him davett looked at bell whered he kidnap the girl most recently same place as mary beth blackwater landing bell touched the map and then moved his finger north to location h crossed the river went to a hunting blind about here then headed north a halfmile then the search party lost the trail theyre waiting for us to give them directions oh then theres no question davett said with encouraging confidence the businessman moved his finger to the east he crossed stone creek here see it some of the waterfalls there look like foam on beer theres so much detergent and phosphate in the water it starts out near hobeth falls up north and theres a ton of runoff they dont know a thing about planning and zoning in that town good rhyme said now once he crossed the creek any thoughts about which way hed go davett again consulted the chart if you found pine needles id have to guess this way tapping the map at i and j theres pine everywhere in north carolina but around here most of the forests are oak oldgrowth cedar cypress and gum the only big pine forest i know of is northeast here on the way to the great dismal davett stared at the charts for a moment longer shook his head not much else i can say im afraid how many search parties you have out one rhyme said what davett turned to him frowning just one youre joking no bell said sounding defensive under the mans firm crossexamination well how big is it four deputies bell said davett scoffed thats crazy he waved at the map youve got hundreds of square miles thiss garrett hanlon the insect boy he just about lives north of the paquo he can outmaneuver you in a minute the sheriff cleared his throat mr rhyme here thinks its better not to use too many people you cant use too many people in a situation like this davett said to rhyme you should take fifty men give them rifles and have them beat the bushes till you find him youre doing it all wrong rhyme noticed that ben observed davetts lecture with a mortified expression the zoologist would of course assume that one had to take the kidglove approach when arguing with crips the criminalist though said calmly a big manhunt would just drive garrett to kill lydia and then go to ground no davett said emphatically itd scare him into letting her go ive got about fortyfive people working a shift at the factory now well a dozen are women we couldnt get them involved but the men let me get them out well find some guns turn them loose around stone creek rhyme could just imagine what thirty or forty amateur bounty hunters would do in a search like this he shook his head no this is the way to handle it their eyes met and for a moment there was a thick silence in the room davett shrugged and looked away first but this disengagement was not a concession that rhyme might be correct it was just the opposite an emphatic protest that by ignoring his advice rhyme and bell were proceeding at their own peril henry bell said i agreed to let mr rhyme run the show were pretty thankful to him part of the sheriffs comments were intended for rhyme himself implicitly apologizing for davett but for his part rhyme was delighted to be on the receiving end of davetts bluntness it was a shocking admission for him but rhyme who believed not at all in omens felt the mans presence now was a sign that the surgery would go well and would have some beneficial effect on his condition he felt this because of the brief exchange that had just occurred in which this tough businessman had looked him in the eye and told him he was deadwrong davett didnt even notice rhymes condition all he saw was rhymes actions his decision his attitude his damaged body was irrelevant to davett dr weavers magic hands would move him a step closer to a place where more people would treat him this way the businessman said ill pray for those girls then turned to rhyme ill pray for you too sir the glance lasted a moment longer than a valediction normally would and rhyme sensed the last promise was meant sincerely and literally he walked out the door henrys a bit opinionated bell said when davett had left and hes got his own interests here right rhyme asked the girl who died from the hornets last year meg blanchard got herself stung times rhyme nodded bell continued she worked for henrys company went to the same church he and his family belong to too hes no different from most folks here he thinks the townd be better off without garrett hanlon in it he just tends to think his way is the best way to handle things church prayer rhyme suddenly understood something he said to bell davetts tie bar the j stands for jesus bell laughed you got that right oh henryd drive a competitor out of business without a blink but hes a deacon in church goes three times a week or so one of the reasons hed like to send an army out after garrett is that hes thinking that the boys probably a heathen rhyme still couldnt figure out the rest of the initials i give up whatre the other letters stands for what would jesus do thats what all those good christians round here ask themselves when theyre facing a big decision i myself dont have a clue what hed do in a case like this but ill tell you what im doing calling up lucy and your friend and gettin em on garretts trail stone creek jesse corn said after sachs had relayed rhymes message to the search party the deputy pointed a halfmile that way he started through the brush followed by lucy and amelia ned spoto was in the rear his pale eyes scanning the surroundings uneasily in five minutes they broke out of the tangle and stepped onto a welltrod path jesse motioned them along it to the right east this is the path sachs asked lucy the one you thought hed gone down thats right lucy responded you were right sachs said quietly for her ears only but we still had to wait no you had to show who was in charge lucy said brusquely thats absolutely right sachs thought then added but now we know theres probably a bomb on the trail we didnt know that before i wouldve been looking for traps anyway lucy fell silent and she continued along the path eyes fixed on the ground proving that she would in fact have been looking in ten minutes they came to stone creek its water milky and frothing with pollutant suds on the bank they found two sets of footprints sneaker prints in a small size but deep probably left by a heavyset woman lydia undoubtedly and a mans bare feet garrett had apparently discarded his remaining shoe lets cross here jesse said i know the pine woods that mr rhyme mentioned thiss the shortest way to get to them sachs started toward the water stop jesse called abruptly she froze hand on her pistol crouching whats the matter she asked lucy and ned snickering at her reaction were sitting on rocks taking off their shoes and socks you get your socks wet and keep walking lucy said youll be standing in need of about a dozen bandages fore you go a hundred yards blisters dont know much bout hiking do you ned asked the policewoman jesse corn gave an exasperated laugh at his fellow deputy cause she lives in the cityned just like i dont figure youd be an expert on subways and skyscrapers sachs ignored both the chide and the gallant defense and pulled off her short boots and black anklelength socks rolled her jeans cuffs up they started through the stream the water was icecold and felt wonderful she regretted when the short trek through the creek which jesse pronounced crick was over they waited a few minutes on the other side for their feet to dry then pulled on socks and shoes then searched the shore until they found the footprints once more the party followed the trail into the woods but as the ground grew drier and more tangled with brush they lost the tracks the pine treesre that way jesse said he pointed northeast makes the most sense for them to go straight through there following his general guidance they hiked for another twenty minutes singlefile scanning the ground for trip wires then the oak and holly and sedge gave way to juniper and hemlock ahead of them a quarter mile was a huge line of pine trees but there was no longer any sign of the kidnappers or his victims footprints no clue as to where theyd entered the forest too damn big lucy muttered howre we going to find the trail in there lets fan out ned suggested he too looked dismayed at the tangle of flora in front of them if hes left a bomb here itll be the dickens to see it they were about to spread out when sachs lifted her head wait stay here she ordered then started slowly through the brush eyes on the ground looking for traps only fifty feet away from the deputies in a grove of some flowering trees now barren and surrounded by rotting petals she found garretts and lydias footprints in the dusty earth they led to a clear path that headed into the forest they came this way she called follow my footprints i checked it for traps a moment later the three deputies joined her howd you find it asked infatuated jesse corn what do you smell she asked skunk ned said sachs said garrett had skunk scent on the pants i found in his house i figured hed come this way before i just followed the smell here jesse laughed and said to ned hows that for a city girl ned rolled his eyes and they all started up the path moving slowly toward the line of pine trees several times along this route they passed large barren areas the trees and bushes were dead sachs felt uneasy as they trekked through these the search party was completely exposed to attack halfway through the second clearing and after another bad scare when an animal or bird rustled the brush ringing the bare dirt she pulled out her cell phone rhyme you there what is it found anything weve picked up the trail but tell me did any of the evidence point to garrett doing any shooting no he answered why therere some big barren patches in the woods here acid rain or pollutions killed all the plants we have zero cover its a perfect place for an ambush i dont see any trace thats consistent with firearms weve got the nitrates but if that was from ammunition wedve found burnt powder grains cleaning solvent grease cordite fulminate of mercury theres none of that which just means he hasnt fired a weapon in a while she said true she hung up looking around cautiously now skittish they walked for several miles more surrounded by the turpentiney scent of the air lulled by the heat the buzzing of insects they were still on the path that garrett and lydia had started along though their footsteps were no longer visible sachs wondered if theyd missed stop lucy kerr cried she dropped to her knees ned and jesse froze sachs drew her pistol in a fraction of a second then she noticed what lucy was referring to the silvery glimmer of a wire across the path man ned said howd you see that its fullup invisible lucy didnt respond she crawled to the side of the path following the wire gently pulled aside bushes hot crisp leaves rustled as she lifted them out one by one want me to get the bomb squad over here from elizabeth city jesse asked shhhh lucy ordered the deputys careful hands moved aside the leaves a millimeter at a time sachs was holding her breath in a recent case shed been the victim of an antipersonnel bomb she hadnt been badly injured but she remembered that in a portion of a second the astonishing noise the heat the pressure wave and debris had enveloped her completely she didnt want that to happen again she knew too that many homemade pipe bombs were filled with bbs or ball bearings sometimes dimes or pennies as deadly shrapnel would garrett do this too she remembered his picture his dim sunken eyes she remembered the jars of insects remembered the death of that woman in blackwater landing stung to death remembered ed schaeffer in a waspvenom coma yes she decided garrett would definitely rig the most vicious trap he could think of she cringed as lucy eased the last leaf off the pile the deputy sighed sat back on her haunches its a spider she muttered sachs saw it too it wasnt fishing line at all just a long string of web they rose to their feet spider ned said laughing jesse chuckled too but their voices were humorless and sachs noticed as they started down the path once more each one of them carefully lifted their feet well over the glistening strand lincoln rhyme head back eyes squinting at the chalkboard found at secondary crime scene garetts room skunk musk cut pine needles drawings of insects pictures of mary beth and family insect books fishing line money unknown key kerosene ammonia nitrates camphene he sighed angrily felt completely helpless the evidence was inexplicable to him his eyes focused on insect books then glanced at ben so youre a student are you thats right sir read a lot ill bet how i spend most of my time if im not in the field rhyme was gazing at the spines of the books that amelia had brought from garretts room he mused what do a persons favorite books say about them other than the obvious that theyre interested in the subject of the books i mean hows that well if a person has mostly selfhelp books that says one thing about them if hes got mostly novels that says something else these books of garretts are all nonfiction guidebooks what do you make of that i wouldnt know sir the big man glanced once at rhymes legs involuntarily it seemed then he turned his attention to the evidence chart he mumbled i cant really figure out people animals make a lot more sense to me theyre a lot more social more predictable more consistent than people hell of a lot more clever too then he realized he was rambling and with a ruddy blush stopped talking rhyme glanced again at the books thom could you get me the turning frame rigged to an ecu an environmentalcontrol unit that rhyme could manipulate with his one working finger the device used a rubber armature to turn pages of books its in the van isnt it i think so i hope you packed it i told you to pack it i said i think it is the aide said evenly ill go see if its there he left the room hell of a lot more clever too thom returned a moment later with the turning frame ben rhyme called that book on top there the big man asked staring at the books it was the field guide to insects of north carolina put it in the frame he stepped on his urgency if you would be so kind the aide showed ben how to mount the book then plugged a different set of wires into the ecu underneath rhymes left hand he read the first page found nothing helpful then his mind ordered his ring finger to move an impulse shot from the brain spiraled down through a tiny surviving axon in his spinal cord past a million of its dead kin then streaked along rhymes arm and into his hand the finger flicked a fraction of an inch the armatures own finger slid sideways the page turned they followed the path through the forest surrounded by the oily scent of pine and the sweet fragrance from one of the plants they passed lucy kerr recognized it as a chicken grape as she stared at the path in front of them looking for trip wires she was suddenly aware that they hadnt seen any of garretts or lydia s footprints for a long time she swatted what she thought was a bug on her neck but it turned out to be just a rivulet of sweat tickling as it ran down her skin lucy felt dirty today other times evenings and days off she loved to be outside in her garden as soon as she got home from her tour at the sheriffs department she would pull on her faded plaid shorts and tshirt and navyblue running shoes that trailed stitching and would go to work in one of the three cuts of property surrounding her pale green colonial home that bud had eagerly signed over to her outright as part of the divorce laid low by a fever of guilt there lucy tended her longspurred violets yellow lady slippers fringed orchids and orange bell lilies she scooped dirt led plants up trellises watered them and whispered encouragements as if she were speaking to the children shed been so certain she and buddy would one day have sometimes after an assignment took her into the carolina hinterland serving a warrant or inquiring why the honda or toyota hidden in someones garage happened to be owned by someone else lucy would notice a fledgling plant and the police work disposed of would uproot it and take it home with her like a foundling shed adopted her solomons seal this way a tuckahoe plant too and a beautiful indigo bush which had grown six feet tall under her care her eyes now slipped to what she was presently passing on this anxious pursuit of theirs an elderberry a mountain holly plume grass they passed a nice evening primrose then some cattails and wild rice taller than any of the search party and with leaves sharp as knives and here was a squaw root a parasitic herb which lucy kerr also knew by another name cancer root she glanced at that one once then looked back to the trail the path led to a steep hill a series of rocks about twenty feet high lucy scaled the incline easily but at the top she stopped thinking no somethings wrong here beside her amelia sachs climbed up to the plateau paused a moment later jesse and ned appeared jesse was breathing hard but ned a swimmer and outdoorsman was taking the hike in stride what is it amelia asked lucy assessing the frown this doesnt make any sense for garrett to come this way weve been following the path like mr rhyme told us jesse said its the only stretch of pine weve come across garretts prints were leading this way they werebut we havent seen them for a while why dont you think hed come this way amelia asked look whats growing here she pointed more and more swamp plants and now were on this rise we can see the ground better look how marshy its getting come on think about it jesse wheres this going to get garrett were headed right for the great dismal whats that amelia asked her the great dismal a huge swamp one of the biggest on the east coast ned explained lucy continued theres no cover there no houses no roads the best he could do would be to slog his way into virginia but thatd take days ned spoto added and this time of year they dont make enough insect repellent to keep you from getting eaten alive not to mention snakes anyplace around here they could hide in caves houses sachs looked around ned said no caverns maybe a few old buildings but whats happened is the water tables changed the swamps coming this way and a lot of the old houses and cabinsre submerged lucys right if garrett came this way hes heading for a dead end lucy said i think we ought to turn around she thought that ameliad throw a hissy fit at this suggestion but the woman simply pulled out her cell phone and made a call she said into the phone were in the pine forest rhyme theres a path but we cant find any sign that garrett came along here lucy says it doesnt make any sense for him to come this way she says its mostly swamp northeast of here theres no place for him to go lucy said im thinking hed head west or south back across the river that way he could get to millerton jesse suggested lucy nodded couple of big factories around there closed when the companies took their business to mexico banks foreclosed on a lot of property therere dozens of abandoned houses he could hide in or southeastjesse suggested thats where id go follow route or the rail line theres a slew of old houses and barns that way too amelia repeated this to rhyme as lucy kerr thought what a strange man he is so terribly afflicted and yet so supremely confident the policewoman from new york listened then hung up lincoln says to keep going the evidence doesnt suggest he went in those directions not like there arent any pine trees to the west and south lucy snapped but the redhead was shaking her head that might be logical but its not what the evidence shows we keep going ned and jesse were looking from one woman to the other lucy glanced at jesses face and saw the ridiculous crush she obviously wasnt going to get any support from him she dug in no i think we should go back see if we can find where they turned off the path amelia lowered her head stared right into lucys eyes ill tell you what we can call jim bell if you want a reminder that jim had declared that that damn lincoln rhyme was running the operation and that hed put amelia in charge of the search party this was crazy a man and woman whod probably never been in the tar heel state before this two people who knew nothing of the people or the geography of the area telling lifelong residents how to do their job but lucy kerr knew that shed signed on to do a job where like the army you followed the chain of command all right she muttered angrily but for the record im against going that way it doesnt make any sense she turned and started along the path leaving the others behind her footsteps growing silent suddenly as she walked over a thick blanket of pine needles that covered the path amelias phone rang and she slowed as she took the call lucy strode quickly ahead of her over the thick bed of needles trying to control her anger there was no way garrett hanlon would come this way it was a waste of time they should have dogs they should call elizabeth city and get the state police choppers out they should then the world became a blur and she was tumbling forward giving a short scream her hands outstretched to catch her fall jesus lucy fell hard onto the path the breath knocked out of her pine needles digging into her palms dont move amelia sachs said climbing to her feet after tackling the deputy what the hell dyou do that for lucy gasped her hands stinging from the impact with the ground dont move ned and jesse you either ned and jesse froze hands on their weapons looking around not sure what was going on amelia wincing as she stood stepped cautiously off the pine needles and found a long stick in the woods picked it up she moved forward slowly slipping the branch into the ground two feet in front of lucy where shed been about to step the stick disappeared through a pile of pine boughs its a trap but theres no trip wire lucy said i was looking carefully amelia lifted away the boughs and the needles they rested on a network of fishing line and covered a pit about two feet deep the fish line wasnt a trip wire ned said it was to make that a deadfall pit lucy you nearly stepped right in it and inside there a bomb jesse asked amelia said to him let me have your flashlight he handed it to her she shined the beam into the hole then backed up quickly what is it lucy asked no bomb amelia responded hornets nest ned looked christ what a bastard amelia carefully lifted off the rest of the boughs exposing the hole and the nest which was about the size of a football man ned muttered closing his eyes undoubtedly considering what it would have been like to find a hundred stinging wasps clustered around your thighs and waist lucy rubbed her hands together they smarted from the fall she rose to her feet howd you know i didnt that was lincoln on the phone he was reading through garretts books there was an underlined passage about some insect called an ant lion it digs a pit and stings its enemy to death when it falls in garrett had circled it and the ink was just a few days old rhyme remembered the cut pine needles and the fishing line he figured that the boy might dig a trap and told me to look for a bed of pine boughs on the path lets burn the nest out jesse said no amelia said but its dangerous lucy agreed with the policewoman a fired give away our position and garrettd know where we are just leave it uncovered so people can see it well come back afterward and take care of it hardly anybody comes along here anyway amelia nodded she made a call on her phone we found it rhyme nobody got hurt there was no bomb he put a hornets nest inside okay well be careful keep reading that book let us know if you find anything else they started down the path once more and covered a good quarter mile before lucy found it in her to say thanks yall were right about him coming this way i was wrong she hesitated for another long moment then added jim made a good choice bringing you down from new york for this i wasnt real crazy about it at first but i wont argue with results amelia frowned bringing us down what do you mean to help out jim didnt do that what lucy asked no no we were over at the medical center in avery lincoln s having some surgery jim heard we were going to be here so he came by this morning to ask if wed look at some evidence a long pause then lucy gave a laugh as the relief flooded through her i thought hed scrounged up county money to fly yall down here after the kidnapping yesterday amelia shook her head the surgerys not till day after tomorrow we had some free time thats all that boy jim he never said a word about it he can be the quiet one sometimes you were worried he didnt think you could handle the case i guess thats exactly what i thought jims cousin works with us in new york he told jim we were coming down for a couple of weeks wait you mean roland lucy asked sure i know him knew his wife too before she passed his boysre dears had them over for a barbecue not long ago amelia said lucy laughed again i guess i was being paranoid here so you were over at avery the medical center thats right thats where lydia johansson works you know shes a nurse there i didnt a dozen memories flickered through lucy kerrs mind some she was warmly touched by some she wanted to avoid like the swarm of wasps shed nearly stirred up in garretts trap she didnt know whether she wanted to tell any of this to amelia sachs or not what she settled for was thats why im pretty eager to save her i had some medical problems a few years ago and lydia was one of my nurses shes a good person the best well save her amelia said and she said it with a tone that lucy sometimes not often but sometimes heard in her own voice a tone that didnt leave any doubt they walked more slowly now the trap had spooked them all and the heat was truly excruciating lucy asked amelia that surgery your friends going to have its for his situation yep whats that look lucy asked noticing a darkness cross the womans face it probably wont do anything then whys he doing it amelia explained theres a chance it might help small chance its experimental nobody with the kind of injury he has as serious as that has ever improved and you dont want him to go through with it i dont no why not amelia hesitated because it could kill him or make him even worse you talked to him about it yes but it didnt do any good lucy said not a bit lucy nodded i figured hes a man whos a bit muley amelia said thats putting it mildly a crash sounded near them in the brush and by the time lucys hand found her pistol amelia had drawn a careful bead on a wild turkeys chest the four members of the search party smiled but the amusement lasted for only a moment replaced by edginess as adrenaline eased through their hearts guns replaced in holsters eyes scanning the path they continued forward conversation on hold for the time being there were several categories people fell into when it came to rhymes injury some took the joking inyourface approach crip humor no prisoners taken some like henry davett ignored his condition completely most did what ben was doing tried to pretend that rhyme didnt exist and prayed that they could escape at the earliest possible moment it was this response that rhyme hated the most it was one of the most blatant reminders of how different he was but he had no time to dwell on his surrogate assistants attitude garrett was leading lydia deeper and deeper into the wilderness and mary beth mcconnell might be close to dying from suffocation or dehydration or a wound jim bell walked into the room maybe theres some good news from the hospital ed schaeffer said something to one of the nurses went unconscious again right after but im taking it as a good sign whatd he say rhyme asked something hed seen on that map she said it sounded like important then olive bell walked to the map touched a location to the southeast of tanners corner theres a development here they named the roads after plants and fruits and things one of thems olive street but thats way south of stone creek should i tell lucy and amelia to check it out i think we ought to ah the eternal conflict rhyme reflected trust evidence or trust witnesses if he picked wrong lydia or mary beth might die they should stay where they are north of the river you sure bell asked doubtfully yes okay bell said the phone rang and with a firm press of his left ring finger rhyme answered it sachs voice clattered into his headset were at a dead end rhyme therere four or five paths here going in different directions and we dont have a clue which way garrett went i dont have anything more for you sachs were trying to identify more of the evidence nothing more in the books nothing specific but its fascinating theyre pretty serious reading for a sixteenyearold hes smarter than i would have figured where are you exactly sachs rhyme looked up ben go to the map please he aimed his massive frame at the wall and took up a position beside it sachs consulted someone else in the search party then said about four miles northeast of where we forded stone creek pretty much in a straight line rhyme repeated this to ben who put his hand on a part of the map location j near bens massive forefinger was an unidentified lshaped formation ben you have any idea what that square is think thats the old quarry oh jesus rhyme muttered shaking his head in frustration what ben asked alarmed that hed done something wrong why the hell didnt anybody tell me there was a quarry near there bens round face looked even more puffed up than it had been he was taking the accusation personally i didnt really but rhyme wasnt even listening there was no one to blame but himself for this lapse someone had told him about the quarry henry davett when hed said that limestone was big business in the area at one time how else do companies produce commercial limestone rhyme shouldve asked about a quarry as soon as hed heard that and the nitrates werent from pipe bombs at all but from blasting out rock that kind of residue would last for decades he said into the phone theres an abandoned quarry not far from you to the southwest a pause faint words she said jesse knows about it garrett was there i dont know if he still is so be careful and remember he may not be leaving bombs but hes rigging traps call me when you find something now that lydia was away from the outside and wasnt as sick from heat and exhaustion she realized that she had the inside to contend with and that was proving to be just as frightening her captor would pace for a while look out the window then squat on his haunches clicking his fingernails and muttering to himself looking over her body then go back to pacing once garrett glanced down at the floor of the mill and picked up something he slipped it into his mouth chewed hungrily she wondered if it was an insect and the thought of this nearly made her vomit they were in what seemed to have been the office of the mill from here she could look down a corridor partly burnt in the fire to another series of rooms probably the grain storage and the grinding rooms brilliant afternoon light flowed through the burntout walls and ceiling of the hallway something orange caught her eye she squinted and saw bags of doritos also cape cod potato chips reeses peanut butter cups and more of those planters peanutbutterandcheese cracker packages hed had at the quarry sodas and deer park water she hadnt seen them when they first entered the mill why all this food how long would they be staying here garrett had said just for the night but there were enough provisions for a months stay was he going to keep her here longer than hed originally told her lydia asked is mary beth all right have you hurt her oh yeah like im going to hurt her he said sarcastically i dont think so lydia turned away and studied the shafts of light piercing the remains of the corridor from beyond it came a squeaking sound the revolving millstone she guessed garrett continued offering the only reason i took her away is to make sure shes okay she wanted to get out of tanners corner she likes it at the beach i mean fuck who wouldnt better than shitty tanners corner snapping his nails faster now louder he was agitated and nervous with his huge hands he ripped open one of the bags of chips he ate several handfuls chewing them sloppily bits falling from his mouth he drank down an entire can of coke at once ate more chips this place burned down two years ago he said i dont know who did it you like that sound the waterwheel its pretty cool the wheel going round and round like reminds me of this song my father used to sing around the house all the time big wheel keep on turning he shoveled more food into his mouth and started speaking she couldnt understand him for a moment he swallowed here a lot you sit here at night listen to the cicada and the bloodnouns you know the bullfrogs if im going all the way to the ocean like now i spend the night here youll like it at night he stopped talking and leaned toward her suddenly too scared to look directly at him she kept her eyes downcast but sensed he was studying her closely then in an instant he leapt up and crouched close beside her lydia winced as she smelled his body odor she waited for his hands to crawl over her chest between her legs but he wasnt interested in her it seemed garrett moved aside a rock and lifted something out from underneath a millipede he smiled the creature was long and yellowgreen and the sight of it sickened her they feel neat i like them he let it climb over his hand and wrist theyre not insects he lectured theyre like cousins theyre dangerous if you try to hurt them their bite is really bad the indians around here used to grind them up and put the poison on arrowheads when a millipede is scared it shits poison and then escapes a predator crawls through the gas and dies thats pretty wild huh garrett grew silent and studied the millipede intently the way lydia herself would look at her niece and nephew with affection amusement almost love lydia felt the horror rising in her she knew she should stay calm knew she shouldnt antagonize garrett should just play along with him but seeing that disgusting bug slither over his arm hearing his fingernails click watching his blotched skin and wet red eyes the flecks of food on his chin she convulsed in panic as the disgust and the fear boiled up in her lydia imagined she heard a faint voice urging yes yes yes a voice that could only belong to a guardian angel yes yes yes she rolled onto her back garrett looked up smiling from the sensation of the animal on his skin curious about what she was doing and lydia lashed out as hard as she could with both feet she had strong legs used to carrying her big frame for eighthour shifts at the hospital and the kick sent him tumbling backward he hit his head against the wall with a dull thud and rolled to the floor stunned then he cried out a raw scream and grabbed his arm the millipede must have bit him yes lydia thought triumphantly as she rolled upright she struggled to her feet and ran blindly toward the grinding room at the end of the corridor according to jesse corns reckoning they were almost to the quarry about five minutes ahead he told sachs then he glanced at her twice and after some tacit debate said you know i was going to ask you when you drew your weapon when that turkey came outa the brush well and at blackwater landing too when rich culbeau surprised us that was well that was something you know how to drive a nail looks like she knew from roland bell the southern expression meant to shoot one of my hobbies she said nofoolin easier than running she said cheaper than joining a health club you in competition sachs nodded north shore pistol club on long island how bout that he said with a daunting enthusiasm nra bullseye matches right thats my sport too well skeet and trap course but sidearmsre my specialty hers too but she thought it best not to find too much in common with adoring jesse corn you reload your own ammo he asked uhhuh well thes ands not the rimfire of course getting the bubbles out of slugs thats the big problem whoa youre not telling me you cast your own bullets i do she admitted recalling that when everyone elses apartment in her building smelled of waffles and bacon on sunday morning hers often was redolent of the unique aroma of molten lead i dont do that he said apologetically i buy match rounds they walked for another few minutes in silence all eyes on the ground looking for more deadfall traps so jesse corn said offering a coy grin swiping his blond hair off his damp forehead ill show you mine sachs looked at him quizzically and he continued i mean whats your best score on the bullseye circuit when she hesitated he encouraged come on you can tell me its only a sport and hey ive been competing for ten years i got a little edge on you twentyseven hundred sachs said jesse nodded right thats the match i mean the threepistol rotation nine hundred points max for each gun whats your best no thats my score she said wincing as a jolt of arthritic pain coursed through her stiff legs twentyseven hundred jesse turned to her looking for signs of a joke when she didnt grin or guffaw he exhaled a fast laugh but thats a perfect score oh i dont shoot that every match but you asked what my best was but his eyes were wide ive never even met anybody shot a twentyseven hundred you have now ned said laughing hard and dont feel bad jess its only a sport twentyseven the young deputy shook his head sachs decided she should have lied with this information about her ballistic prowess it seemed that jesse corns love for her was sealed say after this is over he said shyly you have some free time maybe you and me could go out to the range waste us some ammo and sachs thought better a box of winchester specials than a cup of starbucks accompanied by talk of how hard it is to meet women in tanners corner lets see how things go its a date he said using the word shed hoped wouldnt surface there lucy said look they stopped at the edge of the forest and saw the quarry in front of them sachs motioned them into a crouch damn that hurts she popped condroitin and glucosamine daily but this carolina humidity and heat it was hell on her poor joints she gazed at the huge pit two hundred yards across and easily a hundred feet deep the walls were yellow like old bone and they dropped straight down into green brackish water that smelled sour the vegetation for twenty yards around the perimeter had died bad deaths keep clear of the water lucy warned in a whisper its bad kids used to swim here not long after they shut it down my nephew did once bens younger brother but i just showed him the coroners picture from when they fished kevin dobbs out after hed drowned and been in the water for a week never went back i think dr spock recommends that approach sachs said lucy laughed sachs thinking about children again not now not now her phone vibrated as theyd gotten closer to their prey shed turned off the ringer she answered rhymes voice crackled sachs where are you the rim of the quarry she whispered any sign of him we just got here nothing yet were about to start searching all the buildingsve been torn down and i dont see anywhere he could be hiding but therere a dozen places he couldve left a trap sachs what is it rhyme his solemn tone chilled her theres something i have to tell you i just got the dna and serologic results from the medical center on that kleenex you found at the scene this morning and it was garretts semen all right and the blood it was mary beths he raped her sachs whispered be careful sachs but move fast i dont think lydia has much time left she was hiding in a dark filthy bin that had been used to store grain long ago hands behind her still dizzy from the heat and dehydration lydia johansson had stumbled down the bright corridor away from where garrett lay writhing and had found this hiding space on the floor below the grinding room when she slipped inside and closed the door a dozen mice had skittered over her feet and it took every ounce of willpower within her to keep from screaming now listening for garretts footsteps over the lowgear sound of the grinding wheel nearby panic was filling her and she was starting to regret her defiant escape but there was no going back she decided shed hurt garrett and now he was going to hurt her back if he found her maybe do worse there was nothing to do but try to escape no she decided that wasnt the right way to think one of her angel books said there was no such thing as trying to you either did or you didnt she wasnt going to try to get away she was going to escape she just had to have faith lydia looked through a crack in the bin door listened carefully she heard him in one of the rooms nearby muttering to himself and ripping open bins and closet doors shed hoped that hed think shed run outside through the collapsed wall in the burntout corridor but it was obvious from his methodical search that he knew she was still here she couldnt stay in the storage closet any longer hed find her she glanced out through a crack in the door and not seeing him she slipped out of the bin and ran into an adjoining room moving silently on her white sneakers the only exit from this room was a stairway leading up to the second floor she staggered up it gasping for breath and not having her hands for balance bounding off the walls and the wroughtiron railing she heard his voice echoing in the corridor you made him bite me he cried it hurts it hurts wish it had stung you in the eye or crotch she thought and struggled up the stairs fuck you fuck you fuck you she heard him ripping open closet doors in the room below heard his guttural moaning imagined she could hear the snick snick of his nails that shiver of panic again nausea swelling the room at the top of the stairs was large and had a number of windows facing the burnt portion of the mill there was one door which was unlocked and she pushed it open stepped into the grinding area itself two large millstones sat in the center the wooden mechanism was rotted the sound shed heard wasnt the stones but the waterwheel powered by the diverted stream it still turned slowly rustcolored water cascaded off it into a deep narrow pit like a well lydia couldnt see the bottom the water mustve drained back into the stream somewhere below the surface stop garrett cried she jumped in shock at the angry sound he stood in the doorway his eyes were red and wide and he was cradling his arm on which was a huge blackandyellow bruise you made it sting me he muttered staring at her with hatred its dead you made me kill it i didnt want to but you made me now get your ass downstairs ive gotta tape your legs up now he started forward she looked at his bony face brows knit together his huge hands his angry eyes into her thoughts came a burst of images a cancer patient of hers slowly wasting to death mary beth mcconnell locked away somewhere the boy madly chewing his chips the scuttling millipede the fingernails snapping the outside her long nights alone waiting desperately for a brief phone call from her boyfriend taking the flowers to blackwater landing even though she didnt really want to it was all too much for her wait lydia said placidly he blinked stopped walking she smiled at him the way shed smile at a terminal patient and sending a goodbye prayer to her boyfriend lydia hands still bound behind her plunged headfirst into the narrow pit of dark water the crosshairs of the hitech telescopic sight rested on the redheaded cops shoulders that was some hair mason germain thought he and nathan groomer were on a rise overlooking the old anderson rock products quarry about a hundred yards away from the search party nathan finally stated the conclusion he mustve come to a half hour ago this dont have anything to do with rich culbeau no it doesnt not exactly whats that mean not exactly culbeaus out here someplace with sean osarian that boys scarier than two culbeaus no argument there mason said and harris tomel too but thats not what were doing nathan looked back at the deputies and the redhead guess not whyre you sighting down on lucy kerr with my gun after a moment mason handed back the ruger m and said cause i didnt bring my fucking binoculars and it wasnt lucy i was looking at they started along the ridge mason was thinking about the redhead thinking about pretty mary beth mcconnell and lydia thinking too how sometimes life just doesnt go the way you want it to mason germain knew for instance that he shouldve advanced further than senior deputy by now he knew he shouldve handled his request for promotion different just like he shouldve handled things different when kelley left him for that trucker five years ago and for that matter handled his whole marriage different before she left him and shouldve handled the first garrett hanlon case a lot different too the case where meg blanchard woke from her nap and found the hornets clustered on her chest and face and arms one hundred thirtyseven stings and a terrible slow death now he was paying for those bad choices his life was just a series of still days worrying sitting on his porch and drinking too much not even finding the energy to put his boat in the paquo and go after bass trying desperately to figure out how to fix what maybe couldnt be fixed he so you gonna tell me what were doing nathan asked were looking for culbeau but you just said nathans voice faded when mason said nothing else the deputy sighed loudly culbeaus house where were sposed to be is six or seven miles away and here we are north of the paquo me with my deer gun and you with that zipped mouth of yours im saying if jim askswe were out here looking for culbeau mason said and what were really doing is nathan groomer could prune trees at five hundred yards with this ruger of his he could charm a pointfiveoh dui out of his car in three minutes he could carve decoys thatd sell for five hundred bucks each to collectors if he ever bothered to try to sell any but his talents and smarts didnt go much beyond that were going to get that boy mason said garrett yeah garrett who else theyre going to flush him for us nodding toward the redhead and the deputies and were going to get him whatta you mean by get youre going to shoot him nathan and kill him dead as a stick shoot him yessir mason said hold on there youre not ramshagging my career cause youre hot to get that boy you dont have a career mason snapped you got a joband if you want to keep it youll do what im telling you listen here ive talked to him garrett during those other investigations when he killed those people yeah did you i guess you would sure and know what he told me no what mason was trying to think if this was credible then recalling nathans dogeyed concentration as he spent hour after hour sanding the back of a pinewood duck lost in happy oblivion the senior deputy continued garrett said if he was standing in need to hed kill any law tried to stop him he said that that boy yep looked me right in the eye and said so and said he was looking forward to it too hoped i was in the lead but hed take anybody that happened to be handy that son of a bitch you tell jim course i did you think i wouldnt but he didnt pay it a lick of mind i like jim bell you know i do but the truth is hes more concerned about keeping his cushy job than he is with doing it the deputy was nodding and a portion of mason was astonished that nathan had bought this so easily and never even guessed that there might be another reason he was so hot to get that boy the sharpshooter thought for a moment has garrett got a gun i dont know nathan but tell me bout how hard is it to get a firearm in north carolina the phrase fallin off a log come to mind thats true see lucy and jesse even jim they dont appreciate that kid like i do appreciate appreciate the dangers what i mean mason said oh hes killed three people so far probably todd wilkes too strung that little boy up by his neck or at least scared him into killing himself which is murder all the same and that girl got stung meg you see those pictures of her face after the wasps were through with her then think about ed schaeffer you and me were out drinking with him just last week now hes in the hospital and he might never wake up its not like im a sniper or nothing mase but mason germain wasnt going to give an inch you know what the courtsre going to do hes sixteen theyre gonna say poor boy parentsre dead lets put him in some halfway house then hes going to get out in six months or a year and do it all over again kill some other football player headed for chapel hill some other girl in town never hurt a soul but dont worrynathan youre doing tanners corner a favor that aint what i was going to say the thing is we kill him we lose any chance of finding mary beth hes the only one knows where she is mason gave a sour laugh mary beth you think shes alive no way garrett raped and killed her and buried her in a shallow grave someplace we can stop worrying about her its our job now to make sure that dont happen to anybody else you with me nathan didnt say anything but the snapping sound of the deputy pressing the long copperjacketed shells into his rifles magazine was answer enough ii the white doe outside the window was a large hornets nest resting her head against the greasy glass of her prison an exhausted mary beth mcconnell stared at it more than anything else about this terrible place the nest gray and moist and disgusting gave her a sense of hopelessness more than the bars that garrett had so carefully bolted outside of the windows more than the thick oak door secured with three huge locks more than the memory of the terrible trek from blackwater landing in the company of the insect boy the wasps nest was in the shape of a cone the point facing toward the earth it rested on a forked branch that garrett had propped up near the window the nest mustve been home to hundreds of the glossy blackandyellow insects that oozed in and out of the hole in the bottom garrett had been gone when shed wakened this morning and after lying in bed for an hour groggy and nauseated from the vicious blow to her head last night mary beth had climbed unsteadily to her feet and looked out the window the first thing that shed noticed was the nest outside the back window near the bedroom the wasps hadnt made the nest here garrett had placed it outside the window himself at first she couldnt figure out why but then with a feeling of despair she understood her captor had left it as a flag of victory mary beth mcconnell knew her history she knew about warfare knew about armies conquering other armies the reason for flags and standards wasnt only to identify your side it was to remind the vanquished who now controlled them and garrett had won well hed won the battlethe outcome of the war had yet to be decided mary beth pressed the gash on her head it had been a terrible blow to her temple and had peeled away some skin she wondered if it would become infected she found a rubber band in her backpack and tied her long brunette hair into a ponytail sweat trickled down her neck and she felt a fierce aching of thirst she was breathless from the stifling heat in the closed rooms and thought about taking off her thick denim shirt worried about snakes and spiders she always wore long sleeves when she was on a dig around brush or tall grass but despite the heat now she decided to leave the shirt on she didnt know when her captor would return she wore only a lacy pink bra underneath the shirt and garrett hanlon sure didnt need any encouragement in that department with a last glance at the nest mary beth stepped away from the window then walked around the threeroom shack once more searching futilely for a breach in the place it was a solid building very old thick walls a combination of handhewn logs and heavy boards nailed together outside the front window was a large field of tall grass that ended in a line of trees a hundred yards away the cabin itself was in another stand of thick trees looking out the back window the hornets nest window she could just see through the trunks to the glistening surface of the pond theyd skirted yesterday to get here the rooms themselves were small but surprisingly clean in the living room was a long brownandgold couch several old chairs around a cheap diningroom table a second table on which were a dozen quart juice jars covered with mesh and filled with insects hed collected a second room contained a mattress and a dresser the third room was empty except for several halffull cans of brown paint sitting in the corner it seemed that garrett had painted the exterior of the cabin recently the color was dark and depressing and she couldnt understand why hed picked it until she realized it was the same shade as the bark of the trees that surrounded the cabin camouflage and it occurred to her again what shed thought yesterday that the boy was much cagier and more dangerous than shed thought in the living room were stacks of food junk food and rows of canned fruits and vegetables farmer john brand from the label a stolid farmer smiled at her the image as outdated as the s betty crocker she searched the cabin desperately for water or soda anything to drink but couldnt find a thing the canned fruits and vegetables would be packed in juice but there was no opener or any sort of tool or utensil to open them she had her backpack with her but had left her archaeological tools at blackwater landing she tried banging a can on the side of the table to split it open but the metal didnt give downstairs was a root cellar that you reached via a door in the floor of the shacks main room she glanced at it once and shivered with disgust felt her skin crawl last night after garrett had been gone for some time mary beth had worked up her courage and walked down the rickety stairs into the lowceilinged basement looking for a way out of the horrible cabin but thered been no exit just dozens of old boxes and jars and bags she hadnt heard garrett return and suddenly in a rush hed charged down the stairs toward her shed screamed and tried to flee but the next thing she remembered was lying on the dirt floor blood spattered on her chest and clotted in her hair and garrett smelling of unwashed adolescence walking up slowly wrapping his arms around her his eyes fixed on her breasts hed lifted her and shed felt his hard penis against her as he carried her slowly upstairs deaf to her protests no she now told herself dont think about it or about the pain or the fear and where was garrett now as frightened as shed been with him padding around the cabin yesterday she was nearly as scared now that hed forget about her or would get killed in an accident or shot by the deputies looking for her and shed die of thirst here mary beth mcconnell remembered a project she and her graduate adviser had been involved in a north carolina state historical societysponsored disinterment of a nineteenthcentury grave to run dna tests on the body inside to see if the corpse was that of a descendant of sir francis drake as a local legend claimed to her horror when the top of the coffin was lifted off the arm bones of the cadaver were upraised and there were scratch marks on the inside of the lid the man had been buried alive this cabin would be her coffin and no one what was that looking out the front window she thought she saw motion just inside the edge of the forest in the distance through the brush and leaves she believed it might be a man because his clothes and broadbrimmed hat seemed dark and there was something confident about his posture and gait she thought he looks like a missionary in the wilderness but wait was someone really there or was it just the light on the trees she couldnt tell here she cried but the window was nailed shut and even if it had been open she doubted he could hear her scream feeble from her dry throat from this distance she grabbed her backpack hoping she still had the whistle that her paranoid mother had bought her for protection mary beth had laughed at the idea a rape whistle in tanners corner but she now searched desperately for it but the whistle was gone maybe garrett had found it and taken it when shed been passed out on the bloody mattress well shed scream for help anyway scream as loudly as she could despite her parched throat mary beth grabbed one of the insect jars intending to smash it through the window she drew it back like a pitcher about to let fly the last ball of a nohitter then her hand lowered no the missionary was gone where hed been was just a dark willow trunk grass and a bay tree swaying in the hot wind maybe that was all shed seen maybe he hadnt been there at all to mary beth mcconnell hot scared racked with thirst truth and fiction now blended together and all the legends shed studied about this eerie north carolina countryside seemed to become real maybe the missionary was just another in the cast of imaginary characters like the lady of drummond lake like the other ghosts of the great dismal swamp like the white doe in the indian legend a tale that was becoming alarmingly like her own head throbbing dizzy in the heat mary beth lay on the musty couch and closed her eyes watching the wasps hover close then enter the gray nest the flag of her captors victory lydia felt the bottom of the stream beneath her feet and kicked to the surface choking spitting water she found herself in a swampy pool about fifty feet downstream from the mill hands still taped behind her back she kicked hard to right herself wincing in pain shed either sprained or broken her ankle on the wooden paddle of the waterwheel as shed leapt into the sluice but the water here was six or seven feet deep and if she didnt kick shed drown the pain in her ankle was astonishing but lydia forced her way to the surface she found that by filling her lungs and rolling on her back she could float and keep her face above water as she kicked with her good foot toward the shore shed gone five feet when she felt a cold slithering on the back of her neck curling around her head and ear heading for her face snake she realized in panic flashing back to a case in the emergency room last month a man brought in with a water moccasin bite his arm swollen nearly double hed been hysterical with pain she now spun around and the muscular snake slithered across her mouth she screamed but with empty lungs and no buoyancy she sank beneath the surface and began to choke she lost sight of the snake where is it where she thought furiously a bite on the face could blind her on the jugular or the carotid shed die where was it above her about to strike please please help me she thought to the guardian angel and maybe the angel heard because when she bobbed once again to the surface there was no sign of the creature she finally touched the muck of the stream bottom with her stockinged feet shed lost her shoes in the dive she paused catching her breath trying to calm down slowly she struggled toward the shore up a steep incline of mud and slick sticks and decaying leaves that eased her back a foot for every two that she managed to stagger forward watch the carolina clay she reminded herself itll hold you like quicksand just as she staggered out of the water a gunshot very close split the air jesus garrett has a gun hes shooting she dropped back into the water and sank beneath the surface she stayed for as long as she could but finally had to surface gasping for breath she broke from the water just as the beaver slapped its tail once more making a second loud crack the animal vanished toward its dam a big one two hundred feet long she felt a hysterical laugh rise up in her from the false alarm but managed to control the urge then lydia stumbled into the sedge and mud and lay on her side gasping spitting water after five minutes shed caught her breath she rolled into a sitting position and looked around her no sign of garrett she struggled to her feet tried to pull her hands apart but the duct tape held tight despite the soaking she could see the burnt chimney of the mill from here she oriented herself and decided which direction to go in to find the path that would take her back south of the paquo back home she wasnt that far from it her swim in the creek hadnt taken her downstream much from the mill but lydia couldnt will herself to move she felt paralyzed from the fear from the hopelessness then she thought of her favorite tv show touched by an angel and when she thought of the program she had another memory of the last time shed watched the show just as it was over and a commercial came on the door to her town house swung open and there was her boyfriend with a sixpack he hardly ever dropped by for surprise visits and shed been ecstatic theyd spent a glorious two hours together she decided that her angel had given her this memory just now as a sign that there was hope when you least expected it clutching this thought firmly in her mind lydia rolled awkwardly to her feet and started through the sedge and swamp grass from nearby she heard a guttural sound a faint growling she knew there were bobcats here north of the river bears too and wild boars but even though she was limping painfully lydia moved as confidently toward the path as if she were making the rounds at work dispensing pills and gossip and cheering up the patients under her care jesse corn found a bag here look here ive got something a crocus sack sachs started down a rocky incline along the edge of the quarry to where the deputy stood pointing at something on a ledge of limestone that had been blasted flat she could see the grooves from where the drills had tapped into the dull stone to pack with dynamite no wonder rhyme had found so much nitrate this place was one big demolition field she walked up to jesse he was standing in front of an old cloth bag rhyme can you hear me sachs called into her phone go ahead theres a lot of static but i can just hear you weve got a bag here she told him then asked jesse whatd you call it crocus sack what they call a burlap bag down here she said to rhyme its an old burlap bag looks like theres something in it rhyme asked garrett leave it she looked at the ground where the stone floor met the walls its definitely garretts and lydia s footprints they lead up an incline to the rim of the quarry lets get after them jesse said not yet sachs said we need to examine the bag describe it the criminalist ordered burlap old about twentyfour by thirtysix inches not much inside its closed up not tied just twisted open it carefully remember the traps sachs eased a corner of the bag down peered inside its clear rhyme lucy and ned came down the path and all four of them stood around the bag as if it were the body of a drowned man pulled from the quarry whats in it sachs pulled on her latex gloves which were very soft because of the sun immediately her hands began to sweat and tingle from the heat empty water bottles deer park no store price or inventory stickers on them wrappers from two packages of planters peanutbutterandcheese crackers no store stickers on them either you want upc codes to trace the shipments if we had a week maybe rhyme muttered no dont bother more details on the bag he ordered theres a little printing on it but its too faded to read anybody make it out she asked the others no one could read the lettering any idea what was inside originally rhyme asked she picked up the bag and smelled it musty been inside someplace for a long time cant tell what was in it sachs turned the bag inside out and hit it hard with the flat of her hand a few old shriveled corn kernels fell onto the ground corn rhyme my namesake jesse laughed rhyme asked farms around here sachs relayed the question to the search party dairy not corn lucy said looking at ned and jesse who nodded jesse said but youd feed corn to cows sure ned said id guess it came from a feedandgrain store someplace or a warehouse you hear that rhyme feed and grain right ill get ben and jim bell on that anything else sachs she looked at her hands they were blackened she turned the bag over looks like theres scorch on the bag rhyme it wasnt burned itself but it was sitting in something that had any idea what bits of charcoal looks like so id guess wood okay he said its going on the list she glanced at garretts and lydia s footprints were going after them again she told rhyme ill call when i have some more answers sachs announced to the search party back up to the top feeling the shooting pains in her knees she gazed up to the lip of the quarry muttering didnt seem that high when we got here oh hey thats a rule hillsre always twice as tall going up as coming down said jesse corn the resident storehouse of aphorisms as he politely let her precede him up the narrow path lincoln rhyme ignoring a glistening blackandgreen fly that strafed nearby was gazing at the latest evidence chart found at secondary crime scene quarry old burlap bag unreadable name on it corn feed and grain scorch marks on bag deer park water planters cheese crackers the most unusual evidence is the best evidence rhyme was never happier at a crime scene than when he found something completely unidentifiable because it meant that if he could identify it thered be limited sources he could trace it back to but these items the evidence sachs had found at the quarry were common if the printing on the bag had been legible then he might have traced that to a single source but it wasnt if the water and crackers had price stickers they might have been traced to the stores that sold them and to a clerk who recalled garrett and might have some information about where to find him but they didnt and scorched wood that led to every barbecue in paquenoke county useless the corn might be helpful jim bell and steve farr were on phones right now calling feedandgrain outlets but rhyme doubted the clerks would have anything more to say than yeah we sell corn in old burlap bags like everybody does damn he had no sense of this place at all he needed weeks months to get a feel for the area but of course they didnt have weeks or months eyes moving from chart to chart fast as the fly found at primary crime scene blackwater landing kleenex with blood limestone dust nitrates phosphate ammonia detergent camphene nothing more to be deduced from that one back to the insect books he decided ben that book there the miniature worldi want to look at it yessir the young man said absently eyes on the evidence chart he picked it up and held it out to rhyme a moment passed as the book hovered in the air over the criminalists chest rhyme cast a wry gaze at ben who glanced at him and after a beat gave a sudden jerk and reared back realizing that he was offering something to a man whod need divine intervention to take it oh my mr rhyme look ben blurted his round face red im so sorry i wasnt thinking sir man that was stupid i really ben rhyme said evenly shut the fuck up the huge man blinked in shock swallowed the book tiny in his massive hand lowered it was an accident sir i said i was shut up ben did his mouth closed he looked around the room for help but there was no help on the horizon thom was standing against the wall silent arms crossed not about to become a un peacekeeper rhyme continued in a low growl youre walking on eggshells and im sick of it quit your goddamn cringing cringing i was just trying to be decent to somebody whos i mean no you werent youve been trying to figure out how to get the hell out of here without looking at me any more than you have to and without upsetting your own delicate little psyche the massive shoulders stiffened well now sir i dont think thats completely fair bullshit its about time i took the gloves off rhyme laughed viciously how do you like that metaphor me taking off gloves something im not going to be able to do very fast am i now hows that for a crip joke ben was desperate to escape to flee out the door but his massive legs were rooted like oak trunks what ive got isnt contagious rhyme snapped you think its going to rub off doesnt work that way youre walking around here like you breathe the air and theyre going to have to cart you off in a wheelchair hell youre even afraid if you look my way youre going to end up like me thats not true isnt it i think it is how come i scare the hell out of you you dont ben snarled no way rhyme raged oh yes i do youre terrified to be in the same room with me youre a fucking coward the big man leaned forward spittle flying from his lips jaw trembling as he shouted back well fuck you rhyme he was speechless with rage for a moment then continued i come over here as a favor to my aunt it messes up all my plans and im not getting paid a penny i listen to you boss people around like youre some kind of fucking prima donna i mean i dont know where the hell you get off mister his voice faded and he squinted at rhyme who was laughing hard what ben snapped what the hellre you laughing at see how easy it is rhyme asked chuckling now thom too was having trouble suppressing a smile breathing heavily straightening up ben wiped his mouth angry wary he shook his head what do you mean whats easy looking me in the eye and telling me im a prick rhyme continued in a placid voice ben im just like anybody else i dont like it when people treat me like a china doll and i know they sure as hell dont like to worry that theyre going to break me you suckered me you said those things just to get my goat lets say just to get through to you rhyme wasnt sure that ben would ever become a henry davett a man who cared only about the core the spirit of a human being and ignored the packaging but rhyme had at least managed to push the zoologist a few steps in the direction of enlightenment i oughta walk out that door and not come back a lot of people would ben but i need you youre good youve got a flair for forensics now come on we broke the ice lets get back to work ben began to mount the miniature world in the turning frame as he did he glanced at rhyme and asked so theres really a lot of people who look you in the eye and call you a son of a bitch rhyme staring at the cover of the book deferred to thom who said oh sure of course thats only after they get to know him lydia was still only a hundred feet from the mill she was moving as quickly as she could toward the path that would take her to freedom but her ankle throbbed in pain and hampered her progress significantly also she had to move slowly truly silent travel through brush requires the use of your hands but like some of the brainlesion victims shed worked with at the hospital she had limited equilibrium and could only stumble from clearing to clearing making far more noise than she wanted to she circled wide around the front of the mill pausing no sign of garrett no sound at all except for the flushing of the diverted stream water into the ruddy swamp five more feet ten come on angel she thought stay with me a little longer help me get through this please just a few minutes and well be home free oh man alive that hurts she wondered if a bone was broken her ankle was swollen and she knew that if it was a fracture walking unsupported like this could make it ten times worse the color of the skin was darkening too which meant broken vessels blood poisoning was a possibility she thought of gangrene amputation if that happened what would her boyfriend say hed leave her she supposed their relationship was casual at best at least on his part besides she knew from her job in oncology how people disappeared from patients lives once they started losing body parts she paused and listened looked around her had garrett fled had he given up on her and gone to the outer banks to be with mary beth lydia kept moving toward the path that led back to the quarry once she found it shed have to move even more carefully because of the ammonia trap she didnt remember exactly where hed rigged it another thirty feet and there it was the path that led back home she paused again listening nothing she noticed a darkskinned placid snake sunning itself on the stump of an old cedar so long she thought to it im going home lydia started forward and then the insect boys hand lashed out from underneath a lush bay tree and snagged her good ankle unstable anyway hands useless lydia could do nothing but try to twist to the side so that her solid rump took the force of the fall the snake awoke at the sound of her scream and vanished garrett climbed on top of her pinning her to the ground face red with anger he mustve been lying there for fifteen minutes keeping silent not moving an inch until she was within striking distance like a spider waiting for its next kill please lydia muttered breathless from the shock and horrified that shed been betrayed by her angel dont hurt quiet he raged in a whisper looking around im at the end of my row with you he pulled her roughly to her feet he couldve taken her by the arm or rolled her onto her back and eased her up that way but he didnt he reached around her from behind his hands over her breasts and lifted her to her feet she felt his taut body rub disgustingly against her back and butt finally after what seemed like forever he released her but wrapped his bony fingers around her arm and pulled her after him toward the mill oblivious to her sobbing he paused only once to examine a long line of ants carrying tiny eggs across the path dont hurt them he muttered and watched her feet carefully to make sure she didnt with a sound that rhyme had always thought was that of a butcher sharpening a knife the turning frame swished another page of the miniature worldwhich was to judge from its battered condition garrett hanlons favorite book insects are astonishingly adept at survival the birch moth for example is naturally white but in the areas surrounding industrial manchester england the species coloring changed to black to blend in with the soot on the white tree trunks and appear less obvious to its enemies rhyme flipped through more pages his staunch left ring finger tapping the ecu controller and moving the pages hiss hiss blade on steel reading the passages garrett had marked the paragraph about the antlion pit had saved the search party from falling into one of the boys traps and rhyme was trying to draw more conclusions from the book as fish psychologist ben kerr had told him animal behavior is often a good model for human especially when it comes to matters of survival praying mantises rub their abdomens against their wings producing an unearthly noise which disorients pursuers mantises by the way will eat any living creature smaller than themselves including birds and mammals dung beetles are credited with giving ancient man the idea for the wheel a naturalist named reaumur observed in the seventeen hundreds that wasps make paper nests from wood fiber and saliva that gave him the idea to make paper from wood pulp not cloth as paper manufacturers had been doing up until then but what among this was revealing to the case was there anything that could help rhyme find two human beings on the run somewhere in a hundred square miles of forest and swampland insects make great use of the sense of smell for them it is a multidimensional sense they actually feel smells and use them for many things for education for intelligence for communication when an ant finds food it returns to the nest leaving a scented trail sporadically touching the ground with its abdomen when other ants come across the line they follow it back to the food they know which direction to go in because the scent is shaped the narrow end of the smell points toward the food like a directional arrow insects also use smells to warn of approaching enemies since an insect can detect a single molecule of scent miles away insects are rarely surprised by their enemies sheriff jim bell walked quickly into the room on his beleaguered face was a smile just heard from a nurse at the hospital theres some news about ed looks like hes coming out of that coma and said something his doctors gonna be calling in a few minutes im hoping well find out what he meant by olive and if he saw anything specific on that map in the blind despite his skepticism about human testimony rhyme decided that hed now be happy for a witness the helplessness the fishondryland disorientation was weighing heavily on him bell paced slowly in the lab glancing expectantly toward the doorway every time footsteps approached lincoln rhyme stretched again pressing his head back into the headrest of the chair eyes on the evidence chart eyes on the map eyes back to the book and all the while the greenandblack nutshell of a fly zipped around the room with an unfocused desperation that seemed to match his own an animal nearby darted across the path and vanished what was that sachs asked nodding at it to her the creature had looked like a cross between a dog and a large alley cat gray fox jesse said dont see em too often but then i dont usually go for walks north of the paquo they moved slowly as they tried to follow the frail indications of garretts passage and all the while they kept their eyes out for more deadfall traps and ambush from the surrounding trees and brush once again sachs felt the foreboding that had dogged her since theyd driven past the childs funeral that morning theyd left the pines behind and were in a different type of forest the trees were what youd see in a tropical jungle when she asked about them lucy told her they were tupelo gum oldgrowth bald cypress cedar they were bound together with webby moss and clinging vines that absorbed sound like thick fog and accentuated her sense of claustrophobia there were mushrooms and mold and fungus everywhere and scummy marshes all around them the aroma in the air was that of decay sachs looked at the trodden ground she asked jesse were miles from town who makes these paths he shrugged mostly bad pay whats that she asked recalling that rich culbeau had used the phrase you know somebody who doesnt pay his debts basically it just means trash moonshiners kids swamp people pcp cookers ned spoto took a drink of water and said we get calls sometimes theres been a shooting somebodys screaming calls for help mysterious lights flashing signals stuff like that only by the time we get out here theres nothing no body no perp no complaining witness sometimes we find a blood trail but it dont lead anywhere we make the run we have to but nobody in the department ever comes out in these parts alone jesse said you feel different out here you feel that this sounds funny but you feel that lifes different cheaper id rather be arresting a couple of armed kids pumped up on angel dust at a minimart than come out here on a call at least there therere rules you kinda know what to expect out here he shrugged lucy nodded thats true and normal rules dont apply to anybody north of the paquo us or them you can see yourself shooting before you read anybody their rights and thatd be perfectly all right hard to explain sachs didnt like the edgy talk if the other deputies hadnt been so somber and unnerved themselves she would have thought they were putting on a show to scare the city girl finally they stopped at a place where the path branched out into three directions they walked about fifty feet down each but could find no sign of which one garrett and lydia had chosen they returned to the crossroads she heard rhymes words echoing in her mind be careful sachs but move fast i dont think we have much time left move fast but there was no hint of where they ought to be moving to and as sachs looked down the choked paths it seemed impossible that anyone even lincoln rhyme could figure out where their prey had gone then her cell phone rang and both lucy and jesse corn looked at her expectantly hoping as did sachs that rhyme had come up with a new suggestion about which way to go sachs answered listened to the criminalist and then nodded hung up she took a breath and looked at the three deputies what asked jesse corn lincoln and jim just heard from the hospital about ed schaeffer looks like he woke up long enough to say i love my kids and then he died they thought hed said something earlier about olive street but it turned out he was just trying to say i love thats all he said im so sorry oh jesus ned muttered lucy lowered her head and jesse put his arm around her shoulders what do we do now he asked lucy looked up sachs could see tears in her eyes were gonna get that boy thats what she said with a grim determination were going to pick the most logical path and keep in that direction till we find him and were going to go fast that all right with you she asked sachs who had no problem momentarily yielding command to the deputy you bet it is lydia had seen this look in mens eyes a hundred times a need a desire a hunger sometimes a pointless itch sometimes an inept expression of love this big girl with stringy hair a spotted face in her teens and a pocked face now believed she had little to offer men but she knew too that they would for a few years at least ask one thing from her and shed decided long ago that to get by in the world she would have to exploit the little power that she had and so lydia johansson was now on a playing field that was very familiar to her they were back in the mill in the dark office once again garrett was standing over her his scalp glistening with sweat through the patchy crew cut his erection was obvious through his slacks his eyes slid over her chest where her soaked translucent uniform had ripped open in her fall down the sluice or had he done it when he grabbed her on the trail her bra strap snapped or had he torn it lydia eased away from him wincing at the pain in her ankle pressing against the wall sitting legs splayed as she studied that look in the boys eyes feeling a cold spidery repulsion and yet she thought should i let him he was young hed come instantly and it would be over with maybe afterward hed fall asleep and she could find that knife of his and cut her hands free then knock him out and tape him up but those red bony hands of his his welty face next to her cheek his disgusting breath and body stench how could she face it lydia closed her eyes momentarily uttered a prayer as insubstantial as her blue sunset eye shadow yes or no but any angels in the vicinity remained silent on this particular decision all shed have to do was smile at him hed be inside her in a minute or she could take him into her mouth it wouldnt mean anything fuck me fast then lets watch a movie a joke between her boyfriend and her shed greet him at the door in the red teddy shed bought mailorder from sears shed throw her arms around his shoulders and whisper those words to him you do this she thought to herself and you might be able to escape but i cant garretts eyes were locked onto her coursing over her body his prick couldnt violate her any more thoroughly than his red eyes were doing right now jesus he wasnt just an insect he was a mutation out of one of lydia s horror books something that dean koontz or stephen king could have made up fingernails clicking he was examining her legs now round and smooth her best feature she believed garrett snapped whyre you crying its your fault you hurt yourself you shouldntve run let me see it nodding toward her swollen ankle its okay lydia said quickly but then almost involuntarily she held her foot out to him some assholes at school pushed me down the hill behind the mobil station last year he said sprained my ankle looked like that hurt like a bitch get it over with she told herself youll be that much closer to home fuck me fast no but she didnt pull away when garrett sat down in front of her he took her leg his long fingers god they were huge were gripping her around the calf then around the ankle he was trembling looking at the holes in her white pantyhose where her pink flesh ballooned out he studied her foot its not cut but its all black whats that all about might be broken he didnt respond didnt seem sympathetic it was as if her pain was meaningless to him as if he couldnt understand that a human being might be suffering his concern was just an excuse to touch her she extended her leg farther her muscles quivering from the effort of elevating the limb her foot touched garretts body near his groin his eyelids lowered his breathing was fast lydia swallowed he moved her foot it brushed against his penis through the wet cloth he was hard as the wooden paddle of the waterwheel that shed smacked trying to escape garrett slid his hand farther up her leg she felt his nails snag her pantyhose no yes then he froze his head tilted back and his nostrils flared he inhaled deeply twice lydia sniffed the air too a sour smell it took a moment before she recognized it ammonia shit he whispered eyes wide with horror howd they get here this fast what she asked he leapt up the trap theyve tripped it theyll be here in ten minutes how the fuck dthey get here so fast he leaned into her face and shed never seen so much anger and hatred in anyones eyes you leave anything on the trail send em a message she cringed sure he was about to kill her he seemed completely out of control no i swear i promise garrett started toward her lydia shrank back but he walked past her quickly he was frantic ripping the material as he pulled his shirt and slacks off his underwear socks she stared at his lean body the substantial erection only slightly diminished naked he ran to the corner of the room there were some other clothes folded resting on the floor he put these on shoes too lydia lifted her head and looked out the window through which the smell of the chemical was strong so his trap hadnt been a bomb hed used the ammonia as a weapon itself it had rained down on the search party burning and blinding them garrett continued speaking almost in a whisper i have to get to mary beth i cant walk lydia said sobbing what are you going to do with me he pulled the folding knife from the pocket of his pants opened it up with a loud click turned toward her no no please youre hurt like theres no way you can keep up with me lydia stared at the blade it was stained and nicked her breath came in short gasps garrett walked closer lydia started to cry how had they gotten here so fast garrett hanlon wondered again jogging from the front door of the mill to the stream the panic he felt so often prickling his heart the way the poison oak hurt his skin his enemies had covered the ground from blackwater landing to the mill in just a few hours he was astonished hed thought it would take them at least a day probably two to find his trail the boy looked toward the path leading from the quarry no sign of them he turned in the opposite direction and started slowly down another trail this one led away from the quarry downstream from the mill clicking his nails asking himself how how how relax he told himself there was plenty of time after the ammonia bottle crashed down on the rocks the police would be moving slow as dung beetles on balls of shit worried about other traps in a few minutes hed be in the bogs and theyd never be able to follow him even with dogs hed be with mary beth in eight hours he then garrett stopped on the side of the path was a plastic water bottle empty it looked as if somebody had just dropped it he sniffed the air picked up the bottle smelled the inside ammonia an image snapped into his mind a fly stuck in a spiders web he thought shit they tricked me a womans voice barked hold it right there garrett a pretty redheaded woman in jeans and a black tshirt stepped out of the bushes she was holding a pistol and pointing it directly at his chest her eyes went to the knife in his hand then back to his face hes over here the woman shouted ive got him then her voice dropped and she looked into garretts eyes do what i say and you wont get hurt i want you to toss the knife away and lie down on the ground facefirst but the boy didnt lie down he merely stood still slouching awkwardly fingernail and thumbnail of his left hand clicking compulsively he looked utterly scared and desperate amelia sachs glanced again at the stained knife held firmly in his hand she kept the sight of the smith wesson on garretts chest her eyes stung from the ammonia and the sweat she wiped her face with her sleeve garrett speaking calmly lie down nobodys going to hurt you if you do what we say she heard distant shouting i got lydia ned spoto called shes okay mary beths not here lucys voice was calling where amelia on the path to the stream sachs shouted throw the knife over there garrett on the ground then lie down he stared at her cautiously red blotches on his skin eyes wet come on garrett therere four of us here theres no way out how he asked howd you find me his voice was childlike younger than most sixteenyearolds she didnt share with him that how theyd found the ammonia trap and the mill had been lincoln rhyme of course just as theyd started down the center path at the crossroads in the woods the criminalist had called her hed said one of the feedandgrain clerks jim bell talked to said that you dont see corn used as feed around here he said it probably came from a gristmill and jim knew about an abandoned one thatd burned last year thatd explain the scorch marks bell got on the phone and told the search party how to get to the mill then rhyme had come back on and added ive got a thought about the ammonia too rhyme had been reading garretts books and found an underlined passage about insects using smells to communicate warnings hed decided that since the ammonia wasnt found in commercial explosives like the kind used at the quarry garrett had possibly rigged some ammonia on a fishingline tripwire this was so that when the pursuers spilled it the boy could smell that they were close and could escape after they found the trap itd been sachs idea to fill one of neds water bottles with ammonia quietly surround the mill and pour the chemical on the ground outside the mill to flush the boy and flush him it had but he still wasnt listening to her instructions garrett looked around and then studied her face as if trying to decide if she really would shoot him he scratched at a rash on his face and wiped sweat then adjusted his grip on the knife looking right and left eyes filling with despair and panic afraid to startle him into running or attacking her sachs tried to sound like a mother coercing her child to sleep garrett do what im asking everythingll be fine just do what im asking please you got a shot take it mason germain was whispering a hundred yards away from where that bitchy redhead from new york was confronting the killer mason and nathan groomer were on the crest of a bald hill mason was standing nathan was prone on the hot ground hed sandbagged the ruger on a low rise of helpful rocks and was concentrating on controlling his breathing the way hunters of elks and geese and human beings are supposed to do before they shoot go on mason urged theres no wind you got a clear view take the shot mason the boys not doing anything they saw lucy kerr and jesse corn walk into the clearing joining the redhead their guns also pointed at the boy nathan continued everybodys got him covered and its only a knife hes got a little pissant knife it looks like hes going to give up hes not going to give up spat out mason germain who shifted his slight weight from one foot to the other in impatience i told you hes faking hes gonna kill one of em as soon as their guards down it dont mean anything to you that ed schaeffers dead steve farr had called with this sad news a halfhour ago come on mason im as tore up about that as anybody that doesnt have a thing to do with the rules of engagement besides look will you lucy and jessere six feet away from him you worried about hitting them fuck you could hit a dime at this range nathan nobody shoots bettern you take it take your shot i mason was watching the curious little play going on in the clearing the redhead lowered her gun and took a step forward garrett was still holding the knife head swiveling back and forth the woman took another step toward him oh thats helpfulbitch she in your line of fire no but i mean nathan said were not even supposed to be here thats not the issue mason muttered we are here i authorized backup to protect the search party and im ordering you to take a shot your safety off yeah its off then shoot peering through the scope mason watched the gun barrel of the ruger freeze as nathan grew into his weapon mason had seen this before when he hunted with friends who were far better sportsmen than he was it was an eerie thing that he didnt quite understand your weapon becomes part of you just before the gun fires almost by itself mason waited for the booming report of the long gun not a breath of wind a clean target a clear backdrop shoot shoot shoot was masons silent message but instead of the crack of a rifle shot he heard a sigh nathan lowered his head i cant gimme the fucking gun no mason come on but the expression in the senior deputys eyes silenced the marksman and he handed over the rifle and rolled aside how many in the clip mason snapped i how many rounds in the clip mason said as he dropped to his belly and took up a position identical to his colleagues a moment before five but nothing personal mason you aint the best rifle shot in the world and therere three innocents in the field of target and if you but his voice faded there was only one place for this sentence to go and nathan didnt want to accompany it there true mason knew he wasnt the best shot in the world but hed killed a hundred deer and hed fired high scores on the state police range in raleigh besides good shot or bad mason knew that the insect boy had to die and had to die now he too breathed steadily curled his finger around the ribbed trigger and found that nathan had been lying hed never unsafetied the rifle mason now angrily pushed the button and started controlling his breathing once more in out he rested the crosshairs on the boys face the redhead moved closer to garrett and for a moment her shoulder was in the line of fire jesus my lord you are making it difficult lady she swayed back out of view then her neck appeared in the center of the scope she swayed to the left but remained close to the center of the crosshairs breathe breathe mason ignoring the fact that his hands were shaking far more than they ought to concentrated on the blotchy face of his target lowered the crosshairs to garretts chest the redhead cop swayed once more into the line of fire then she eased out again he knew he should squeeze the trigger gently but as so often in his life anger took over and made the decision for him he pulled the sliver of metal with a jerk behind garrett a plug of dirt shot into the air and he slapped his hand to his ear where he like sachs had felt the zip of a bullet streak past an instant later the booming sound of the gun filled the clearing sachs spun around from the delay between the sound of the bullet itself and the muzzle report she knew the shot hadnt come from lucy or jesse but from a hundred yards or so behind them the deputies too were looking back guns raised trying to spot the shooter crouching sachs glanced at garretts face and she saw his eyes the terror and confusion in them for a moment only an instant he wasnt a killer whod crushed a boys skull or a rapist whod bloodied mary beth mcconnell and invaded her body he was a scared little boy whimpering no no who is it lucy kerr called culbeau they took cover in some bushes get down amelia jesse called we dont know who theyre shooting at might be a friend of garretts aiming for us but sachs didnt think so the bullet was meant for garrett she scanned the hilltops nearby looking for signs of the sniper another shot snapped past this one was a wider miss holy mary jesse corn said swallowing the apparently unaccustomed blasphemy look up there its mason and nathan groomer on that rise its germainlucy asked bitterly squinting she furiously pressed the transmit button on her handitalkie and shouted mason what the hellre you doing are you there are you receiving central come in central goddamn i cant get reception sachs pulled out her cell phone and called rhyme he answered a moment later she heard his voice hollow through the speakerphone sachs have you weve got him rhyme but that deputy mason germain hes on a hill nearby firing at the boy we cant get him on the radio no no no sachs he cant kill him i checked the degradation of the blood on the tissue mary beth was alive as of last night if garrett dies well never find her she shouted this to lucy but the deputy still couldnt raise mason on the radio another shot a rock shattered spraying them with dust stop it garrett sobbed no no im scared make him stop sachs said to rhyme ask bell if masons got a cell phone and have him call tell him to stop the shooting okay sachs rhyme hung up if garrett dies well never find her amelia sachs made a fast decision and tossed her gun on the ground behind her then stepped forward facing garrett a foot from him directly in between masons gun and the boy thinking in the time it took to do this mason mightve pulled the trigger and the bullet preceding the sound wave of the gunshot might be headed directly toward my back she stopped breathing imagining she could feel the slug streaking at her a moment passed there was no shot garrett youve got to put the knife down you tried to kill me you tricked me she wondered if hed stab her in anger or panic no we didnt have anything to do with it look im in front of you im protecting you he wont shoot again garrett studied her face carefully with his twitchy eyes she wondered if mason was waiting for her to move aside just enough so that he could sight on garrett he was obviously a bad shot and she imagined a bullet shattering her spine ah rhyme she thought youre here for your operation to try to be more like me maybe today ill become more like you jesse corn was sprinting through the brush up the hill waving his arms and calling mason stop shooting stop shooting garrett continued to examine sachs closely then he tossed the knife aside and started compulsively clicking his fingernails over and over as lucy ran forward and cuffed garrett sachs turned to the hill where mason had been shooting from she saw him stand speaking on his phone he glanced directly at her it seemed then shoved the phone into his pocket and started down the hill what the hell were you thinking of sachs raged at mason she walked straight up to him they stood only a foot apart and she was an inch taller than he was saving your ass lady mason replied harshly didnt you happen to notice he had a weapon mason jesse corn tried to diffuse the situation she was trying to calm things down is all she got him to give up but amelia sachs didnt need any big brothers she said ive been doing takedowns for years he wasnt going to move on me the only threat was from you you couldve hit one of us oh bullshit mason leaned close to her and she could smell the musky aftershave he seemed to have poured on she eased away from the cloud of scent and said and if youd killed garrett mary beth probably wouldve starved or suffocated to death shes dead mason snapped that girl is lying in a grave somewhere and well never find her body lincoln got a report on her blood sachs responded she was alive as of last night this gave him a moments pause he muttered last night aint now come on mason jesse said it worked out okay but he wasnt calming he lifted his arms and slapped his thighs he looked into sachss eyes said i dont know what the fuck we need you down here for anyway mason lucy kerr cut in its over with we wouldntve found lydia it hadnt been for mr rhyme and amelia here we have them to thank let it go shes the one not letting it go when somebody puts me in the line of fire there better be a pretty good reason sachs said evenly and its no reason at all that youre gunning for that boy because you havent been able to make a case against him you got no business talking about how i do my job i okay we got to wrap this up here lucy said and get back to the office were still working on the assumption that mary beth isnt dead and weve got to find her hey jesse corn called theres the chopper a helicopter from the medical center landed in a clearing near the mill and the medics brought lydia out on a stretcher she was suffering from minor heatstroke and had a badly sprained ankle the woman had been hysterical at first garrett had come at her with a knife and even though it turned out he had used it just to cut a piece of duct tape to gag her she was still very shaken she managed to calm down enough to tell them that mary beth wasnt anywhere near the mill garrett had her hidden near the ocean somewhere on the outer banks she didnt know where exactly lucy and mason had tried to get garrett to say but hed remained mute and sat hands cuffed behind him staring morosely at the ground lucy said to mason you nathan and jesse walk garrett over to easedale road ill have jim send a car there the possum creek turnoff amelia wants to search the mill ill help her send another car over to easedale in a half hour or so for us sachs was happy to hold masons eyes for as long as he wanted to have a pissing contest but he turned his attention to garrett looking the scared boy up and down like a guard studying a deathrow prisoner mason nodded to nathan lessgo those cuffs on tight jesse theyre tight sure jesse said sachs was glad jesse would be with them to keep mason on his good behavior shed heard stories about escaping prisoners being beaten by their transporting officers occasionally they ended up dead mason gripped garrett roughly by the arm and pulled him to his feet the boy cast a hopeless look at sachs then mason led him down the path sachs said to jesse corn keep an eye on mason you may need all of garretts cooperation to find mary beth and if hes too scared or mad you wont get anything out of him ill make sure of it amelia a glance her way that was gutsy what you did stepping in front of him i wouldntve done that well she said not in the mood for any more adoration sometimes you just act and dont think he nodded brightly as if adding that expression to his repertoire oh hey i was gonna ask you have a nickname you go by not really good i like amelia just the way it is for a ridiculous moment she thought he was going to kiss her to celebrate the capture then he started off after mason nathan and garrett brother thought exasperated amelia sachs watching jesse turn to give her a cheerful wave one of the deputies wants to shoot me and one of thems just about got the church reserved and the caterer lined up sachs walked the grid carefully inside the mill concentrating on the room where garrett had kept lydia walking back and forth one step at a time she knew there were some clues here as to where mary beth mcconnell was being held yet sometimes the connection between a perp and a location was so tenuous that it existed only microscopically and as sachs traversed the room she found nothing helpful only dirt bits of hardware and burnt wood from the walls that had collapsed during the mill fire food water empty wrappers and the duct tape that garrett had brought all without store labels she found the map that poor ed schaeffer had gotten a look at it showed garretts route to the mill but no destinations beyond that were marked still she searched twice then once more part of this was rhymes teaching part of it was her own nature and was part of it she wondered a delaying tactic to postpone as long as possible rhymes appointment with dr weaver then lucys voice called ive got something sachs had suggested that the deputy search the grinding room that was where lydia had told them shed tried to escape from garrett and sachs had reasoned that if thered been a struggle something might have fallen from garretts pockets shed given the deputy a fast course in walking the grid told her what to look for and how to properly handle evidence look lucy said enthusiastically as she carried a cardboard box over to sachs found this hidden behind the millstone inside was a pair of old shoes a waterproof jacket a compass and a map of the north carolina coastline sachs also noticed a dusting of white sand in the shoes and in the folds of the map lucy started to open up the map no sachs said there could be some trace inside wait till were back with lincoln but he couldve marked the place where hes got her he mightve but itll still be marked when we get back to the lab we lose trace now we lose it forever then she said you keep searching inside i want to check out the path he was going down when we stopped him it led to the water maybe he had a boat hidden there there might be another map or something sachs left the mill and hiked down toward the stream as she passed the rise where mason had been shooting from she turned the corner and found two men staring at her they carried rifles oh no not them well rich culbeau said brushed away a fly that landed on his sunburnt forehead he tossed his head and his thick shiny braid swung like a horses tail thanks loads maam the other one said to her with mild sarcasm sachs recalled his name harris tomel the one who resembled a southern businessman as much as culbeau looked like a biker no reward for us tomel continued and out all day in the hot sun culbeau said the boy tell you where mary beth is youll have to talk to sheriff bell about that sachs said just thought he mightve said then she wondered how had they found the mill they mightve followed the search party but they might also have had a tip from mason germain maybe hoping for a little backup for his renegade sniper operation i was right culbeau continued whats that sachs asked sue mcconnell upped the reward to two thousand he shrugged tomel added so near yet so far youll excuse me ive got some work to do sachs started past them thinking and wheres the other one of this gang the skinny a fast noise behind her and she felt her pistol being lifted out of her holster she spun around crouching as the gun disappeared into the hand of scrawny freckled sean osarian who danced away from her grinning like the class cutup culbeau shook his head sean come on she held her hand out id like that back just looking fine piece harris here collects guns thiss a nice one dont you think harris tomel said nothing just sighed and wiped sweat off his forehead youre borrowing trouble sachs said culbeau said give it back ther sean too hot for your pranking he pretended to hand it to her buttfirst then grinned and pulled his hand away hey honey where you from exactly new york i heard whats it like there wild place ill bet quit fooling with the goddamn gun culbeau muttered were out the money lets just live with it and get back to town give me back the weapon now sachs muttered but osarian was dancing around sighting on trees as if he were a tenyearold playing cops and robbers pow pow okay forget about it sachs shrugged its not mine anyway when youre through playing just take it back to the sheriffs department she turned to walk past osarian hey he said frowning with disappointment that she didnt want to play anymore dont you sachs dodged to his right ducked and came up behind him fast catching him in a onearmed neck lock in half a second the switchblade was out of her pocket the blade open and the point tapping out red dots on the underside of his chin oh jesus what the hellre you doing he blurted then realized that speaking pushed his throat against the tip of the knife he shut up okay okay culbeau said holding up his hands lets not drop your weapons on the ground sachs said all of you i didnt do anything culbeau protested listen miss tomel said trying to sound reasonable we didnt mean any trouble our friend here is the knife tip poked his stubbly chin ahh do it do it osarian said desperately teeth together put the fucking guns down culbeau eased his rifle to the ground tomel too repulsed by osarians unclean smell sachs slid her hand along his arm and seized her gun he released it she stepped back shoved osarian away kept the pistol pointed at him i was just pranking osarian said i do that i fool around i dont mean nothing tell her i fool around whats going on here lucy kerr said walking down the path hand on her pistol grip culbeau shook his head sean was being an asshole which is gonna get him killed someday lucy said sachs closed the switchblade onehanded and put it back into her pocket look im cut look blood osarian held up a stained finger damn tomel said reverently though sachs had no idea what he was referring to lucy looked at sachs you want to do anything about this take a shower she responded culbeau laughed sachs added we dont have time to waste on them the deputy nodded to the men this is a crime scene you boysre out your reward she nodded at the rifles you want to hunt do it elsewhere oh like anythings in season osarian asked sarcastically dishing on lucy for the stupidity of her comment i mean hell ohhh then head back to town fore you bollix up your lives any moren you already have the men picked up their guns culbeau lowered his head to osarians ear and spoke quiet angry words to him osarian gave a shrug and grinned for a moment sachs thought culbeau was going to hit him but then the tall man calmed and turned back to lucy you find mary beth not yet but we got garrett and hell tell us culbeau said wish we got the reward but im glad hes caught that boys trouble when they were gone sachs asked you find anything else in the mill no thought id come down here to help you look for a boat as they continued down the path sachs said one thing i forgot about we ought to send somebody back to that trap the hornets nest kill em and fill in the hole oh jim sent trey williams one of our deputies over there with a can of wasp spray and a shovel but there werent any wasps it was an old nest empty right so it wasnt a trap at all just a trick to slow them down sachs reflected too that the ammonia bottle wasnt intended to hurt anybody either garrett could have rigged it to spill on his pursuers blinding them but hed perched it on the side of a small cliff if they hadnt found the fishing line first and tripped it the bottle wouldve fallen onto rocks ten feet below the path warning garrett with the smell of the ammonia but not hurting anyone she had an image of garretts wide frightened eyes once more im scared make him stop sachs realized lucy was talking to her im sorry the deputy said whered you learn how to use that toad sticker of yours that knife wilderness training wilderness where place called brooklyn sachs responded waiting mary beth mcconnell stood beside the grimy window she was edgy and dizzy from the close heat of her prison and the bristling thirst she hadnt found a drop of any liquid to drink in the entire house glancing out the back window of the cabin past the wasps nest she could see empties of bottled water in a trash heap they taunted her and the sight made her feel all the more thirsty she knew she couldnt last more than a day or two in this heat without something to drink where are you where she spoke silently to the missionary if there had been a man there and he wasnt just a creation of her desperate thirstcrazed imagination she leaned against the hot wall of the shack wondered if shed faint tried to swallow but there wasnt a bit of moisture in her mouth the air enwrapped her face stifling as hot wool then thinking angrily oh garrett i knew youd be trouble she remembered the old saw no good deed goes unpunished i should never have helped him out but how could i not how could i not save him from those high school boys she recalled seeing the four of them watching garrett on the ground after hed fainted on maple street last year one tall sneering boy a friend of billy stails from the football team unzipped his guess jeans pulled out his penis and was about to urinate on garrett shed stormed up to them given them hell and snatched one boys cell phone to call an ambulance for garrett i had to do it of course but once id saved him i was his at first after that incident mary beth was amused that he would shadow her like a shy admirer calling her at home to tell her things hed heard on the news leaving presents for her but what presents a glistening green beetle in a tiny cage clumsy drawings of spiders and centipedes a dragonfly on a string a live one but then she began to notice him nearby a little too often shed hear footsteps behind her as she walked from the car to the house late at night see a figure in the trees near her house in blackwater landing hear his high eerie voice muttering words she couldnt make out talking or singing to himself hed spot her on main street and make a beeline to her rambling on taking up precious time making her feel more and more uneasy glancing both embarrassed and desirous at her breasts and legs and hair mary beth mary beth did you know that if a spiderweb was like stretched all around the world itd weigh less than an ounce hey mary beth you know that a spiderweb is something like five times stronger than steel and its way more elastic than nylon some webs are really cool theyre like hammocks flies lie down in them and never wake up she should have noticed she now reflected that much of his trivia was about spiders and insects snaring prey and so she rearranged her life to avoid running into him finding new stores to shop in different routes home different paths to ride her mountain bike on but then something happened that would negate all her efforts to distance herself from garrett hanlon mary beth made a discovery and it happened to be on the banks of the paquenoke river right in the heart of blackwater landing a place that the boy had staked out as his personal fiefdom still it was a discovery so important that not even a gang of moonshiners let alone a skinny boy obsessed with insects could keep her away from the place mary beth didnt know why history excited her so much but it always had she remembered going to colonial williamsburg when she was a little girl it was only a twohour drive from tanners corner and the family went there often mary beth memorized the roads near the town so that shed know when they were almost to their destination then shed close her eyes and after her father had parked the buick she made her mother lead her by the hand into the park so that she could open her eyes and pretend that she was actually back in colonial america shed felt this same exhilaration only a hundred times greater when shed been walking along the banks of the paquenoke in blackwater landing last week eyes on the ground and noticed something halfburied in the muddy soil shed dropped to her knees and started moving aside dirt with the care of a surgeon exposing an ailing heart and yes there they were old relics the evidence that a stunned twentythreeyearold mary beth mcconnell had been searching desperately for evidence that could prove her theory which would rewrite american history like all north carolinians and most schoolchildren in america mary beth mcconnell had studied the lost colony of roanoke in history class in the late s a settlement of english colonists landed on roanoke island between the mainland of north carolina and the outer banks after some mostly harmonious contact between the settlers and the local native americans relations deteriorated with winter approaching and the colonists running short on food and other provisions governor john white whod founded the colony sailed back to england for relief but by the time he returned to roanoke the colonists more than a hundred men women and children had disappeared the only clue as to what had happened was the word croatoan carved in tree bark near the settlement this was the indian name for hatteras about fifty miles south of roanoke most historians believed the colonists died at sea en route to hatteras or were killed when they arrived though there was no record of them ever landing there mary beth had visited roanoke island several times and had seen the reenactment of the tragedy performed at a small theater there she was moved and chilled by the play but she never thought much about the story until she was older and studying at the university of north carolina in avery where she read about the lost colony in depth one aspect of the story that raised unanswered questions about the fate of the colonists involved a girl named virginia dare and the legend of the white doe it was a story that mary beth mcconnell an only child a bit of a renegade singleminded could understand virginia dare was the first english child born in america she was governor whites granddaughter and was one of the lost colonists presumably the history books reported she died with them at or on the way to hatteras but as mary beth continued her research she learned that not long after the disappearance of the colonists when more british began to settle on the eastern seaboard local legends about the lost colony began to spring up one tale was that the colonists werent killed right away but survived and continued to live among the local tribes virginia dare grew into a beautiful young woman blond and fairskinned strongwilled and independent a medicine man fell in love with her but she rejected him and not long after that she disappeared the medicine man claimed he hadnt harmed her but because she rejected his love hed turned her into a white deer no one believed him of course but soon people in the area began seeing a beautiful white doe who seemed to be the leader of all the animals in the woods the tribe frightened by the does apparent powers held a contest to capture her one young brave managed to track her down and made a nearly impossible shot with a silvertipped arrow it pierced her chest and as she lay dying the doe looked up at the hunter with chillingly human eyes he stammered who are you virginia dare the deer whispered and died mary beth had decided to look into the story of the white doe in earnest spending long days and nights in academic archives at unc at chapel hill and at duke university reading old diaries and journals from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries she found a number of references to white deer and mysterious white beasts in northeastern north carolina but the sightings werent on either roanoke or hatteras the creatures were seen along the blackwater banks where the serpentine river flowes west from the great swamp mary beth knew the power of legend and how there is often truth in even the most fanciful tales she reasoned that maybe the lost colonists afraid of attack by the local tribes had left the word croatoan to lead off their attackers and escaped not south but west where they settled along the banks of the yes serpentine paquenoke river near tanners corner in what was now called blackwater landing there the lost colonists grew more and more powerful and the indians fearful of the threat attacked and killed them virginia dare mary beth allowed herself to speculate interpreting the legend of the white doe might have been one of the last settlers alive fighting to the death well this was her theory but mary beth had never found any proof to support it shed spent days prowling around blackwater landing with ancient maps trying to figure out exactly where the colonists mightve landed and where their settlement had been then finally last week walking along the banks of the paquo she found evidence of the lost colony she remembered her mothers horror when the girl had told her that she was going to be doing some archaeological work at blackwater landing not therethe doughy woman had said bitterly as if she herself were in danger thats where the insect boy kills people hell find you hell hurt you mother shed snapped back youre like those assholes at school who tease him you said that word again i asked you not to the a word mom come on you sound like a hardshell baptist sitting on the anxious bench meaning the front row in church where sat those parishioners particularly worried about their own or more likely someone elses moral standing even the name is scary sue mcconnell muttered blackwater and mary beth explained that there were dozens of blackwaters in north carolina any river that flowed from marshlands was referred to as a blackwater river because it was darkened by deposits of decaying vegetation the paquenoke was fed by the great dismal swamp and surrounding bogs but this information didnt relieve her mother one bit please dont go honey then the woman fired her own silvertipped arrow of guilt now that your fathers gone if anything happened to you i wouldnt have anyone id be alone i wouldnt know what to do you dont want that do you but mary beth fired by the adrenaline that had excited explorers and scientists forever had packed up her brushes and collection jars and bags and gardeners spade and headed off yesterday morning in the wet yellow heat to continue her archaeological work and what had happened shed been assaulted and kidnapped by the insect boy her mother had been right now sitting in this hot disgusting cabin in pain sick and halfdelirious with thirst she thought about her mother having lost her husband to wasting cancer the womans life was falling apart shed given up her friends her volunteer work at the hospital any semblance of routine and normalcy in her life mary beth found herself assuming the role of parent while her mother slipped into the world of daytime tv and junk food pudgy and insensate and needy she was nothing more than a pathetic child but one of the things her father had taught mary beth by his life as well as by his arduous death was that you do what youre destined for and dont alter your course for anyone mary beth hadnt dropped out of school as her mother had begged and gotten a job close to home she balanced her mothers need for support with her own the need to get her grad degree and when she graduated next year to find a job doing serious fieldwork in american anthropology if that happened to be nearby fine but if it was conducting native american digs in santa fe or eskimo in alaska or africanamerican in manhattan then that was where shed go shed always be there for her mother but she had her own life to look forward to except that now when she should be unearthing and collecting more evidence at blackwater landing conferring with her grad adviser and writing proposals running tests on the relics shed found she was trapped in a psychotic teenagers love nest a wave of hopelessness coursed through her she felt the tears but then she stopped them cold stop it be strong be your fathers daughter fighting his illness every single minute of the day never resting not your mothers be virginia dare who rallied the lost colonists be the white doe the queen of all the animals in the forest and then just as she was thinking of an illustration of the majestic deer in a book about north carolina legends there was another flash of motion at the edge of the forest the missionary came out of the woods a large backpack over his shoulder he was real mary beth grabbed one of garretts jars which held a dinosaurlike beetle and slammed it against the window the jar crashed through the glass and shattered on the iron bars outside help me she screamed in a voice barely audible because of her sanddry throat help a hundred yards away the man paused looked around please help me a long wail he looked behind him then into the woods she took a deep breath and tried to call again but her throat seized she started choking spit some blood and across the field the missionary kept on walking into the woods he disappeared from view a moment later mary beth sat heavily on the musty couch and leaned her head hopelessly against the wall she glanced up suddenly some motion had caught her eye again it was nearby in the cabin the beetle in the jar the miniature triceratops had survived the trauma of losing his home mary beth watched him troop doggedly up a summit of broken glass open one set of wings then spread a second set which fluttered invisibly and lifted him off the windowsill to freedom weve caught him rhyme said to jim bell and his brotherinlaw deputy steve farr amelia and me that was the bargain now we have to get back to avery well lincoln bell began delicately its just that garretts not talking hes not telling us anything about where mary beth is ben kerr stood nearby uncertainly beside the glowing mountain range on the computer screen connected to the chromatograph his initial hesitancy had vanished and he now seemed to regret the end of his assignment amelia sachs was in the lab too mason germain wasnt which was just as well rhyme was furious that hed endangered sachs life with the sniping at the mill bell had angrily ordered the deputy to stay out of the case for the time being i appreciate that rhyme said dismissively responding to bell s implicit request for more help but its not that shes in immediate danger lydia had reported that mary beth was alive and had told them the general location where she was being held a concentrated search of the outer banks would probably find her within several days and rhyme was now ready for the operation he clung of all things to a bizarre goodluck charm the memory of henry davetts gruff argument with him the mans temperedsteel gaze the image of the businessman prodded him to return to the hospital to finish the tests and to go under the knife he glanced at ben and was about to instruct him on how to pack up the forensic equipment when sachs took up bell s cause we found some evidence at the mill rhyme lucy did actually good evidence rhyme said sourly if its good evidence then somebody elsell be able to figure out where it leads to look lincoln bell began in his reasonable carolinian accent im not going to push it but youre the only one round heres got experience at major crimes like this wed be at sea trying to figure out what thats telling us for instance he nodded at the chromatograph or whether this bit of dirt or that footprint means anything head rubbing against the storm arrows pillowy rest rhyme glanced at sachs imploring face sighing he finally asked garretts not saying anything hes talking farr said tugging at one of his flaglike ears but hes denying killing billy and hes saying he got mary beth away from blackwater landing for her own good thats it wont say a word about where she is sachs said in this heat rhyme she could die of thirst or starve to death farr pointed out oh for gods sake thom rhyme snapped call dr weaver tell her ill be here for a little longer emphasize little thats all were asking lincoln bell said relief in his lined face an hour or two we sure appreciate it well make you an honorary resident of tanners corner the sheriff joked well give you the key to the town all the faster to unlock the door and get the hell out of here rhyme thought cynically he asked bell wheres lydia in the hospital she all right nothing serious theyre keeping her in for observation for a day whatd she say exactlyrhyme demanded sachs said that garrett told her hes got mary beth east of here near the ocean on the outer banks he also said that he didnt really kidnap her she went along willingly he was just looking out for her and she was happy to be where she was she also told me that we caught garrett completely off guard he never thought wed get to the mill so fast when he smelled the ammonia he panicked changed his clothes gagged her and ran out the door okay ben weve got some things to look at the zoologist nodded pulled on his latex gloves once more without rhymes having to instruct him to do so the criminalist observed rhyme asked about the food and water found at the mill ben held them up the criminalist observed no individual store labels like the others wont do us any good see if theres anything adhering to the sticky sides of the duct tape sachs and ben bent over the roll and spent ten minutes examining it with a hand glass she pulled fragments of wood from the side and ben once again held the instrument so rhyme could peer into the eyepieces but under the microscope it was clear that they matched the wood in the mill nothing she said ben then picked up the map that showed paquenoke county it was marked with xs and arrows indicating garretts path to the mill from blackwater landing there was no price sticker on this either and it gave no indication of where the boy had been headed once hed left the mill rhyme said to bell you have an esda a what electrostatic detection apparatus dont even know what that is picks up indented writing on paper if garrett had written something on top of the map a town or address we could see it well we dont have one should i call the state police no ben just shine a flashlight on the map at a low angle see if therere any indentations ben did this and though they searched every inch of the map they could see no evidence of writing or other marking rhyme ordered ben to examine the second map the one lucy had found in the gristmill lets see if theres any trace in the folds its too big for magazine subscription cards open it over a newspaper more sand poured out rhyme noticed immediately that it was in fact ocean sand the sort that would be found on the outer banks the grains were clear not opaque as would have been the case with inland sand run a sample through the chromatograph lets see if theres any other trace thatll be helpful ben started the noisy machine as they waited for the results he spread the map out on the table bell ben and rhyme examined it carefully it depicted the eastern shore of the us from norfolk virginia and the hampton roads shipping lanes all the way down to south carolina they looked over every inch but garrett hadnt circled or marked any location of course not rhyme thought its never that easy they used the flashlight on this map too but found no indented writing the chromatograph results flashed up onto the screen rhyme glanced at it quickly not much help sodium chloride salt along with iodine organic material all consistent with seawater but theres hardly any other trace doesnt do us much good for tying the sand to a specific location rhyme nodded at the shoes that had been in the box with the map he asked ben any other trace in those the young man examined them carefully even unlacing them just as rhyme was about to ask him to do this boy has good criminalist potential rhyme thought he shouldnt be wasting his talent on neurotic fish the shoes were old nikes so common that tracing them to a particular store where garrett might have bought them was impossible flecks of dried leaves looks like maple and oak if i had to guess rhyme nodded nothing else in the box nothing rhyme looked up at the other evidence charts his eye paused at the references to camphene sachs in the mill were there oldfashioned lamps on the walls or lanterns no sachs answered none are you sure he persisted gruffly or did you just not notice she crossed her arms and said evenly the floors were teninchwide chestnut the walls plaster and lath there was graffiti on one of the walls in blue spray paint it said josh and brittany luv always love spelled luv there was one shakerstyle table cracked down the middle and painted black three bottles of deer park water a pack of reeses peanut butter cups five bags of doritos two bags of cape cod potato chips six cans of pepsi four cans of coke eight packets of planters peanutbutterandcheese crackers there were two windows in the room one was boarded over in the unboarded window there was only one pane that was unbroken the others had been smashed and every doorknob and window latch in the place were stolen there were oldfashioned raised electric switches on the walls and yes im sure there were no oldfashioned lamps whoa she got you there lincoln ben said laughing now being one of the gang the young man was rewarded with a glower from rhyme the criminalist stared once more at the evidence then shook his head said to bell im sorry jim the best i can tell you is that shes probably being held in a house not far from the ocean but if the deciduous leaves are near the place not on the water because oak and maple wouldnt grow in sand and its old because of the camphene lamps nineteenth century thats the best i can do im afraid bell was looking at the map of the eastern shore shaking his head well im going to talk to garrett again see if hell cooperate if not im gonna give the da a call and think about trading a plea for information worse comes to worst ill fix up a search of the outer banks i tell you lincoln youre a lifesaver i cant thank you enough youll be here for a spell only long enough to show ben how to pack up the equipment rhyme spontaneously thought again of his mascot henry davett but he found to his surprise that his elation that his job was now finished was tainted by his frustration that the ultimate answer to the puzzle of finding mary beth mcconnell still eluded him but as his exwife used to say to him as he walked out the door of their apartment at one or two am to run a crime scene you cant save the entire world i wish you luck jim sachs said to bell you mind if i come with you to see garrett feel free the sheriff said he seemed to want to add something maybe about female charm helping them get some information out of the boy but he then apparently and wisely rhyme reflected thought better of it lets get to work ben rhyme said he wheeled to the table that held the density gradient tubes now listen carefully a criminalists tools are like a tactical officers weapons they have to be packed and stored just right you treat them as if somebodys life will depend on them because believe me it will are you listening ben im listening the tanners corner lockup was a structure two long blocks away from the sheriffs department sachs and bell walked along the blistering sidewalk toward the place again she was struck by the ghosttown quality of tanners corner the sickly drunks theyd noticed when they first arrived were still downtown sitting on a bench silent a skinny coiffed woman parked her mercedes in an empty row of parking spaces climbed out and walked into the nail salon the glitzy car seemed completely out of place in the small town there was no one else on the street sachs noticed a halfdozen businesses had gone under one of them had been a toy store a mannequin of a baby wearing a sunbleached jumper lay in the window where she thought again were all the children then she looked across the street and saw a face watching her from the dim recesses of eddies bar she squinted those three guys she said nodding bell looked culbeau and his buddies uhhuh theyre trouble they got my weapon away from me sachs said one of them did osarian the sheriff frowned what happened i got it back she answered shortly you want me to bring him in no just thought you should know theyre upset about losing out on the reward if you ask me though its more than that theyre gunning for that boy them and the rest of the town sachs said but the rest of the town doesnt carry around loaded weapons bell chuckled and said well not all of em anyway im also a little curious how they happened to end up at the mill the sheriff thought about this for a moment mason you thinking yep sachs said wish hed take his vacation this week but theres no chance of that happening well here we are not much of a jail but it works they walked inside the singlestory cinderblock building the groaning airconditioner kept the rooms mercifully cool bell told her to drop her gun in the lockbox he did the same and they walked into the interrogation room he closed the door wearing a blue jumpsuit courtesy of the county garrett hanlon sat at a fiberboard table across from jesse corn the deputy smiled at sachs and she gave him a smaller smile in return she then looked at the boy and was struck again at how sad and desperate he seemed im scared make him stop on his face and arms were welts that hadnt been there earlier she asked what happened to your skin he looked down at his arm and rubbed selfconsciously poison oak he muttered in a kind voice bell said you heard your rights didnt you did deputy kerr read them to you yeah and you understand them i guess theres a lawyer on his way mr fredericks hes coming from a meeting in elizabeth city and hell be here pretty soon you dont have to say anything until he gets here you understand that he nodded sachs glanced at the oneway mirror wondered who was on the other side manning the video camera but we hope youll talk to us garrett bell continued we have some real important things to ask you about first of all its true mary beths alive sure she is did you rape her like id never do that he said and the pathos momentarily gave way to indignation but you kidnapped her bell said not really not really she like didnt get it that blackwater landings dangerous i had to get her away or she wouldnt be safe thats all i saved her like sometimes you gotta make somebody do things they dont want to for their own good and you know then they catch on shes near the beach somewhere isnt she the outer banks right he blinked at this red eyes narrowing hed be realizing that theyd found the map and talked to lydia he looked down at the fiberboard table didnt say anything else where is she exactly garrett i cant tell you son youre in serious trouble you got a murder conviction staring you in the face i didnt kill billy howd you know it was billy i was talking about bell asked quickly jesse corn lifted an eyebrow to sachs impressed at his bosss cleverness garretts fingernails clicked together whole world knows billy got killed his fast eyes circled the room resting inevitably on amelia sachs she could endure the imploring look for only a moment then had to look away we got your fingerprints on the shovel that killed him the shovel that killed him yep he seemed to think back to what had happened i remember seeing it lying there on the ground i guess maybe i picked it up why i dont know i wasnt thinking i felt all weird seeing billy lying there like all bloody and everything well you have any idea who did kill billy this man mary beth told me that she was like doing this project for school there by the river and billy stopped to talk to her and then this man came up hed been following billy and they started arguing and fighting and this guy grabbed the shovel and killed him then i came by and he ran off you saw him yessir what were they arguing about bell asked skeptically drugs or something mary beth said sounded like billy was selling drugs to the kids on the football team like those steroid things jeeez said jesse corn giving a sour laugh garrett bell said billy wasnt into drugs i knew him and we never had any reports about steroids at the high school i understand that billy stail ragged on you a lot jesse said billy and a couple other boys on the team sachs thought this wasnt right two big deputies doubleteaming him that they made fun of you called you bug boy you took a swing at billy once and he and his friends beat you up bad i dont remember principal gilmore told us bell said they had to call security maybe but i didnt kill him ed schaeffer died you know he got stung to death by those wasps in the blind im sorry that happened that wasnt my fault i didnt put the nest there it wasnt a trap no it was just there in the hunting blind i went there all the time even slept there and they didnt bother me yellow jackets only sting when theyre afraid youre going to hurt their family well tell us about this man you say killed billy the sheriff said you ever see him around here before yessir two or three times the last couple years walking through the woods around blackwater landing then once i saw him near the school white black white and he was tall maybe about as old as mr babbage his forties yeah i guess he had blond hair and he was wearing overalls tan ones and a white shirt but it was just your and billys fingerprints on the shovel bell pointed out nobody elses garrett said like i think he was wearing gloves whyd he be wearing gloves this time of year jesse said probably so he wouldnt leave fingerprints garrett shot back sachs thought back to the frictionridge prints on the shovel she and rhyme hadnt done the printing themselves sometimes its possible to image grain prints from leather gloves cotton or wool glove prints were much less detectable although fabric fibers could slough off and get caught in the tiny splinters in a wooden surface like a tool handle well what you say couldve happened garrett bell said but it just doesnt seem like the truth to anybody billy was dead i just picked up the shovel and looked at it which i shouldnt have but i did thats all that happened i knew mary beth was in danger so i took her away to be safe he said this to sachs gazing at her with imploring eyes lets get back to her bell said why was she in danger because she was in blackwater landing he snapped his nails again different from my habit sachs reflected i dig into my flesh he clicks nail against nail which is worse she wondered mine she decided its more destructive he turned his damp ruddy eyes back to sachs stop it i cant take that look she thought glancing away and todd wilkes the boy who hung himself did you threaten him no his brother saw you shouting at him last week he was dropping lit matches on anthills thats shitty and mean and i told him to stop it what about lydia bell said whyd you kidnap her i was worried about her too because she was in blackwater landing right you were going to rape her werent you no garrett started to cry i wasnt going to hurt her or anybody and i didnt kill billy everybodys trying to get me to say i did something that i didnt bell dug up a kleenex and handed it to the boy the door swung open fast and mason germain walked in hed probably been the one watching through the oneway mirror and from the look on his face it was clear hed lost patience sachs smelled his raw cologne shed come to detest the cloying scent mason bell began listen to me boy you tell us where that girl is and you tell us now cause if you dont youre going to lancaster and youre going to stay there till they put your ass on trial you heard about lancaster havent you case you havent let me tell all right thats enough a highpitched voice commanded a bantam strode into the room a man even shorter than mason with razortrimmed hair perfectly sprayed into place a gray suit all buttons snug a babyblue shirt and striped tie he wore shoes with threeinch heels dont say another word he said to garrett hello cal bell said not pleased the visitor was here the sheriff introduced sachs to calvin fredericks garretts lawyer what the hellre you doing interrogating my client without me being here he nodded at mason and what the hell was that lancaster stuff about i should have you put away for talking to him like that he knows where the girl is cal mason muttered hes not telling us he had his rights read to him he a sixteenyearold boy well im inclined to get this case thrown out right now and get on to an early supper he turned to garrett hey young man how you doing my face itches they mace you nosir just happens well get it taken care of get some cream or something now im going to be your lawyer the state appointed me you dont have to pay they read you your rights told you you didnt have to say anything yessir but sheriff bell wanted to ask me some questions he said to bell oh thiss cute jim what were you thinking of four deputies in here mason said we were thinking of mary beth mcconnell who he kidnapped allegedly and raped mason muttered i didnt garrett shouted we got a bloody tissue with his come all over it mason snapped no no the boy said his face growing alarmingly red mary beth hurt herself thats what happened she hit her head and i like wiped off the blood with a kleenex i had in my pocket and about the other sometimes i just you know touch myself i know i shouldnt i know its wrong but i cant help it shhhh garrett fredericks said you dont have to explain a single thing to anybody to bell he said now this interrogation is over with take him back to the cell as jesse corn was leading him out the door garrett stopped suddenly and turned to sachs please you have to do something for me please my room at home its got some jars go on jesse bell commanded take him out but sachs found herself saying wait to garrett the jars with your insects the boy nodded will you put water in them or at least let them go outside so they have a chance mr and mrs babbage they wont do anything to keep them alive please she hesitated sensing everyones eyes upon her then nodded ill do it i promise garrett gave her a faint smile bell looked at sachs with a cryptic gaze then nodded toward the door and jesse led the boy out the lawyer started after him but bell stuck a finger in his chest youre not going anywhere cal were sitting here till mcguire shows up dont touch me bell he muttered but he sat as ordered jesus lord whats all this folderol here you talking to a sixteenyearold without shut the hell up cal i wasnt fishing for a confession which he didnt give us and i wouldnt use if he did we got more evidence than we need to put him away forever all i care about is finding mary beth shes on the outer banks somewhere and thats a hell of a big haystack to find somebody in without some help no way hes not saying another word she could die of thirst cal she could starve to death heatstroke get sick when the lawyer gave no response the sheriff said cal that boys a menace hes got a slew of incident reports against him which my secretary read to me on the way over here hell theyre mostly for truancy oh and for peeping when he funnily enough wasnt even on the property of the complaining party just hanging out on the sidewalk the hornets nest a few years ago mason said angrily meg blanchard you released him the lawyer pointed out happily not even indicted bell said this ones different cal we got eyewitnesses we got hard evidence and now ed schaeffers dead we can do to this boy pretty much what we feel like a slim man in a wrinkled blue seersucker suit walked into the interrogation room thinning gray hair a lined fiftyfiveyearold face he glanced at amelia with a vacant nod and at fredericks with a darker expression i heard enough of that to make me think thiss one of the easiest cases of murder one kidnapping and sexual assault ive had in years bell introduced sachs to bryan mcguire the paquenoke county prosecutor hes sixteen fredericks said in an unflappable voice the da said isnt a venue in this state wouldnt try him as an adult and put him away for two hundred years so giddyap mcguire fredericks said impatiently youre fishing for a bargain i know that tone mcguire nodded to bell and sachs deduced that a conversation between the sheriff and the district attorney had occurred earlier about this very subject of course were bargaining bell continued theres a good chance that girls alive and we want to find her fore shes not alive anymore mcguire said we got so many charges on this one cal youd be amazed at how flexible we can be amaze me the cocky defense lawyer said i could go with two counts unlawful detention and assault and two counts firstdegree manslaughter one for billy stail one for the deputy who died yessir im willing to do that all conditioned on finding the girl alive ed schaeffer the lawyer countered that was accidental mason raged it was a fucking trap the boy set ill give you first manslaughter for billy mcguire offered and negligent homicide for the deputy fredericks chewed on this for a moment lemme see what i can do his heels tapping noisily the lawyer vanished in the direction of the cells to consult with his client he returned five minutes later and he wasnt happy whatsa story bell asked discouraged as he read the lawyers expression no luck stonewalling completely bell muttered if you know something and youre not telling us cal i dont give a shit about attorneyclient privilege no no jim for real he says hes protecting the girl he says shes happy where she is and you oughta go looking for this guy in tan overalls and a white shirt bell said he doesnt even have a good description and if he gave us one itd change tomorrow because hes making it up mcguire slicked back his alreadyslickedback hair the defense used aqua net sachs could smell the prosecution brylcreem listen cal thiss your problem im offering you what im offering you get us the girls whereabouts and shes alive ill go with reduced counts you dont ill take it to trial and go for the moon that boyll never see the outside of a prison again we both know it silence for a moment fredericks said ive got a thought uhhuh mcguire said skeptically no listen i had a case in albemarle a spell back a woman claimed her boyd run away from home but it seemed fishy the williams case mcguire asked that black woman that was it i heard of that one you represented her bell asked right she was giving us pretty odd stories and had a history of mental problems i hired this psychologist over in avery hoping he could give me an insanity opinion he ran some tests on her during one of em she opened up and told us what had happened hypnosis that recoveredmemory crap mcguire asked no its something else he called it empty chair therapy i dont exactly know how it works but it really started her talking like all she needed was a little push let me give this guy a call and have him come over and talk to garrett the boy might see reason but now the defense got to poke a finger in bell s chest everything they talk abouts privileged and you dont get diddly unless the guardian ad litem and i say so first bell caught mcguires eye and nodded the da said call him okay fredericks stepped toward the phone in the corner of the interrogation room sachs said excuse me the lawyer turned to her that case the psychologist helped you with the williams case yeah what happened with her child did he run away naw the mother killed him baled him up in chicken wire and a cinder block and drowned him in a pond behind the house hey jim how do i get an outside line the scream was so loud that it stung her dry throat like fire and for all mary beth knew permanently damaged her vocal cords the missionary walking by the edge of the woods paused his backpack was over one shoulder a tank like a weed sprayer in his hand he glanced around himself please please please mary beth was thinking ignoring the pain she tried again over here help me he looked at the cabin started to walk away she took a deep breath thought of garrett hanlons clicking fingernails his wet eyes and hard erection thought of her fathers brave death of virginia dare and she gave the loudest scream she ever had this time the missionary stopped looked toward the cabin again he pulled off his hat left the rucksack and tank on the ground and started running toward her thank you she started to sob oh thank you he was thin and welltanned in his fifties but in good shape clearly an outdoorsman whats wrong he called gasping when he was fifty feet away slowing to a trot are you all right please she rasped the pain in her throat was overwhelming she spit more blood he walked cautiously up to the broken window looking at the shards of glass on the ground you need some help i cant get out somebodys kidnapped me kidnapped mary beth wiped her face which was wet with tears of relief and sweat a high school kid from tanners corner wait i heard about that was on the news youre the one he kidnapped thats right where is he now she tried to speak but her throat hurt too much she breathed deeply and finally responded i dont know he left last night please do you have any water a canteen with my gear ill get it and call the police you have a phone not with me he shook his head and grimaced im doing contract work for the county he nodded toward the backpack and tank were killing marijuana you know that kids plant out here the county gives us those cell phones but i never bother with mine you hurt bad he studied her head the crusted blood its okay but water i need water he trotted back to the woods and for a terrible moment she was afraid hed keep going but he picked up an olive drab canteen and ran back she took it with trembling hands and forced herself to drink slowly the water was hot and musty but shed never had as wonderful a drink as this im going to try and get you out the man said he walked to the front door a moment later she heard a faint thud as he either kicked the door or tried to break it with his shoulder another two more he picked up a rock and slammed it into the wood it had no effect he returned to the window its not budging he wiped sweat from his forehead as he examined the bars on the windows man he built himself a prison here hacksawd take hours okay ill go for help whats your name mary beth mcconnell im going to call the police then come back and get you out please dont be long i got a friend isnt too far away ill call nineoneone from his place and well come back that boy does he have a gun i dont know i didnt see one but i dont know you sit tight mary beth youre gonna be okay i dont run as a rule but ill do some running today he turned and started through the field mister thank you but he didnt acknowledge her gratitude he sprinted through the sedge and tall grass and disappeared in the woods not even pausing to collect his gear mary beth remained standing in front of the window cradling the canteen as if it were a newborn baby on the street across from the lockup sachs saw lucy kerr sitting on a park bench in front of a deli drinking an arizona iced tea she crossed the street the women nodded to each other sachs noticed a sign on the front of the place cold beer she asked lucy you have an opencontainer law in tanners corner yeah lucy said and we take it pretty serious the law is if youre going to drink from a container its got to be open took just a second for the joke to register sachs laughed she said you want something stronger lucy nodded at the iced tea thisll do fine sachs came out a minute later with a sam adams ale foaming excessively in a large styrofoam cup she sat down next to the deputy she told lucy about the discussion between mcguire and fredericks about the psychologist hope that works lucy said jim was figuring theres gotta be thousands of old houses on the outer banks well have to narrow down the search some they said nothing for a few minutes a lone teenager clattered past on a noisy skateboard and vanished sachs commented on the absence of children in town true lucy said hadnt thought about it but there arent a lot of kids here i think most of the young couplesve moved away places closer to the interstate maybe or bigger towns tanners corners not the sort of place for anybody on the way up sachs asked you have any children no buddy and i never did then we split up and i never met anybody after that my big regret ill have to say no kids how long you been divorced three years sachs was surprised the woman hadnt remarried she was very attractive especially her eyes when sachs had been a professional model in new york before shed decided to follow in her fathers lawenforcement career shed spent a lot of time with many gorgeous people but so often their gazes were vacant if the eyes arent beautiful amelia sachs had concluded neither is the person sachs told lucy oh youll meet somebody have a family ive got my job lucy said quickly dont have to do everything in life you know something was going unsaid here something that she felt lucy wanted to divulge sachs wondered whether she should push it or not she tried the oblique approach must be a thousand men in paquenoke county dying to go out with you after a moment lucy said fact is i dont date much really another pause sachs looked up and down the dusty deserted street the skateboarder was long gone lucy took a breath to say something opted for a long sip of iced tea instead then on impulse it seemed the policewoman said you know that medical problem i told you about sachs nodded breast cancer wasnt too advanced but the doctor said they probably should do a double radical and thats what they did im sorry sachs said frowning with sympathy you go through the treatments yup was bald for a while interesting look she sipped more of the iced tea im three and a half years in remission so far so good lucy continued really threw me for a loop that happening no history of it in my family grandmothers healthy as a horse my moms still working five days a week at the mattamuskeet national wildlife reserve she and my dad hike the appalachian two three times a year sachs asked you cant have kids because of the radiation oh no they used a shield its just i guess im not inclined to date much you know where a mans hand goes right after you kiss serious for the first time sachs couldnt argue with that ill meet some nice guy and well have coffee or something but in ten minutes i start to worry about what hes going to think when he finds out and i end up not returning his phone calls sachs said so youve given up on a family maybe when im older ill meet a widower with a couple grown kids thatd be nice she said this casually but sachs could hear in her voice that shed repeated it to herself often maybe every day lucy lowered her head sighed id give up my badge in a minute to have children but hey life doesnt always go in the direction we want and your ex left you after the operation whats his name again bud not right after but eight months later hell i cant blame him why do you say that what that you cant blame him sachs asked just i cant i changed and ended up being different i turned into something he hadnt bargained for sachs said nothing for a moment then she offered lincoln s different about as different as they come lucy considered this so theres more to you two than just being what would you say colleagues thats right sachs said thought that might be the case then she laughed hey youre a tough cop from the big city how do you feel about children id like some pop my father wanted grandkids he was a cop too liked the idea of three generations on the force thought people magazine might do a story on us or something he loved people past tense died a few years ago killed on his beat sachs debated but finally answered cancer lucy said nothing for a moment looked at sachs in profile back to the lockup can he have children lincoln the foam was down in the cup of beer and she sipped in earnest theoretically yes and chose not to tell lucy that this morning when they were at the neurologic research institute in avery the reason that sachs had slipped out of the room with dr weaver was to ask if the operation would affect rhymes chances of having children the doctor had said that it wouldnt and had started to explain about the intervention necessary that would enable her to get pregnant but just then jim bell had showed up with his plea for help nor did she tell the deputy that rhyme had deflected the subject of children every time it came up and she was left to speculate why he was so reluctant to consider the matter it could have been any number of reasons of course his fear that having a family might interfere with his practice of criminalistics which he needed to keep his sanity or his knowledge that quadriplegics statistically at least have a shorter life span than the nondisabled or maybe he wanted to have the freedom to wake up one day and decide that hed had enough and that he didnt want to live any longer perhaps it was all of these coupled with the belief that he and sachs would hardly be the most normal of parents though she would have countered and what exactly is normal nowadays lucy mused i always wondered if i had kids would i keep working how bout you i carry a weapon but im mostly crimescene id cut out the risky stuff have to drive slower too ive got a camaro thatll churn three hundred sixty horses sitting in my garage in brooklyn right now cant really see having one of those baby seats in it a laugh i guess id have to learn how to drive a volvo station wagon with an automatic maybe i could take lessons i can see you laying rubber pulling out of the food lion parking lot silence fell between them that odd silence of strangers whove shared complicated secrets and realize they can go no further with them lucy looked at her watch i should get back to the station house help jim make calls about the outer banks she tossed the empty bottle into the trash shook her head i keep thinking about mary beth wondering where she is if shes okay if shes scared as she said this though amelia sachs was thinking not about the girl but about garrett hanlon because theyd been talking about children sachs was imagining how shed feel if she had a son who was accused of murder and kidnapping who was looking at the prospect of spending the night in jail maybe a hundred nights maybe thousands lucy paused you headed back in a minute or two hope to see you fore you leave the deputy disappeared up the street a few minutes later the door to the lockup opened and mason germain walked out shed never once seen him smile and he wasnt smiling now he looked around the street but didnt notice her he strode over the broken sidewalk and disappeared into one of the buildings a store or bar on the way to the county building then a car pulled up across the street and two men got out garretts lawyer cal fredericks was one and the other was a heavyset man in his forties he was in a shirt and tie the top button undone and the sloppy knot of his striped tie pulled down a few inches from his throat his sleeves were rolled up and his navy sports jacket was draped over his arm his tan slacks were savagely wrinkled his face had the kindness of a gradeschool teacher they walked inside sachs tossed the cup in an oil drum outside the deli she crossed the empty street and followed them into the lockup cal fredericks introduced sachs to doctor elliott penny oh youre working with lincoln rhyme the doctor asked surprising sachs thats right cal told me it was mostly because of you two they caught garrett is he here lincoln hes at the county building right now probably wont be there long we have a friend in common id like to say hi ill stop by if i get a chance sachs said he should be there for another hour or so she turned to cal fredericks can i ask you something yesm the defense lawyer said cautiously sachs was in theory working for the enemy mason germain was talking to garrett in the lockup earlier he mentioned lancaster whats that the violent felony detention center hell be transferred there after the arraignment held there until the trial its juvenile no no adult but hes sixteen sachs said oh mcguirell try him as an adult if we cant work out a plea how bad is it what lancaster the lawyer shrugged his narrow shoulders hell get hurt no getting around that i dont know how bad but he will get hurt a boy like hims gonna be at the bottom of the food chain at vfdc can he be segregated not there its all general population just a big holding pen basically the best we can do is hope the guards look out for him how bout bail fredericks laughed theres no judge in the worldd set bail in a case like this hes a bondjumper waiting to happen is there anything we can do to get him into a different facility lincoln s got friends in new york new york fredericks gave her a genteel but wry southern smile i dont think that carries much weight south of the masondixon line probably not even west of the hudson he nodded toward doctor penny no our best bet is to get garrett to cooperate then work out a plea shouldnt his foster parents be here should be yep i called them but hal said the boys on his own he wouldnt even let me talk to maggie his mother but garrett cant be making decisions on his own sachs said hes just a boy oh fredericks explained before the arraignment or plea deals agreed to the courtll appoint a guardian ad litem dont worry hell be looked out for sachs turned to the doctor whatre you going to do this empty chair test dr penny glanced at the lawyer who nodded his okay to explain its not a test its a type of gestalt therapy a behavioral technique thats known for getting very fast results in understanding certain types of behavior im going to have garrett imagine that mary beth is sitting in a chair in front of him and have him talk to her explain to her why he kidnapped her i hope to get him to understand that shes upset and frightened and that what he did was wrong that shell be better off if he tells us where she is and thisll work its not really intended for this type of situation but i think it could get results the lawyer glanced at his watch you ready doctor he nodded lets go the doctor and fredericks disappeared into the interrogation room sachs hung back got a cup of water from the cooler sipped it slowly when the deputy at the front desk turned his attention back to his newspaper sachs quickly stepped through the door of the observation room where the video camera sat for taping suspects the room was empty she pulled the door shut and sat down peered into the interrogation room she could see garrett in one chair in the middle of the room the doctor sat at the table cal fredericks was in the corner his arms folded ankle resting on a knee revealing the height of his shoes stubby heels a third chair unoccupied sat facing garrett cokes were on the table the cans sweated with condensation through the cheap clattering speaker above the mirror sachs heard their voices garrett im doctor penny howre you no answer its a little warm in here isnt it still garrett said nothing he looked down clicked the nails on his finger and thumb sachs couldnt hear the sound she found her own thumbnail digging into the flesh of her index finger felt moisture saw the blood stop it stop it stop it she thought and forced herself to lower her hands to her sides garrett im here to help you im working with your lawyer mr fredericks here and were trying to get you a reduced sentence for whats happened we can help you but we need your cooperation fredericks said the doctors going to talk to you garrett were going to try to find out a few things but everything you say is going to be just between us we wont tell anybody else without your permission you understand that he nodded remember garrett the doctor said were the good guys were on your side now i want to try something her eyes were on the boys face he scratched at a welt he said i guess see that chair there dr penny nodded toward the chair and the boy glanced at it i see it were going to play sort of a game youre going to pretend theres somebody real important in that chair like the president no i mean somebody important to you somebody you know in real life youre going to pretend theyre sitting there in front of you i want you to talk to them and i want you to be real honest with them you tell them whatever you want to say share your secrets with them if youre mad at them you tell them that if you love them tell them so if you want them like youd want a girl tell them remember its okay to say anything at all nobodys going to be upset with you just talk to the chair garrett asked the doctor why for one thing itll help you feel better about the bad things that happened today you mean like getting caught sachs smiled dr penny seemed to repress his own smile and moved the empty chair a little closer to garrett now imagine that somebody important is sitting right there lets say mary beth mcconnell and that youve got something you want to say to her and nows your chance something youve never said before because it was too hard something really important not just some bullshit garrett looked nervously around the room glanced at his lawyer who nodded encouragingly the boy took a deep breath and let it out slowly okay i guess im ready good now picture mary beth in the but i dont want to say anything to hergarrett interrupted you dont he shook his head i already told her everything i wanted to say there isnt anything else he hesitated i dont know maybe only the thing is id rather imagine somebody else in the chair could we like do that well for now lets stick with mary beth you said maybe theres something you want to say to her what is it do you want to tell her how she let you down or hurt you or made you angry about how you want to get even with her anything at all garrett you can say anything its all right garrett shrugged uhm why cant it be someone else for now lets say it has to be mary beth the boy turned suddenly to the oneway mirror and he looked right at where sachs was sitting involuntarily she sat back as if he knew she was there even though he couldnt possibly see her go on the doctor encouraged the boy turned back to dr penny okay i guess id say im glad shes safe the doctor beamed good garrett lets start there tell her that you saved her tell her why nodding to the chair garrett looked uneasily at the empty chair he began she was in blackwater landing and no remember youre talking to mary beth pretend shes sitting there in the chair he cleared his throat you were in blackwater landing it was like really really dangerous people get hurt in blackwater landing people get killed there i was worried about you i didnt want the man in the overalls to hurt you too the man in the overalls the doctor asked the one who killed billy the doctor looked past garrett to the lawyer who was shaking his head dr penny asked garrett you know even if you did save mary beth she might think she did something to make you mad mad she didnt do anything to make me mad well you took her away from her family i took her away to make sure shes safe he remembered the rules of the game and looked back to the chair i took you away to make sure you were safe i cant help but think the doctor continued softly that theres something else you want to say i sensed that earlier that theres something pretty important to say but you dont want to sachs too had seen this in the boys face his eyes were troubled but he was intrigued with the doctors game what was going through his mind there was something he wanted to say what was it garrett looked down at his long grimy fingernails well maybe there is something go on this is its kinda hard cal fredericks was sitting forward pen held over a pad of paper dr penny said softly lets set the scene mary beths right there shes waiting she wants you to say it garrett asked she does you think so i do the doctor reassured him do you want to tell her something about where she is now where you took her what its like maybe why you took her to that particular place no garrett said i dont want to say anything about that then what do you want to say i his voice faded his nails clicked i know its difficult sachs too was sitting forward in her chair come on she found herself thinking come on garrett we want to help you meet us halfway dr penny continued his voice hypnotic go ahead garrett theres mary beth right there in the chair shes waiting shes wondering what youre going to say talk to her the doctor pushed the soft drink closer to garrett and he took several long drinks the cuffs ringing against the can as he lifted it with both hands after this momentary break the doctor continued what is there that you really want to say to her that one important thing i can see that you want to say it i can see that you need to say it and i think that she needs to hear it the doctor pushed the empty chair closer there she is garrett sitting there right in front of you looking at you whats that one thing youd say to her that you havent been able to nows your chance go ahead another swallow of coke sachs noticed that the boys hands were shaking what was coming she wondered what was he about to say suddenly startling both the men in the room garrett leaned forward and blurted to the chair i really really like you mary beth and and i think i love you he took several deep breaths clicked his fingernails a few times then gripped the arms of the chair nervously and lowered his head his face red as sunset thats what you wanted to say the doctor asked garrett nodded anything else uhm no this time it was the doctor who glanced at the lawyer and shook his head mister garrett began doctor ive like got this question go ahead garrett okay theres this book of mine id really like to have from my house its called the miniature worldwould that be okay well see if that can be arranged the doctor said he looked past garrett to fredericks who rolled his eyes in frustration the men rose pulled on their jackets thatll be it for now garrett the boy nodded sachs quickly rose and stepped outside into the lockup office the desk deputy hadnt noticed her eavesdropping fredericks and the doctor stepped outside as garrett was led back into the cell jim bell pushed through the doorway fredericks introduced him to the doctor and the sheriff asked anything fredericks shook his head not a thing bell said grimly was just over with the magistrate theyre gonna arraign him at six and get him over to lancaster tonight tonightsachs said better to get him out of town therere a few people around hered like to take matters into their own hands dr penny said i can try again later hes very agitated right now course hes agitated bell muttered he just got himself arrested for murder and kidnapping thatd make me agitated too do whatever you want in lancaster but mcguires slapping the charges on him and were shipping him out fore dark and by the way cal i have to tell you mcguires going for murder one in the county building amelia sachs found rhyme as ornery as shed thought hed be come on sachs help poor ben with the equipment and lets get on our way i told dr weaver id be at the hospital some time this year but she just stood at the window looking out finally she said rhyme the criminalist looked up squinted as he studied her the way hed study a bit of trace evidence he couldnt identify i dont like that sachs what i dont like it one bit ben no you have to take the armature off before you pack it up armature ben was struggling to close up the boxy als alternative light source used to image substances invisible to the unaided eye the wand sachs explained and took over packing up the device thanks ben began to coil computer wire that look of yours sachs thats what i dont like your look and the tone of your voice ben she asked could you give us a few minutes alone no he couldnt rhyme snapped we dont have time weve got to get packed up and out of here five minutes she said ben looked from rhyme to sachs and because sachs stared at him with an imploring gaze not an angry gaze she won the contest and the big man stepped out of the room rhyme tried to preempt her sachs weve done all we can do we saved lydia weve caught the perp hell take a plea and tell them where mary beth is hes not going to tell where she is but thats not our problem theres nothing more i dont think he did it killed mary beth i agree the blood shows shes probably alive but i mean killed billy rhyme tossed his head to flick an infuriating tail of hair off his forehead you believe that maninthetanoveralls story that jim mentioned yes i do sachs hes a troubled boy and you feel sorry for him i feel sorry for him but that doesnt have anything to do with it youre right it doesnt he snapped the only thing thats relevant is the evidence and the evidence shows theres no man in overalls and that garretts guilty the evidence suggests hes guilty rhyme it doesnt prove it evidence can be interpreted in a lot of different ways besides ive got some evidence of my own such as he asked me to take care of his insects for him so doesnt it seem a little odd that a coldblooded killer would care what happened to some goddamn insects thats not evidence sachs thats his strategy its psychological warfare trying to break down our defenses the boys smart remember high iq good grades and look at his reading matter its heady stuff hes learned a lot from the insects and one thing about them is that they have no moral code all they care about is surviving those are the lessons hes learned thats been his child development its sad but its not our problem you know that trap he set the pinebough trap rhyme nodded it was only two feet deep and the hornets nest inside it was empty no wasps and the ammonia bottle wasnt rigged to hurt anybody it was just so hed have some warning when a search party was getting close to the mill thats not empirical evidence sachs like the bloody tissue for instance he said he had been masturbating and that mary beth hit her head and he wiped the wound with it anyway if he raped her what would be the point of a tissue to clean up afterward doesnt fit any rape profile i know rhyme quoted himself from the foreword of his criminalistics textbook a profile is a guideevidence is god she completed the quotation okay then there were plenty of footprints at the scene remember it was trampled some of those mightve been the overall mans there are no other prints on the murder weapon he claims the man wore gloves she countered but no leather grain prints either couldve been cloth let me test it and could have could have come on sachs this is pure speculation but you shouldve heard him when he was talking about mary beth he was concerned about her he was acting whats my numberone rule you have a lot of numberone rules she muttered he continued unfazed you cant trust witnesses he thinks he loves her he cares for her he really believes hes protecting her a mans voice interrupted oh he is protecting her sachs and rhyme looked to the doorway it was dr elliott penny he added protecting her from himself sachs introduced them i wanted to meet you lincoln dr penny said i specialize in forensic psychology bert markham and i were on a panel together at the aaleo last year and he speaks highly of you berts a good friend rhyme said just appointed head of chicago pd forensics dr penny nodded toward the corridor garretts lawyers in there with the da right now but i dont think the outcomes going to be very good for the boy what did you mean just then about protecting her from himself sachs asked cynically some kind of multiple personality crap no replied the doctor not at all troubled by her abrasive skepticism theres definitely some mental or emotional disturbance at work but its nothing as exotic as multiple personalities garrett knows exactly what he did to mary beth and billy stail im pretty sure hes hidden her someplace to keep her away from blackwater landing where he probably did kill those other people over the past couple of years and scared what was his name the wilkes boy into killing himself i think he was planning to rape and kill mary beth at the same time he killed billy but that the part of him that quote loves her wouldnt let him he got her away from blackwater landing as fast as he could to keep from hurting her i think he did rape her though to him its not rape just the consummation of what he sees as their quote relationshipas normal to him as a husband and wife on their honeymoon but he still felt the urge to kill her and so he went back to blackwater landing the next day and got a substitute victim lydia johansson he was undoubtedly going to murder her in place of mary beth i hope youre not billing the defense sachs said acerbically if thats your sympathetic testimony dr penny shook his head based on the evidence ive heard that boys going to jail with or without expert witnesses i dont think he killed the boy and i think the kidnappings not as blackandwhite as were making it dr penny shrugged my professional opinion is that he did obviously i havent run all the tests but he exhibits clear dissocial and sociopathic behavior and im thinking of all three major diagnostic systems the international classification of diseases the dsmiv and the revised psychopathy checklistwould i have to run the complete battery of tests of course but he clearly presents with an affectless antisocialcriminal personality hes got a high iq he exhibits strategic thinking patterns and organizedoffender behavior considers revenge acceptable displays no remorse hes a very dangerous person sachs rhyme said whats the point this isnt our game anymore she ignored him and his piercing eyes but doctor the doctor held up a hand can i ask you a question what do you have children a hesitation no she responded why you understandably feel sympathy for him i think we all do but you might be confusing that with some latent maternal sense what does that mean the doctor continued i mean that if you have some desire to have children yourself you might not be able to take an objective view about a sixteenyearold boys innocence or guilt especially one whos an orphan and has had a tough time in life i can take a perfectly objective role she snapped theres just too much that doesnt add up garretts motives dont make sense he motives are the weak leg of the evidentiary stool sachs you know that i dont need any more maxims rhyme she snapped the criminalist sighed in frustration glanced at the clock dr penny continued i heard you asking cal fredericks about lancaster about what was going to happen to the boy she lifted an eyebrow well i think you can help him the doctor said the best thing you can do is to just spend some time with him the countyll assign a caseworker to liaise with the guardian the court appoints and youll have to get their approval but im sure it can be arranged he might even open up with you about mary beth as she was considering this thom appeared in the doorway vans outside lincoln rhyme glanced at the map one last time and then turned toward the doorway once more into the breach dear friends jim bell walked into the room and rested his hand on rhymes insensate arm were organizing a search of the outer banks with a little luck well have her in a few days listen i cant thank you enough lincoln rhyme deflected the gratitude with a nod and wished the sheriff good luck ill come visit you at the hospital lincoln ben said ill bring some scotch whenre they going to let you start drinking again not soon enough ill help ben finish up sachs told him bell said to her well get you a ride over to avery she nodded thanks ill be there soon rhyme but the criminalist had it seemed already departed from tanners corner mentally if not physically and he said nothing sachs heard only the vanishing whine as the storm arrow steamed down the corridor fifteen minutes later they had most of the forensic equipment put away and sachs sent ben kerr home thanking him for his volunteer efforts in his wake jesse corn had appeared at sachs side she wondered if hed been staking out the corridor waiting for a chance to catch her alone hes quite somebody isnt he jesse asked mr rhyme the deputy began stacking boxes that didnt need to be stacked that he is she said noncommittally that operation hes talking about will it fix him itll kill him itll make him worse itll turn him into a vegetable no she thought jesse would ask then whys he doing it but the deputy offered another one of his sayings sometimes you just find yourself standing in need to do somethingno matter it seems hopeless sachs shrugged thinking yeah sometimes you just do she snapped the locks on a microscope case and coiled the last of the electrical cords she noticed a stack of books on the table the ones shed found in garretts room in his foster parents house she picked up the miniature worldthe book that the boy had asked dr penny for she opened it flipped through the pages read a passage there are known species of mammals in the world but known species of insects and an estimated two to three million more not yet discovered the diversity and astonishing resilience of these creatures arouses more than simple admiration one thinks of harvard biologist and entomologist e o wilsons coined term biofilia by which he means the emotional affiliation humans feel toward other living organisms there is certainly as great an opportunity for such a connection with insects as there is for a pet dog or prize racehorse or indeed other humans she glanced out into the corridor where cal fredericks and bryan mcguire were still engaged in their complicated verbal fencing match garretts lawyer was clearly losing sachs snapped the book shut hearing in her mind the doctors words the best thing you can do is to just spend some time with him jesse said say might be a little hectic to go out to the pistol range but you interested in some coffee sachs laughed to herself so shed got the starbucks invite after all probably shouldnt im going to drop this book over at the lockup then i have to go over to the hospital in avery how bout a rain check you got it in eddies the bar a block from the lockup rich culbeau said sternly this aint no game i dont think its a game sean osarian said i only laughedi mean shit was just a laugh i was looking at that commercial there nodding at the greasy tv screen above the beer nuts rack where this guys trying to get to the airport and his car you do that too much you prank around you dont pay attention all right im listening were going in the back the doorll be open thats what i was gonna ask harris tomel said the back door to the lockups never open its always locked and its got that you know bar on the inside the barll be off and the doorll be unlocked okay you say so tomel said skeptically itll be open culbeau continued we go in therell be a key to his cell on the table that little metal one you know it of course they knew the table anybody whod spent a night in the tanners corner lockup had tove barked his shins on that fucking table bolted to the floor near the door especially if they were drunk yeah go ahead osarian said now paying attention we unlock the cell and go in im going to hit the kid with the pepper spray put a bag over him i got a crocus sack like i use for kittens in the pond just put that over his head and get him out the back he can shout if he wants but wont nobody hear him harris you be waiting with the truck back it right up near the door keep it in gear where we gonna take him to osarian asked none of our places culbeau said wondering if osarian was thinking they were going to take a kidnapped prisoner to one of their houses which if he did meant the skinny kid was even more stupid than culbeau thought he was the old garage near the tracks good osarian offered we get him out there i got my propane torch and we start on him five minutes is all itll take i figure and hell tell us where mary beth is and then do we osarians voice faded what culbeau snapped then whispered you gonna say something you maybe dont want to say out loud in public osarian whispered back you were just talking bout using a torch on the boy doesnt seem to me thats any worse than what im asking about afterward which culbeau had to agree with though of course he didnt tell osarian he may have a point instead he said only accidents happen they do tomel agreed osarian toyed with a beerbottle cap dug some crud out from under his nails with it hed turned moody what culbeau asked thiss getting risky woulda been easier to take the boy in the woods at the mill but hes not in the woods at the mill anymore tomel said osarian shrugged just wondering if its worth the money you wanta back out culbeau scratched his beard thinking it was so hot he ought to shave it but then you could see his triple chin more id rather split it two ways than three naw you know i dont want to everthings fine osarians eyes strayed to the tv again a movie caught his attention and he shook his head eyes wide looking at one of the actresses hold on here tomel said eyes out the window take a look he was nodding outside that redheaded policewoman from new york the one so damn fast with the knife was walking up the street carrying a book tomel said nicelooking lady i could use a little of that but culbeau remembered her cold eyes and the steady point of the knife under osarians chin he said juice aint worth the squeeze the redhead walked into the lockup osarian was looking too well that fucks things up a bit culbeau said slowly no it dont harris get that truck over there and keep the motor running but what about hertomel asked culbeau said i got plenty of pepper spray inside the lockup deputy nathan groomer leaned back in the rickety chair and nodded at sachs jesse corns infatuation had grown tedious nathans formal smile was a relief to her hello miss its nathan right right thats some decoy there sachs looked down at his desk this old thing he asked humbly what is it female mallard about a year old the duck not the decoy you make that yourself hobby of mine have a couple others at my desk in the main building check em out you want thought you were leaving will be soon hows he doing he who sheriff bell no i mean garrett oh i dunno mason went back to see him had a talk

handed it back creepy that boy is somethin out of a horror movie you oughta give him a bible i think this is all hes interested in i guess youre right about that slip your weapon in the lockbox there and ill let you in sachs put the smith wesson inside and stepped to the door but nathan was looking at her expectantly she lifted an eyebrow well miss i understand you got a knife too oh sure i forgot about it rules is rules you know she handed over the switchblade he dropped it in beside the gun you want the cuffs too she touched her handcuff case nope cant get into much trouble with those course we had us a reverend who did once but that was only cause his wife come home early and found him hitched to the bedpost with sally anne carlson atop him come on ill let you in rich culbeau flanked by nervous sean osarian stood beside a dying lilac bush at the back of the lockup the back door to the place overlooked a large field filled with grass and trash and parts of old cars and appliances more than a few limp condoms too harris tomel drove his sparkling ford f up over the curb and backed around culbeau thought he shouldve come the other way because this looked a little obvious but there was nobody out on the street and besides after the custard stand closed there was no reason for anybody to come down here at least the truck was new and had a good muffler it was quiet whos in the front office osarian asked nathan groomer that girl cop with him i dont know how the hell do i know but if she is shell have her gun and that knife she was tattooing you with in the lockbox wont nathan hear if the girl screams recalling the redheads eyes and the flash of the blade once more culbeau said the boyll be more likely to scream than her well then what if he does well get the bag over him fast here culbeau handed o sarian a redandwhite canister of pepper spray aim low cause people duck does it i mean will it get on us the spray not if you dont shoot yourself in the fucking face its a stream not like a cloud which of em should i take the boy what if the girls closer to me culbeau muttered shes mine but shes mine okay osarian agreed they dipped their heads as they went past a filthy window in the back of the lockup and paused at the metal door culbeau noticed that it was open a halfinch see its unlocked he whispered feeling hed scored some kind of point against osarian then wondering why he felt he needed to now ill nod then we go in fast spray em both and be generous with that shit he handed osarian a thick bag then throw that over his head osarian gripped the canister firmly nodded at the second bag which had appeared in culbeaus hand so were taking the girl too culbeau sighed said an exasperated yeah sean we are oh okay just wondered when theyre down just drag em out fast dont stop for nothing okay oh i was meaning to say i got my colt what i got my i brought it he nodded toward his pocket culbeau paused for a moment then he said good he closed his big hand around the door handle would this be his last view he wondered from his hospital bed lincoln rhyme could see a park on the grounds of the university medical center in avery lush trees a sidewalk meandering through a rich green lawn a stone fountain that a nurse had told him was a replica of some famous well on the unc campus at chapel hill from the bedroom in his townhouse on central park west in manhattan rhyme could see sky and some of the buildings along fifth avenue but the windows there were high off the floor and he couldnt see central park itself unless his bed was shoved right against the pane which let him look down onto the grass and trees here perhaps because the facility had been built with sci and neuro patients in mind the windows were lower even the views here were accessible he thought wryly to himself then wondered again whether or not the operation would have any success whether hed even survive it lincoln rhyme knew that it was the inability to do the simple things that was the most frustrating traveling from new york to north carolina for instance had been such a project so long anticipated so carefully planned that the difficulty of the journey had not troubled rhyme at all but the overwhelming burden of his injury was the heaviest when it came to the small tasks that a healthy person does without thinking scratching an itch on your temple brushing your teeth wiping your lips opening a soda sitting up in a chair to look out the window and watch sparrows bathe in the dirt of a garden he wondered again how foolish he was being hed had the best neurologists in the country and was a scientist himself hed read and understood the literature about the near impossibility of neuro improvement in a patient with a c spinal cord injury yet he was determined to go ahead with cheryl weavers operation despite the chance that this bucolic setting outside his window in a strange hospital in a strange town might be the very last image of nature he ever saw in this life of course there are risks so why was he doing it oh there was a very good reason yet it was a reason that the cold criminalist in him had trouble accepting and one that hed never dare utter out loud because it had nothing to do with being able to prowl over a crime scene searching for evidence nothing to do with brushing his teeth or sitting up in bed no no it was exclusively because of amelia sachs finally hed admitted the truth that hed grown terrified of losing her hed brooded that sooner or later shed meet another nick the handsome undercover agent whod been her lover a few years ago this was inevitable he figured as long as he remained as immobile as he was she wanted children she wanted a normal life and so rhyme was willing to risk death to risk making his condition worse in the hope that he could improve he knew of course that the operation wouldnt allow him to stroll down fifth avenue with sachs on his arm he was simply hoping for a minuscule improvement to move slightly closer to a normal life slightly closer to her but summoning up his astonishing imagination rhyme could picture himself closing his hand on hers squeezing it and feeling the faint pressure of her skin a small thing to everyone else in the world but to rhyme a miracle thom walked into the room after a pause he said an observation i dont want one wheres amelia im going to tell you anyway you havent had a drink in five days i know it pisses me off youre getting in shape for the operation doctors orders rhyme said testily when have those ever meant anything to you a shrug theyre going to be pumping me full of who knows what kind of crap i didnt think it would be smart to add to the cocktail in my bloodstream it wouldntve been youre right but you paid attention to your doctor im proud of you oh pride now theres a helpful emotion but thom was a waterfall to rhymes rain he continued but i want to say something youre going to anyway whether i want you to or not ive read a lot about this lincoln the procedure oh have you on your time i hope i just want to say that if it doesnt work this time well come back next year two years five years itll work then the sentiment within lincoln rhyme was as dead as his spinal cord but he managed thank you thom now where the hell is that doctor ive been hard at work catching psychotic kidnappers for these people i think theyd be treating me a little better than this thom said shes only ten minutes late lincoln and we did change the appointment twice today its closer to twenty minutes ah here we go the door to the hospital room swung open and rhyme looked up expecting to see dr weaver but it wasnt the surgeon sheriff jim bell his face dotted with sweat walked inside in the corridor behind him was his brotherinlaw steve farr both men were clearly upset the criminalists first thought was that theyd found mary beths body that the boy had in fact killed her and his next thought was how badly sachs would react to this news having had her faith in the boy shattered but bell had different news im sorry to have to tell you this lincoln and rhyme knew the message was something closer to him personally than just garrett hanlon and mary beth mcconnell i was going to call the sheriff said but then i figured you should hear it from somebody in person so i came what jim he asked its amelia what thom asked what about her rhyme couldnt of course feel his heart pounding in his chest but he could sense the blood surge through his chin and temples what tell me rich culbeau and those buddies of his went by the lockup i dont know what they had in mind exactly probably no good but anyway what they found was my deputy nathan cuffed in the front office and the cell was empty cell garretts cell bell continued as if this explained everything rhyme still didnt understand the significance what in a gruff voice the sheriff said nathan said that your amelia trussed him up at gunpoint and broke garrett outa jail its a felony escape theyre on the run theyre armed and nobody has a clue where they are iii knuckle time running as best she could her legs ached from the waves of arthritic pain coursing through her body she was drenched in sweat and was already dizzy from the heat and dehydration and she was still in shock at the thought of what shed done garrett was beside her jogging silently through the forest outside tanners corner this is way past stupid lady when sachs had gone into the cell to give garrett the miniature world shed watched the boys happy face as hed taken the book from her a moment or two passed and almost as if someone else were forcing her to shed reached through the bars taken the boy by the shoulders flustered hed looked away no look at me shed instructed look finally he had shed studied his blotched face his twitching mouth the dark pits of eyes the thick brows garrett i need to know the truth this is only between you and me tell me did you kill billy stail i swear i didnt i swear it was that man the one in the tan overalls he killed billy thats the truth its not what the facts show garrett but people can see the same thing different hed responded in a calm voice like the way we can look at the same thing a fly sees but it doesnt look the same what do you mean we see something moving just a blur when somebodys hands trying to swat the fly but the way a flys eyes work is he sees a hand stopping in midair a hundred times on its way down like a bunch of still pictures its the same hand same motion but the fly and us see it way different and colors we look at something thats just solid red to us but some insects see a dozen different types of red the evidence suggests hes guilty rhyme it doesnt prove it evidence can be interpreted in a lot of different ways and lydia sachs had persisted gripping the boy even more firmly whyd you kidnap her i told everybody why cause she was in danger too blackwater landing its a dangerous place people die there people disappear i was just protecting her of course its a dangerous place shed thought but is it dangerous because of you sachs had then said she said you were going to rape her no no no she jumped into the water and her uniform got wet and torn i saw her you know on top her chest and i got kind of turned on but thats all and mary beth did you hurt her rape her no no no i told you she hit her head and i cleaned it off with that tissue id never do that not to mary beth sachs had stared at him a moment longer blackwater landing its a dangerous place finally shed asked if i get you out of here will you take me to mary beth garrett had frowned i do that then youd bring her back to tanners corner and she might get hurt its the only way garrett ill get you out if you take me to her we can make sure shell be safe lincoln rhyme and i you can do that yes but if you dont agree youll stay in jail for a long time and if mary beth dies because of you itll be murder same as if you shot her and youll never get out of jail hed looked out the window it seemed that his eyes were following the flight of an insect sachs couldnt see it all right how far away is she on foot itll take us eight ten hours depending on what on how many they got coming after us and how careful we are getting away garrett said this quickly and his assured tone troubled sachs it was as if hed been anticipating that someone would break him out or that hed escape and hed already considered avoiding pursuit wait here shed told him and stepped back into the office shed reached into the lockbox pulled out her gun and knife and against all training and sense turned the smith wesson on nathan groomer im sorry to do this she whispered i need the key to his cell and then i need you to turn around and put your hands behind your back wideeyed hed hesitated perhaps debating whether or not to go for his sidearm or she realized now probably not even thinking at all instinct or reflex or just plain anger mightve driven him to pull the weapon from his holster this is way past stupid lady hed said the key he opened the drawer and tossed it on the desk he put his hands behind his back she cuffed him with his own handcuffs and ripped the phone from the wall shed then freed garrett cuffed him too the back door to the lockup seemed to be open but she thought she heard footsteps and a running car engine outside she opted for the front door theyd made a clean escape undetected now a mile from downtown surrounded by brush and trees the boy directed her along an illdefined path the chains of the cuffs clinked as he pointed in the direction they should go she was thinking but rhyme there was nothing i could do do you understand i had no choice if the detention center in lancaster was like what she expected hed be raped and beaten his first day there and perhaps killed before a week passed sachs knew too that this was the only way to find mary beth rhyme had exhausted the possibilities with the evidence and the defiance in garretts eyes told her that hed never cooperate no im not confusing being maternal with being concerned dr penny all i know is that if lincoln and i had a son hed be as singleminded and stubborn as we are and that if anything happened to us id pray for someone to look out for him the way im looking out for garrett they moved quickly sachs was surprised at how elegantly the boy slipped through the woods despite having his hands cuffed he seemed to know exactly where to put his feet what plants you could easily push through and which offered resistance where the ground was too soft to walk on dont step there he said sternly thats clay from a carolina bay itll hold you like glue they hiked for a halfhour until the ground grew soupy and the air became fragrant with the smells of methane and decay the route finally became impassable the path ended in a thick bog and garrett led them to a twolane asphalt road they started through the brush beside the shoulder several cars drove by leisurely their drivers oblivious to the felony they were passing sachs watched them enviously on the lam for only twenty minutes she reflected and already she felt a heartwrenching tug at the normalcy of everyone elses life and at the dark turn hers had taken this is way past stupid lady hey there mary beth mcconnell jerked awake with the heat and oppressive atmosphere in the cabin shed fallen asleep on the smelly couch the voice nearby called again miss are you all right hello mary beth she leapt from the bed and walked quickly toward the broken window she felt dizzy had to lower her head for a minute steady herself against the wall the pain in her temple throbbed ferociously she thought fuck you garrett the pain subsided her vision cleared and she continued to the window it was the missionary he had his friend with him a tall balding man in gray slacks and a work shirt the missionary carried an ax thank you thank you she whispered miss you all right im fine he hasnt come back her voice was still painfully raw he handed her another canteen of water and she drank the whole container down i called the town police he told her theyre on their way theyll be here in fifteen twenty minutes but we arent gonna wait for them were gonna get you out now the two of us i cant thank you enough stand back a little i been chopping wood all my life and that doors gonna be a stack of firewood in one minute thiss tom hes working for the county too hi tom hi your head okay there he asked frowning looks worse than it is she said touching the scab thunk thunk the ax drove into the door from the window she could see the blade as it lifted high into the air and caught the sunlight the cutting edge of the tool glistened meaning it was very sharp mary beth used to help her father chop wood for their fireplace she remembered how much she loved watching him edge the ax with a grinding stone on the end of his drill the orange sparks would fly into the air like fireworks on the fourth of july whos this boy who kidnapped you tom asked some kind of pervert thunk thunk hes a high school kid from tanners corner hes scary look at all this she waved at the insects in the jars gosh tom said leaning close to the window looking in thunk a crack as the missionary worked a large splinter out of the door thud mary beth glanced at the door garrett must have reinforced it maybe nailing two doors together she said to tom i feel like im one of his damn bugs myself he mary beth saw a blur as toms left arm shot through the window and gripped the collar of her shirt his right hand socketed onto her breast he yanked her forward against the bars and planted his wet beerytobacco mouth on her lips his tongue darted out and ran hard into her teeth he probed her chest pinching trying to find her nipple through her shirt as she twisted her head away from him spitting and screaming what the hellre you doing the missionary cried dropping the ax he ran to the window but before he could pull tom off mary beth gripped the hand that spidered across her chest and pulled downward hard she ran toms wrist into a stalagmite of glass rising from the window frame he cried out in pain and shock and let go of her stumbling backward wiping her mouth mary beth ran from the window to the middle of the room the missionary shouted at tom what the fuckd you do that for hit him mary beth was thinking nail him with the ax hes crazy turn him over to the police too tom wasnt listening he was squeezing his bloody arm examining the slash jesus jesus jesus the missionary muttered i told you to be patient we woulda had her out in five minutes and spreadeagle at your place in a half hour now we got a mess spreadeagle his comment registered in mary beths thoughts an instant before its corollary arrived that thered been no call to the police there was no one coming to rescue her man look at this look tom held up his split wrist blood cascading down his arm fuck the missionary muttered we gotta get that stitched up you dumb shit why couldnt you wait come on lets get it taken care of mary beth watched tom stagger into the field he stopped ten feet away from the window you fucking bitch you get yourself ready well be back he glanced down and crouched out of view for a moment he stood up again holding a rock the size of a large orange in his good hand he flung it through the bars mary beth stumbled backward as it sailed into the room missing her by a scant foot she sank onto the couch sobbing as they walked toward the woods she heard tom call again get yourself ready they were at harris tomels house a nice fivebedroom colonial on a goodsized cut of grass the mand never done a lick of work to tomels idea of lawn decorations was parking his f in the front yard and his suburban in the back he did this because being the sortof college boy of the trio and owning more sweaters than plaid shirts tomel had to try a little harder to seem like a shitkicker oh sure hed done fed time but it was for some crappy scam in raleigh where he sold stocks and bonds in companies whose only problem was that they didnt exist he could shoot good as a sniper but culbeaud never known him to whale on anybody by himself skin on skin at least nobody who wasnt tied up tomel also thought about things too much spent too much time on his clothes asked for call liquor even at eddies so unlike culbeau who worked hard on his own splitlevel and unlike osarian who worked hard picking up waitresses whod keep his trailer nice harris tomel just let the house and yard go hoping culbeau assumed that itd goose the impression that he was a mean fuck but that was tomels business and the three men werent at the house with its scruffy yard and detroit lawn ornaments to discuss landscaping they were here for one reason only because tomel had inherited the gun collection to end all gun collections when his father went into spivy pond ice fishing on new years eve a few years ago and didnt surface till the next tax day they stood in the mans paneled den looking over the gun cases the same way culbeau and osarian had stood at the penny candy rack in petersons drugs on maple street twenty years ago deciding what to steal osarian picked the black colt ar the civvy version of the m because he was always yammering on and on about vietnam and watched every war movie he could find tomel took the beautiful browning shotgun with the inlay which culbeau coveted as much as he coveted any woman in the county even though he himself was a rifle man and would rather drill a hole in a deers heart from three hundred yards than blow a duck into a dust of feathers for himself today he chose tomels nifty winchester with a scope the size of texas they packed plenty of ammo water culbeaus cell phone and food shine of course sleeping bags too though none of them expected the hunt to last very long a grim lincoln rhyme wheeled into the dismantled forensic lab in the paquenoke county building lucy kerr and mason germain stood beside the fiberboard table that had held the microscopes their arms were crossed and as thom and rhyme entered both deputies regarded the criminalist and his aide with a blend of contempt and suspicion how the hell could she do it mason asked what was she thinking of but these were two of many questions about amelia sachs and what shed done that couldnt be answered not yet and so rhyme asked merely was anybody hurt no lucy said but nathan was pretty shook up looking down the barrel of that smith and wesson which we were crazy enough to give her rhyme struggled to remain outwardly calm yet his heart was pierced with fear for sachs lincoln rhyme trusted evidence before all else and the evidence showed clearly that garrett hanlon was a kidnapper and killer sachs tricked by his calculated facade was as much at risk as mary beth or lydia jim bell entered the room did she take a car rhyme continued i dont think so bell said i asked around no vehicles missing yet bell looked at the map still taped to the wall this isnt an easy area to get out of and not get seen lot of marshland not many roads ive lucy said get some dogs jim irv wanner runs a couple hounds for the state police call captain dexter in elizabeth city and get irvs number hell track em down good idea bell said well i want to propose something rhyme interrupted mason gave a cold laugh what bell asked ill make a deal with you no deals bell said shes a fleeing felon and armed to boot shes not going to shoot anybody thom said rhyme continued amelias convinced theres no other way to find mary beth thats why she did it theyre going to where shes being held doesnt matter bell said you cant go breaking murderers out of jail give me twentyfour hours before you call the state police ill find them for you we can work something out with the charges but if troopers and dogs get involved we all know theyll play it by the book and that means theres a good chance of people getting hurt thats a hell of a deal lincoln bell said your friend busts out our prisoner he wouldnt be your prisoner if it werent for me you never wouldve found him on your own no damn way mason said were wasting time and theyre getting farther away every minute weve wasted talking im of a mind to get every man in town out looking for em now deputize the lot do what henry davett suggested pass out rifles and bell interrupted him and asked rhyme if we give you your twentyfour hours then whats in it for us ill stay and help you find mary beth however long it takes thom said the operation lincoln forget the operation he muttered feeling the despair as he said this he knew that dr weavers schedule was so tight that if he missed his appointed date on the table hed have to go back on the waiting list then it crossed his mind that one reason sachs had done this was to keep rhyme from having the surgery to buy a few more days and give him a chance to change his mind but he pushed this thought aside raging to himself find her save her before garrett adds her to the list of his victims stung times lucy said were looking at a bit of what would you say divided loyalty here arent we mason yeah how do we know you arent gonna send us round robin hoods barn and let her get away because rhyme said patiently amelias wrong garrett is a murderer and he just used her to break out of jail once he doesnt need her hell kill her bell paced for a moment gazing up at the map okay well do it lincoln youve got twentyfour hours mason sighed and how the hellre you going to find her in that wilderness he motioned toward the map you just going to call her up and ask where she is thats exactly what im going to do thom lets get the equipment set up again and somebody get ben kerr back here lucy kerr stood in the office adjacent to the war room on the phone north carolina state police elizabeth city the womans crisp voice answered how can i help you detective gregg hold please lo asked a mans voice after a moment pete slucy kerr over in tanners corner hey lucy hows it going whats with those missing girls got that under control she said her voice calm though she was enraged that bell had insisted she recite the words lincoln rhyme had dictated to her but we do have another little problem little problem whatcha need a couple troopers no just a cell phone trace got a warrant magistrates clerks faxing it to you right now gimme the phone and serial numbers she gave him the information whats that area code two one two its a new york number partys roaming now not a problem gregg said you want a tape of the conversation just location and a clear line of sight to the target when wait heres the fax a pause as he read oh just a missing person thats all she said reluctantly you know its expensive well have to bill you i understand okay hold the line ill call my tech people there was a faint click lucy sat on the desk shoulders slumped flexing her left hand staring at fingers ruddy from years of gardening an old scar from the metal strap on a pallet of mulch the indentation in her ring finger from five years of wedding band flex straighten watching the veins and muscles beneath the skin lucy kerr realized something that amelia sachs crime had tapped into an anger within her that was more intense than anything shed ever felt when they took part of her body away shed felt ashamed and then forlorn when her husband left shed felt guilty and resigned and when she finally grew mad at those events she was angry in a way that suggested embers an anger that radiates immense heat but never bursts into flames but for a reason she couldnt understand this woman cop from new york had let the simple whitehot fury burst from lucys heart like the wasps that had streamed out of the nest and killed ed schaeffer so horribly whitehot fury at the betrayal of lucy kerr who never intentionally caused a soul pain who was a woman who loved plants a woman whod been a good wife to her man a good daughter to her parents a good sister a good policewoman a woman who wanted only the harmless pleasures life gave freely to everyone else but seemed determined to withhold from her no more shame or guilt or resignation or sorrow simple fury at the betrayals in her life the betrayal by her body by her husband by god and now by amelia sachs hello lucy pete asked from elizabeth city you there yes im here you are you okay you sound funny she cleared her throat fine you set up youre good to go whens the subject going to be making a call lucy looked into the other room called ready rhyme nodded into the phone she said any time now stay on the line gregg said ill liaise please let this work lucy thought please then she added a footnote to her prayer and dear lord give me one clear shot at my judas thom fitted the headset over rhymes head the aide then punched in a number if sachs phone was shut off it would ring only three times and the pleasant lilt of the voicemail lady would start to speak one ring two hello rhyme didnt believe hed ever felt such relief hearing her voice sachs are you all right a pause im okay in the other room he saw lucy kerrs sullen face nod listen to me sachs listen to me i know why you did it but you have to give yourself up you are you there im here rhyme i know what youre doing garretts agreed to take you to mary beth thats right you cant trust him rhyme said thinking in despair or me either he saw lucy moving her finger in a circle meaning keep her on the line ive made a deal with jim if you bring him back in theyll work something out with the charges against you the states not involved yet and ill stay here as long as it takes to find mary beth ive postponed the operation he closed his eyes momentarily pierced with guilt but he had no choice he pictured what the death of that woman in blackwater landing had been like the death of deputy ed schaeffer imagining the hornets swarming over amelias body he had to betray her in order to save her garretts innocent rhyme i know he is i couldnt let him go to the detention center theyd kill him there then well arrange for him to be held someplace else and well look at the evidence again well find more evidence well do it together you and me thats what we say sachs right you and me always you and me theres nothing we cant find there was a pause theres nobody on garretts side hes all by himself rhyme we can protect him you cant protect somebody from a whole town lincoln no first names rhyme said thats bad luck remember this whole thing has been bad luck please sachs she said sometimes you just have to go on faith now whos dispensing maxims he forced himself to laugh in part to reassure her in part himself faint static come home sachs he was thinking please we can still salvage something from this your life is as precarious as the thread of the nerve in my neck the tiny fiber that still works and as precious to me she said garrett tells me we can get to mary beth by tonight or tomorrow morning ill call you when we have her sachs dont hang up yet one thing let me say one thing what whatever you think about garrett dont trust him you think hes innocent but just accept that maybe he isnt you know how we approach crime scenes sachs with an open mind she recited the rule no preconceptions believing that anythings possible right promise me youll remember that hes cuffed rhyme keep him that way and dont let him near your weapon i wont ill call you when we have mary beth sachs the line went dead damn the criminalist muttered he closed his eyes tried to shake off the headset in fury thom reached forward and lifted the unit off his head with a brush he smoothed rhymes dark hair lucy hung up the phone in the other room and stepped inside rhyme could tell from her expression that the trace hadnt worked pete said theyre within three miles of downtown tanners corner mason muttered they cant do any better than that lucy said if shed been on the line a few minutes longer they couldve pinpointed her down to fifteen feet bell was examining the map okay three miles outside of downtown would he go back to blackwater landing rhyme asked no bell said we know theyre headed for the outer banks and blackwater landingd take him in the opposite direction whats the best way to get to the banks the criminalist asked they cant do it on foot bell said walking to the map theyll have to take a car or car and a boat therere two ways to get there they could go route south to thatll take them to elizabeth city and they could get a boat or keep on all the way to and drive to the beaches or they could take harper road mason you take frank sturgis and trey and get over to set up a roadblock at belmont rhyme noticed this was location m on the map the sheriff continued lucy you and jesse take harper down to millerton road set up there this was h bell called his brotherinlaw into the room steve you coordinate communications and get everybody handitalkies if they dont already have them sure thing jim bell said to lucy and mason tell everybody that garretts in one of our detention jumpsuits theyre blue whats your girl wearing i dont remember shes not my girl rhyme said sorry rhyme said jeans black tshirt she have a hat no lucy and mason headed out the door a moment later the room was empty except for bell rhyme and thom the sheriff called the state police and told the detective whod helped them with the mobile locator to keep somebody on that frequency that the missing person might call in later rhyme noticed bell pause he glanced at rhyme and said into the phone appreciate the offer pete but so far its just a missing person nothing serious he hung up muttered nothing serious jesus our lord fifteen minutes later ben kerr walked into the office he actually seemed glad to be back though he was visibly upset at the news that necessitated his return together he and thom finished unpacking the state polices forensic equipment while rhyme stared up at the map and the evidence charts on the wall found at primary crime scene blackwater landing kleenex with blood limestone dust nitrates phosphate ammonia detergent camphene found at secondary crime scene garetts room skunk musk cut pine needles drawings of insects pictures of mary beth and family insect books fishing line money unknown key kerosene ammonia nitrates camphene found at secondary crime scene quarry old burlap bag unreadable name on it corn feed and grain scorch marks on bag deer park water planters cheese crackers found at secondary crime scene mill map of outer banks ocean beach sand oakmaple leaf residue as rhyme gazed at the last chart he realized how little evidence sachs had found at the mill this was always a problem when you locate obvious clues at crime scenes like the map and the sand psychologically your attention flags and you search less diligently he now wished they had more evidence from the scene then rhyme recalled something lydia had said that garrettd changed his clothes at the mill when the search party was closing in why the only reason was that he knew that the clothes hed hidden there could reveal where hed hidden mary beth he glanced at bell did you say garrett was wearing a prison jumpsuit thats right you have what he was wearing when he was arrested itd be over at the lockup could you have them sent over here the clothes right away have them put in a paper bag he ordered dont unfold them the sheriff called the lockup told a deputy to bring them over from the onesided conversation rhyme deduced that the deputy was more than happy to participate in helping to find the woman whod hogtied and shamed him rhyme stared at the map of the eastern shore they could narrow the search to old houses because of the camphene lamp and to ones set back from the beach itself because of the maple and oak leaf trace but the sheer size of the place was daunting hundreds of miles bell s phone rang he answered and spoke for a minute then hung up walked to the map theyve got the roadblocks set up garrett and amelia might move inland here to get around them he tapped location m but from where mason and frank are theyve got a good view of this field and theyd be seen rhyme asked what about that railroad line south of town not used for passenger travel its a freight line and theres no set schedule for the trains but they could hike along it thats why i set up the block at belmont my bet is theyll go that way im also thinking garrett might hide out for a while in the manitou falls wildlife preserve with his interest in bugs and nature and stuff he probably spends a lot of time there bell tapped spot t farr asked what about that airport bell looked at rhyme can she hotwire an airplane no she doesnt fly rhyme noticed a reference on the map he asked whats that military base used it to store weapons in the sixties and seventies its been closed for years but therere tunnels and bunkers all over the place wed need twodozen men to search the place and he could still probably find a nook to hide in is it patrolled not anymore whats that square area at spot e and e that probably that old amusement park bell said looking at farr and ben right said ben my brother and i used to go there when i was a kid it was called what indian ridge or something bell nodded it was a recreation of an indian village went outa business a few years ago nobody went williamsburg and six flags were a lot more popular good place to hide but its in the opposite direction of the outer banks garrett wouldnt go there bell touched spot h lucys here and garrett and ameliad have to stick to harper road in those parts they go off the road and its swampland filled with clay take em days to get through it if they survived which they probably wouldnt so i guess we just wait and see what happens rhyme nodded absently his eyes moving like his friend the skittish fly now departed from one topographical landmark in paquenoke county to another garrett hanlon led amelia down a wide asphalt road they were walking slower than before exhausted from the exertion and the heat there was a familiarity about the area and she realized this was canal road the one that theyd taken from the county building that morning to search the crime scenes at blackwater landing ahead she could see the dark rippling of the paquenoke river across the canal were those large beautiful houses shed commented on earlier to lucy she looked around i dont get it this is the main road into town why arent there any roadblocks they think were going a different way theyve set up the roadblocks south and east of here how do you know that garrett answered they think im fuckedup they think im stupid when youre different thats what people think but im not but we are going to mary beth sure just not the way they think once again garretts confidence and caginess troubled her but her attention slipped back to the road and they continued on in silence in twenty minutes they were within a halfmile of the intersection where canal road ended at route the place where billy stail had been killed listen he whispered gripping her arm with his cuffed hands she cocked her head but heard nothing into the bushes they slipped off the road into a stand of scratchy holly trees what she asked shhhh a moment later a large flatbed truck came into view behind them thats from the factory he whispered up ahead there the sign on the truck was for davett industries she recognized the name of the man whod helped them with the evidence when it was past they returned to the road how did you hear that oh you gotta be cautious all the time like moths moths what do you mean mothsre pretty cool they like sense ultrasound waves they have these radar detector things when a bat shoots out a beam of sound to find them moths fold their wings and drop to the ground and hide magnetic and electronic fields too insects can feel them like things we arent even aware of you know you can lead some insects around with radio waves or make em go away too depending on the frequency he fell silent head turned away frozen in position then he looked back at her he said you have to listen all the time otherwise they can sneak up on you who she asked uncertainly you know everybody then he nodded up the road toward blackwater landing and the paquenoke ten minutes and well be safe theyll never find us she was wondering what realistically would happen to garrett when they found mary beth and returned to tanners corner there would still be some charges against him but if mary beth corroborated the story of the real murderer the man in the tan overalls then the da might accept that garrett had kidnapped her for her own good defense of others was recognized by all criminal courts as a justification and hed probably drop the charges and who was the man in the overalls why was he prowling the forests of blackwater landing had he been the one whod killed those other residents over the past few years and was trying to blame garrett for the deaths had he scared young todd wilkes into killing himself was there a drug ring that billy stail had been involved in she knew that drug problems in small towns were as serious as in the city then something else occurred to her that garrett could identify billy stails real murderer the man in the overalls who by now mightve heard about the escape and be out looking for garrett and for her too to silence them maybe they should suddenly garrett froze an alarmed look on his face he spun around what she whispered car moving fast where shhh a flash of light from behind them caught their eyes you have to listen all the time otherwise they can sneak up on you no garrett cried in dismay and pulled her into a stand of sedge two paquenoke county squad cars were racing along canal road she couldnt see who was driving the first one but the deputy in the passenger seat the black deputy whod set up the chalkboard for rhyme was squinting as he scanned the woods he held a shotgun lucy kerr was driving the second car jesse corn sat beside her garrett and sachs lay flat hidden by broom grass moths fold their wings and drop to the ground the cars sped past and skidded to a stop where canal road met route they parked perpendicular to the road blocking both lanes and the deputies got out weapons ready roadblock she muttered hell no no no garrett muttered dumbfounded they were supposed to think we were going the other way east they had to think that a passenger car passed them slowing at the end of the road lucy flagged down the car and questioned the driver then they made him get out of the vehicle and open the trunk which they searched carefully garrett huddled in the nest of grass how the fuck dthey figure out we were coming this way he whispered how because theyve got lincoln rhyme sachs answered silently they dont see anything yet lincoln jim bell told him amelia and garrett arent going to be walking down the middle of canal road rhyme said testily theyll be in the bushes keeping a low profile theres a roadblock set up and theyre searching every car jim bell said even if they know the drivers rhyme looked again at the map on the wall theres no other way for them to go west from tanners corner from the lockup the only way through the marshes is canal road to route but bell sounded doubtful i gotta say though thiss a big risk lincoln committing everybody to blackwater landing if they really are headed east to the outer banks theyre gonna get past us now and well never find them this idea of yours well its a little farfetched but rhyme believed it was right as hed stared at the map twenty minutes before tracing the route the boy had taken with lydia which led toward the great dismal swamp and very little else he had started wondering about lydias abduction he had remembered what sachs had told him when they were in the field pursuing garrett this morning lucy says it doesnt make any sense for him to come this way and that had made him ask a question that no one had yet answered satisfactorily why exactly did garrett kidnap lydia johansson to kill her as a substitute victim was dr pennys answer but as it turned out he hadnt killed her even though hed had plenty of time to or raped her nor was there any other motive for abducting her they were strangers shed never taunted him he didnt seem to have an obsession with her she wasnt a witness to billys murder what could his point have been then he had recalled how garrett had willingly told lydia that mary beth was being held on the outer banks and how she was happy how she didnt need to be rescued why would he volunteer that information and the evidence at the mill the ocean sand the map of the outer banks lucy had found it easily according to sachs too easily the scene he had decided had been staged as forensic scientists call evidence planted to lead investigators off rhyme had shouted bitterly weve been set up what do you mean lincoln ben had asked he tricked us the criminalist had said a sixteenyearold boy had fooled them all from the beginning rhyme had explained that garrett had intentionally kicked off one shoe at the scene when he kidnapped lydia hed filled it with limestone dust which would lead anyone with knowledge of the area davett for instance to think of the quarry where hed planted the other evidence the scorched bag and corn that in turn led to the mill the searchers were supposed to find lydia along with the rest of the planted evidence to convince them that mary beth was being held in a house on the outer banks which meant of course that she was being held in the opposite direction west of tanners corner garretts plan was brilliant but he had made one mistake assuming that it would take the search party several days to find lydia which is why hed left all the food for her by then hed have been with mary beth in the real hiding place and the searchers would be combing the outer banks and so rhyme had asked bell what was the best route west from tanners corner blackwater landing the sheriff had answered route and rhyme had ordered lucy and the other deputies there as fast as possible there was a chance that garrett and sachs had been through the intersection already and were on their way west but rhyme had calculated distances and didnt think that on foot and keeping under cover they could have gotten that far in so little time lucy now called in from the roadblock thom put the call on the speakerphone the policewoman undoubtedly still suspicious and wondering whose side rhyme was really on said skeptically i dont see any sign of them here and weve checked every car thats come by are you sure about this yes he announced im sure and whatever she chose to think of this arrogant response she said nothing other than lets hope youre right theres a chance for some real sorrow here she hung up a moment later bell s phone rang he listened looked up at rhyme three more deputies just got to canal road about a mile south of theyre going to do a sweep north on foot toward lucy and the others and pin garrett and sachs in he listened into the phone for a moment longer glanced at rhyme then away and continued into the phone yeah shes armed and yeah i hear tell shes a good shot sachs and garrett crouched in the bushes watching the passenger cars waiting to get through the roadblock then behind them another sound that even without a moths sensitive hearing sachs could detect sirens they saw a second set of flashing lights coming from the other the southern end of canal road another squad car parked and three more deputies got out also armed with shotguns they started slowly through the bushes moving toward garrett and sachs in ten minutes theyd walk right through the nest of sedge where the fugitives were hiding garrett looked at her expectantly what she asked he glanced at her gun arent you going to use that she stared at him in shock no of course not garrett nodded toward the roadblock they will nobodys going to be doing any shooting she whispered fiercely horrified that hed even consider it she looked behind her into the woods it was marshy and impossible to get through without being seen or heard ahead of them was the chainlink fence surrounding davett industries through the mesh she saw the cars in the parking lot amelia sachs had worked street crimes for a year that experience combined with what she knew about cars meant that she could break into and hotwire a vehicle in under thirty seconds but even if she boosted wheels how could they get out of the factory grounds there was a delivery and shipping entrance to the factory but it too opened onto canal road theyd still have to drive past the roadblock could they steal a fourbyfour or pickup and make it through the fence where nobody could see them then drive off the road to route there were steep hills and sharp dropoffs into marshes everywhere around blackwater landing could they escape without rolling a truck and killing themselves the deputies on foot were now only two hundred feet away whatever they were going to do now was the time sachs decided they had no choice come on garrett weve got to get over the fence crouching they moved forward toward the parking lot are you thinking of a car he said noticing where they were headed sachs glanced back the deputies were a hundred yards away garrett continued i dont like cars they scare me but she wasnt paying attention she kept hearing his earlier words circulating through her thoughts moths fold their wings and drop to the ground where are they now rhyme demanded the deputies making the sweep bell relayed the question into his phone listened then touched a spot on the map about halfway up square g theyre close to here thats the entrance to davetts company eighty a hundred yards moving north can amelia and garrett get around the factory to the east naw davetts propertys all fenced beyond that its serious swamp if they went west theyd have to swim the canal and they probably couldnt climb the banks anyway theres no cover there lucy and treyd spot em for sure waiting was so hard rhyme knew that sachs would scratch and pick at her flesh in an attempt to relieve the anxiety that was a dark corollary to her drive and talent destructive habits yes but how he envied her them before the accident rhyme himself would bleed off tension by pacing and walking now he had nothing to do but stare at the map and obsess about how much at risk she was a secretary stuck her head in the door sheriff bell state police on line two jim bell stepped into the office across the hall and took the call he spoke for a few minutes then trotted back into the lab he said excitedly weve got em they pinpointed her cell phone signal shes on the move going west on route they got past the roadblock rhyme asked how looks like they snuck into davetts parking lot and stole a truck or fourbyfour then drove off the road for a while and got back on the highway man that took some serious driving thats my amelia rhyme thought that woman can drive up walls bell continued shes going to ditch the car and get another one how do you know shes on the phone with a car rental company in hobeth falls lucy and the othersre after her silent pursuit were talking to davetts people to see whos missing a vehicle from the lot but we dont need a description if she just stays on the line a little longer another few minutes and the tech peoplell have the exact location lincoln rhyme stared at the map though it was by now imprinted on his mind after a moment he sighed then muttered good luck but whether that wish was directed toward predator or toward prey he couldnt have said lucy kerr nudged the crown victoria up to eighty you drive fast amelia well so do i they were speeding along route the gumball machine on top of the car spinning madly with its red white and blue lights the siren was off jesse corn was beside her on the phone with pete gregg in the elizabeth city state police office in the squad car directly behind them were trey williams and ned spoto mason germain and frank sturgis a quiet man and a recent grandfather were in the third car where are they now lucy asked jesse asked the state police this question and nodded as he received an answer he said only five miles away they turned off the highway heading south please lucy offered yet another prayer please stay on the phone just a minute more she nudged the accelerator closer to the floor you drive fast amelia i drive fast youre a good shot but im a good shot too i dont make a show of it like you do what with all that fancy quickdraw crap but ive lived with guns all my life recalling that when buddy left her she took every round of live ammo in the house and pitched them into the murky waters of blackwater canal worrying that she might wake up one night glance at his empty side of the bed and then wrap her lips around the oily barrel of her service revolver and send herself to the place where her husband and nature seemed to want her to be lucy had gone around for three and a half months with an unloaded service pistol collaring shiners and militiamen and big snotty teens huffed to oblivion on butane and shed handled them all on bluff alone then she woke up one morning and as if a fever had passed had gone to shakeys hardware on maple street and bought a box of winchester shells jeez lucy the countys in worser shape than i thought making you buy your own ammo shed gone home and loaded her weapon and kept it that way ever since it was a significant event for her the reloaded gun was an emblem of survival amelia i shared my darkest moments with you i told you about the surgery which is the black hole of my life i told you about my shyness with men about my love for children i backed you up when sean osarian got your gun i apologized when you were right and i was wrong i trusted you i a hand touched her shoulder she glanced at jesse corn he was giving her one of his gentle smiles the highway curves up ahead he said id just as soon we made that curve too lucy exhaled slowly and sat back in the seat let her shoulders slump she eased off on the speed still when they made the curve jessed mentioned which was posted forty she was doing sixtyfive a hundred feet up the road jesse corn whispered they were out of their cars the deputies and were clustered around mason germain and lucy kerr the state police had finally lost the signal from amelias cell phone but only after itd been stationary for about five minutes at the location they were now looking at a barn fifty feet from a house in the woods a mile off route it was lucy noted west of tanners corner just as lincoln rhyme had predicted you dont think mary beths in theredo you asked frank sturgis brushing at his yellowstained moustache i mean its all of seven miles from downtown id feel pretty foolish hes been keeping the girl that close to town naw theyre just waiting for us to go past mason said then theyre gonna go on to hobeth falls and pick up the rental car anyway jesse said somebody lives here hed called in the address of the house pete hallburton anybody know him think so said trey williams married no connection to garrett that i know of they have kids trey shrugged think they might seem to recall a soccer game last year its summer the youngsters might be home frank muttered garrett mightve taken em hostage inside maybe lucy said but the triangulation on amelias phone signal placed them in the barn not the house they couldve gone inside but i dont know i cant see em takin hostages masons right i think theyre just hiding out here until they think its safe to get up to hobeth for that rental car whatta we do frank asked block the drive with our cars we pull up do that theyll hear us jesse said lucy nodded i think we should just hit the barn on foot fast from two directions ive got cs gas mason said cs a powerful military tear gas kept under lock and key in the sheriffs department bell hadnt distributed any and lucy wondered how mason had gotten his hands on some no no jesse protested might make em panic lucy believed that wasnt his concern at all she bet he didnt want to expose his new girlfriend to the vicious gas still she agreed feeling that since the deputies didnt have masks gas might work against them no gas she said ill go in the front trey you take the no mason said evenly i go in the front lucy hesitated then said okay ill go in the side door trey and frank youre on the back and far side she looked at jesse i want you and ned to keep an eye on the front and back doors of the house there got it jesse said and the windows mason said sternly to ned i dont want anybody sighting down on our backs from inside lucy said if they come out driving just take out the tires or if youve got a magnum like frank there aim for the engine block dont shoot garrett or amelia unless you have to you all know the rules of engagement she was looking at mason when she said this thinking of his sniper attack at the mill but the deputy seemed not to hear her she called in on her handitalkie and told jim bell they were about to storm the barn ive got the ambulance standing by he said this isnt a swat operation jesse said overhearing the transmission weve gotta be damn careful about any shooting lucy clicked off the radio she nodded toward the building lets move out they ran crouching using the oaks and pine for cover her eyes were fastened on the dark windows of the barn twice she was sure she saw movement inside it might have been the reflection of trees and clouds as she ran but she couldnt be sure as they approached she paused and switched her gun to her left hand wiped her palm took the weapon once more in her shooting hand the deputies clustered at the windowless back of the barn lucy was thinking that shed never done anything like this this isnt a swat operation but youre wrong jesse thats exactly what it is dear lord give me one clear shot at my judas a fat dragonfly strafed her she brushed it away with her left hand it returned and hovered nearby ominously as if garrett had sent the creature out to distract her stupid thought she told herself then swatted furiously at the bug again the insect boy youre going down lucy thought the message meant for both fugitives im not going to say anything mason said im just going in when you hear me kick in the door lucy you go through the side she nodded and as concerned as she was about mason being too eager as desirous as she was to get amelia sachs she was still happy to share some of the burden of this hard job let me make sure the side doors open she whispered they dispersed jogging into position lucy ducked under one of the windows and hurried to the side door it wasnt locked and was open a crack she nodded to mason who stood at the corner watching her he nodded back and held up ten fingers meaning she assumed to count the seconds down until he went through the door and then disappeared ten nine eight she turned to the door smelling the musty wood scent laced with the sweet aroma of gasoline and oil that flowed from inside the barn she listened carefully she heard a tapping the noise of the engine of the car or truck amelia had stolen five four three she took a deep breath to calm herself another ready she told herself then there was a loud crash from the front of the building as mason kicked inside sheriffs office he cried nobody move go she thought lucy kicked the side door but it moved only a few inches and stopped fast hitting a large riding lawn mower parked just inside the door it wouldnt go any farther she slammed into it with her shoulder twice but the door held shit she whispered and ran around to the front of the barn before she got halfway there she heard mason call out oh jesus and then she heard a gunshot followed a moment later by a second one whats going on rhyme demanded okay bell said uncertainly holding the phone there was something about his stance that alarmed rhyme the sheriff stood with the phone pressed hard against his ear his other fist clenched and away from his body he nodded as he listened looked at rhyme thereve been shots shots mason and lucy went into the barn jesse said there were two shots he looked up shouted into the other room get the ambulance over to the hallburton place badger hollow road off route steve farr called its on its way rhyme pressed his head back into the headrest of the chair glanced at thom who said nothing who was shooting whod been hit oh sachs an edge in his voice bell said well find out jesse is anybody down what the hells going on is amelia all right rhyme shouted well know in a minute bell said but it felt more like days finally bell stiffened again as jesse corn or somebody came on the phone he nodded jesus he did what he listened a moment longer then looked at rhymes alarmed face its all right nobodys hurt mason kicked his way into the barn and saw some overalls hung up on the wall a rake or shovel or something in front of it it was real dark he thought it was garrett with a gun he fired a couple times thats all amelias all right they werent even there it was just the truck they stole that was inside garrett and amelia mustve been in the house but they probablyve heard the shots and took off into the woods they cant get too far i know the property its all surrounded by bogs rhyme said angrily i want mason off the case that was no mistake he shot on purpose i told you he was too hotheaded bell obviously agreed into the phone he said jesse put mason on there was a short pause mason what the hell is this all about whyd you fire well what if itd been pete hallburton standing there or his wife or one of his kids i dont care you head back here right now thats an order well let them search the house get in your cruiser and head back im not telling you again i shit bell hung up a moment later the phone rang again lucy whats going on the sheriff listened frowning eyes on the floor he paced oh jesus youre sure he nodded then said okay stay there ill call you back he hung up what happened bell shook his head i dont believe it we got suckered she did a number on us your friend what bell said pete hallburtons there hes home in his house lucy and jesse just talked to him his wife works the threetoeleven shift over at davetts company and she forgot her supper so he dropped it off a half hour ago and drove home he drove home were amelia and garrett hiding in the trunk bell gave a disgusted sigh hes got a pickup no place to hide not for them anyway but there was plenty of room for her cell phone behind a cooler he had in the back rhyme too now barked a cynical laugh she called the rental company got put on hold and hid the phone in the truck you got that right bell muttered thom said remember lincoln she called that rental place this morning she was mad because she was on hold for so long she knew wed have a locator on the phone bell said they waited till lucy and the squad cars left canal road and then went on their merry goddamn way he looked at the map theyve got forty minutes on us they could be anywhere after the police cruisers had abandoned the roadblock and disappeared west down route garrett and sachs jogged to the end of canal road and crossed the highway they skirted the blackwater landing crime scenes then turned left and moved quickly through brush and an oak forest following the paquenoke river a halfmile into the forest they came to a tributary of the paquo it was impossible to go around and sachs had no desire to swim across the dark water dotted with insects and slime and trash but garrett had made other arrangements he pointed his cuffed hands to a place on the shore the boat boat where there there he pointed again she squinted and could just make out the shape of a small boat it was covered with brush and leaves garrett walked to it and working as best he could with the handcuffs on began stripping off the foliage hiding the vessel sachs helped him camouflage he said proudly i learned it from insects theres this little cricket in france the truxalis this is totally cool it changes its color three times a summer to match the different greens of grass during the season predators can hardly see it well sachs too had used some of the boys esoteric knowledge about insects when garrett had commented on the moths their ability to sense electronic and radio signals shed realized that of course rhyme had set up a locator on her cell phone shed remembered that shed been on hold for a long time at piedmontcarolina car rental that morning then shed snuck into the davett industries parking lot called the rental company and slipped the phone playing interminable muzak into the back of an unoccupied pickup truck whose motord been running parked in front of the employee entrance to the building the trick had apparently worked the deputies took off after the truck when it left the grounds as they uncovered the boat sachs now asked garrett the ammonia and the pit with the wasps nest you learned those from the insects too yeah he said you werent going to hurt anybody were you no no the antlion pit was just to scare you to slow you up i put an empty nest in there on purpose the ammonia was to warn me if you got close thats what insects do smellsre like an earlywarning system or something for them his red watery eyes shone with a curious admiration that was pretty cool what you did finding me at the mill i like never thought youd get there fast as you did and you left that fake evidence in the mill the map and the sand to lead us off yeah i told you insectsre smart theyve gotta be they finished uncovering the battered boat it was painted dark gray was about ten feet long and had a small outboard motor on it inside were a dozen plastic gallon bottles of spring water and a cooler sachs tore open one of the waters and drank a dozen mouthfuls she handed the bottle to garrett and he drank too then he opened the cooler inside were boxes of crackers and chips he looked them over carefully to make sure everything was accounted for and undamaged he nodded then climbed into the boat sachs followed sat with her back to the bow facing him he gave her a knowing grin as if acknowledging that she didnt trust him enough to turn her back on him and pulled the starter rope the engine sputtered to life he pushed off from the shore and like modern huck finns they started down the river sachs reflecting this is knuckle time a phrase her father had used the trim balding man a beat patrolman in brooklyn and manhattan most of his life had had a serious talk with his daughter when shed told him she wanted to give up modeling and get into police work hed been all for the decision but had said this about the profession amie you have to understand sometimes its a rush sometimes you get to make a difference sometimes its boring and sometimes not too often thank god its knuckle time fist to fist youre all by your lonesome with nobody to help you and i dont mean just against the perps sometimes itll be you against your boss sometimes against their bosses could be you against your buddies too you gonna be a cop you got to be ready to go it alone theres no getting around it i can handle it pop thats my girl lets go for a drive honey sitting in this rickety boat being piloted by a troubled young man sachs had never felt so alone in her life knuckle time fist to fist look there garrett said quickly pointing to an insect of some kind its my favorite of all the water boatman it flies under the water his face lit up with unbridled enthusiasm it really does hey thatd be pretty neat wouldnt it to fly underwater i like water it feels good on my skin the smile faded and he rubbed his arm this fucking poison oak i get it all the time it itches bad sometimes they began threading their way through small inlets around islands roots and gray trees halfsubmerged always returning to a westerly course toward the lowering sun a thought came to sachs an echo of something that had occurred to her earlier in the boys cell just before she broke him out of jail by hiding a boat filled with provisions gassed up garrett had anticipated that he would somehow escape from jail and that her role in this journey was part of an elaborate premeditated plan whatever you think about garrett dont trust him you think hes innocent but just accept that maybe he isnt you know how we approach crime scenes sachs with an open mind no preconceptions believing that anythings possible but then she looked at the boy once again his eyes bright and skipping happily from sight to sight as he guided the boat through the channels looking nothing at all like an escaped criminal but for all the world like an enthusiastic teenager on a camping trip content and excited about what he might find around the next bend in the river shes good lincoln ben said referring to the cell phone trick she is good the criminalist thought adding to himself shes as good as i am though he conceded grimly and to himself alone that shed been better than he this time rhyme was furious with himself for not anticipating it this isnt a game he thought an exercise like the way hed challenge her sometimes when she was walking the grid or when they were analyzing evidence back in his lab in new york her life was in danger she had perhaps only hours before garrett assaulted or killed her he couldnt afford to slip up again a deputy appeared in the doorway carrying a paper food lion bag it contained garretts clothes from the lockup good rhyme said do a chart somebody thom ben do a chart found at the secondary crime scene the mill ben write write but weve got one ben said pointing to the chalkboard no no no rhyme snapped erase it those clues were fakegarrett planted them to lead us off just like the limestone in the shoe he left behind when he snatched lydia if we can find some evidence in his clothes nodding at the bag thatll tell us where mary beth really is if were lucky bell said no rhyme thought if were skillful he said to ben cut a piece of the pants near the cuff and run it through the chromatograph bell stepped out of the office to talk to steve farr about getting priority frequencies on the radios without tipping the state police about what was happening which rhyme had insisted he do now the criminalist and ben waited for the results from the chromatograph as they did rhyme asked what else do we have nodding toward the clothes brown paint stains on garretts pants ben reported as he examined them dark brown looks recent brown rhyme repeated examining them whats the color of garretts parents house i dont know ben began i didnt expect you to be a storehouse of tanners corner trivia rhyme grumbled i meant call them oh ben found the number in the case file and called he spoke to someone for a moment then hung up thats one uncooperative son of a bitch garretts foster dad anyway their house is white and theres nothing painted dark brown on the property so its probably the color of the place where hes got her the big man asked is there a paint database somewhere we can compare it to good idea rhyme responded but the answers no i have one in new york but that wont do us any good here and the fbi database is automotive but keep going whats in the pockets anything put on but ben was already pulling on the latex gloves this what you were going to say it was rhyme muttered thom said he hates to be anticipated then ill try to do it more ben said ah heres something rhyme squinted at several small white objects the young man dug out of garretts pocket what are they ben sniffed cheese and bread more food like the crackers and ben was laughing rhyme frowned whats funny its food but its not for garrett what do you mean havent you ever fished ben asked no ive never fished rhyme grumbled if you want fish you buy it you cook it you eat it what the hell does fishing have to do with cheese sandwiches theyre not from sandwiches ben explained theyre stinkballs bait for fishing you wad up bread and cheese and let em get good and sour bottom feeders love em like catfish the smellier the better rhymes eyebrow lifted ah now thats helpful ben examined the cuffs he brushed a small amount out onto a people magazine subscription card and then looked at it under the microscope nothing much distinctive he said except little flecks of something white let me see the zoologist carried the large bausch lomb microscope over to rhyme who looked through the eyepieces okay good theyre paper fibers they are ben asked its obvious theyre paper what else would they be absorbent paper too dont have a clue what the source is though now that dirt is very interesting can you get some more out of the cuffs ill try ben cut the stitching securing the cuff and unfolded it he brushed more dirt out onto the card scope it rhyme ordered the zoologist prepared a slide and slipped it onto the stage of the compound microscope which he again held rocksteady for rhyme who peered into the eyepieces theres a lot of clay i mean a lotfeldspathic rock probably granite and whats that oh peat moss impressed ben asked how dyou know all this i just do rhyme didnt have time to go into a discussion of how a criminalist must know as much about the physical world as he does about crime he asked what else was in the cuffs whats thatnodding toward something resting on the subscription card that little whitishgreen thing its from a plant ben said but thats not my expertise i studied marine botany but it wasnt my favorite subject im more into life forms thatve got a chance to get away when youre collecting them seems more sporting rhyme ordered describe it ben looked it over with a magnifying glass a reddish stalk and a dot of liquid on the end it looks viscous theres a white bellshaped flower attached to it if i had to guess you do rhyme snapped and quickly im pretty sure its from a sundew what the hells that sounds like dish soap ben said its like a venus flytrap they eat insects theyre fascinating when i was a kid wed sit and watch em for hours the way they eat is fascinatingrhyme repeated sarcastically im not interested in their dining habits wherere they found thats what would be fascinating to me oh all over the place here rhyme scowled useless shit all right run a sample of that dirt through the chromatograph after the cloth samples done he then looked at garretts tshirt which was lying spread open on a table whatre those stains there were several reddish blotches on the shirt ben studied them closely and shrugged shook his head the criminalists thin lips curved into a wry smile you game to taste it without hesitation ben lifted the shirt and licked a small portion of the stain rhyme called good man ben lifted an eyebrow i assumed that was standard procedure no way in hell would i have done that rhyme responded i dont believe that for a minute ben said he licked it again fruit juice id guess cant tell what flavor okay add that to the list thom rhyme nodded at the chromatograph lets get the results from the scraps of pants cloth and then run the dirt from the cuffs soon the machine had told them what trace substances were embedded in garretts clothes and what had been found in the dirt in his cuffs sugar more camphene alcohol kerosene and yeast the kerosene was in significant amounts thom had added these to the list and the men examined the chart found at secondary crime scene mill brown paint on pants sundew plant clay peat moss fruit juice paper fibers stinkball bait sugar camphene alcohol kerosene yeast what did all this mean rhyme wondered there were too many clues he couldnt see any relationships among them was the sugar from the fruit juice or from a separate location the boy had been to had he bought the kerosene or had he just happened to hide in a gas station or barn where the owner stored it alcohol was found in more than three thousand common household and industrial products from solvents to aftershave the yeast had undoubtedly been picked up in the gristmill where grain had been ground into flour after a few minutes lincoln rhymes eyes flicked to another chart found at secondary crime scene garetts room skunk musk cut pine needles drawings of insects pictures of mary beth and family insect books fishing line money unknown key kerosene ammonia nitrates camphene something that sachs had mentioned when she was searching the boys room came back to him ben could you open that notebook there garretts notebook i want to look at it again you want me to put it in the turning frame no just thumb through it rhyme told him the boys stilted drawings of the insects flipped past a water boatman a diving bell spider a water strider he remembered that sachs had told him that except for the wasp jar garretts safe the insects in his collection were in jars containing water theyre all aquatic ben nodded seem to be hes attracted to water rhyme mused he looked at ben and that bait you said its for bottom feeders stinkballs right saltwater or fresh well fresh of course and the kerosene boats run on that right white gas ben said small outboards do rhyme said hows this for a thought hes going west by boat on the paquenoke river ben said makes sense lincoln and ill bet theres so much kerosene because hes been refueling a lot making runs back and forth between tanners corner and the place hes got mary beth getting it ready for her good thinking call jim bell in here would you a few minutes later bell returned and rhyme explained his theory bell said water bugs gave you that idea huh rhyme nodded if we know insects well know garrett hanlon its no crazier than anything else ive heard today jim bell said rhyme asked have you got a police boat no but it wouldnt do us any good anyway you dont know the paquo from the map it looks like any other river with banks and all but its got a thousand inlets and branches flowing into and out of marshes if garretts on it hes not staying to the main channel i guarantee you that itd be impossible to find him rhymes eyes followed the paquenoke west if he was moving supplies to the place where hes got mary beth that means its probably not too far off the river how far west would he have to go to be in an area that was habitable have to be a ways see up there bell touched a spot around location g thats north of the paquo nobodyd live there south of the river it gets pretty residential hed be seen for sure so at least ten miles or so west you got that right bell said that bridge rhyme nodded toward the map looking at spot e the hobeth bridge whatre the approaches to it like the highway just landfill but theres a lot of it the bridges about forty feet high so the ramps leading up to it are long oh wait youre thinking garrettd have to sail back to the main channel to get under the bridge right because the engineers wouldve filled in the smaller channels on either side when they built the approaches bell was nodding yep makes sense to me get lucy and the others there now to the bridge and ben call that fellow henry davett tell him were sorry but we need his help again wwjd thinking once again of davett rhyme now offered a prayer though not to any deities it was directed to amelia sachs oh sachs be careful its only a matter of time until garrett comes up with an excuse for you to take the cuffs off him then to lead you to someplace deserted then hell manage to get a hold of your gun dont let the passing hours lull you into trusting him sachs dont let your guard down hes got the patience of a mantis garrett knew the waterways like an expert river pilot and steered the boat up what seemed to be dead ends yet he always managed to find creeks thin as spiderweb strands that led them steadily west through the maze he pointed out river otter muskrat and beaver to sachs sightings that might have excited amateur naturalists but left her cold her wildlife was the rats and pigeons and squirrels of the city and only to the extent they were useful in helping her and rhyme in their forensic work look there he cried what he was pointing to something she couldnt see he stared at a spot near the shore lost in whatever tiny drama was being played out on the water all sachs could see was some bug skipping over the surface water strider he told her then sat back as they eased past his face grew serious insectsre like a lot more important than us i mean when it comes to keeping the planet going see i read this someplace if all the people on earth disappeared tomorrow the worldd keep going just fine but if the insects all went away then lifed be over with way fast like one generation the plantsd die then the animals and the earthd turn into this big rock again despite his adolescent vernacular garrett spoke with the authority of a professor and the verve of a revivalist he continued yeah some insectsre a pain in the ass but thats only a few of them like one or two percent his face grew animated and he said proudly and the ones that eat crops and stuff well i have this idea its pretty cool i want to breed this special kind of golden lacewing to control the bad ones instead of poisons so the good insects and other animals dont die the lacewingd be the best nobodys done that yet you think you can garrett i dont exactly know how yet but im gonna learn she recalled what shed read in his book e o wilsons term biofilia the affection people have for other types of life on the planet and as she listened to him telling her this trivia all proof of a love of nature and learning foremost in her thoughts was this anyone who could be so fascinated by living creatures and in his odd way could love them couldnt possibly be a rapist and killer amelia sachs held on tightly to this thought and it sustained her as they navigated the paquenoke escaping from lucy kerr and from the mysterious man in the tan overalls and from the simple troubled town of tanner s corner escaping from lincoln rhyme too and from his impending operation and the terrible consequences it might have for both of them the narrow boat eased through the tributaries no longer black water but golden camouflaged reflecting the low sunlight just like that french cricket garrett had told her about finally the boy steered out of the back routes and into the main channel of the river hugging the shore sachs looked behind them to the east to see if there were police boats in pursuit she saw nothing except one of the big davett industries barges headed upstream away from them garrett throttled back on the motor and eased into a little cove he peered through an overhanging willow branch looking west toward a bridge that ran across the paquenoke we have to go under it he said we cant get around he studied the span you see anybody sachs looked she saw a few flashes of light maybe i cant tell theres too much glare thats where the assholesd be waiting for us he said uneasily i always worry about the bridge people looking for you always garrett beached the boat and shut the motor off he climbed out and unscrewed a turnbolt securing the outboard which he pulled off and hid in the grass along with the gas tank whatre you doing she asked cant take a chance of getting spotted garrett took the cooler and the water jugs out of the boat and lashed the oars to the seats with two pieces of greasy rope he poured the water out of a halfdozen of the jugs and recapped them set them aside he nodded toward the bottles too bad about the water mary beth doesnt have any shell need some but i can get some for her from this pond near the cabin then he waded into the river and gripped the boat by the side help me he said weve got to capsize it were going to sink it no just turn her upside down well put the jugs underneath shell float fine upside down sure sachs realized what garrett had in mind theyd get up underneath the boat and float past the bridge the dark hull low in the water would be almost impossible to see from the bridge once they were past they could right the boat and row the rest of the way to where mary beth was he opened the cooler and found a plastic bag we can put our things in it that we dont want to get wet he dropped his book the miniature worldinside it sachs added her wallet and the gun she tucked her tshirt into her jeans and slipped the bag down the front of her shirt garrett said can you take my cuffs off he held his hands out she hesitated i dont want to drown he said eyes imploring im scared make him stop i wont do anything bad i promise reluctantly sachs fished the key from her pocket and undid the cuffs the weapemeoc indians native to what is now north carolina were linguistically part of the algonquin nation and were related to the powhatans the chowans and the pamlico tribes in the midatlantic portion of the united states they were excellent farmers and were envied among their fellow native americans for their fishing prowess they were peaceful to an extreme and had little interest in arms three hundred years ago the british scientist thomas harriot wrote those weapons that they have are onlie bowes made of witch hazle and arrows of reeds neither have they anything to defend themselves but targets made of barcks and some armours made of sticks wickered together with thread it took british colonists to turn these people militant and they did so quite efficiently by simultaneously threatening them with gods wrath if they didnt convert immediately to christianity decimating the population by importing influenza and smallpox demanding food and shelter they were too lazy to provide for themselves and murdering one of the tribes favorite chiefs wingina who the colonists were convinced erroneously as it happened was plotting an attack on the british settlements to the colonists indignant surprise rather than accepting the lord jesus christ into their hearts the indians declared allegiance to their own deities spirits called manitous and then war against the british the opening action of which according to history as writ by young mary beth mcconnell was the assault on the lost colonists at roanoke island after the settlers fled the tribe anticipating british reinforcements took a new look at weaponry and began to use copper which had been used only for decoration in making arms metal arrowheads were much sharper than flint and easier to make however unlike in the movies an arrow fired by an unpulleyed bow usually wont penetrate very far into the skin and is rarely fatal to finish off his wounded adversary the weapemeoc warrior would apply the coup de grace a blow to the head with a club called appropriately a coup stick which the tribe became very talented in making a coup stick is nothing more than a large rounded rock bound into the split end of a stick and lashed into place with a leather thong its a very efficient weapon and the one that mary beth mcconnell was now making based on her knowledge of native american archaeology was surely as deadly as the ones that in her theory had crushed the skulls and snapped the spines of the roanoke settlers as they fought their last battle on the shores of the paquenoke at what was now called blackwater landing shed made hers out of two curved support rods from the old dinner table chair in the cabin the rock was the one that tom the missionarys friend had flung at her shed mounted it in between the two rods and bound it with long strips of denim torn from her shirttail the weapon was heavy six or seven pounds but it wasnt too heavy for mary beth who regularly lifted thirty and fortypound rocks at archaeological digs she now rose from the bed and swung the weapon several times pleased with the power the club gave her a skittish sound registered in her hearing the insects in the jars it made her think of garretts disgusting habit of snapping his fingernails together she shivered in rage and lifted the coup stick to bring it down on the jar closest to her but then she paused she hated the insects yes but her anger wasnt really directed at them it was garrett she was furious with she left the jars alone and walked to the door then slammed the stick into it several times near the lock the door didnt budge well she hadnt expected it to but the important thing was that shed tied the rock to the head of the club very firmly it hadnt slipped of course if the missionary and tom returned with a gun the club wouldnt do much good against them but she decided that if they got inside shed keep the stick hidden behind her and the first one who touched her would get a broken skull the other might kill her but shed take one of them with her she imagined that this was how virginia dare had died mary beth sat down and looked out the window at the low sun on the line of trees where shed first seen the missionary what was the feeling coursing through her fear she supposed but then she decided that it wasnt fear at all it was impatience she wanted her enemies to return mary beth lifted the coup stick into her lap get yourself readytom had told her well that she had theres a boat lucy leaned forward through the leaves of a pungent bay tree on the shore near the hobeth bridge her hand was on her weapon where she asked jesse corn there pointing upstream she could vaguely see a slight darkness on the water a halfmile away moving in the current what do you mean boat she asked i dont see no look its upside down i can hardly see it she said youve got good eyes is it them trey asked what happened did it capsize but jesse corn said naw theyre underneath it lucy squinted how do you know just have a feeling he said theres enough air under there trey asked jesse said sure its high enough in the water we used to do that with canoes on bambert lake when we were kids wed play submarine lucy said what do we do we need a boat or something to get to them she looked around ned pulled his police utility belt off handed it to jesse corn hell ill just go out and kick it back into shore you can swim that she asked the man took his boots off i swum this river a million times well cover you lucy said theyre underwater jesse said i wouldnt worry too much about them shooting anybody trey pointed out a little grease on the shells and theyll last for weeks underwater amelias not gonna shoot said jesse corn judas defender but were not taking any chances lucy said then to ned dont flip it over just swim out and steer it over this way trey you go over there by the willow with the scattergun jesse and ill be over there on the shore well have em in a crossfire if anything happens ned barefoot and shirtless walked gingerly on the rocky embankment down to the mud beach he looked around carefully for snakes lucy supposed and then eased into the water ned breaststroked out toward the boat swimming very quietly keeping his head above water lucy pulled her smith wesson from the holster cocked the hammer glanced at jesse corn who looked at her weapon uneasily trey was standing beside a tree holding the shotgun muzzleup he noticed her cocked pistol and he racked a round into the chamber of the remington the boat was thirty feet from them near midstream ned was a strong swimmer and he was closing the distance quickly hed be there in the gunshot was loud and close lucy jumped as a spume of water shot into the air a few feet from ned oh no lucy called bringing up her weapon looking for the shooter where where trey called crouching and adjusting his grip on the shotgun ned dove under the surface another shot water flew into the air trey lowered the scattergun and started firing at the boat panic fire the twelvegauge didnt have a plugged tube it was loaded with seven rounds the deputy emptied it in seconds hitting the boat squarely with every round sending splinters of wood and water flying everywhere no jesse cried therere people under there wherere they shooting from lucy called under the boat the other side of it i cant tell where are they wheres ned trey asked is he hit wheres ned i dont know lucy shouted voice raw with panic i cant see him trey reloaded and aimed at the boat once more no lucy ordered dont fire cover me she ran down the embankment and waded into the water suddenly near the shore she heard a choking gasp as ned bobbed to the surface help me he was terrified looking behind him scrabbling out of the water jesse and trey aimed their weapons at the far shore and stepped slowly down the incline to the river jesses dismayed eyes were fixed on the riddled vessel the terrible ragged holes in the hull charging into the water lucy holstered her gun and grabbed neds arm dragged him to the shore hed stayed under as long as he dared and was pale and weak from lack of oxygen where are they he struggled to ask choking dont know she said pulling him into a stand of bushes he collapsed on his side spitting and coughing she looked him over carefully he hadnt been hit they were joined by trey and jesse both of them crouching eyes gazing across the river looking for their attackers ned was still choking fucking water tastes like shit the boat was slowly easing toward them half submerged now theyre dead whispered jesse corn staring at the boat they have to be the boat floated closer jesse slipped his utility belt off and started forward no lucy said eyes on the far shore let it come to us the capsized boat floated into an uprooted cedar extending into the river and stopped the deputies waited a few moments there was no movement other than the rocking of the shattered vessel the water was ruddy but lucy couldnt tell if the color was due to blood or was from the fiery sunset pale troubled jesse corn glanced at lucy who nodded all three of the other deputies kept their guns on the boat as jesse waded out and flipped it over the remnants of several torn water jugs bobbed out and floated leisurely downstream there was no one underneath what happened jesse asked i dont get it hell ned muttered bitterly they set us up it was a goddamn ambush lucy hadnt believed that her anger could get any more consuming but it now seized her like raw electric current ned was right amelia had used the boat like one of nathan groomers decoys and ambushed them from the far shore no jesse protested she wouldnt do that if she shot it was just to scare us amelia knows her way round firearms she couldve hit ned shed wanted to goddamnit jesse open your eyes will you lucy snapped firing from heavy cover like that doesnt matter how good a shot you are she still couldve missed and on water there couldve been a ricochet or ned mightve panicked and swum into a bullet jesse corn had no response for that he rubbed his face with his palms and stared out over the far shore okay heres what were doing lucy said in a low voice its getting late were going as far as we can while theres still some light then well have jim bring us some supplies for the night well be camping out were going to assume theyre gunning for us and were going to act accordingly now lets get across the bridge and look for their trail everybody locked and loaded ned and trey said they were jesse corn stared at the shattered boat for a moment then slowly nodded then lets go the four deputies started over the fifty yards of unprotected bridge but they didnt walk in a cluster they were in a long line so that if amelia sachs were to shoot again she couldnt hit more than one of them before the others got to cover and could return fire the formation was treys idea one that he got from a world war ii movie and because hed thought of it he assumed hed take the point position but that was the spot lucy kerr insisted on taking for herself you came damn close to hitting him harris tomel said no way but culbeau persisted i said scare em youd hit ned you know what kinda shit wed be in i know what im doing rich give me a little credit okay fucking schoolboy culbeau thought the three men were on the north shore of the paquo trekking along a path that followed the river in fact while culbeau was pissed that tomel had fired too close to the deputy swimming out to the boat he was sure the sniping had worked lucy and the other deputiesd be skittish as sheep now and would move nice and slow the shooting also had another beneficial effect sean osarian was spooked and was being quiet for a change they walked for twenty minutes then tomel asked culbeau you know the boys going in this direction yep but you dont have any idea where hes gonna end up course not culbeau said if i did we could just go there direct right come on schoolboy use your fucking noggin but dont worry were gonna find him can i have some water osarian finally asked water you want water osarian said complacently yeah thats what id like culbeau glanced at him suspiciously and handed him a bottle hed never known the scrawny young man to actually drink something that wasnt beer whisky or shine he drank it down wiped a mouth surrounded by freckles and tossed the bottle aside culbeau sighed he said sarcastically hey now sean you sure you want to leave something with your fingerprints on the trail oh right the skinny man scurried into the brush and retrieved it sorry sorry sean osarian apologizing culbeau stared for a moment in disbelief then nodded them all forward again they came to a bend in the river and being on high ground they could see for miles downstream tomel said hey look up there theres a house bet the boy and the redheadve headed that way culbeau sighted through the scope of his deer rifle about two miles down the valley was an aframe vacation house just about on the river itd be a logical hiding place for the boy and the woman cop to hole up he nodded bet they are lets go downstream from the hobeth bridge the paquenoke river makes a sharp bend to the north its shallow here near the shore and the muddy shoals are piled high with driftwood and vegetation and trash like skiffs adrift two human forms floating in the water now missed the turn and were eased by the current into this refuse heap amelia sachs let go of the plastic water jug her improvised flotation device and reached out a wrinkled hand to grip a branch she then realized that this wasnt a very smart thing to do because her pockets were filled with rocks for ballast and she felt herself being tugged downward into the dusky water but she straightened her legs and found the river bottom only four feet below the surface she stood unsteadily and slogged forward garrett appeared beside her a moment later and helped her out of the water onto the muddy ground they crawled up a slight incline through a tangle of bushes and collapsed in a grassy clearing lay there for a few minutes caught their breath she pulled the plastic bag out of her shirt it had leaked slightly but there wasnt any serious water damage she handed him his insect book and opened the cylinder of her gun then rested it on a clump of brittle yellow grass to dry shed been wrong about what garrett had planned they had slipped empty water jugs under the overturned boat for buoyancy but then hed shoved it into midstream without getting underneath it hed told her to fill her pockets with rocks hed done the same and they hurried downstream past the boat fifty feet or so and slipped into the water each holding a halffull water jug for flotation garrett showed her how to lean her head back with the rocks for ballast only their faces were above the water theyd float downstream on the current ahead of the boat the diving bell spider does this hed told her like a scuba diver carries his air around with him hed done this several times in the past to get away though just like earlier he didnt elaborate on why hed been escaping and from whom garrett had explained that if the police werent at the bridge theyd swim over to the boat beach it drain out the water and continue on their way rowing with the oars if the deputies were on the bridge their attention would be on the boat and they wouldnt notice garrett and amelia floating ahead of it once past the bridge theyd kick to shore and continue their journey on foot well hed been right about that part theyd gotten under the bridge undetected but sachs was still shocked at what had happened next unprovoked the deputies had fired round after round at the overturned boat garrett too was badly shaken by the gunshots they thought we were under there he whispered fuckers tried to kill us sachs said nothing he added ive done some bad things but im no phymata whats that an ambush bug lies in wait and kills thats what they were going to do with us just like shoot us not give us any chance at all oh lincoln she thought what a mess this is why did i do it i should just surrender now wait here for the deputies give it up go back to tanners corner and try to make amends but she looked over at garrett hugging himself shivering with fear and she knew she couldnt turn back now shed have to keep going play this crazy game out knuckle time where do we go now see that house there a brown aframe is mary beth there naw but theyve got a little trolling boat we can borrow and we can get dry and get some food well what did a count of breaking and entering matter after tallying up her criminal charges today garrett suddenly picked up her pistol she froze watching the blueblack gun in his hands knowingly he looked in the chambers and saw it was loaded with six rounds he clicked the cylinder into the frame of the gun and balanced it in his hand with a familiarity that unnerved her whatever you think about garrett dont trust him he glanced at her and gave a grin then he handed her the gun buttfirst lets go this way nodding toward a path she replaced the weapon in her holster feeling the flutter of her heart from the scare they walked toward the house its empty sachs asked nodding toward the structure nobodys there now garrett paused and looked back after a moment he muttered theyre pissed now the deputies and theyre after us with all their guns and things shit he turned and led her along a path to the house he was silent for a few minutes you wanta know something amelia what i was thinking about this moth the grand emperor moth what about it she asked absently hearing in her memory the terrible shotgun blasts meant for her and this boy lucy kerr trying to kill her the echoes of the shots obscured everything else in her mind the coloring on its wings garrett told her like when theyre open they look just like an animals eyes i mean its pretty cool theres even a white dot in the corner like a reflection of light in the pupil birds see that and think its a fox or a cat and it scares them off cant the birds smell that its a moth and not an animal she asked not concentrating on the conversation he looked at her for a moment to see if she was joking he said birds cant smell as if shed just asked if the world was flat he looked behind them up the river again well have to slow em down how close you think they are very close she said with all their guns and things its them rich culbeau was looking at the footprints in the mud of the shore the trails only ten fifteen minutes old and theyre heading for the house tomel said they moved cautiously up a path osarian still wasnt acting weird which for him actually was weird and scary he hadnt snuck any hits of shine hadnt been pranking hadnt even been talking and sean was the numberone motormouth in tanners corner the shooting at the river had really shaken him now as they walked through the woods he swung the muzzle of the black soldier rifle around fast at every sound from the brush did you see that nigger shoot he said finally mustve put ten slugs in that boat in less than a minute was pellets harris tomel corrected and instead of challenging him and trying to impress them with what he knew about guns and acting like the allpurpose asshole he was osarian just said oh buckshot right i shouldve thought of that and nodded like a kid in school whod just learned something new and interesting they moved closer to the house it looked like a nice place culbeau thought a vacation house probably maybe some lawyers or doctors from raleigh or winstonsalem a good hunting lodge full bar nice bedrooms a freezer for venison hey harris osarian asked culbeaud never known the boy to use anybodys first name what this thing shoot high or low holding up the colt tomel glanced at culbeau probably also trying to figure out where the weird part of osarian had gone first ones right on the money but itll kick higher than youre used to drop the muzzle for the next shots because the stocks plastic osarian asked so its lighter than wood yeah he nodded again his face even more serious than earlier thanks thanks the woods ended and the men could see a large clearing around the house easily fifty yards in all directions without even a sapling for cover the approachd be tough think theyre inside tomel asked kneading his gorgeous shotgun i dont wait get down the three men crouched fast i saw something downstairs through that window to the left culbeau looked through the scope on the deer rifle somebodys moving around on the ground floor i cant see too good with the blinds but theres definitely somebody there he scanned the other windows shit a panicked whisper he dropped to the ground what osarian asked alarmed gripping his gun and spinning around get down one of ems got a rifle with a scope theyre sighting right at us upstairs window damn gotta be the girl tomel said that boys too much of a faggot to know which end the bullet comes out fuck that bitch culbeau muttered osarian was easing behind a tree hugging his nam gun close to his cheek shes got the whole field covered from here culbeau said we wait till its dark tomel asked oh with little miss titless deputy coming up behind us i dont think thatll work now harris will it well can you hit her from here tomel nodded toward the window probably culbeau said sighing he was about to start ragging on tomel when osarian said in a weirdly normal voice but if rich shoots then lucy and thothersll hear i think we oughta flank em go around the side and try and get inside a shotd be a lot quieter in there which was just what culbeau was about to say thatll take a half hour tomel snapped probably pissed at being outthought by osarian who remained at the top of his uncrazy form the young man clicked the safety off his gun and squinted toward the house well id say we gotta make it take less than half an hour whatta you think rich steve farr led henry davett into the lab once again the businessman thanked farr who left and nodded to rhyme henry rhyme said thank you for coming as before the businessman paid no attention to rhymes condition this time though rhyme took no comfort from his attitude his concern for sachs was consuming him he kept hearing jim bells voice you usually have twentyfour hours to find the victim after that they become dehumanized in the kidnappers eyes and he doesnt think anything about killing them this rule which had applied to lydia and mary beth now encompassed amelia sachs fate too the difference was rhyme believed that sachs might have far fewer than twentyfour hours i thought youd caught that boy thats what i heard ben said he got away from us no davett frowned sure did ben offered oldfashioned jailbreak rhyme ive got some more evidence but i dont know what to make of it i was hoping you could help again the businessman sat down ill do what i can a glance at his wwjd tie bar rhyme nodded toward the chart said could you look that over the list on the right the mill is that where he was that old mill northeast of town right i knew about the place davett grimaced angrily i shouldve thought of it criminalists cant let the verb should have creep into their vocabulary rhyme said its impossible to think of everything in this business but take a look at the chart does anything on it seem familiar to you davett read carefully found at secondary crime scene mill brown paint on pants sundew plant clay peat moss fruit juice paper fibers stinkball bait sugar camphene alcohol kerosene yeast as he gazed at the list he said in a distracted voice its like a puzzle thats the nature of my job rhyme said how much can i speculate the businessman asked as much as youd like rhyme said all right davett said he thought for a moment then said a carolina bay rhyme asked whats that a horse davett glanced at rhyme to see if he was joking then said no its a geologic structure you see on the eastern seaboard mostly though theyre found in the carolinas north and south theyre basically oval ponds about three or four feet deep freshwater they could be a halfacre big or a couple of hundred the bottom of them is mostly clay and peat just whats on the chart there but clay and peat theyre pretty common around here ben said they are davett agreed and if youd found just those two things i wouldnt have a clue where they came from but you found something else see one of the most interesting characteristics about carolina bays is that insectkiller plants grow around them you see hundreds of venus flytraps sundews and pitcher plants around bays probably because the ponds promote insects if you found a sundew along with clay and peat moss then theres no doubt the boys spent time around a carolina bay good rhyme said then gazing at the map asked what does bay mean an inlet of water no it refers to bay trees they grow around the ponds therere all sorts of myths about them settlers used to think they were carved out of the land by sea monsters or witches casting spells meteorites were a theory for a few years but theyre really just natural depressions caused by wind and currents of water are they unique to a particular area around here rhyme asked hoping that theyd help narrow down the search to some extent davett rose and walked to the map with his finger he circled a large area to the west of tanners corner locations b to e and f to b youll find them mostly here in this area just before you get to the hills rhyme was discouraged what davett had circled must have included seventy or eighty square miles davett saw rhymes reaction he said wish i could be more helpful no no i appreciate it it will be helpful we just need to narrow down more of the clues the businessman read sugar fruit juice kerosene he shook his head unsmiling you have a difficult job mr rhyme these are the tough cases rhyme explained when you have no clues youre free to speculate when you have a lot of them you can usually get the answer pretty quickly but having a few clues like this rhymes voice faded were hogtied by the facts ben muttered rhyme turned to him exactly ben exactly i should be getting home davett said my familys expecting me he wrote a phone number on a business card you can call me anytime rhyme thanked him again and turned his gaze back to the evidence chart hogtied by the facts rich culbeau sucked the blood off his arm from where the brambles had scratched it deeply he spit against a tree it had taken them twenty minutes of hard slogging through the brush to get to the side porch of the aframe vacation house without being seen by the bitch with the sniper gun even harris tomel who normally looked like hed just stepped off a country club patio was bloody and duststained the new sean osarian quiet and thoughtful and well sanewas waiting back on the path lying on the ground with his black gun like an infantry grunt at khe sahn ready to slow up lucy and the other vietcong with a few shots over their heads in case they came up the trail toward the house you ready culbeau asked tomel who nodded culbeau eased open the knob of the mudroom door and pushed the door inside his gun up and ready tomel followed they were skittish as cats knowing that the redheaded cop with the deer rifle she surely knew how to use could be waiting for them anywhere in the house you hear anything culbeau whispered just music it was soft rock the sort culbeau listened to because he hated countrywestern the two men moved slowly down the dim hallway guns up and cocked they slowed ahead of them was the kitchen where culbeau had seen somebody probably the boy moving when hed sighted on the house through the rifle scope he nodded toward the room dont think they heard us tomel said the music was up pretty high we go in together shoot for their legs or knees dont kill him we still gotta get him to tell us where mary beth is the woman too culbeau thought for a moment yeah why not we might want to keep her alive for a while you know what for tomel nodded one two three they pushed fast into the kitchen and found themselves about to shoot a weatherman on a bigscreen tv they crouched and spun around looking for the boy and the woman didnt see them then culbeau looked at the set he realized it didnt belong here somebodyd rolled it in from the living room and set it up in front of the stove facing the windows culbeau peered out through the blinds shit they put the set here so wed see it from across the field from the path and think there was somebody in the house he took off up the stairs taking them two at a time wait tomel called shes up there with the gun but of course the redhead wasnt up there at all culbeau kicked into the bedroom where hed seen the rifle barrel and the telescopic sight aiming at them and he now found pretty much what he expected to find a piece of narrow pipe on top of which was taped the ass end of a corona bottle in disgust he said thats the gun and scope jesus christ they rigged it to bluff us out it cost us a half fucking hour and the goddamn deputiesre probably five minutes away we gotta get outa here he stormed past tomel who started to say pretty smart of her but seeing the fire in culbeaus eyes he decided not to finish his sentence the battery ran down and the tiny electric trolling engine fell silent their narrow skiff theyd stolen from the vacation house drifted on the current of the paquenoke through the oily mist covering the river it was dusk the water was no longer golden but moody gray garrett hanlon picked up a paddle in the bottom of the boat and headed toward shore we gotta land someplace he said before its like totally dark amelia sachs noticed that the landscape had changed the trees had thinned and large pools of marsh met the river the boy was right a wrong turn would take them into a back alley of some impenetrable bog hey whats wrong he asked seeing her troubled expression im a hell of a long way from brooklyn thats in new york right she said he clicked his nails and it bothers you not being there you bet it does steering toward the shore he said thats what scares insects the most whats that like its weird they dont mind working and they dont mind fighting but they get all freaked out in an unfamiliar place even if its safe they hate it dont know what to do okay sachs thought i guess im a cardcarrying insect she preferred the way lincoln phrased it fish out of water you can always tell when an insects really upset they clean their antennas over and over again insects antennas show their moods like our faces only the thing is he added cryptically they dont fake it like we do he laughed in an odd way a sound she hadnt heard before he eased over the side of the boat into the water and pulled the boat onto the land sachs climbed out he directed her through the woods and seemed to know exactly where he was going despite the darkness of dusk and the absence of any path that she could see how do you know where to go she asked garrett said i guess im like the monarchs i just know directions pretty good monarchs you know the butterflies they migrate a thousand miles and know exactly where theyre going its really really cool they navigate by the sun and like change course automatically depending on where it is on the horizon oh and when its overcast or dark they use this other sense they have they can feel the earths magnetic fields when a bat shoots out a beam of sound to find them moths fold their wings and drop to the ground and hide she was smiling at his enthusiastic lecture when she stopped suddenly and crouched look out she whispered there theres a light faint illumination reflecting off a murky pond an eerie yellow light like a failing lantern but garrett was laughing she looked at him quizzically he said just a ghost what she asked its the lady of the swamp like this indian maiden who died the night before her wedding her ghost still paddles through the dismal swamp looking for the guy she was going to marry were not in the great dismal but its near here he nodded toward the glow what it is really is just fox fire this gross fungus that glows she didnt like the light it reminded her of the uneasiness she felt as they drove into tanners corner that morning seeing the small coffin at the funeral i dont like the swamp with or without ghosts sachs said yeah garrett said maybe youll get to like it someday he led her along a road and after ten minutes he turned down a short overgrown driveway there was an old trailer sitting in a clearing in the gloom she couldnt see clearly but it seemed to be a ramshackle place leaning to the side rusted tires flat and overgrown with ivy and moss this is yours well nobodys lived here for years so i guess its mine i have a key but its at home i didnt have a chance to get it he went around to the side and managed to open a window boosted himself up and through it a moment later the door opened she walked inside garrett was rummaging through a cabinet in the tiny kitchen he found some matches and lit a propane lantern it gave off a warm yellow glow he opened another cabinet peered inside i had some doritos but the mice got em he pulled out some tupperware and examined it chewed right through shit but ive got farmer john macaroni its good i eat it all the time and some beans too he started opening cans as sachs looked around the trailer a few chairs a table in the bedroom she could see a dingy mattress there was a thick mat and a pillow on the living room floor the trailer itself radiated poverty broken doors and fixtures bullet holes in the walls windows broken carpet stained beyond cleaning in her days as a patrol officer for the nypd shed seen many sad places like this but always from the outside now this was her temporary home thinking of lucys words from that morning normal rules dont apply to anybody north of the paquo us or them you can see yourself shooting before you read anybody their rights and thatd be perfectly all right remembering the stunning blasts of the shotgun intended for her and garrett the boy hung pieces of greasy cloth over the windows to keep anyone from seeing the light inside he stepped outside for a moment then came back with a rusty cup filled presumably with rainwater he held it out to her she shook her head feel like i drank half the paquenoke thiss better im sure it is ill still pass he drank the contents of the cup and then stirred the food as it heated on the small propane stove in a soft voice he sang an eerie tune over and over farmer john farmer john enjoy it fresh from farmer john it was nothing more than an advertising jingle but the chant was unsettling and she was glad when he stopped sachs was going to pass on the food but she realized suddenly that she was famished garrett poured the contents into two bowls and handed her a spoon she spit on the utensil and wiped it on her shirt they ate for a few minutes in silence sachs noticed a sound outside a raucous highpitched noise whats that she asked cicadas yeah he said its just the males make that noise only the males make all that noise just from these little plates on their body he squinted reflected for a moment they live this totally weird life the nymphs dig into the ground and stay there for like twenty years before they hatch then they come out and climb a tree their skin splits down the back and the adult crawls out all those years in the ground just hiding before they come out and become adults why do you like insects so much garrett sachs asked he hesitated i dont know i just do havent you ever wondered about it he stopped eating scratched one of his poison oak welts i guess i got interested in them after my parents died after that happened i was pretty unhappy i felt funny in my head a lot confused and i dont know just different the counselors at school just said it was because mom and dad and my sister died and they like told me i should work harder to get over it but i couldnt i just felt like i wasnt a real person i didnt care about anything all i did was lie in bed or go into the swamp or the woods and read for a year thats all i did like i hardly saw anybody just moved from foster home to foster home but then i read something neat in that book there flipping open the miniature worldhe found a page he showed it to her hed circled a passage headed characteristics of healthy living creatures sachs scanned it read several of the list of eight or nine entries a healthy creature strives to grow and develop a healthy creature strives to survive a healthy creature strives to adapt to its environment garrett said i read that and it was like wow i could be like that i could be healthy and normal again i tried totally hard to follow the rules it said and that made me feel better so i guess i felt close to them insects i mean a mosquito landed on her arm she laughed but they also drink your blood she slapped it got him hergarrett corrected its just the females drink blood the males drink nectar really he nodded then grew quiet for a moment looked at the dot of blood on her arm insects never go away what do you mean he found another passage in the book and read aloud if any creature could be called immortal it is the insect which inhabited the earth millions of years before the advent of mammals and which will be here on earth long after intelligent life has vanished garrett put the book down and looked up at her see the thing is if you kill one therere always more if my mom and dad and sister were insects and they died thered be others just like them and i wouldnt be alone dont you have any friends garrett shrugged mary beth shes sort of the only one you really like her dont you totally she saved me from this kid who was going to do something shitty to me and i mean she talks to me he thought for a moment i guess thats what i like about her talking i was thinking like maybe in a few years when im older she might wanta go out with me we could do things like other people do you know go to movies or go on picnics i was watching her on a picnic once she was with her mother and some friends they were having fun i watched for like hours i just sat under a holly bush with some water and doritos and pretended i was with them you ever go on a picnic i have sure i went with my family a lot i mean my real family i liked it mom and kayed set the table and cook stuff on this little grill from kmart dad and med take our shoes and socks off and stand in the water to fish i remember what the mud felt like and the cold water sachs wondered if that was why he liked water and water insects so much and you thought you and mary beth would go on picnics i dont know maybe then he shook his head and offered a sad smile i guess not mary beths pretty and smart and a bunch older than me shell end up with somebody whos handsome and smart but maybe we could be friends her and me but even if not all i really care about is shes okay shell stay with me till its safe or you and your friend that man in the wheelchair everybody was talking about you can help her go someplace where shed be safe he looked out the window and fell silent safe from the man in the overalls she asked he didnt answer for a moment then nodded yeah thats right im going to get some of that water sachs said wait he said he tore some dry leaves off a small branch resting on the kitchen counter told her to rub her bare arms and neck and cheeks with it it gave off a strong herbal smell citronella plant he explained keeps the mosquitoes away you wont have to swat em anymore sachs picked up the cup she went outside looked at the rainwater barrel it was covered with a fine screen lifted it filled the cup and drank the water seemed sweet she listened to the creaks and zips of the insects or you and your friend that man in the wheelchair everybody was talking about you can help her go someplace where shed be safe the phrase echoed in her head the man in the wheelchair the man in the wheelchair she returned to the trailer set down the cup looked around the tiny living room garrett would you do me a favor i guess you trust me i guess go sit over there he looked at her for a moment then stood and walked to the old armchair she was nodding at sachs walked across the tiny room and picked up one of the rattan chairs in the corner she carried it to where the boy sat and placed it on the floor facing him garrett you remember what dr penny was telling you to do in jail about the empty chair talk to the chair he asked eyeing it uncertainly he nodded that game thats right i want you to do it again will you he hesitated wiped his hands on the legs of his pants stared at the chair for a moment finally he said i guess amelia sachs was thinking back to the interrogation room and the session with the psychologist from her vantage point sachs had watched the boy closely through the oneway mirror she remembered how the doctor had tried to get him to imagine that mary beth was in the chair but that while garrett hadnt wanted to say anything to her he did want to talk to somebodyshed seen a look in his face a longing disappointment and anger too she believed when the doctor turned him away from where he wanted to go oh rhyme i understand that you like hard cold evidence that we cant depend on those soft things on words and expressions and tears and the look in someones eyes as we sit across from them and listen to their stories but that doesnt mean those stories are always false i believe theres more to garrett hanlon than the evidence tells us look at the chair she said who do you want to imagine sitting there he shook his head i dont know she pushed the chair closer smiled to encourage him tell me its okay a girl somebody at school he shook his head once more tell me well i dont know maybe after a pause he blurted maybe my father sachs remembered with irritation the cold eyes and crude manners of hal babbage she supposed that garrett would have a lot to say to him just your father or both him and mrs babbage no no not him i mean my real father your real father garrett nodded he was agitated nervous clicking his nails frequently insects antennas show their moods looking at his troubled face sachs realized with concern that she had no idea what she was doing there were surely all sorts of things psychologists did to draw patients out to guide them to protect them when they practiced any type of therapy was there a chance that she would make garrett worse push him over a line so that he actually would do something violent and hurt himself or someone else nonetheless she was going to try it sachs nickname in the new york city police department was pd for the portables daughter the child of a beat patrolman and she definitely took after her old man his love of cars love of police work impatience with bullshit and especially his talent for streetcop psychology lincoln rhyme disparaged her being a people cop and warned that it would be her downfall he extolled her talent as a criminalist and though she was a talented forensic scientist in her heart she was just like her father for amelia sachs the best type of evidence was that found in the human heart garretts eyes strayed to the window where bugs thumped suicidally against the rusty screen what was your fathers name sachs asked stuart stu what did you call him dad mostly sir sometimes garrett smiled sadly if id done something wrong and thought i better be like on good behavior you two got along bettern most of my friends and their dads they got whipped some and their dads were always yelling at them you know whyd you miss that goal whys your room so messy why didnt you get your homework done but dad was okay to me until his voice bled out go on i dont know another shrug sachs persisted until what garrett silence say it i dont want to tell you its stupid well dont tell metell himyour dad she nodded toward the chair theres your father right there in front of you imagine it the boy edged forward staring at the chair almost fearfully theres stu hanlon sitting there talk to him for an instant there was such a look of longing in the boys eyes that sachs wanted to cry she knew they were close to something important and she was afraid hed balk tell me about him she said changing tack slightly tell me what he looked like what he wore after a pause the boy said he was tall and pretty thin he had dark hair and it stuck up right after hed get his hair cut he had to put this stuff on that smelled good to keep it down for a couple days afterward he always wore pretty nice clothes he didnt even have a pair of jeans i dont think he always wore shirts with you know collars on them and pants with cuffs sachs recalled noting when she searched his room that he had no jeans only cuffed slacks a faint smile bloomed on garretts face he used to drop a quarter down the side of his pants and try and catch it in his cuff and if he did then my sister or me could have it it was like this game we played on christmas hed bring home silver dollars for us and hed keep sliding them down his pants until we got them the silver dollars in the wasp jar sachs recalled did he have any hobbies sports he liked to read hed take us to bookstores a lot and he read to us a lot of history and travel books and stuff about nature oh and he fished almost every weekend well imagine that hes sitting there in the empty chair and hes wearing his nice slacks and a shirt with a collar and hes reading a book okay i guess he puts the book down no first hed like mark the place he was reading he had a ton of bookmarks he sort of collected them my sister and me got him one the christmas before the accident okay he marks his place and puts the book down hes looking at you now youve got a chance to say something to him what would you say he shrugged shook his head looked around the dim trailer nervously but sachs wasnt going to let it go knuckle time she said lets think about a specific thing youd like to talk to him about an incident something youre unhappy about was there anything like that but dad was okay to me until the boy was gripping his hands rubbing them together clicking his nails tell him garrett okay i guess there was something what well that night the night they died sachs felt a faint shudder knew they were probably going very hard places with this she thought for a moment about pulling back but it wasnt in amelia sachs nature to pull back and she didnt now what about that night you want to talk to your father about something that happened he nodded see they were in the car going to dinner it was wednesday every wednesday we went to bennigans i liked the chicken fingers id have the chicken fingers and fries and a coke and kaye my sisterd get onion rings and wed split the fries and the rings and sometimes we drew pictures on an empty plate with the squeeze bottle of ketchup his face was pale and drawn there was so much sorrow in his eyes sachs thought she fought down her own emotions what do you remember about that night it was outside the house in the driveway they were in the car dad and mom and my sister they were going to dinner and he swallowed what it was they were going to leave without me they were he nodded i was late id been in the woods in blackwater landing and id kinda lost track of time i ran like a halfmile or something but my father wouldnt let me in he mustve been mad because i was late i wanted to get in so bad it was really cold i remember i was shivering and they were shivering i remember there was frost on the windows but they wouldnt let me in maybe your father didnt see you because of the frost no he saw me i was right beside his side of the car i was banging on the window and he saw me but he didnt open the door he just kept frowning and shouting at me and i kept thinking hes mad at me and im cold and im not going to get my chicken fingers and french fries im not going to have dinner with my family tears ran down his cheeks sachs wanted to put her arm around the boys shoulders but she remained where she was go on nodding toward the chair talk to your father what do you want to say to him he looked at her but she pointed toward the chair finally garrett turned to it its so cold he said gasping its cold and i want to get in the car why wont he let me in the car no tell himimagine hes there sachs was thinking this is the same way rhyme urged her to imagine herself as the perp at crime scenes it was utterly harrowing and she now felt the boys fear all too clearly still she didnt let up tell him tell your father garrett looked at the old chair uneasily he leaned forward i sachs whispered go ahead garrett its okay i wont let anything happen to you tell him i just wanted to go to bennigans with you he said sobbing thats all like just to have dinner all of us i just wanted to go with you why wouldnt you let me in the car you saw me coming and you locked the door i wasnt that late then garrett grew angry you locked me out you were mad at me and it wasnt fair what i did being late it wasnt that bad i mustve done something else to make you mad what why didnt you want me to go with you tell me what i did his voice was choked come back and tell me come back i want to know what did i do tell me tell me tell me sobbing he jumped up and kicked the empty chair hard it sailed across the room and fell on its side he grabbed the chair and screaming in fury smashed it into the floor of the trailer sachs pushed back blinking in shock at the anger shed unleashed he slammed the chair down a dozen times until it was nothing but a shattered mass of wood and rattan finally garrett collapsed on the floor hugging himself sachs rose and put her arms around him as he sobbed and shook after five minutes the crying ended he stood up wiped his face on his sleeve garrett she began in a whisper but he shook his head im going outside he said then rose and pushed out the door she sat for a moment wondering what to do sachs was utterly exhausted but she didnt lie down on the mat hed left for her and try to sleep she shut the lantern off and pulled the cloth off the window then sat in the musty armchair she leaned forward smelling the pungent aroma of the citronella plant and watched the hunchedover silhouette of the boy sitting outside on an oak stump and gazing intently at the moving constellations of lightning bugs that filled the forest around him lincoln rhyme muttered i dont believe it hed just spoken with a furious lucy kerr and had learned that sachs had taken several shots at a deputy under the hobeth bridge i dont believe it he repeated in a whisper to thom the aide was a master of dealing with broken bodies and spirits broken because of broken bodies but this was a different matter far worse and the best he could do was offer its a mixup it has to be amelia wouldnt do that she wouldntrhyme muttered this time offering the denial to ben theres no way not even to scare them off he told himself that shed never shoot at a fellow officer even just to scare them yet he was also thinking about what desperate people did the crazy risks they took oh sachs why do you have to be so impulsive and stubborn why do you have to be so much like me bell was in the office across the hall rhyme could hear him as he spoke endearments over the phone he supposed that the sheriffs wife and family werent used to latenight absences lawenforcement in a town like tanners corner probably didnt require as many hours as the garrett hanlon case had taken ben kerr sat beside one of the microscopes his huge arms crossed over his chest he was gazing at the map unlike the sheriff he hadnt made any calls home and rhyme wondered if he had a wife or girlfriend or if the shy mans life was wholly consumed with science and the mysteries of the ocean the sheriff hung up he walked back into the lab you have any more ideas lincoln rhyme nodded at the evidence chart found at secondary crime scene mill brown paint on pants sundew plant clay peat moss fruit juice paper fibers stinkball bait sugar camphene alcohol kerosene yeast he reiterated what they knew about the house where mary beth was being kept theres a carolina bay on the way to or near the place half the marked passages in his insect books are about camouflage and the brown paint on his pantss the color of tree bark so the place is probably in or next to a forest the camphene lamps are from the s so the place is old probably victorian era but the rest of the trace isnt much help the yeast would be from the mill the paper fibers could be from anywhere the fruit juice and sugar from food or drinks garrett had with him i just cant the phone rang rhymes left ring finger twitched on the ecu and he answered the call hello he said into the speakerphone lincoln he recognized the soft exhausted voice of mel cooper what do you have mel i need some good news i hope its good that key you found weve been looking through sourcebooks and databases all night finally tracked it down what is it its to a trailer made by the mcpherson deluxe mobile home company the trailers were manufactured from through the early s companys out of business but according to the guide the serial number on the key youve got fits a trailer that was made in any description no pictures in the guide hell tell me does one live in these things in a trailer park or drive em around like a winnebago live in them id guess they measure eight by twenty not the sort of thing youd cruise around in anyway theyre not motorized you have to tow it thanks mel get some sleep rhyme shut the phone off what do you think jim any trailer parks around here the sheriff seemed doubtful therere a couple along route and but they arent even close to where garrett and amelia were headed and theyre crowded hard to hide out in a place like that should i send somebody to check them out how far seventy eighty miles no garrett probably found a trailer abandoned someplace in the woods and took it over rhyme glanced at the map thinking and its parked somewhere in a hundred square miles of wilderness wondering too had the boy gotten out of the handcuffs did he have sachs gun was she falling asleep just now her guard down garrett waiting for the moment when she slipped into unconsciousness hed rise crawl closer to her with a rock or a hornets nest the anxiety racing through him he stretched his head back heard a bone pop he froze worried about the excruciating contractures that occasionally racked the muscles that were still connected to extant nerves it seemed completely unfair that the same trauma that made most of your body numb also subjected the sensate part to agonizing tremors there was no pain this time but thom noticed the alarm on his bosss face the aide said lincoln thats it im taking your blood pressure and youre going to bed no argument all right thom all right only we have to make one phone call first look at what time it is whos awake now its not a matter of whos awake now rhyme said wearily its a matter of whos about to be awake midnight in the swamp the sounds of insects the fast shadows of bats an owl or two the icy light of the moon lucy and the other deputies hiked four miles over to route where a camper awaited bell had pulled strings and requisitioned the vehicle from fred fisher winnebagos steve farr had driven it over here to meet the search party and give them a place to stay for the night they stepped inside the cramped quarters jesse trey and ned hungrily ate the roast beef sandwiches that farr had brought lucy drank a bottle of water passed on the food farr and bell bless their hearts had also dug up clean uniforms for the searchers she called in and told jim bell that theyd tracked the pair to an aframe vacation house which had been broken into looked like theyd been watching tv you can believe that but it had been too dark to follow the trail and theyd decided to wait until dawn to resume the search lucy picked up the clean clothes and stepped inside the bathroom in the tiny shower stall she let the weak stream of water course over her body her hands started with her hair and face and neck and then as always tentatively washed her flat chest feeling the ridges of scar then grew more certain as they moved to her belly and thighs she wondered again why she had such an aversion to silicone or the reconstructive surgery that the doctor explained took fat from her thighs or butt and remade the breasts even nipples could be reconstructed or tattooed on because she told herself it was fake because it wasnt real and so why bother but then lucy thought look at that lincoln rhyme he was only a partial man his legs and arms were fake a wheelchair and an aide but thinking about him reminded her of amelia sachs and anger seared her again she pushed those thoughts aside dried herself and pulled on a tshirt thinking absently about the drawer of bras in the dresser in the guest room of her house and recalled that shed been meaning to throw them out for two years but for some reason never had then she put on her uniform blouse and slacks she stepped out of the bathroom jesse was hanging up the phone anything no he said theyre still working on the evidence jim and mr rhyme lucy shook her head at the food jesse offered her then sat down at the table pulled her service revolver out of its holster steve she asked farr the crewcut young man looked up from the newspaper he was reading lifted an eyebrow you bring what i asked for oh yeah he dug in the glove compartment and handed her a yellowandgreen box of remington bullets she ejected the roundpoint cartridges from her pistol and speedloaders and replaced them with the new bullets hollow points which have more stopping power and cause much more damage to soft tissue when they hit a human being jesse corn watched her closely but it was a moment before he spoke as she knew hed do amelias not dangerous he said in a low voice the words meant for her only lucy set the gun down and looked into his eyes jesse everybody said mary beth was at the ocean but turns out shes in the opposite direction everybody said garrett was just a stupid kid but hes smart as a snake ands conned us a halfdozen times we dont know anything anymore maybe garretts got a store of weapons someplace and has some plan or another to take us out when we walk into his trap but amelias with him she wouldnt let that happen amelias a damn traitor and we cant trust her an inch listen jesse i saw that look on your face when you saw she wasnt under the boat you were relieved i know you think you like her and youre hoping she likes you no no let me finish but she busted a killer outa jail and if youd been the one out there in the river instead of ned ameliad have shot at you just as fast he began to protest but the chill look in her eyes kept him quiet its easy to get infatuated with somebody like that lucy continued shes pretty and shes from someplace else someplace exotic but she doesnt understand life down here and she doesnt understand garrett you know him thats one sick boy and its just a fluke that hes not doing life right now i know garretts dangerous im not arguing there its amelia im thinking of well its us that im thinking of and everybody else in blackwater landing that boy could be planning on killing tomorrow or next week or next year if he gets away from us which he might just do thanks to her now i need to know if i can count on you if not you can go on home and well have jim send somebody else in your place jesse glanced at the box of shells then back to her you can lucy you can count on me good you better mean that cause at first light im tracking them down and bringing em both back i hope alive but i tell you thats become optional mary beth mcconnell sat alone in the cabin exhausted but afraid to sleep hearing noises everywhere shed given up on the couch she was afraid that if she remained there shed stretch out and fall asleep then wake to find the missionary and tom gazing at her through the window about to break in so she was perched at a diningroom chair which was about as comfortable as brick noises on the roof on the porch in the woods she didnt know what time it was she was afraid to even push the light button on her wristwatch to glimpse the face out of the crazy fear that the flash would somehow beckon to her attackers exhausted too tired even to wonder again why this had happened to her what she might have done to prevent it no good deed goes unpunished she stared out at the field in front of the cabin now completely black the window was like a frame around her fate whom would it show approaching through the field her killers or her rescuers she listened what was that noise a branch on bark or the rasp of a match what was that dot of light in the woods a firefly or a campfire that motion a deer goaded to run by the scent of bobcat or the missionary and his friend settling in around the fire to drink beer and eat food then prowl through the woods to come for her and satisfy their bodies in other ways mary beth mcconnell couldnt tell tonight as in so much of life she sensed only ambiguity you find relics of longdead settlers but you wonder if maybe your theory is completely wrong your father dies of cancer a long wasting death that the doctors say is inevitable but you think maybe it wasnt two men are out there in the woods planning to rape and kill you but maybe not maybe theyve given up maybe theyre passed out on moonshine or were scared off at the thought of the consequences deciding that their fat wives or callused hands are safer or easier than what they had planned with her spreadeagle at your place a sharp crack filled the night she jumped at the sound a gunshot it seemed to come from where shed seen the firelight a moment later there was a second shot closer breathing heavily in fear gripping the coup stick unable to look out the black window unable not to terrified that shed see toms pasty face appearing slowly in the frame grinning well be back the wind was up bending the trees the brush the grass she thought she heard a man laughing the sound soon lost in the hollow wind like the call of one of the manitou spirits of the weapemeocs she thought she heard a man calling get yourself ready get yourself ready but maybe not you hear shots rich culbeau asked harris tomel they sat around a dying campfire they were uneasy and not nearly as drunk as if thisd been a normal hunting trip not nearly as drunk as they wanted to be the shine just wasnt taking pistol tomel said large caliber ten millimeter or a automatic bullshit culbeau said you cant tell its an automatic or not can tomel lectured a revolvers louder because of the gap between the cylinder and the barrel logical bullshit culbeau repeated then asked how far humid air its night i make it four five miles tomel sighed i want this thing to be over with im sick of it i hear that culbeau said was easier in tanners corner getting complicated now damn bugs tomel said swatting a mosquito whatta you think somebodys shooting for this time of night its almost one raccoon in the garbage black bear in a tent man humping somebody elses wife culbeau nodded look seans asleep that man sleeps anytime anyplace he kicked through the embers to cool them hes on fucking medication he is i didnt know that thats why he sleeps anytime anyplace hes acting funny dontcha think tomel asked glancing at the skinny man as if he were a snoozing snake liked him better when you couldnt figure him out now hes all serious it scares the shit outa me holding that gun like its his dick and all youre right bout that tomel muttered then stared into the murky forest for several minutes he sighed then said hey you got the sixtwelve im getting eaten alive here and hand me that bottle of shine while youre at it amelia sachs opened her eyes at the sound of the pistol shot she looked into the bedroom of the trailer where garrett was asleep on the mattress he hadnt heard the noise another shot why was somebody shooting this late she wondered the shots reminded her of the incident on the river lucy and the others firing at the boat they thought sachs and garrett were under she pictured the geysers of water flying into the air from the stunning shotgun blasts she listened carefully but heard no more shots heard nothing other than the wind and the cicadas of course they live this totally weird life the nymphs dig into the ground and stay there for like twenty years before they hatch all those years in the ground just hiding before they come out and become adults but soon her mind was occupied once again with what shed been considering before the gunshots interrupted her thoughts amelia sachs had been thinking of an empty chair not dr pennys therapy technique or what garrett had told her about his father and that terrible night five years ago no she was thinking of a different chair lincoln rhymes red storm arrow wheelchair thats what they were doing down here in north carolina after all rhyme was risking everything his life what was left of his health his and sachs life together so that he could move closer to climbing out of that chair leaving it behind him empty and lying here in this foul trailer a felon alone in her own knuckle time amelia sachs finally admitted to herself what had troubled her so about rhymes insistence on the operation of course she was worried that hed die on the table or that the operation would make him worse or that it wouldnt work at all and hed be plunged into depression but those werent her main fears that wasnt why shed done everything she could to stop him from having the operation no no what scared her the most was that the operation would succeed oh rhyme dont you understand i dont want you to change i love you the way you are if you were like everyone else what would happen to us you say itll always be you and me sachs but the you and me is based on who we are now me and my bloody nails and my itchy need to move move move you and your damaged body and elegant mind that roams faster and further than i ever could in my stripped and rigged camaro that mind of yours that holds me tighter than the most passionate lover ever could and if you become normal again when youre your own arms and legs rhyme then why would you want me why would you need me id become just another portable a beat cop with some talent for forensics youll meet another one of the treacherous women whove derailed your life in the past another selfish wife another married lover and youll fade away from me the way lucy kerrs husband left after her surgery i want you the way you are she actually shuddered at how appallingly selfish this thought was yet she couldnt deny it stay in your chair rhyme i dont want it empty i want a life with you a life the way its always been i want children with you children wholl grow up to know you exactly the way you are amelia sachs found she was staring at the black ceiling she closed her eyes but it was an hour later before the sound of the wind and the cicadas their thoracic plates singing like monotonous violins finally seduced her to sleep sachs woke just after dawn to the droning noise which in her dream had been placid locusts but turned out to be her casio wristwatchs alarm she clicked it off her body was in agony an arthritics response to sleeping on a thin pad over a riveted metal floor but she felt oddly buoyant low sunlight streamed through the windows of the trailer and she took this as a good omen today they were going to find mary beth mcconnell and return to tanners corner with her shed confirm garretts story and jim bell and lucy kerr could start the search for the real killer the man in the tan overalls she watched garrett awaken in the bedroom and roll upright on the saggy mattress with his lengthy fingers he combed his mussed hair into place he looks just like any other teenager in the morning she thought gangly and cute and sleepy about to get dressed about to take the bus to school and see his friends to learn things in class to flirt with girls toss footballs watching him look around groggily for his shirt she noticed his skinny frame and worried about getting him some good food cereal milk fruit and washing his clothes making sure he took a shower this she thought is what it would be like to have children of your own not to borrow youngsters from friends for a few hours like her goddaughter amys girl but to be there every day when they wake up with their messy rooms and difficult adolescent attitudes to fix them meals to buy them clothes to argue with them to take care of them to be the hub of their lives morning she smiled he smiled back we gotta go he said gotta get to mary beth been away from her for too long shes got to be totally scared and thirsty sachs climbed unsteadily to her feet he glanced at his chest at the poison oak splotches and seemed embarrassed he pulled his shirt on quickly im going outside have to you know take care of business and im gonna leave a couple of empty hornets nests around might slow em up if they come this way garrett stepped outside but returned just a moment later he left a cup of water on the table beside her said shyly thiss for you he stepped out again she drank it down longing for a toothbrush and time for a shower maybe when they got to its hima mans voice called in a whisper sachs froze looked out the window she saw nothing but from a tall stand of bushes near the trailer the forced whisper continued ive got him in my sights ive got a clear shot the voice was familiar and she decided it sounded like culbeaus friend sean osarian the skinny one the redneck trio had found them they were going to kill the boy or torture him into telling where mary beth was so they could get the reward garrett hadnt heard the voice sachs could see him he was about thirty feet away setting an empty hornets nest on the trail she heard footsteps in the bushes pushing forward toward the clearing where the boy was she grabbed the smith wesson and stepped quietly outside she crouched motioning desperately to garrett he didnt see her the footsteps in the bushes grew closer garrett she whispered he turned saw sachs motioning for him to join her he frowned seeing the urgency in her eyes then he glanced to his left into the bushes and she saw terror blossom in his face he held his hands out a defensive gesture he cried dont hurt me dont hurt me dont hurt me sachs dropped into a crouch curled her finger around the trigger cocked the pistol and aimed toward the bushes it happened so quickly garrett falling to his belly in fear crying out dont dont amelia lifting her pistol twohanded combat stance pressure on the trigger waiting for a target to present the man bursting from the bushes into the clearing gun raised toward garrett just as deputy ned spoto turned the corner of the trailer right beside sachs blinked in surprise and leapt toward her arms outstretched startled sachs stumbled away from him her weapon fired bucking hard in her hand and thirty feet away beyond the faint cloud of smoke from the muzzle she saw the bullet from her gun strike the forehead of the man whod been in the bushes not sean osarian at all but jesse corn a black dot appeared above the young deputys eye and as his head jerked back a horrible pink cloud puffed out behind him without a sound he dropped straight to the ground sachs gasped staring at the body which twitched once and then lay completely still she was breathless she dropped to her knees the gun tumbling from her hand oh jesus ned muttered also staring in shock at the body before the deputy could recover and draw his gun garrett rushed him the boy snagged sachs pistol from the ground and pointed it at neds head then took the deputys weapon and flung it into the bushes lie down garrett raged at him on your face you killed him you killed him ned muttered now ned did as he was told tears running down his tanned cheeks jesse lucy kerrs voice called from nearby where are you whos shooting no no no sachs moaned watching an astonishing amount of blood pour from the dead deputys shattered skull garrett hanlon glanced at jesses body then past it toward the sound of approaching feet he put his arm around sachs we have to go when she didnt answer when she simply stared completely numb at the scene in front of her the end of the deputys life and the end of her own garrett helped her to her feet then took her hand and pulled her after him they vanished into the woods iv hornets nest what was happening now a frantic lincoln rhyme wondered an hour ago at fivethirty am hed finally gotten a call from a very putout drone in the real estate division of the north carolina department of taxation the man had been awakened at onethirty and given the assignment of tracking down delinquent taxes on any land on which a claimed residence was a mcpherson trailer rhyme had first checked to see if garretts parents had owned one and when he learned they hadnt reasoned that if the boy was using the place as a hideout it was abandoned and if it was abandoned the owner had defaulted on the taxes the assistant director told him thered been two such properties in the state in one case near the blue ridge to the west the land and trailer had been sold at a tax lien foreclosure to a couple who currently lived there the other on an acre in paquenoke county wasnt worth the time or money to foreclose on hed given rhyme the address an rfd route about a halfmile from the paquenoke river location c on the map rhyme had called lucy and the others and sent them there they were going to approach at first light and if garrett and amelia were inside surround them and talk them into surrendering the last rhyme had heard theyd spotted the trailer and were moving in slowly unhappy that his boss had gotten virtually no sleep thom sent ben out of the room and went through the morning ritual carefully the four bsbladder bowel brushing teeth and blood pressure its high lincoln thom muttered putting away the sphygmomanometer excessive blood pressure in a quad could lead to an attack of dysreflexia which in turn could result in a stroke but rhyme didnt pay any attention he was riding on pure energy he wanted desperately to find amelia he wanted rhyme looked up jim bell an alarmed expression on his face walked through the doorway ben kerr equally upset entered behind him what happened rhyme asked is she all right is amelia she killed jesse bell said in a whisper shot him in the head thom froze glanced at rhyme the sheriff continued he was about to arrest garrett she shot him they took off no its impossible rhyme whispered theres a mistake somebody else did it but bell was shaking his head no ned spoto was there he saw the whole thing im not saying she did it on purpose ned went for her and her gun went off but its still felony murder oh my god amelia secondgeneration cop the portables daughter and now shed killed one of her own the worst crime a police officer could commit thiss way past us now lincoln ive got to get the state involved wait jim rhyme said urgently please shes desperate now shes scared sos garrett you call in troopers a lot more peoplere going to get hurt theyll be gunning for them both well apparently they oughta be gunning for them bell spat back and looks like they shoulda been from the gitgo ill find them for you im close rhyme nodded toward the evidence chart and map i gave you one chance and look what happened ill find them and ill talk her into surrendering i know i can ill suddenly bell was jostled aside and a man rushed into the room it was mason germain you fucking son of a bitch he cried and made right for rhyme thom stepped in the way but the deputy flung aside the thin man he rolled to the floor mason grabbed rhyme by the shirt you fucking freak you come down here and play your little mason bell started forward but the deputy shoved him aside again play your little games with the evidence your little puzzles and now a good mans dead because of you rhyme smelled the mans potent aftershave as the deputy drew his fist back the criminalist cringed and turned his face away im going to kill you im going to but masons voice was choked off as a huge arm wrapped around his chest and he was lifted clean off the floor ben kerr carried the deputy away from rhyme kerr goddamn it let go of me mason gasped you asshole youre under arrest calm yourself down deputy the big man said slowly mason was reaching for his pistol but with his other hand ben clamped down hard on the mans wrist ben looked at bell who waited a moment then nodded ben released the deputy who stood back fury in his eyes he said to bell im going out there and im finding that woman and im you are not mason bell said you want to keep working in this department youll do what i tell you were going to handle it my way youre staying in the office here you understand son of a bitch jim she do you understand me yeah i fucking understand you he stormed out of the lab bell asked rhyme you all right rhyme nodded and you he glanced at thom im fine the aide adjusted rhymes shirt and despite the criminalists protest he took the blood pressure again the same too high but not critical the sheriff shook his head ive got to call jesses parents lord i dont want to do that he walked to the window and stared outside first ed now jesse what a nightmare this whole things been rhyme said please jim let me find them and give me a chance to talk to her if you dont its going to escalate you know that well end up with more people dead bell sighed glanced at the map theyve got a twentyminute lead you think you can find them yes rhyme answered i can find them that direction sean osarian said im positive rich culbeau was looking west where the young man was pointing toward where theyd heard the gunshot and the shouting fifteen minutes ago culbeau finished peeing against a pine tree and asked whats over that way swamp a few old houses said harris tomel who had hunted probably every square foot of paquenoke county not much else saw a gray wolf there a month ago the wolves had supposedly been extinct but were making a comeback no fooling culbeau said hed never seen one always wanted to you shoot it osarian asked you dont shoot em tomel said culbeau added theyre protected so and culbeau realized he didnt have an answer for that they waited a few minutes longer but there were no more gunshots no more shouts may as well keep going culbeau said pointing toward where the shot had come from may as well said osarian as he took a hit from a bottle of water hot again today tomel offered looking at the low disk of radiant sun its hot every day culbeau muttered he picked up his gun and started along the path his army of two trudging along behind him thunk mary beths eyes shot open pulling her from a deep unwanted sleep thunk hey mary beth a mans voice called cheerfully like an adult speaking to a child in her grogginess she thought its my father whats he doing back from the hospital hes in no shape to chop wood ill have to get him back to bed has he had his medicine wait she sat up dizzy head throbbing shed fallen asleep in the diningroom chair thunk wait its not my father hes dead its jim bell thunk mareeeeeeee bayeth she jumped as the leering face looked in the window it was tom another slam on the door as the missionarys ax bit into the wood tom leaned inside squinting into the gloom where are you she stared at him paralyzed tom continued oh hey there you are my youre prettiern i remembered he held up his wrist showed her thick bandages i lost a pint of blood thanks to you i think its only fair i get a little back thunk i have to tell you honey he said i fell asleep last night thinking about feeling up your titties yesterday thank you much for that sweet thought thunk with this blow the ax broke through the door tom disappeared from the window and joined his friend keep going boy he called encouragingly youre on a roll thunk his worry now was that shed hurt herself since hed known amelia sachs lincoln rhyme had watched her hands disappear into her scalp and return bloody hed watched her worry nails with teeth and skin with nails hed seen her drive at a hundred fifty miles per hour he didnt know exactly what pushed her but he knew there was something within her that made amelia sachs live on the edge now that this had happened now that shed killed the anxieties might push her over the line after the accident that left rhyme a broken man terry dobyns the nypd psychologist had explained to him that yes he would feel like killing himself but it wasnt depression that would motivate him to act depression depleted your energy the main cause of suicide was a deadly fusion of hopelessness anxiety and panic which would be exactly what amelia sachs hunted betrayed by her own nature would be feeling right now find her was his only thought find her fast but where was she the answer to that question still eluded him he looked at the chart again there was no evidence from the trailer lucy and the other deputies had searched it fast too fast of course they were under the spell of hunt lust even immobilized rhyme often felt this and the deputies were desperate to get on the trail of the enemy whod killed their friend the only clues he had to mary beths location to where garrett and sachs were now headed were right in front of him but they were as enigmatic as any set of clues hed ever analyzed found at the secondary crime scene mill brown paint on pants sundew plant clay peat moss fruit juice paper fibers stinkball bait sugar camphene alcohol kerosene we need more evidence he raged to himself but we dont have any more goddamn evidence when rhyme was mired smack in the denial stage of grief after the accident he had tried to summon superhuman willpower to make his body move he had recalled the stories of the people who lifted cars off children or had run at impossible speeds to find help in emergencies but hed finally accepted that those types of strength were no longer available to him but he did have one type of strength left mental strength think all you have is your mind and the evidence thats in front of you the evidence isnt going to change so change the way youre thinking all right lets start over he went through the chart once more the trailer key had been identified the yeast would be from the mill the sugar from food or juice the camphene from an old lamp the paint from the building where she was being held the kerosene from the boat the alcohol could be from anything the dirt in the boys cuffs it exhibited no particularly unique characteristics and was wait the dirt rhyme recalled that he and ben had run the densitygradient test of the dirt sampled from in the shoes and carfloor mats of county workers yesterday morning hed ordered thom to photograph each tube and note which employee it had come from on the back of the polaroid ben what run the dirt you found in garretts cuffs at the mill through the densitygradient unit after the dirt had settled in the tube the young man said got the results compare it with the pictures of the samples you did yesterday morning good good the young zoologist nodded impressed with the idea he flipped through the polaroids paused ive got a match he said ones almost identical the zoologist was no longer hesitant to give opinions rhyme was pleased to note and he wasnt hedging either whose shoes was it from ben looked at the notation on the back of the polaroid frank heller he works in the department of public works is he in yet ill find out ben vanished he returned a few minutes later accompanied by a heavyset man in a white shortsleeved shirt he eyed rhyme uncertainly youre the fellow from yesterday making us clean off our shoes he laughed but the sound was uneasy frank we need your help again rhyme explained some of the dirt on your shoes matches dirt we found on the suspects clothes the boy who kidnapped those girls frank muttered redfaced and looking completely guilty thats right which means he might this is pretty farfetched but he might have the girl maybe two or three miles from where you live could you point out on the map exactly where that is he said its not like im a suspect or anything am i no frank not at all cause i got peoplell vouch for me im with the wife every night we watch tv jeopardy and wheel of fortune like clockwork then wwf sometimes her brother comes over i mean he owes me money but hed back me up even if he didnt thats okay ben reassured him we just need to know where you live on that map there thatd be here he stepped to the wall and touched a spot location d it was north of the paquenoke north of the trailer where jesse had been killed there were a number of small roads in the area but no towns marked whats the area like around you forests and fields mostly you know anywhere that somebody might hide a kidnap victim frank seemed to be considering this question earnestly i dont no rhyme can i ask you a question on top of the ones you already asked thats right i suppose you can you know about carolina bays sure everybody does meteors made em long time ago when the dinosaurs got themselves killed are there any near you oh you bet there are which was something that rhyme was hoping the man would say frank continued must be close to a hundred of em which was something he was hoping he wouldnt head back eyes closed reviewing the evidence charts in his mind jim bell and mason germain were back in the evidence room along with thom and ben but lincoln rhyme was paying them no mind he was in his own world an orderly place of science and evidence and logic a place where he needed no mobility a place where his feelings for amelia and what shed done were mercifully forbidden entry he could see the evidence in his mind as clearly as if he were staring at the notations on the chalkboard in fact he was able to see them better with his eyes shut paint sugar yeast dirt camphene paint dirt sugar yeast yeast a thought slipped into his mind fished away come back come back come back yes he snagged it rhymes eyes snapped open he looked into the empty corner of the room bell followed his eyes what is it lincoln you have a coffee machine here coffee thom asked not pleased no caffeine not with your blood pressure the way no i dont want a goddamn cup of coffee i want a coffee filter filter ill dig one up bell disappeared and returned a moment later give it to ben rhyme ordered then said to the zoologist see if the paper fibers from the filter match the ones we found on garretts clothes at the mill ben rubbed some fibers off the filter onto a slide he gazed through the eyepieces of the comparison microscope adjusted the focus and then moved the stages so the samples were next to each other in the splitscreen viewfinder the colorsre a little different lincoln but the structure and size of the fibersre pretty much the same good rhyme said his eyes now on the tshirt with the stain on it he said to ben the juice the fruit juice on the shirt taste it again is it a little sour tart ben did maybe a little hard to tell rhymes eyes strayed to the map imagining that lucy and the others were closing in on sachs somewhere in that green wilderness eager to shoot or that garrett had sachs gun and might be turning it on her or that she was holding her gun to her own scalp squeezing the trigger jim he said i need you to get something for me for a control sample okay where he fished his keys from his pocket many images revolved in lucy kerrs thoughts jesse corn on his first day in the sheriffs department standardissue shoes polished perfectly but his socks mismatched hed gotten dressed before light to make sure he wasnt late jesse corn hunkered down behind a cruiser shoulder touching hers while barton snell his mind on fire from pcp took potshots at the deputies it was jesses easygoing banter that got the big man to put down his winchester jesse corn proudly driving his new cherryred ford pickup over to the county building on his day off and giving some kids a ride in the bed up and down the parking lot they shouted wheeee in unison as he rolled over the speed bumps these thoughts and a dozen others stayed with her now as she ned and trey pushed through a large oak forest jim bell had told them to wait at the trailer and hed send steve farr frank and mason to take over the pursuit he wanted her and the other two deputies to return to the office but they hadnt even bothered to vote on the matter as reverently as possible theyd moved jesses body into the trailer covered it with a sheet then shed told jim that they were going after the fugitives and that nothing on gods earth was going to stop them garrett and amelia were fleeing fast and were making no effort to cover their tracks they moved along a path that bordered marshland the ground was soft and their footprints were clearly visible lucy remembered something that amelia had told lincoln rhyme about the crime scene at blackwater landing as the redhead had gazed at the footprints there billy stails weight had been on the toes which meant that hed been running toward garrett to rescue mary beth lucy now noticed this same thing about the prints of the two people they pursued they were sprinting and so lucy said to her two fellow deputies lets jog and despite the heat and their exhaustion they trotted forward together they continued this way for a mile until the ground grew drier and they could no longer see the footprints then the trail ended in a large grassy clearing and they had no idea where their prey had gone damn lucy muttered gasping for breath and furious that theyd lost the trail goddamn they ringed the clearing studying every foot of the ground but could find no path or any other clue as to which way garrett and amelia sachs had gone what do we do ned asked call in and wait she muttered she leaned against a tree caught the bottled water that trey tossed to her and drank it down recalling jesse corn shyly showing off a glistening silver pistol he was planning on using in his nra competition matches jesse corn accompanying his parents to first baptist church on locust street the images kept looping through her mind they were painful for her to picture and stoked her anger but lucy made no effort to force them away when she found amelia sachs she wanted her fury to be unrelenting with a squeak the door to the cabin eased open a few inches mary beth tom sang you come on out now come out and play he and the missionary whispered to each other then tom spoke again come on come on honey make it easy on yourself we wont hurt you we were just pulling your leg yesterday she stood upright against the wall behind the front door didnt say a word gripped the coup stick in both hands the door eased open farther the hinges giving another squeal a shadow fell onto the floor tom stepped inside cautious where is she the missionary whispered from the porch theres a cellar tom said shes down there ill bet well get her and lets go i dont like it here tom took another step inside he was holding a long skinning knife mary beth knew about the philosophy of indian warfare and one of the rules is that if the parleys fail and war is inevitable you dont banter or threaten you attack with all your force the point of battle isnt to talk your enemy into submission or explain or chide its to annihilate them and so she stepped calmly out from behind the door screamed like a manitou spirit and swung the club with both hands as tom spun around eyes wide in terror the missionary cried look out but tom didnt have a chance the coup stick caught him solidly in front of his ear shattering his jaw and closing down half his throat he dropped the knife and grabbed his neck falling to his knees choking he crawled back outside hehf hehf meh he gasped but there was no help forthcoming the missionary simply reached down and pulled him off the porch by his collar letting him fall to the ground holding his shattered face as mary beth watched from the window you asshole the missionary muttered to his friend and then drew a pistol from his back pocket mary beth swung the door shut took her place behind it again wiping her sweating hands and getting a better grip on the stick she heard the double click of a gun cocking mary beth i got a gun here and you probably figured out under the circumstances i got no problem using it just come on out you dont ill shoot inside and ill probably hit you she crouched down against the wall behind the door waiting for the gunshot but he never fired it was a trick he kicked the door hard and it swung into her stunning her for an instant knocking her down but as he started inside she kicked the door closed just as hard as hed shoved it open he wasnt expecting any more resistance and the heavy wooden slab caught him on the shoulder knocking him off balance mary beth stepped toward him and swung the coup stick at the only target on him she could reach his elbow but he dropped to the floor just as the rock would have struck him and she missed the momentum of her fierce swing pulled the stick from her sweaty hands and it skidded along the floor no time to get it just run mary beth jumped past the missionary before he could turn and fire and she sprinted out the door at last free of this hellhole at last she ran to the left heading back toward the path that her captor had brought her down two days ago the one that led past a big carolina bay at the corner of the cabin she turned toward the pond and ran right into the arms of garrett hanlon no she cried no the boy was wildeyed he held a gun howd you get out how he grabbed her wrist let me go she tried to pull away from him but his grip was like steel there was a grimfaced woman with him pretty with long red hair her clothes like garretts were filthy the woman was silent her eyes dull she didnt seem the least bit startled by the girls sudden appearance she looked drugged goddamn the missionarys voice called you fucking bitch he turned the corner and found garrett aiming the pistol at his face the boy screamed whore you whatd you do to my house whatd you do to mary beth she attacked us look at my friend look at throw that away garrett raged nodding at the mans pistol throw it away or ill kill you i will ill blow your fucking head off the missionary looked at the boys face and the gun garrett cocked his pistol jesus the man pitched the revolver into the grass now get outa here move the missionary backed away then helped tom to his feet and they staggered off toward the trees garrett walked toward the front door of the cabin pulling mary beth after him into the house we have to get in theyre after us we cant let them see us well hide in the cellar look what they did to the locks they broke my door no garrett mary beth said in a rasping voice im not going back in there but he said nothing and pulled her into the cabin the silent redhead walked unsteadily inside garrett shoved the door closed looking at the shattered wood the broken locks dismay on his face no he cried seeing shards of glass on the floor from the jar that had held the dinosaur beetle mary beth appalled that the boy seemed the most upset that one of his bugs had escaped strode up to garrett and slapped him hard on the face he blinked in surprise and staggered backward you prick she screamed they couldve killed me the boy was flustered im sorry his voice cracked i didnt know about them i thought there was nobody around here i didnt mean to leave you this long i got arrested he shoved splinters under the door to wedge it shut arrested mary beth asked then whatre you doing here finally the redhead spoke in a mumbling voice she said i got him out of jail so we could find you and bring you back and you could back up his story about the man in the overalls what man mary beth asked confused at blackwater landing the man in the tan overalls the one who killed billy stail but she shook her head garrett killed billy he hit him with a shovel i saw him it happened right in front of me then he kidnapped me mary beth had never seen such an expression on another human being complete shock and dismay the redhead started to turn toward garrett but then something caught her eye the rows of farmer john canned fruits and vegetables she walked slowly toward the table as if she were sleepwalking and picked one up stared at the picture on the label a cheerful blond farmer wearing tan overalls and a white shirt you made it up she whispered to garrett holding the can up there was no man you lied to me garrett stepped forward fast as a grasshopper and pulled a pair of handcuffs off the redheads belt he ratcheted them onto her wrists im sorry amelia he said but if id told you the truth you never wouldve got me out it was the only way i had to get back here i had to get back to mary beth found at the secondary crime scene mill brown paint on pants sundew plant clay peat moss fruit juice paper fibers stinkball bait sugar camphene alcohol kerosene yeast obsessively lincoln rhymes eyes scanned the evidence chart top to bottom bottom to top then again why the hell was the damn chromatograph taking so long he wondered jim bell and mason germain sat nearby both silent lucy had called in a few minutes before to say that theyd lost the trail and were waiting north of the trailer at location c the chromatograph rumbled and everyone in the room remained still waiting for the results silence for long minutes finally broken by ben kerrs voice he spoke to rhyme in a soft voice they used to call me it you know what youre probably thinking rhyme looked over at him big ben like the clock in england you were probably wondering i wasnt in school you mean a nod high school i hit sixthree and twofifty when i was sixteen i got made fun of a lot big ben other names too so i never felt real comfortable with the way i looked think maybe that was why i acted kinda funny seeing you at first kids gave you a tough time did they rhyme asked both acknowledging and deflecting the apology they sure did until i took up junior varsity wrestling and pinned darryl tennison in threepointtwo seconds and it took him a lot longer than that to get his wind back i skipped pe class a lot rhyme told him i forged excuses from my doctor my parents pretty good ones i will say and snuck into the science lab you did that twice a week at least and you did experiments read a lot played around with the equipment a few times i played around with sonja metzger thom and ben laughed but sonja his first girlfriend put him in mind of amelia sachs and he didnt like where those thoughts were headed okay ben said here we go the computer screen had burst to life with the results of the control sample rhyme had asked jim bell to procure the big man nodded heres what weve got solution of fiftyfive percent alcohol water lot of minerals well water rhyme said most likely the zoologist continued then therere traces of formaldehyde phenol fructose dextrose cellulose thats good enough for me rhyme announced thinking the fish may still be out of water but its just grown lungs he announced to bell and mason i made a mistake a big one i saw the yeast and i assumed itd come from the mill not the place where garrett really has mary beth but why would a mill have supplies of yeast youd only find those in a bakery or he lifted his eyebrow to bell someplace theyre brewing that he nodded at the bottle that sat on the table the liquid inside was what rhyme had just asked bell to collect from the basement of the sheriffs department it was proof moonshine from one of the juice bottles that rhyme had seen a deputy clear away when hed taken over the evidence room and turned it into a lab this is what ben had just sampled in the chromatograph sugar and yeast the criminalist continued thosere ingredients in liquor and the cellulose in that batch of moonshine rhyme continued looking at the computer screen is probably from the paper fibers i assume when you make moonshine you have to filter it yep bell confirmed and most shiners use offtheshelf coffee filters just like the fiber we found on garretts clothes and the dextrose and fructose complex sugars found in fruit thats from the fruit juice left over in the jar ben said it was tart like cranberry juice and you told me jim thats the most popular container for moonshine right ocean spray so rhyme summarized garretts holding mary beth in a moonshiners cabin presumably one thats been abandoned since the raid what raid mason asked well its like the trailer rhyme replied shortly hating as always to have to explain the obvious if garretts using the place to hide mary beth then it has to be abandoned and whats the only reason anybodyd abandon a working still department of revenue busted it bell said right rhyme said get on the phone and find out the location of any stills thatve been raided in the past couple of years itll be a nineteenthcentury building in a stand of trees and painted brown though it may not have been when it got raided its four or five miles from where frank heller lives and itll be on a carolina bay or youll have to go around a bay to get there from the paquo bell left to call the revenue department thats pretty good lincoln ben said even mason germain seemed impressed a moment later bell hurried back into the room got it he examined the sheet of paper in his hand then began tracing directions on the map ending at location b he circled a spot right here head of investigations at revenue said it was a big operation they raided it a year ago and busted up the still one of his agents checked out the place a couple three months ago and saw that somebodyd painted it brown so he looked it over good to see if it was being used again but he said it was empty so he didnt pay any more mind oh and its about twenty yards from a goodsized carolina bay is there any way to get a car in there rhyme asked has to be bell said all stillsre near roads to bring the supplies in and get the finished shine out rhyme nodded and said firmly i need an hour alone with her to talk her out i know i can do it its risky lincoln i want that hour rhyme said holding bell s eye finally bell said okay but if garrett gets away this time its gonna be a fullout manhunt understood you think my van can make it there bell said roads arent great but ill get you there thom said firmly whatever it takes ill get you there five minutes after rhyme had wheeled out of the county building mason germain watched jim bell return to his office he waited a moment and making sure no one saw him he stepped into the corridor and headed toward the front door of the building there were dozens of phones in the county building mason could have used to make his call but instead he pushed outside into the heat and walked quickly across the quadrangle to a bank of pay phones on the sidewalk he fished into his pockets and dug out some coins he looked around and when he saw he was alone he dropped them in looked at a number on a slip of paper and punched in the digits farmer john farmer john enjoy it fresh from farmer john farmer john farmer john enjoy it fresh from farmer john staring at the row of cans in front of her a dozen overallclad farmers staring back with mocking smiles amelia sachs mind was clogged with this inane jingle the anthem for her foolishness which had cost jesse corn his life and had ruined hers as well she was only vaguely aware of the cabin where she now sat a prisoner of the boy shed risked her life to save and of the angry exchange now going on between garrett and mary beth no all she could see was that tiny black dot appearing in jesses forehead all she could hear was the singsong jingle farmer john farmer john then suddenly sachs understood something occasionally lincoln rhyme would mentally go away he might converse but his words were superficial he might smile but it was false he might appear to listen but he wasnt hearing a word at moments like that she knew he was considering dying hed be thinking about finding someone from an assistedsuicide group like the lethe society to help him or even as some severely disabled people had done actually hiring a hit man rhyme whod contributed to the jailing of a number of oc organized crime mobsters obviously had some connections there in fact there were probably a few whod gladly do the job for free but until this moment with her own life now as shattered as rhymes no more shattered shed always thought he was wrong in that thinking now though she understood how he felt no garrett called leaping up and cocking his ear toward the window you have to listen all the time otherwise they can sneak up on you then sachs heard it too a car was slowly approaching theyve found us the boy cried gripping the pistol he ran to the window stared out he seemed confused whats that he whispered a door slammed then there was a long pause and she heard sachs its me a faint smile crossed her face no one else in the universe could have found this place except lincoln rhyme sachs are you there no garrett whispered dont say anything ignoring him sachs rose and walked to a broken window there in front of the cabin resting unevenly on a dirt driveway was the black rollx van rhyme in the storm arrow had maneuvered close to the cabin as far as he could get until a hillock of dirt near the porch stopped him thom stood beside him hello rhyme she said quiet the boy whispered harshly can i talk to you the criminalist called what was the point she wondered still she said yes she walked to the door and said to garrett open it im going outside no its a trick the boy said theyll attack open the door garrett she said firmly her eyes boring into his he looked around the room then bent down and pulled the wedges out from the doorjamb sachs opened the door the cuffs on her stiff wrists jingling like sleigh bells he did it rhyme she said sitting down on the porch steps in front of him he killed billy i got it wrong deadwrong the criminalist closed his eyes what horror she must be feeling he thought he looked at her carefully her pale face her stony eyes he asked is mary beth okay shes fine scared but fine she saw him do it sachs nodded there wasnt any man in overalls he asked no garrett made that up so id break him out he had it all planned from the beginning leading us off to the outer banks he had a boat hidden supplies hed planned what to do if the deputies got close even had a safe house that trailer you found the key right that i found in the wasp jar thats how you tracked us down it was the key rhyme confirmed i shouldve thought of that we shouldve stayed someplace else he saw she was cuffed and noticed garrett in the window peering out angrily holding a pistol this was now a hostage situation garrett wasnt going to come out willingly it was time to call the fbi rhyme had a friend arthur potter now retired but still the best hostage negotiator the bureau ever had he lived in washington dc and could be here in a few hours he turned back to sachs and jesse corn she shook her head i didnt know it was him rhyme i thought it was one of culbeaus friends a deputy jumped me and my weapon went off but it was my fault i acquired an unidentified target with an unsafetied weapon i broke rule number one ill get you the best lawyer in the country it doesnt matter it matters sachs it matters well get something worked out she shook her head theres nothing to work out rhyme its felony murder openandshut case then she was looking up past him frowning she stood whats suddenly a womans voice called hold it right there amelia youre under arrest rhyme tried to turn but couldnt rotate his head far enough he puffed into the controller and backed up in a semicircle he saw lucy and two other deputies crouching as they ran from the woods their weapons were in their hands and they kept their eyes on the windows of the cabin the two men used trees for cover but lucy walked boldly toward rhyme thom and sachs her pistol leveled at sachs chest how had the search party found the cabin had they heard the van had lucy picked up garretts trail again or had bell reneged on his deal and told them lucy walked right up to sachs and without a moments pause hit her hard in the face her fist connecting with the policewomans chin sachs gave a faint wheeze at the pain and stepped back she said nothing no rhyme cried thom stepped forward but lucy grabbed sachs by the arm is mary beth in there yes blood trickled from her chin is she all right a nod eyes on the cabin window lucy asked does he have your weapon yes jesus lucy called to the other deputies ned trey hes inside and hes armed then she snapped at rhyme id suggest you get under cover and she pulled sachs roughly back behind the van on the side opposite the cabin rhyme followed the women thom holding the chair for stability as it crossed the uneven ground lucy turned to sachs grabbed her by the arms he did it didnt he mary beth told you right garrett killed billy sachs looked down at the ground finally she said yes im sorry i sorry doesnt mean a damn thing to me or anybody else least of all to jesse corn does garrett have any other weapons in there i dont know i didnt see any lucy turned back to the cabin shouted garrett can you hear me its lucy kerr i want you to put that gun down and walk outside with your hands on your head you do that now okay the only response was the door slamming shut a faint pounding filled the clearing as garrett hammered or wedged the door shut lucy pulled out her cell phone and started to make a call hey deputy a mans voice interrupted you need some help lucy turned oh no she muttered rhyme too glanced toward the voice a tall ponytailed man carrying a hunting rifle was trooping through the grass toward them culbeau she snapped i got a situation here and i cant deal with you too just go on get out of here her eyes noticed something in the field there was another man walking slowly toward the cabin he carried a black army rifle and squinted thoughtfully as he surveyed the field and cabin is that sean lucy asked culbeau said yeah and harris tomels over there tomel was walking up to the tall africanamerican deputy they were chatting casually as if they knew each other culbeau persisted if the boys in the cabin you might need some help getting him out what can we do this is police business rich the three of you clear on outa here now trey she called to the black deputy get em out the third deputy ned walked toward lucy and culbeau rich he called theres no reward anymore forget about it and the shot from culbeaus powerful rifle poked a hole in the front of neds chest and the impact flung him several feet onto his back trey stared at harris tomel only ten feet away each man looked about as shocked as the other and neither moved for a moment then there was a whoop like a hyenas cry from sean osarian who lifted his soldier gun and shot trey three times in the back cackling with laughter he vanished into the field no lucy screamed and lifted her pistol toward culbeau but by the time she fired the men had gone for cover in the tall grass surrounding the cabin rhyme felt the instinctive urge to drop to the ground but of course remained upright in the storm arrow wheelchair more bullets slammed into the van where sachs and lucy now facedown on the grass had been standing a moment before thom was on his knees trying to work the heavy wheelchair out of the depression of soft earth where it was lodged lincoln sachs cried im okay move get to the other side of the van under cover lucy said but garrett can target us from there sachs snapped back but hes not the one whos goddamn shooting another shotgun blast missed them by a foot and the pellets rattled along the porch thom put the wheelchair in neutral and muscled it toward the cabin side of the van stay low rhyme said to the aide who ignored a shot that zipped past them and shattered a side window of the vehicle lucy and sachs followed the two men to the shadowy area between the cabin and the van why the hellre they doing this lucy cried she fired several shots sending osarian and tomel scrabbling for cover rhyme couldnt see culbeau but knew that the big man was directly in front of them somewhere the rifle that hed been carrying was highpowered and fitted with a large telescopic sight take the cuffs off and give me the gun sachs shouted give it to her rhyme said shes a better shot than you no goddamn way the deputy shook her head her expression one of astonishment at this suggestion more bullets slapped the metal of the van dug out chunks of wood from the porch theyve got fucking rifles sachs raged youre no match for them give me the gun lucy rested her head against the side of the van and stared in shock at the slain deputies lying in the grass whats going on she muttered crying whats happening their cover the van wasnt going to last much longer it protected them from culbeau and his rifle but the other two were flanking them in a few minutes theyd set up a crossfire lucy fired twice more into the grass where a shotgun blast had erupted a moment before dont waste your ammunition sachs ordered wait till you have a clear shot otherwise shut the hell up lucy raged she patted her pockets lost the goddamn phone lincoln thom said im taking you out of the chair youre too much of a target rhyme nodded the aide undid the harness got his arms around rhymes chest and pulled him out laid him on the ground rhyme tried to lift his head to see what was going on but a contracture a merciless cramp gripped his neck muscles and he had to lower his head to the grass until the pain passed hed never felt as stabbed by his helplessness as at this moment more shots closer and more insane laughter from osarian hey knife lady where are you lucy muttered theyre almost in position ammo sachs asked ive got three left in the chamber one speedloader loaded six yeah a shot slammed into the back of the storm arrow and knocked it on its side a cloud of dust rose up around it lucy fired at osarian but his giggling and the staccato response from the colt told them that shed missed the rifle fire also told them that in only a minute or two theyd be completely flanked theyd die here shot to death trapped in this dim valley between the shattered van and the cabin rhyme wondered what he would feel when the bullets tore into his body no pain of course not even any pressure in his numb flesh he glanced at sachs who was looking at him with a hopeless expression on her face you and me sachs then he glanced at the front of the cabin look he called lucy and sachs followed his eyes garrett had opened the front door sachs said lets get inside are you crazy lucy called garretts with them theyre all together no rhyme said hes had a chance to shoot from the window he didnt two more shots very close the bushes rustled nearby lucy lifted the pistol dont waste it sachs called but lucy rose and fired two fast shots at the sound the rock one of the men had thrown to shake the bushes and trick her into presenting a target rolled into view lucy jumped aside just as tomels shotgun blast meant for her back streaked past puncturing the side of the van shit the deputy cried ejecting the empty cartridges and reloading with the speedloader inside rhyme said now lucy nodded okay rhyme said firemans carry this was a bad position to carry a quad in it put stress on parts of the body that werent used to stress but it was faster and would expose thom to the gunshots for the least amount of time rhyme was also thinking that his own body would protect thoms no thom said do it thom no argument lucy said ill cover you the three of you go together ready sachs nodded thom lifted rhyme cradling him like a child in his strong arms thom rhyme protested quiet lincoln the aide snapped were doing this my way go lucy called rhymes hearing was stunned by several loud gunshots everything blurred as they ran up the few stairs into the cabin another several bullets cracked into the wood of the cabin as they pushed inside a moment later lucy rolled into the room after them and slammed the door shut thom set rhyme gently on a couch rhyme had a glimpse of a terrified young woman sitting in a chair staring at him mary beth mcconnell garrett hanlon with his red blotched face eyes wide with fear sat manically clicking the fingernails of one hand and holding a pistol awkwardly in the other as lucy aimed the gun right in his face give me the weapon she cried now now he blinked and immediately handed the gun to her she put it in her belt and called out something rhyme didnt hear what he was staring at the boys bewildered and frightened eyes a childs eyes and he thought i understand why you had to do it sachs why you believed him why you had to save him i understand he said everybody okay fine sachs said lucy nodded actually thom said almost apologetically not really he lifted his hand away from his trim belly revealing the bloody exit wound then the aide went down on his knees hard ripping the slacks that hed ironed with such care just that morning search the wound for severe hemorrhage stop the bleeding if possible check the patient for shock amelia sachs trained in the basic nypd firstaid course for patrol officers bent over thom examining the wound the aide lay on his back conscious but pale sweating fiercely she clamped one hand over the wound get these cuffs off me she cried i cant take care of him this way no lucy said jesus sachs muttered and examined thoms stomach as best she could with the restraints on how are you thom rhyme blurted talk to us it feels numb its feeling its funny his eyes rolled back under the lids and he passed out a crash above their heads a bullet tore through the wall followed by a thud of a shotgun blast hitting the door garrett handed sachs a wad of napkins she pressed them against the rip in thoms belly she slapped him gently on the face he gave no response is he alive rhyme asked hopelessly hes breathing shallow but hes breathing exit wound isnt too bad but i dont know what kind of damage there is inside lucy looked out the window fast ducked whyre they doing this rhyme said jim said they were into moonshine maybe they had their eye on this place and didnt want it found or maybe theres a drug lab nearby there were two men earlier they tried to break in mary beth told them they said they were killing marijuana fields but i guess they were growing it they might all be working together wheres bell lucy asked and mason hell be here in a half hour rhyme said lucy shook her head in dismay at this information then looked again out the window she stiffened as it seemed she sighted a target she lifted the pistol aimed quickly too quickly no let me sachs cried but lucy fired twice her grimace told them she had missed she squinted seans just found a can a red can what is that garrett gas the boy huddled on the floor frozen in panic garrett talk to me he turned toward her the red can whats in it its like kerosene for the boat lucy muttered hell theyre going to burn us out shit garrett cried he rolled to his knees staring at lucy eyes frantic sachs alone among them it seemed knew what was coming no garrett dont the boy ignored her and flung the door open and half running half crawling skittered along the porch bullets cracked into the wood following him sachs had no idea if hed been hit then there was silence the men moved closer to the cabin with the kerosene sachs looked around the room filled with dust from the impact of the bullets she saw mary beth hugging herself crying lucy her eyes filled with the devils own hatred checking her pistol thom slowly bleeding to death lincoln rhyme on his back breathing hard you and me in a steady voice sachs said to lucy weve got to go out there weve got to stop them the two of us therere three of them theyve got rifles theyre going to set fire to the place and either burn us alive or shoot us when we run outside we dont have any choice take the cuffs off sachs held out her wrists you have to how can i trust you lucy whispered you ambushed us at the river sachs asked ambushed whatre you talking about lucy scowled what am i talking about you used that boat as a lure and shot at ned when he went out to get it bullshit you thought we were under the boat and shot at us only after you then lucys voice faded and she nodded knowingly sachs said to the deputy it was them culbeau and the others one of them shot first to scare you and slow you up probably and we thought it was you sachs held her wrists out we dont have any choice the deputy looked at sachs carefully then slowly reached into her pocket and found her cuff key she undid the chrome bracelets sachs rubbed her wrists whats the ammunition situation ive got four left ive got five in mine sachs said taking her longbarreled smith wesson from lucy and checking the cylinder sachs looked down at thom mary beth stepped forward ill take care of him one thing sachs said hes gay hes been tested but doesnt matter the girl responded ill be careful go on sachs rhyme said i later rhyme no time for that now sachs eased to the door looked out quickly eyes taking in the topography of the field what would make good cover and shooting positions her hands free again gripping a hefty gun in her palm she felt confident once more this was her world guns and speed she couldnt think about lincoln rhyme and his operation about jesse corns death about garrett hanlons betrayal about what awaited her if they got out of this terrible situation when you move they cant getcha she said to lucy we go out the door you go left behind the van but dont stop no matter what keep moving till you get to the grass im going right for that tree over there we get into the tall grass and stay down move forward toward the forest flank them theyll see us go out the door theyre supposed to see us we want them to know therere two of us out there somewhere in the grass itll keep em edgy and looking over their shoulders dont shoot unless you have a clear nomiss target got that do you ive got it sachs gripped the doorknob with her left hand her eyes met lucys one of them osarian with tomel beside him was lugging the kerosene can toward the cabin not paying attention to the front door so that when the two women charged outside splitting up and sprinting for cover neither of them got his weapon up in time for a clear shot culbeau back a ways so he could cover the front and sides of the cabin must not have been expecting anybody to run either because by the time his deer rifle boomed both sachs and lucy were rolling into the tall grass surrounding the cabin osarian and tomel disappeared into the grass too and culbeau shouted you let em get out what the fuck you doing he fired one more shot toward sachs she hugged the earth and when she looked again culbeau too had dropped into the grass three deadly snakes out there in front of them and no clue where they might be culbeau called go right one of the others responded where she thought it was tomel i think wait then silence sachs crawled toward where shed seen tomel and osarian a moment ago she could just make out a bit of red and she steered in that direction the hot breeze pushed the grass aside and she saw it was the kerosene can she moved a few feet closer and when the wind cooperated again aimed low and fired a bullet squarely into the bottom of the can it shivered under the impact and bled clear liquid shit one of the men called and she heard a rustle of grass as she supposed he fled from the can though it didnt ignite more rustling footsteps but coming from where then sachs saw a flash of light about fifty feet into the field it was near where culbeau had been and she realized it would be the scope or the receiver of his big gun she lifted her head cautiously and caught lucys eye pointed to herself and then toward the flash the deputy nodded then gestured around to the flank sachs nodded but as lucy started through the grass on the left side of the cabin running in a crouch osarian rose and laughing again madly began firing with his colt sharp cracks filled the field lucy was momentarily a clear target and it was only because osarian was an impatient marksman that he missed the deputy dove prone as the dirt kicked up around her then rose and fired one shot at him a near hit and the small man dropped to cover giving a whoop and calling nice try baby sachs started forward again toward culbeaus snipers nest she heard several other shots the pops of a revolver then the staccato cracks of the soldier rifle then the stunning detonation of the shotgun she was worried that theyd hit lucy but a moment later she heard the womans voice call amelia hes coming at you the pounding of feet in the grass a pause rustling who and where was he she felt panicked looking around dizzily then silence a mans voice calling something indistinct the footsteps receded the wind parted the grass again and sachs saw the glint of culbeaus telescopic sight he was nearly in front of her fifty feet away on a slight rise a good spot for him to shoot from he could pop up out of the grass with his big gun and cover the entire field she crawled faster convinced that he was sighting through the powerful scope at lucy or into the cabin and targeting rhyme or mary beth through the window faster faster she climbed to her feet and started to run in a crouch culbeau was still thirtyfive feet away but sean osarian it turned out was much closer than that as sachs found out when she sprinted into the clearing and tripped over him he gasped as she rolled past him and fell onto her back she smelled liquor and sweat his eyes were manic he looked as disconnected as a schizophrenic there was an immeasurable beat and sachs lifted her pistol as he swung the colt toward her she kicked backward into the grass and they fired simultaneously she felt the muzzle blast of the three shots as he emptied the clip all the long rounds missing her single shot missed too when she rolled prone and looked for a target he was leaping through the grass howling dont miss the opportunity she told herself and risked a shot from culbeau as she rose from the grass and aimed at osarian but before she could fire lucy kerr stood and shot him once as he ran directly toward her the mans head lifted and he touched his chest another laugh then he spiraled down into the grass the look on lucys face was shock and sachs wondered if this had been her first kill in the line of duty then the deputy dropped into the grass a moment later several shotgun blasts chewed up the vegetation where shed been standing sachs continued on toward culbeau moving very fast now it was likely that he knew lucys position and when she stood again hed have a clear shot at her twenty feet ten the glint from the scope flashed more brightly and sachs ducked cringing waiting for his shot but apparently the big man hadnt seen her there was no shot and she continued on her belly easing around to the right to flank him sweating the arthritis pinching her joints hard five feet ready it was a bad shooting situation because he was on a hill in order to acquire a clear target shed have to roll into the clearing on culbeaus right and stand thered be no cover if she didnt cap his ass immediately hed have a clear shot at her and even if she did hit him tomel would have several long seconds to hit her with the scattergun but there was nothing to be done when you move smittie up pressure on the trigger a deep breath they cant getcha now she leapt forward and rolled into the clearing she went up on one knee aiming the gun and gave a gasp of dismay culbeaus gun was a pipe from an old still and the scope was a part of a bottle resting on top exactly the same trick she and garrett had used at the vacation house on the paquenoke suckered the grass rustled nearby a footstep amelia sachs dropped to the ground like a moth the footsteps were getting closer to the cabin powerful footsteps first through brush then on dirt then on the wooden steps leading up to the cabin moving slowly to rhyme they seemed more leisurely than cautious which meant they were confident too and therefore dangerous lincoln rhyme struggled to lift his head from the couch but couldnt see who was approaching a creak of floorboards and rich culbeau holding a long rifle looked inside rhyme felt another jolt of panic was sachs all right had one of the dozens of shots hed heard struck her was she lying somewhere injured in the dusty field or dead culbeau looked at rhyme and thom and concluded they werent a threat still standing in the doorway he asked rhyme wheres mary beth rhyme held the mans eyes and said i dont know she ran outside to get help five minutes ago culbeau glanced around the room then his eyes settled on the root cellar door rhyme said quickly whyre you doing this whatre you after ran outside did she i didnt see her do that culbeau stepped farther into the cabin his eyes on the root cellar door then he nodded behind him toward the field they shouldntve left you here alone that was their mistake he was studying rhymes body what happened to you i was hurt in an accident youre that fellow from new york everybody was talking bout youre the one figured out she was here you really cant move no culbeau gave a faint laugh of curiosity as if hed caught a kind of fish hed never known existed rhymes eyes slipped to the cellar door then back to culbeau the big man said you sure got yourself into a mess here more than you bargained for rhyme said nothing in response and finally culbeau started forward aiming his gun onehanded at the cellar door mary beth left did she she ran out where are you going rhyme asked culbeau said shes down there aint she he pulled the door open fast and fired worked the bolt fired again three times more then he peered into the smoky darkness reloading it was then that mary beth mcconnell brandishing her primitive club stepped out from behind the front door where shed been waiting squinting with determination she swung the weapon hard it slammed into the side of culbeaus head ripping part of his ear the rifle fell from his hands and down the stairs into the darkness of the cellar but he wasnt badly hurt and lashed out with a huge fist striking mary beth squarely in the chest she gasped and dropped to the floor the wind knocked out of her she lay on her side keening culbeau touched his ear and examined the blood then he looked down at the young woman from a scabbard on his belt he took a folding knife and opened it with a click he gripped her brunette hair pulled it up exposing her white throat she grabbed his wrist and tried to hold it back but his arms were huge and the dark blade moved steadily toward her skin stop a voice from the doorway commanded garrett hanlon stood just inside the cabin he was holding a large gray rock in his hand he walked close to culbeau leave her alone and get the fuck out of here culbeau released mary beths hair her head dropped to the floor the big man stepped back he touched his ear again and winced hey boy whore you to be cussing at me go on get out culbeau laughed coldly whyd you come back here i got close to a hundred pounds of weight on you and i got a buck knife all you gots that rock well come on over here lets mix it up get it over with garrett clicked his fingernails twice he crouched like a wrestler walked forward slowly his face showed eerie determination he pretended to throw the rock several times and culbeau dodged backed up then the big man laughed sizing up his adversary and probably concluding that the boy wasnt much of a threat he lunged forward and swung the knife toward garretts narrow belly the boy jumped back fast and the blade missed but garrett had misjudged the distance and hit the wall hard he dropped to his knees stunned culbeau wiped his hand on his pants and gripped the knife again matteroffactly surveying garrett with no emotion as if he were about to dress a deer he stepped toward the boy then there was a blur of motion from the floor mary beth still lying on the floor grabbed the club and swung it into culbeaus ankle he cried out as it connected and turned toward her lifting the knife but garrett lunged forward and pushed the man hard on the shoulder culbeau was off balance and he slid on his knees down the cellar stairs he caught himself halfway down you little shit he growled rhyme saw culbeau grope in the dark cellar stairway for his rifle garrett hes going for the gun the boy just walked slowly to the cellar and lifted the rock but he didnt throw it what was he doing rhyme wondered he watched garrett pull a wad of cloth out of a hole in the end he looked down at culbeau said its not a rock and as the first few yellow jackets flew out of the hole he flung the nest into culbeaus face and slammed the root cellar door shut he hooked the clasp on the lock and stood back two bullets snapped through the wood of the cellar door and disappeared through the ceiling but there were no more shots rhyme thought culbeau would have fired more than twice but then he also thought the screams from the basement would last longer than they did harris tomel knew it was time to get the hell out back to tanners corner osarian was dead okay no loss there and culbeau had gone down to the cabin to take care of the rest of them so it was tomels job to find lucy but he didnt mind he was still stung with shame that hed clenched when hed faced down trey williams and it had been that psycho little shit osarian whod saved his life well he wasnt going to freeze again then beside a tree some distance away he saw a flash of tan he looked yeah there through the crook of a tree he could just make out lucy kerrs tan uniform blouse holding the twothousanddollar shotgun he moved a little closer it wasnt a great shot there wasnt much target presenting just part of her chest visible through the crook of the tree a hard shot with a rifle but doable with the shotgun he set the choke on the end of the muzzle so that the pellets would scatter wider and hed have a better chance of hitting her he stood fast dropped the bead sight right on the front of her blouse and squeezed the trigger a huge kick then he squinted to see if hed hit his target oh christ not again the blouse was floating in the air launched by the impact of the pellets shed hung it on the tree to lure him into giving away his position hold it right there harris lucys voice called behind him its over with that was good he said you fooled me he turned to face her holding the browning at waist level hidden in the grass the shotgun pointed in her direction she was in a white tshirt drop your gun she ordered i did already he said he didnt move let me see your hands in the air now harris last warning look lucy the grass was four feet high hed drop down fire to take out her knees then finish her off from close range itd be a risk though she could still get off a shot or two then he noticed something a look in her eyes a look of uncertainty and it seemed to him that she held her gun too threateningly she was bluffing youre out of ammo tomel said smiling there was a pause and the expression on her face confirmed it he lifted the shotgun with both hands and aimed it at her she gazed back hopelessly but im not came a voice nearby the redhead he looked her over and his instinct told him shes a woman shell hesitate i can get her first he swung toward her the pistol in her hands bucked and the last thing tomel felt was an itchy tap on the side of his head lucy kerr saw mary beth stagger onto the porch and call out that culbeau was dead and that rhyme and garrett were all right amelia sachs nodded then walked toward sean osarians body lucy turned her own attention to harris tomels she bent down and closed her shaking hands around the browning shotgun she thought that while she should be horrified to be prying this elegant weapon from a dead mans hands in fact all she thought about was the gun itself she wondered if it was still loaded she answered that question by racking the gun losing one shell but making sure that another was chambered fifty feet away sachs was bending down over osarians body as she searched it keeping her pistol pointed at the corpse lucy wondered why she was bothering then decided wryly that it must be standard procedure she found her blouse and put it back on it was torn apart by the shotgun pellets but she was selfconscious about her body in the tight tshirt lucy stood by the tree breathing heavily in the heat and watching sachs back simple fury at the betrayals in her life the betrayal by her body by her husband by god and now by amelia sachs she glanced behind her where harris tomel lay it was a straight line of sight from where hed been standing to amelias back the scenario was plausible tomel had been hiding in the grass he rose shot sachs in the back with his shotgun lucy then grabbed sachs gun and killed tomel nobodyd know different except lucy herself and maybe jesse corns spirit lucy lifted the shotgun which felt weightless as a larkspur blossom in her hands pressing the smooth fragrant stock against her cheek reminding her of the way shed pressed her face against the chrome guard of the hospital bed after her mastectomy she sighted down the smooth barrel at the womans black tshirt resting the sight on the womans spine shed die painlessly and fast as fast as jesse corn had died this was simply trading a guilty life for an innocent one dear lord give me one clear shot at my judas lucy looked around no witnesses her finger curled around the trigger tightened squinted held the brass dot of the bead sight rocksteady thanks to arms strengthened by years of gardening years of managing a house and a life on her own aiming at the exact center of amelia sachs back the hot breeze whistled through the grass around her she thought about buddy about her surgeon about her house and her garden lucy lowered the gun she racked the weapon until it was empty and padded butt resting on her hip muzzle skyward she carried it back to the van in front of the cabin she set it on the ground and found her cell phone then called the state police the medevac chopper was the first to arrive and the medics quickly bundled thom up and flew him off to the medical center one stayed to look after lincoln rhyme whose blood pressure was edging critical when the troopers themselves showed up in a second helicopter a few minutes later it was amelia sachs they arrested first and left hogtied hands behind her lying in the hot dirt outside the cabin while they went inside to arrest garrett hanlon and read him his rights thom would survive the doctor in the emergency medicine department of the university medical center in avery had said laconically the bullet it came and went missed the important stuff though the aide would be off duty for a month or two ben kerr had volunteered to cut class and stay around tanners corner for a few days to assist rhyme the big man had grumbled you dont really deserve my help lincoln i mean hell you never even pick up after yourself still not quite comfortable with crip jokes he glanced quickly at rhyme to see if this type of banter was within the rules the criminalists sour grimace was a reverse affirmation that it was but rhyme added that as much as he appreciated the offer the care and feeding of a quad is a fulltime and tricky job largely thankless too if the patient is lincoln rhyme and so dr cheryl weaver was arranging for a professional caregiver from the medical center to help rhyme but hang around ben he said i still might need you most aides dont last more than a few days the case against amelia sachs was bad ballistics tests had proved that the bullet that killed jesse corn had come from her gun and though ned spoto was dead lucy kerr had given a statement describing what ned had told her about the incident bryan mcguire had already announced that he was going for the death penalty goodnatured jesse corn had been a popular figure around town and since hed died trying to arrest the insect boy there was considerable outcry for making this a capital case jim bell and the state police had looked into why culbeau and his friends would attack rhyme and the deputies an investigator from raleigh had found tens of thousands of dollars in cash hidden in their houses more than moonshine money the detective had said then echoed mary beths thought that cabin mustve been near a marijuana farm those three were probably working it with the men who attacked mary beth garrett mustve stumbled on their operation now a day after the terrible events at the shiners cabin rhyme sat in the storm arrow drivable despite the stigmata of a bullet hole in the improvised lab waiting for the new aide to arrive morose he was brooding about sachs fate when a shadow appeared in the doorway he looked up and saw mary beth mcconnell she stepped into the room mr rhyme he noted how pretty she was what confident eyes she had what a ready smile he understood how garrett could have become ensnared by her hows your head nodding at the bandage on her temple ill have a pretty spectacular scar wont be wearing my hair pulled back too much i dont think but no serious damage like everyone else rhyme had been relieved to learn that garrett hadnt in fact raped mary beth hed been telling the truth about the bloody tissue garrett had startled her in the root cellar of the cabin and shed stood quickly hitting her head on a low beam hed been visibly aroused true but that was due only to a sixteenyearolds hormones and garrett hadnt touched her other than to carry her carefully upstairs clean the wound and bandage it hed apologized profusely that shed been hurt the girl now said to rhyme i just wanted to say thank you i dont know what i wouldve done if it hadnt been for you im sorry about your friend that policewoman but if it wasnt for her id be dead now im sure of it those men were going to well you can figure that out thank her for me i will rhyme told her would you mind answering something what i know you gave a statement to jim bell but i only know what happened at blackwater landing from the evidence and some of that wasnt clear could you tell me sure i was down by the river dusting off some of the relics id found and i looked up and there was garrett i was upset i didnt want to be bothered whenever he saw me he just came right up and started talking like we were best friends that morning he was agitated he was saying things like you shouldntve come here by yourself its dangerous people die in blackwater landing that sort of thing he was freaking me out i told him to leave me alone i had work to do he grabbed my hand and tried to make me leave then billy stail comes out of the woods and he goes you son of a bitch or something and he starts to hit garrett with a shovel but he got it away from billy and killed him then he grabbed me again and made me get into this boat and brought me to the cabin how long had garrett been stalking you mary beth laughed stalking no no youve been talking to my mother ill bet i was downtown about six months ago and some of the kids from his school were picking on him i scared them off that made me his girlfriend i guess he followed me around a lot but that was all admired me from afar that sort of thing i was sure he was harmless her smile faded until the other day mary beth glanced at her watch i should go but i wanted to ask you the other reason i came by if you dont need them anymore for evidence would it be okay if i took the rest of the bones rhyme whose eyes were now gazing out his window as thoughts of amelia sachs slipped back into his mind turned slowly to mary beth what bones he asked at blackwater landing where garrett kidnapped me rhyme shook his head what do you mean mary beths face furrowed with concern the bones those were the relics i found i was digging up the rest of them when garrett kidnapped me theyre very important you dont mean theyre missing nobody recovered any bones at the crime scene rhyme said they werent in the evidence report she shook her head no no they cant be gone what kind of bones i found the remains of some of the lost colonists of roanoke from the late fifteen hundreds rhymes knowledge of history was pretty much limited to new york city im not too familiar with that though when she explained about the settlers on roanoke island and their disappearance he nodded i do remember something from school why do you think it was their remains the bones were really old and decayed and they werent in an algonquin burial site or a colonial graveyard they were just dumped in the ground without any markings that was typical of what the warriors did with the bodies of their enemies here she opened her backpack id already packed up a few of them before garrett took me off she lifted several of them out wrapped in saran wrap blackened and decomposed rhyme recognized a radius a portion of a scapula a hipbone and several inches of femur there were a dozen more she said this is one of the biggest finds in us archaeological history theyre very valuable i have to find them rhyme stared at the radius one of the two forearm bones after a moment he looked up could you go up the hallway there to the sheriffs department ask for lucy kerr and have her come down here for a minute is this about the bones she asked it might be it had been an expression of amelia sachs fathers when you move they cant getcha the expression meant many things but most of all it was a statement of their shared philosophy father and daughter both of them were admirers of fast cars lovers of police work on the street fearful of closed spaces and lives that were going nowhere but now they had got her got her for good and her precious cars her precious life as a policewoman her life with lincoln rhyme her future with children all that was destroyed sachs in her cell in the lockup had been ostracized the deputies who brought her food and coffee said nothing to her just stared coldly rhyme was having a lawyer flown down from new york but like most police officers sachs knew as much about criminal law as most attorneys she knew that whatever horsetrading went on between the hired gun from manhattan and the paquenoke county da her life as shed lived it was over with her heart was as numb as lincoln rhymes body on the floor an insect of some kind made a diligent trek from one wall to the other what was its mission to eat to mate to find shelter if all the people on earth disappeared tomorrow the worldd keep going just fine but if the insects all went away then lifed be over with way fast like one generation the plantsd die then the animals and the earthd turn into this big rock again the door to the main office swung open a deputy she didnt recognize stood there youve got a call he opened the cell door shackled her and led her to a small metal table on which sat a phone it would be her mother she supposed rhyme was going to call the woman and give her the news or maybe it was her best friend in new york amy but when she picked up the receiver the thick chains clinking she heard lincoln rhymes voice how is it in there sachs cool its all right she muttered that lawyerll be here tonight hes good hes been doing criminal law for twenty years he got off a suspect in a burglary i made a case against anybody does that you know they have to be good rhyme come on why even bother im an outsider who broke a murderer out of jail and killed one of the local cops it doesnt get any more hopeless than that well talk about your case later ive got to ask you something else you spent a couple of days with garrett did you talk about anything sure we did what i dont know insects the woods the swamp why was he asking her these things i dont remember i need you to remember i need you to tell me everything he said why bother rhyme she repeated come on sachs humor an old crip will you lincoln rhyme was alone in the impromptu lab gazing at the evidence

blackwater landing and meandered west there was a peak in the stiff paper of the map a wrinkle that made you itch to smooth it thats been my life for the past few years lincoln rhyme thought itches that cant be scratched maybe soon ill be able to do that after dr weaver cuts and stitches and fills me up with her magic potions and youthful shark maybe then ill be able to run my hand over maps like this flatten out a little crinkle an unnecessary gesture pointless really but what a victory it would be footsteps sounded boots rhyme deduced from the sound with hard leather heels from the interval between the steps it had to be a tall man he hoped it would be jim bell and it was breathing carefully into the sipandpuff controller rhyme turned away from the wall lincoln the sheriff asked whats up nathan said it was urgent come on in close the door but first is anybody in the hall bell gave a faint smile at this intrigue and looked empty rhyme reflected that the mans cousin roland would have tacked on a southernism of some sort quiet as a church on payday was one that hed heard the northern bell use from time to time the sheriff swung the door shut then walked to the table leaned against it crossed his arms rhyme turned slightly and continued to study the map of the area our map doesnt go far enough north and east to show the dismal swamp canal does it the canal no it doesnt rhyme asked you know much about it not really bell said deferentially hed known rhyme for only a short while but mustve sensed when to play straight man ive been doing a little research rhyme said nodding at the phone the dismal swamp canals part of the intracoastal waterway you know you can take a boat all the way from norfolk virginia down to miami and not have to sail on open sea sure everybody in carolina knows about the intracoastal ive never been on it im not much of a boater i got seasick watching titanic took twelve years to dig the canal its twentytwo miles long dug completely by hand amazing dont you think relax jim thiss going someplace i promise you look at that line up there the one between tanners corner and the paquenoke river g to g on the map you mean our canal the blackwater canal right now a boat could sail up that to the paquo then to the great dismal and the approaching footsteps werent half as loud as bell s had been with the door being shut and there was little warning before it swung open rhyme stopped speaking mason germain stood in the doorway he glanced at rhyme then at his boss and said wondered where youd got to jim we got to make a call to elizabeth city captain dexter has some questions bout what happened at the shiners cabin just having a chat with lincoln we were talking about but rhyme interrupted him quickly say mason i wonder if you could give us a few minutes alone here mason glanced from one to the other he nodded slowly theyre in a mind to talk to you pretty soon jim he left before bell could respond is he gone rhyme asked once again bell glanced down the corridor then nodded whats this all about lincoln could you check out the window make sure masons left oh and id close that door again bell did then he walked to the window and looked out yeah hes headed up the street why all this he lifted his hands to complete the thought how well do you know mason as good as i know mosta my deputies why because he murdered garrett hanlons family whatbell started to smile but the expression faded fast mason mason rhyme said but why on earth because henry davett paid him to hold up bell said youre a couple steps past me i cant prove it yet but im sure henry whats his involvement rhyme said it all has to do with the blackwater canal he fell into his lecturing mode eyes on the map now the point of digging the canals in the eighteenth century was having dependable transport because the roads were so bad but as the roads and railroads got better shippers stopped using the waterways whered you find all this out historical society in raleigh talked to a charming lady julie devere according to her blackwater canal was closed just after the civil war wasnt used for a hundred thirty years until henry davett started running barges on it again bell nodded that was about five years ago rhyme continued let me ask you ever wonder why davett started using it the sheriff shook his head i remember some of us were a little worried kidsd try to swim out to a barge and get hurt and drown but none of em ever did and we never thought any more about it but now you mention it i dont know why hed use the canal hes got trucks coming and going all the time norfolk s nothing to get to by truck rhyme nodded up at the evidence chart the answers right up there that one bit of trace i never did find a source for camphene the stuff in the lanterns rhyme shook his head grimaced no i made a mistake there true camphene was used in lanterns but its also used in something else it can be processed to make toxaphene whats that one of the most dangerous pesticides there is it was used mostly in the south until it was banned in the eighties by the epa for most uses rhyme shook his head angrily i assumed that because toxaphene was illegal there was no point in considering pesticides as the source for the camphene and that it had to be from old lanterns except we never found any old lanterns my mind got into a rut and it wouldnt get out no old lamps then i should have gone down the list and started looking for insecticide and when i did this morning i found the source of the camphene bell nodded fascinated which was where everywhererhyme said i had lucy take samples of dirt and water from around tanners corner theres toxaphene all over the place the water the land i shouldve listened to what sachs told me the other day when she was searching for garrett she saw huge patches of barren land she thought it was acid rain but it wasnt toxaphene did that the highest concentrations are for a couple of miles around davetts factory blackwater landing and the canal hes been manufacturing asphalt and tar paper as a cover for making toxaphene but its banned i thought you said i called an fbi agent friend of mine and he called the epa its not completely banned farmers can use it in emergencies but thats not how davetts making his millions this agent at the epa explained something called the circle of poison dont like the sound of that you shouldnt toxaphene is banned here but the ban in the us is only on useit can be made here and sold to foreign countries and they can use it its legal in most third world and latin american countries thats the circle those countries spray food with pesticides and send it back into the us the fda only inspects a small percentage of imported fruits and vegetables so there are plenty of people in the us still poisoned even though its banned bell gave a cynical laugh and davett cant ship it on the roads because of all the counties and towns that wont let any toxic shipments go through em and the icc logs on his trucksd show what the cargo is not to mention the public relations problem if word got out what he was doing exactly rhyme said nodding so he reopened the canal to send the toxaphene through the intracoastal waterway to norfolk where its loaded onto foreign ships only there was a problem when the canal closed in the eighteen hundreds the property around it was sold privately people whose houses butted up against the canal had the right to control who used it bell said so davett paid them to lease their portion of the canal he nodded with sudden understanding and he mustve paid a lot of money look at how big those houses are in blackwater landing and think about those nice trucks and mercedeses and lexuses peoplere driving around here but whats this about mason and garretts family garretts fathers land was on the canal but he wouldnt sell his usage rights so davett or somebody in his company hired mason to convince garretts father to sell and when he wouldnt mason picked up some local trash to help him kill the family culbeau tomel and osarian then id guess that davett bribed the executor of the will to sell the property to him but garretts folks died in an accident a car accident i saw the report myself was mason the officer who handled the report i dont remember but he couldve been bell admitted he looked at rhyme with an admiring smile how on earth dyou figure this out oh it was easy because theres no frost in july not in north carolina anyway frost i talked to amelia garrett told her that the night his family was killed the car was frosty and his parents and sister were shivering but the accident happened in july i remembered seeing the article in the file the picture of garrett and his family he was in a tshirt and the picture was of them at a fourth of july party the story said the photo was taken a week before his parents were killed then what was the boy talking about frost shivering mason and culbeau used some of davetts toxaphene to kill the family i talked to my doctor over at the medical center she said that in extreme cases of neurotoxic poisoning the body spasms thats the shivering garrett saw the frost was probably fumes or residue of the chemical in the car if he saw it why didnt he tell anybody i described the boy to the doctor and she said it sounds like he got poisoned too that night just enough to give him mcs multiple chemical sensitivity memory loss brain damage severe reaction to other chemicals in the air and water remember the welts on his skin sure garrett thinks its poison oak but it isnt the doctor told me that skin eruptions are a classic symptom of mcs breaking out when youre exposed to trace amounts of substances that wouldnt affect anybody else even soap or perfumell make your skin erupt its making sense bell said then frowning he added but if you dont have any hard evidence then all weve got is speculation oh i should mention rhyme couldnt resist a faint smile modesty was never a quality that he wore well ive got some hard evidence i found the bodies of garretts family at the albemarle manor hotel a block away from the paquenoke county lockup mason germain didnt wait for the elevator but climbed the stairs covered with threadbare tan carpet he found room and knocked sopen came the voice mason pushed the door open slowly revealing a pink room bathed in orange afternoon sunlight it was painfully hot inside he couldnt imagine that the occupant of the room liked it this way so he assumed that the man sitting at the table was either too lazy to turn on the airconditioner or too stupid to figure out how it worked which made mason all the more suspicious of him the africanamerican lean and with particularly dark skin wore a wrinkled black suit which looked completely out of place in tanners corner draw attention to yourself why dont you mason thought contemptuously malcolm goddamn x youd be germain the man asked yeah the mans feet were on the chair across from him and when he withdrew his hand from under a copy of the charlotte observer his long fingers were holding a long automatic pistol that answers one of my questions mason said whether you got a gun or not whats the other the man in the suit asked whether you know how to use it the man said nothing but carefully marked his place in a newspaper story with a stubby pencil he looked like a thirdgrader struggling with the alphabet mason studied him again not saying a word then felt an infuriating trickle of sweat running down his face without asking the man if it was all right mason walked to the bathroom snagged a towel and wiped his face with it dropped it on the bathroom floor the man gave a laugh as irritating as the bead of sweat had been and said im gettin the distinct impression you dont much like my kind no i guess i dont mason answered but if you know what youre doing what i like and what i dont arent important thats completely right the black man said coolly so talk to me i dont want to be here any longer than i have to mason said heres the way its shaking out rhymes talking to jim bell right now over in the county building and that amelia sachs shes in the lockup up the street where should we go first without hesitating mason said the woman then thats what well do the man said as if it were his idea he slipped the gun away placed the newspaper on the dresser and with a politeness that mason believed was more mockery than anything else said after yourself and gestured toward the door the bodies of the hanlons jim bell asked rhyme where are they over there rhyme said nodding to a pile of the bones that had been in mary beths backpack thosere what mary beth found at blackwater landing the criminalist said she thought they were the bones of the survivors of the lost colony but i had to break the news to her that theyre not that old they looked decayed but thats just because they were partially burned ive done a lot of work in forensic anthropology and i knew right away theyve been in the ground only about five years which is just how long ago garretts folks were killed theyre the bones of a man in his late thirties a woman about the same age whod borne children and a girl about ten that describes garretts family perfectly bell looked at them i dont get it garretts familys property was right across route from the river in blackwater landing mason and culbeau poisoned the family then burned and buried the bodies and pushed their car into the water davett bribed the coroner to fake the death report and paid off somebody at the funeral home to pretend to cremate the remains the gravesre empty i guarantee mary beth mustve mentioned finding the bones to somebody and word got back to mason he paid billy stail to go to blackwater landing to kill her and steal the evidence the bones what billy except that garrett happened to be there keeping an eye on mary beth he was right you know blackwater landing is a dangerous place people did die there those other cases in the last few years only it wasnt garrett who killed them it was mason and culbeau they were murdered because theyd gotten sick from the toxaphene and started asking questions about why everybody in town knew about the insect boy so mason or culbeau killed that one girl meg blanchard with the hornets nest to make it look like he was the killer the others they hit over the head and pitched into the canal to drown people who didnt question getting sick like mary beths father and lucy kerr they didnt bother with but garretts fingerprints were on the shovel the murder weapon ah the shovel rhyme mused something very interesting about that shovel i stumbled again there were only two sets of fingerprints on it right billys and garretts but where were mary beths rhyme asked bell s eyes narrowed he nodded right there were none of hers because it wasnt her shovel mason gave it to billy to take to blackwater landing after wiping his own prints off it of course i asked mary beth about it she said that billy came out of the bushes carrying it mason figured it would be the perfect murder weapon because as an archaeologist mary bethd probably have a shovel with her well billy gets to blackwater landing and sees garrett with her he figures hell kill the insect boy too but garrett got the shovel away and hit billy he thought he killed him but he didnt garrett didnt kill billy no no no he only hit billy once or twice knocked him out but didnt hurt him that seriously then garrett took mary beth away with him to the moonshiners cabin mason was the first on the scene he admitted that thats right he took the call kind of a coincidence that he was nearby dont you think rhyme asked i guess i didnt think about it at the time mason found billy he picked up the shovel wearing latex evidence gloves and beat the boy until he died how do you know that because of the position of the latex prints i had ben reexamine the handle of the shovel an hour ago with an alternative light source mason held the shovel like a baseball bat thats not how somebody would pick up evidence at a crime scene and he adjusted his grip a number of times to get better leverage when sachs was at the crime scene she said the blood pattern showed billyd been hit first in the head and knocked down but he was still alive until mason hit him in the neck with the shovel bell looked out the window his face hollow why would mason kill billy he probably figured that billyd panic and tell the truth or maybe the boy was conscious when mason got there and said he was fed up and wanted out of the deal so thats why you wanted mason to leave a few minutes ago i wondered what that was about so howre we going to prove all of this lincoln ive got the latex prints on the shovel ive got the bones which test positive for toxaphene in high concentrations i want to get a diver and look for the hanlons car in the paquenoke some evidence willve survived even after five years then we should search billys house and see if theres any cash there that can be traced to mason and well search masons house too itll be a tough case rhyme gave a faint smile but im good jim i can do it then his smile faded but if mason doesnt turn states evidence against henry davett its going to be tough to make the case against himall ive gots that rhyme nodded to a plastic exemplar jar filled with about eight ounces of pale liquid whats that pure toxaphene lucy got a sample from davetts warehouse a half hour ago she said there mustve been ten thousand gallons of the stuff there if we can establish a compositional identity between the chemical that killed garretts family and whats in that jar we might convince the prosecutor to bring a case against davett but davett helped us find garrett of course he did it was in his interest to find the boy and mary beth as fast as possible davett was the one who wanted her dead most of all mason bell muttered shaking his head ive known him for years you think he suspects youre the only one ive told i didnt even tell lucy i just had her do some legwork for me i was afraid somebodyd overhear and wordd get back to mason or davett this town jim its a nest of hornets i dont know who to trust bell sighed how can you be so sure its mason because culbeau and his friends showed up at the moonshiners cabin just after we figured out where it was and mason was the only one who knew that aside from me and you and ben he mustve called culbeau and told him where the cabin was so lets call the state police have one of their divers come on down here and check out blackwater landing we should get on those warrants to search billys and masons houses too rhyme watched bell nod but instead of going to the phone he walked to the window and slid it shut then he stepped to the door again opened it looked out closed it locked the latch jim whatre you doing bell hesitated then took a step toward rhyme the criminalist looked once into the sheriffs eyes and gripped the sipandpuff controller quickly between his teeth he blew into it and the wheelchair started forward but bell stepped behind him and yanked the battery cable free the storm arrow eased forward a few inches and stopped jim he whispered not you too you got that right rhymes eyes closed no no he whispered his head dipped but only a few millimeters as with most great men lincoln rhymes gestures of defeat were very subtle v the town without children mason germain and the sullen black man moved slowly through the alley next to the tanners county lockup the man was sweating and he slapped in irritation at a mosquito he muttered something and wiped a long hand over his short kinky hair mason felt an urge to needle him but resisted the man was tall and by stretching up on his toes he could look into the lockup window mason saw that he wore short black boots shiny patent leather which for some reason added to the deputys contempt for the outoftowner he wondered how many men hed shot shes in there the man said shes alone were keeping garrett on the other side you go in the front can somebody get out through the back im a deputy remember i got a key i can unlock it he said this in a snide tone wondering again if this fellow was halfway bright he got snide in return i was only asking if theres a door in the back which i dont know never having been in this swamp of a town before oh yeah theres a door well lets go then mason noticed that the mans gun was in his hand and that he hadnt seen him draw it sachs sat on the bench in her cell hypnotized by the motion of a fly what kind was it she wondered garrett would know in an instant he was a warehouse of knowledge a thought occurred to her thered be that moment when a childs knowledge of a subject surpasses his parents it must be a miraculous thing exhilarating to know that youd produced this creation whod outsoared you humbling too an experience that she now would never know she thought once again about her father the man had diffused crime never fired his gun in all his years on duty proud as he was of his daughter hed worried about her fascination with firearms shoot lasthed often remind her oh jesse what can i say to you nothing of course i cant say a word youre gone she thought she saw a shadow outside the lockup window but she ignored it and her thoughts slipped to rhyme you and meshe was thinking you and me recalling the time a few months ago lying together in his opulent clinitron bed in his manhattan townhouse as they watched baz luhrmanns stylish romeo and julietan updated version set in miami with rhyme death always hovered close and watching the final scenes of the movie amelia sachs had realized that like shakespeares characters she and rhyme were in a way starcrossed lovers too and another thought had then flashed through her mind that the two of them would also die together she hadnt dared share this thought with rationalist lincoln rhyme who didnt have a sentimental cell in his brain but once this notion had occurred to her it seated itself permanently in her psyche and for some reason gave her great comfort yet now she couldnt even find solace in this odd thought no now thanks to her theyd live separately and die separately theyd the door to the lockup swung open and a young deputy walked inside she recognized him it was steve farr jim bells brotherinlaw hey there he called sachs nodded then she noticed two things about him one was that he wore a rolex watch which mustve cost half the annual salary of a typical cop in north carolina the other was that he wore a sidearm and that the holster thong was unsnapped despite the sign outside the door to the cells place all weapons in the lockbox before entering the cell area how you doing farr asked she looked at him gave no reaction being the silent type today huh well miss i got good news for you youre free to go he flicked at one of his prominent ears free to go he fished for his keys yep theyve decided the shooting was accidental you can just leave she studied his face closely he wasnt looking her way what about the disposition report whats that farr asked nobody charged with a crime can be released from custody without a disposition report waiving charges signed by the prosecutor farr unlocked the cell door and stood back hand hovering near the pistol butt oh maybe thats how you do things in the big city but down here were a ton more casual you know they say we move slower in the south but that aint right no maam were really more efficient sachs remained seated can i ask why youre wearing your weapon in the lockup oh this he tapped the gun we dont have any hardandfast rules about that sort of thing now come on youre free to leave most peopled be jumping up and down at that news he nodded toward the back of the lockup out the back door she asked sure you cant shoot a fleeing prisoner in the back thats murder he nodded slowly how was it set up she wondered was there someone else outside the door to do the actual shooting probably farr bangs himself on the head and calls for help fires a shot into the ceiling outside somebody maybe a concerned citizen claims he heard the gun and assumes sachs is armed shoots her she didnt move now stand up and git your ass outside farr pulled the pistol from his holster slowly she stood you and me rhyme you were pretty close lincoln jim bell said after a moment he added ninety percent right my experience in lawenforcement is thats a good percentage too bad for you im the ten percent you missed bell shut off the airconditioner with the window closed the room heated up immediately rhyme felt sweat on his forehead his breathing grew labored the sheriff continued two families along blackwater canal wouldnt grant mr davett easements to run his barges a respectful mister davett rhyme noted so his security chief hired a few of us to take care of the problem we had a long talk with the conklins and they decided to grant the easement but garretts father never would agree we were going to make it look like a car crash and we got a can of that shit he nodded to the jar on the table to knock them out we knew the family went out to dinner every wednesday we poured the poison into the cars vent and hid in the woods they got in and garretts father turned on the airconditioner the stuff sprayed out all over them but we used too much he glanced again at the jar that theres enough to kill a man twice over he continued frowning at the memory the family started twitching and convulsing was a hard thing to see garrett wasnt in the car but he ran up and saw what was going on he tried to get inside but couldnt he got a good whiff of the stuff though and it was like he became this zombie he just stumbled off into the woods fore we could catch him and by the time he surfaced a week or two later he didnt remember whatd happened that mcs thing you were mentioning i guess so we just let him be for the time being too suspicious if he was to die right after his family did then we did just what you figured set fire to the bodies and buried them at blackwater landing pushed the car into the inlet by canal road paid the coroner a hundred thousand for some ginnedup reports whenever we heard that somebody elsed got a funny kind of cancer and was asking questions why culbeau and the others took care of them that funeral we saw on the way into town you killed that boy didnt you todd wilkes bell said no he did kill himself but because he was sick from the toxaphene right whatd he have cancer liver damage brain damage maybe i dont know but the sheriffs face said that he knew only too well but garrett didnt have anything to do with it did he no what about those men at the moonshiners cabin the ones who assaulted mary beth bell nodded again grimly tom boston and lott cooper they were part of it too they handled testing a lot of davetts toxins out in the mountains where its less populated they knew we were looking for mary beth but when lott found her i guess he decided theyd hold off letting me know until theyd had some fun with her and yeah we hired billy stail to kill her but garrett got her away fore he could and you needed me to help you find her not to save her but so you could kill her and destroy any other evidence she mightve found after you found garrett and we brought him back from the mill i left the door to the lockup open so culbeau and his buddies could lets say talk garrett into telling us where mary beth was but your friend went and busted him out before they could snatch him rhyme said and when i found the cabin you called culbeau and the others sent them there to kill us all im sorry its all become a nightmare didnt want it to but there you have it ahornets nest oh yeah this towns got itself a few hornets rhyme shook his head tell me are the fancy cars and the big houses and all the money worth destroying the entire town look around you bell it was a childs funeral the other day but there were no children at the cemetery amelia said there are hardly any kids in town anymore you know why peoplere sterile its risky when you bargain with the devil bell said shortly but far as im concerned lifes just one big tradeoff he looked at rhyme for a long moment walked to the table he pulled on latex gloves picked up the toxaphene jar he stepped toward rhyme and slowly began to unscrew the lid steve farr roughly led amelia sachs to the back door of the lockup the pistol firmly in the square of her back he was making the classic mistake of holding the muzzle of his weapon against the body of his victim it gave her leverage when she stepped outside shed know exactly where the gun was and could sweep her elbow into it with some luck farr would drop the weapon and shed sprint as fast as she could if she could make it to main street thered be witnesses and he might hesitate to shoot he opened the back door a stream of hot sunlight flooded into the dusty lockup she blinked a fly buzzed around her head as long as farr stayed right up against her pressing the gun into her skin shed have a chance what now she asked free to go he said cheerfully shrugging she tensed about to swing into him planning every move but then he stepped back fast shoving her outside into the scruffy lot behind the jail farr remained inside well out of reach from nearby behind a tall bush in the field she heard another sound the cocking of a pistol she thought go ahead farr said git on outa here she thought of romeo and juliet again and of the beautiful cemetery on the hill overlooking tanners corner theyd driven past what now seemed like a lifetime ago oh rhyme the fly zipped past her face instinctively she brushed it away and began to walk forward into the low grass rhyme said to bell dont you think somebody might wonder if i die this way i can hardly open a jar by myself the sheriff responded you bumped the table the lid wasnt on tight it splashed on you i went for help but we couldnt save you in time amelias not going to let it go lucy wont either your girlfriends not going to be a problem for very much longer and lucy she might just get sick again and this time there might not be anything to cut off to save her bell hesitated only a moment then he stepped close and poured the liquid over rhymes mouth and nose the rest he splashed onto the front of his shirt the sheriff dropped the jar onto rhymes lap stepped back fast and covered his own mouth with a handkerchief rhymes head jerked back his lips parted involuntarily and some of the liquid slipped into his mouth he began to choke bell pulled off the gloves and stuffed them into his slacks he waited a moment calmly studying rhyme then walked toward the door slowly unlocked it swung it open he called theres been an accident somebody i need help he stepped into the corridor i need he walked right into lucy kerrs line of fire her pistol aimed steadily at his chest jesus lucy thats enough jim just hold it right there the sheriff stepped back nathan the snapshooting deputy walked into the room behind bell and snagged the sheriffs pistol from its holster another man entered a large man in a tan suit and white shirt ben too ran inside ignored everyone else and hurried to rhyme wiping the criminalists face with a paper towel the sheriff stared at lucy and the others no you dont understand there was an accident that poison stuff spilled youve got to rhyme spit on the floor and wheezed from the astringent liquid and the fumes he said to ben could you wipe higher on my cheek im afraid itll get into my eyes thank you sure lincoln bell said i was going for help that stuff spilled i the man in the suit pulled handcuffs off his belt and ratcheted the loops around the sheriffs wrists he said james bell im detective hugo branch with the north carolina state police youre under arrest here branch looked at rhyme sourly i told you hed pour it on your shirt we shouldve put the unit someplace else but you got enough on tape oh plenty thats not the point the point is those transmitters cost money bill me rhyme said acerbically as branch opened rhymes shirt and untaped the microphone and transmitter it was a setup bell whispered you got that right but the poison oh its not toxaphene rhyme said just a little moonshine from that jar we tested by the way ben if theres any left i could use a sip just now and christ could somebody get that ac going tense cut to the left and run like hell ill get hit but if im lucky it wont stop me when you move they cant getcha amelia sachs took three steps into the grass ready set then a mans voice from behind them inside the lockup area called hold it steve put the weapon on the ground now im not telling you again sachs spun around and saw mason germain his gun pointed at the shocked young mans crewcut head his round ears crimson farr crouched and set the gun on the floor mason hurried forward and cuffed him footsteps sounded from outside leaves rustled dizzy from the heat and the adrenaline sachs turned back to the field and saw a lean black man climbing out of the bushes bolstering a big browning automatic pistol fred she cried fbi agent fred dellray sweating furiously in his black suit walked up to her brushing petulantly at his sleeve hey amelia my it is too too too hot down here i dont like this town one tiny bit and look at this suit its all i dont know dusty or something what is this shit pollen we dont have this stuff in manhattan look at this sleeve whatre you doing here she asked dumbfounded whatcha think lincoln wasnt sure who he could trust and who he couldnt so he had me fly down and hooked me up with deputy germain here to keep an eye on you figured he needed some help seeing as how he couldnt trust jim bell or his kin bellshe whispered lincoln thinks he put this whole thing together hes finding out for sure right now but looks like he was right that being his brotherinlaw dellray nodded at steve farr he almost got me sachs said the lean agent chuckled you werent in a single solitary lick of danger no way i had a bead on that fellow right tween his big ears from the second the back door opened hed so much as squinted out a target at you heda been way way gone dellray noticed mason studying him suspiciously the agent laughed said to sachs our friend in the constabulary here dont like my kind much he told me so wait mason protested i only meant you meant federal agents im betting dellray said the deputy shook his head said gruffly i meant northerners true he doesnt sachs confirmed sachs and dellray laughed but mason remained solemn but it wasnt cultural differences that made him somber he said to sachs sorry but ill have to take you back to the cell youre still under arrest her smile faded and sachs looked once more at the sun dancing over the scruffy yellow grass she inhaled the scorching air of the outofdoors once then again finally she turned and walked back into the dim lockup you killed billy didnt you rhyme asked jim bell but the sheriff said nothing the criminalist continued the crime scene was unprotected for an hour and a half and sure mason was the first officer but you got there before he arrived you never got a call from billy saying that mary beth was dead and you started to worry so you drove over to blackwater landing and found her gone and billy hurt billy told you about garrett getting away with the girl then you put the latex gloves on picked up the shovel and killed him finally the sheriffs anger broke through his facade why did you suspect me originally i did think it was mason only the three of us and ben knew about the moonshiners cabin i assumed he called culbeau and sent him there but i asked lucy and it turned out that mason called her and sent her to the cabin just to make sure amelia and garrett didnt get away again then i got to thinking and i realized that at the mill mason tried to shoot garrett anybody in on the conspiracy would want to keep him alive like you did so he could lead you to mary beth i checked into masons finances and found out hes got a cheap house and is in serious hock to mastercard and visa nobody was paying him off unlike you and your brotherinlaw bell youve got a fourhundredthousanddollar house and plenty of cash in the bank and steve farrs got a house worth three ninety and a boat that cost a hundred eighty thousand were getting court orders to take a peek in your safedeposit boxes wonder how much well find there rhyme continued i was a little curious why mason was so eager to nail garrett but he had a good reason for that he told me he was pretty upset when you got the job of sheriff couldnt quite figure out why since he had a better record and more seniority he thought that if he could collar the insect boy the board of supervisorsd be sure to appoint him sheriff when your term expired all your fucking playacting bell muttered i thought you only believed in evidence rhyme rarely sparred verbally with his quarry banter was useless except as a balm for the soul and lincoln rhyme had yet to uncover any hard evidence on the whereabouts and nature of the soul still he told bell i wouldve preferred evidence but sometimes you have to improvise im really not the prima donna everybody thinks i am the storm arrow wheelchair wouldnt fit into amelia sachs cell not cripaccessible rhyme groused thats an ada violation she thought his bluster was for her benefit letting her see his familiar moods but she said nothing because of the wheelchair problem mason germain suggested they try the interrogation room sachs shuffled in wearing the hand and ankle shackles that the deputy insisted on she had after all already managed one escape from the place the lawyer from new york had arrived he was grayhaired solomon geberth a member of the new york massachusetts and dc bars he had been admitted to the jurisdiction of north carolina pro hoc vice for the single case of people v sachs curiously with his smooth handsome face and mannerisms even smoother he seemed far more a genteel southern lawyer out of a john grisham novel than a bulldog of a manhattan litigator the mans trim hair glistened with spray and his italian suit successfully resisted wrinkles even in tanners corners astonishing humidity lincoln rhyme sat between sachs and her lawyer she rested her hand on the armrest of his injured wheelchair they brought in a special prosecutor from raleigh geberth was explaining with the sheriff and the coroner on the take i dont think they quite trust mcguire anyway hes looked over the evidence and decided to dismiss the charges against garrett sachs stirred at this he did geberth said garrett admitted hitting the boy billy and thought he killed him but lincoln was right it was bell who killed the boy and even if they brought him up on assault charges garrett was clearly acting in selfdefense that other deputy ed schaeffer his deaths been ruled accidental what about kidnapping lydia johansson rhyme asked when she realized that garrett had never intended to hurt her she decided to drop the charges mary beth did the same her mother wanted to go ahead with the complaint but you shouldve heard that girl talk to the woman some fur flew during that conversation ill tell you so hes free garrett sachs asked eyes on the floor theyre letting him out in a few minutes geberth told her then okay heres the laundry amelia the prosecutors position is that even if garrett turned out not to be a felon you aided in the escape of a prisoner whod been arrested on the basis of probable cause and you killed an officer during the commission of that crime the prosecutors going for firstdegree murder and throwing in the standard lesserincluded offenses both manslaughter counts voluntary and involuntary and reckless homicide and criminally negligent homicide first degree rhyme snapped it wasnt premeditated it was an accident for christs sake which is what i m going to try to show at trial geberth said that the other deputy the one who grabbed you was a partial proximate cause of the shooting but i guarantee theyll get the reckless homicide conviction on the facts theres no doubt about that whats the chance of acquittal rhyme asked bad ten fifteen percent at best im sorry but i have to recommend you take a plea she felt this like a blow to her chest her eyes closed and when she exhaled it was as if her soul had fled from her body jesus rhyme muttered sachs was thinking about nick her former boyfriend how when he was arrested for hijacking and taking kickbacks he refused a plea and took the risk of a jury trial he said to her its like what your old man said aimee when you move they cant get you its all or nothing it took the jury eighteen minutes to convict him he was still in a new york prison she looked at the smoothcheeked geberth she asked whats the prosecutor offering for the plea nothing yet but hell probably accept voluntary manslaughter if you do hard time id guess eight ten years i have to tell you though that in north carolina itll be hard time no country clubs here rhyme grumbled versus a fifteen percent chance of acquittal geberth said thats right then the lawyer added you have to understand that there arent going to be any miracles here amelia if we go to trial the prosecutors going to prove that youre a professional lawenforcer and a champion marksman and the jurys going to have trouble buying that the shooting was accidental normal rules dont apply to anybody north of the paquo us or them you can see yourself shooting before you read anybody their rights and thatd be perfectly all right the lawyer said if that happens they could convict you of murder one and youll get twentyfive years or the death penalty she muttered yes thats a possibility i cant tell you it isnt for some reason the image that came into her mind at this moment was of the peregrine falcons that nested outside of lincoln rhymes window in his manhattan townhouse the male and the female and the young hawk she said if i plead to involuntary how much time will i do probably six seven years no parole you and me rhyme she inhaled deeply ill plead sachs rhyme began but she repeated to geberth ill plead the lawyer rose he nodded ill call the prosecutor right now see if hell accept it ill let you know as soon as i hear anything with a nod at rhyme the lawyer left the room mason glanced at sachs face he stood and walked to the door his boots tapping loudly ill leave you two for a few minutes i dont have to search you do i lincoln rhyme smiled wanly im weaponfree mason the door swung shut what a mess lincoln she said uhuh sachs no first names why not she asked cynically nearly a whisper bad luck maybe youre not superstitious or so youre always telling me not usually but this is a spooky place tanners corner the town with no children i shouldve listened to you he said you were right about garrett i was wrong i looked at the evidence and got it deadwrong but i didnt know i was right i didnt know anything i just had a hunch and i acted rhyme said whatever happens sachs im not going anywhere he nodded down at the storm arrow and laughed i couldnt get very far even if i wanted to you do some time ill be there when you get out words rhyme she said only words my father said he wasnt going anywhere either that was a week before the cancer shut him down im too ornery to die but youre not too ornery to get bettershe thought to meet someone else to move on and leave me behind the door to the interrogation room opened garrett stood in the doorway mason behind him the boys hands no longer in shackles were cupped in front of him hey garrett said in greeting check out what i found it was in my cell he opened his fist and a small insect flew out its a sphinx moth they like to forage in valerian flowers you dont see em much inside pretty cool she smiled faintly taking pleasure in his enthusiastic eyes garrett theres one thing i want you to know he walked closer looked down at her you remember what you said in the trailer when you were talking to your father in the empty chair he nodded uncertainly you were saying how bad you felt that he didnt want you in the car that night i remember but you know why he didnt want you he was trying to save your life he knew there was poison in the car and that they were going to die if you got in the car with them youd die too and he didnt want that to happen i guess i know that he said his voice was uncertain and amelia sachs supposed that rewriting ones history was a daunting task you keep remembering it i will sachs looked at the tiny beige moth flying around the interrogation room you leave anybody in the cell for me for company yeah i did theres a couple of ladybugs their real name is ladybird beetles and a leafhopper and syrphus fly its cool the way they fly you can watch em for hours he paused like im sorry i lied to you the thing is if i hadnt i never wouldve got out and i couldntve saved mary beth thats all right garrett he looked at mason i can go now you can go he walked to the door turned and said to sachs ill come and like hang out if thats okay id like that he stepped outside and through the open door sachs could see him walk up to a fourbyfour it was lucy kerrs sachs saw her get out and hold the door open for him like a mom picking up her son after soccer practice the jail door closed and shut off this domestic scene sachs rhyme began but she shook her head and started shuffling back toward the lockup she wanted to be away from the criminalist away from the insect boy away from the town without children she wanted to be in the darkness of solitude and soon she was outside of tanners corner on route where its still twolane theres a bend in the road near the paquenoke river just off the shoulder is a thick growth of plume grass sedge indigo and tall columbines showing off their distinctive red flowers like flags the vegetation creates a nook thats a popular parking space for paquenoke county deputies who sip iced tea and listen to the radio as they wait for the display on their radar guns to register mph or higher then they accelerate onto the highway in pursuit of the surprised speeder to add another hundred dollars or so to the county treasury today sunday as a black lexus suv passed this jog in the road the radar gun on lucy kerrs dashboard registered a legal but she put the squad car in gear flipped the switch starting the gumball machine atop the car and sped after the fourbyfour she eased close to the lexus and studied the vehicle carefully shed learned long ago to check the rearview mirror of cars she was stopping you look at the drivers eyes and you can pretty much get a feel for what other kinds of crimes they might be committing if any beyond speeding or a broken taillight drugs stolen weapons drinking you get a feel for how dangerous the pullover will be now she saw the mans eyes flick into the mirror and glance at her without a hint of guilt or concern invulnerable eyes which made the anger in her all the hotter and she breathed hard to control it the big car eased onto the dusty shoulder and lucy pulled in behind it rules dictated that she call in for a tag tax and warrants check but lucy didnt bother with this there was nothing that dmv could report that would be of any interest to her with trembling hands she opened the door and climbed out the drivers eyes now shifted to the sideview mirror and continued to examine her clinically they registered some surprise noticing she supposed that she wasnt in her uniform just jeans and a work shirt though she was wearing her weapon on her hip what would an offduty cop be doing pulling over a driver who hadnt been speeding henry davett rolled down his window lucy kerr looked inside past davett in the front passenger seat was a woman in her early fifties with a dryness to her sprayed blond hair that suggested frequent beauty parlor shampoos she wore diamonds on wrist ears and chest a teenage girl sat in the back flipping through boxes of cds mentally enjoying the music that her father wouldnt let her listen to on the sabbath officer kerr davett said whats the problem but she could see in his eyes now no longer in reflection that he knew exactly what the problem was and still they remained as guiltfree and in control as when hed noticed the gyrations of the flashing lights on her crown victoria her anger tugged at its restraints and she snapped get out of the car davett honey what did you do officer whats the point of this davett asked sighing out now lucy reached inside and popped the door locks can she do that honey can she shut up edna all right im sorry lucy swung the door open davett unsnapped his seat belt and stepped out onto the dusty shoulder a semi sped past and wrapped its wake around them davett looked distastefully at the gray carolina clay settling on his blue blazer my family and i are late for church and i dont think she took him by the arm and pulled him off the shoulder into the shade of wild rice and cattails a small stream a feeder to the paquenoke ran beside the road he repeated with exasperation what is the point i know everything do you officer kerr do you know everything which would be the poison the murders the canal davett said smoothly i never had a bit of direct contact with jim bell or anybody else in tanners corner if there were some damn crazy fools on my payroll who hired some other damn crazy fools to do things that were illegal thats not my fault and if that happened ill be cooperating with the authorities one hundred percent unfazed by his suave response she growled youre going down with bell and his brotherinlaw of course im not nothing links me to a single crime therere no witnesses no accounts no money transfers no evidence of any wrongdoing im a manufacturer of petrochemicalbased products certain cleaners asphalt and some pesticides illegal pesticides wrong he snapped the epa still allows toxaphene to be used in some cases in the us and its not illegal at all in most third world countries do some reading deputy without pesticides malaria and encephalitis and famined kill hundreds of thousands of people every year and and give the people whore exposed to it cancer and birth defects and liver damage and davett shrugged show me the studies deputy kerr show me the research that proves that if its so fucking harmless then why did you stop shipping it by truck why did you start using barges i couldnt get it to port any other way because some kneejerk counties and townsve banned transportation of some substances they dont know the facts about and i didnt have the time to hire lobbyists to change the laws well ill bet the epad be interested in what youre doing here oh please he scoffed the epa send them out ill give you their phone number if they ever get around to visiting the factory theyll find permissible levels of toxaphene everywhere around tanners corner maybe whats in the water alone is at a permissible level maybe whats in the air alone maybe the local produce alone but what about the combination of them what about a child who drinks a glass of water from his parents well then plays in the grass then eats an apple from a local orchard then he shrugged the lawsre clear deputy kerr if you dont like them write your congressman she grabbed him by the lapel she raged you dont understand you are going to prison he pulled away from her whispered viciously no you dont understand officer youre way out of your depth here im very very good at what i do i do not make mistakes he glanced at his watch i have to go now davett walked back to the suv patting his thinning hair the sweat had darkened it and stuck the strands into place he climbed in and slammed the door lucy walked up to the drivers side as he started the engine wait she said davett glanced at her but the deputy ignored him she was looking at his passengers id like you to see what henry did her strong hands ripped her own shirt open the women in the car gaped at the pink scars where her breasts had been oh for pitys sake davett muttered looking away dad the girl whispered in shock her mother stared speechless lucy said you said that you dont make mistakes davett wrong you made this one the man put the car in gear clicked on his turn signal checked his blind spot and eased slowly onto the highway lucy stood for a long moment watching the lexus disappear she fished in her pocket and pinned her shirt closed with several safety pins she leaned against her car for a long moment fighting tears then she happened to look down and notice a small ruddy flower by the roadside she squinted it was a pink moccasin flower a type of orchid its blossoms resemble tiny slipon shoes the plant was rare in paquenoke county and shed never seen one as lovely as this in five minutes using her windshield ice scraper shed uprooted the plant and had it packed safely in a tall eleven cup the root beer sacrificed for the beauty of lucy kerrs garden a plaque on the courthouse wall explained that the name of the state came from the latin carolusfor charles it was king charles i who granted a land patent to settle the colony carolina amelia sachs had assumed the state was named for caroline some queen or princess brooklynborn and raised she had little interest in or knowledge of royalty she now sat handcuffed still between two guards on a bench in the courthouse the redbrick building was an old place filled with dark mahogany and marble floors stern men in black suits judges or governors she assumed looked down on her from oil paintings as if they knew she was guilty there didnt seem to be airconditioning but breezes and the darkness cooled the place thanks to efficient eighteenthcentury engineering fred dellray ambled up to her hey there you want some coffee or something the leftfield guard got as far as no speaking to the before the justice department id card crimped off the recitation no fred wheres lincoln it was nearly ninethirty dunno you know that man sometimes he just appears for a man who doesnt walk he gets around moren anybody i know lucy and garrett werent here either sol geberth in a richlooking gray suit walked up to her the guard on her right scooted over and let the lawyer sit down hello fred the lawyer said to the agent dellray nodded but coolly and sachs deduced that as with rhyme the defense lawyer mustve gotten acquittals for suspects that the agent had collared its a deal geberth said to sachs the prosecutors agreed to involuntary manslaughter no other counts five years no parole five years the lawyer continued theres one aspect to this i didnt think about yesterday what is it she asked trying to gauge from the look on his face how deep this new trouble ran the problem is youre a cop what does that have to do with anything before he could say anything dellray said you being a law enforcement officer inside when she still didnt get it the agent explained inside prison youll have to be segregated or you wouldnt last a week thatll be tough amelia thatll be nasty tough but nobody knows im a cop dellray laughed faintly theyll know eversinglething there is to know bout you by the time you get yourself issued your jumpsuit and linen i havent collared anybody down here why would they care that im a cop dont make a splinter of difference where youre from dellray said eyeing geberth who nodded in confirmation they absolutely wont keepya in general population so its basically five years in solitary im afraid so geberth said she closed her eyes and felt nausea course through her five years of not moving of claustrophobia of nightmares and as an exconvict how could she possibly think about becoming a mother she choked on the despair so the lawyer asked whats it going to be sachs opened her eyes ill take the plea the room was crowded sachs saw mason germain a few of the other deputies a grim couple eyes red probably jesse corns parents sat in the front row she wanted badly to say something to them but their contemptuous gaze kept her silent she saw only two faces that looked at her kindly mary beth mcconnell and a heavy woman who was presumably her mother there was no sign of lucy kerr or of lincoln rhyme she supposed that he didnt have the heart to watch her being led off in chains well that was all right she didnt want to see him under these circumstances either the bailiff led her to the defense table he left the shackles on sol geberth sat beside her they rose when the judge entered and the wiry man in a bulky black robe sat down at the tall bench he spent some minutes looking over documents and talking with his clerk finally he nodded and the clerk said the people of the state of north carolina versus amelia sachs the judge nodded to the prosecutor from raleigh a tall silverhaired man who rose your honor the defendant and the state have entered into a plea arrangement whereby the defendant has agreed to plead guilty to seconddegree manslaughter in the death of deputy jesse randolph corn the state waives all other charges and is recommending a sentence of five years to be served without possibility of parole or reduction miss sachs youve discussed this arrangement with your attorney i have your honor and hes told you that you have the right to reject it and proceed to trial yes and you understand that by accepting this you will be pleading guilty to a felony homicide charge yes youre making this decision willingly she thought of her father of nick and of lincoln rhyme i am yes very well how do you plead to the charge of seconddegree manslaughter brought against you guilty your honor in light of the states recommendation the plea will be entered and i am hereby sentencing you the redleather doors leading to the corridor swung inward and with a highpitched whine lincoln rhymes wheelchair maneuvered inside a bailiff had tried to open the doors for the storm arrow but rhyme seemed to be in a hurry and just plowed through them one slammed into the wall lucy kerr was behind him the judge looked up ready to reprimand the intruder when he saw the chair he like most people deferred to the political correctness that rhyme despised and said nothing he turned back to sachs im hereby sentencing you to five years rhyme said forgive me your honor i need to speak with the defendant and her counsel for a minute well the judge grumbled were in the middle of a proceeding you can speak to her at some future time with all respect your honor rhyme responded i need to speak to her nowhis voice was a grumble too but it was much louder than the jurists just like the old days being in a courtroom most people think that a criminalists only job is finding and analyzing evidence but when lincoln rhyme was head of the nypd s forensics operation the investigation and resources division he had spent nearly as much time testifying in court as he did in the lab he was a good expert witness elaine his exwife often observed that he preferred to perform in front of people herself included rather than interact with them rhyme carefully steered up to the railing that separated the counsel tables from the gallery in the paquenoke county courthouse he glanced at amelia sachs and the sight nearly broke his heart in the three days shed been in jail shed lost a lot of weight and her face was sallow her red hair was dirty and pulled up in a taut bun the way she wore it at crime scenes to keep the strands from brushing against evidence this made her otherwise beautiful face severe and drawn geberth walked over to rhyme crouched down the criminalist spoke to him for a few minutes finally geberth nodded and rose your honor i realize this is a hearing regarding a plea bargain but i have an unusual proposal theres some new evidence thats come to light which you can introduce at trial the judge snapped if your client chooses to reject the plea arrangement im not proposing to introduce anything to the court id like to make the state aware of this evidence and see if my worthy colleague will agree to consider it for what purpose possibly to alter the charges against my client geberth added coyly which may just make your honors docket somewhat less burdensome the judge rolled his eyes to show that yankee slickness counted for zip around these parts still he glanced at the prosecutor and asked well the d a asked geberth what sort of evidence a new witness rhyme couldnt control himself any longer no he said physical evidence youre this lincoln rhyme ive been hearing about the judge asked as if there were two crip criminalists plying their trade in the tar heel state i am yes the prosecutor asked where is this evidence in my custody at the paquenoke county sheriffs department lucy kerr said the judge asked rhyme youll agree to be deposed under oath certainly thiss all right with you counselor the judge asked the prosecutor it is your honor but if this is just tactical or if the evidence turns out to be meaningless ill pursue interference charges against mr rhyme the judge thought for a moment then said for the record this is not part of any proceeding the court is merely lending itself to the parties for a deposition prior to arraignment the examination will be conducted pursuant to north carolina rules of criminal procedure swear the deponent rhyme parked in front of the bench as the bibleclutching clerk approached uncertainly rhyme said no i cant raise my right hand then recited i swear that the testimony i am about to give is the truth upon my solemn oath he tried to catch sachs eye but she was staring at the faded mosaic tile on the courtroom floor geberth strolled to the front of the courtroom mr rhyme could you state your name address and occupation lincoln rhyme central park west new york city im a criminalist thats a forensic scientist is that right somewhat more than that but forensic science is the bulk of what i do and how do you know the defendant amelia sachs shes been my assistant and partner on a number of criminal investigations and how did you happen to come to tanners corner we were assisting sheriff james bell and the paquenoke county sheriffs department looking into the murder of billy stail and the abductions of lydia johansson and mary beth mcconnell geberth asked now mr rhyme you say you have new evidence that bears on this case yes i do what is that evidence after we learned that billy stail had gone to blackwater landing to kill mary beth mcconnell i began speculating why hed done that and i concluded that hed been paid to kill her he why did you think he was paid its obvious why rhyme grumbled he had little patience for irrelevant questions and geberth was deviating from his script share that with us if you would billy had no romantic relationship with mary beth of any kind he wasnt involved in the murder of garrett hanlons family he didnt even know her so hed have no motivation to kill her other than financial profit go on rhyme continued whoever hired him wasnt going to pay by check of course but in cash deputy kerr went to the house of billy stails parents and was given permission to search his room she discovered ten thousand dollars hidden beneath his mattress what was there about this why dont i just finish the story rhyme asked the lawyer the judge said good idea mr rhyme i think counsels laid enough groundwork with officer kerrs assistance i did a friction ridge analysis thats a fingerprint check of the top and bottom bills in the stacks of cash i found a total of sixtyone latent fingerprints aside from billys prints two of these prints proved to be from a person involved in this case deputy kerr got another warrant to enter that individuals house did you search it too the judge asked he replied with forced patience no i didnt it wasnt accessible to me but i directed the search which was conducted by deputy kerr inside the house she found a receipt for the purchase of a shovel identical to the murder weapon eightythree thousand dollars in cash secured with wrappers identical to the ones around the two stacks of money in billy stails house dramatic as ever rhyme had saved the best till the last deputy kerr also found bone fragments in the barbecue behind that premises these fragments match the bones of garrett hanlons family whose house was this deputy jesse corns this drew some loud murmurs from the courtroom pews the prosecutor remained unfazed but sat up slightly his shoes scuffling on the tile floor and whispered to his colleagues as they considered the implications of the revelation in the gallery jesses parents turned to each other shock in their eyes his mother shook her head and started to cry where exactly are you going mr rhyme the judge asked rhyme resisted telling the judge that the destination was obvious he said your honor jesse corn was one of the individuals who had conspired with jim bell and steve farr to kill garrett hanlons family five years ago and then to kill mary beth mcconnell the other day oh yeah this towns got itself a few hornets the judge leaned back in his chair this has nothing to do with me you two duke it out nodding from geberth to the prosecutor you got five minutes then she accepts the plea bargain or ill set bail and schedule trial the prosecutor said to geberth doesnt mean she didnt kill jesse even if corn was a coconspirator he was still the victim of a homicide now the northerner got to roll his eyes oh come on geberth snapped as if the da were a slow student what it means is that corn was operating outside his jurisdiction as a lawenforcer and that when he confronted garrett he was a felon and armed and dangerous jim bell admitted they were planning on torturing the boy to find mary beths whereabouts once they found her corn wouldve been right there with culbeau and the others to kill lucy kerr and the other deputies the judges eyes swept from left to right slowly as he watched this unprecedented tennis match the prosecutor i can only focus on the crime at hand whether jesse corn was going to kill anybody or not doesnt matter geberth shook his head slowly the lawyer said to the court reporter were suspending the deposition this is off the record then to the prosecutor whats the point of proceeding corn was a killer rhyme joined in speaking to the prosecutor you take this to trial and what do you think the jurys going to feel when we show the victim was a crooked cop planning to torture an innocent boy to find a young woman and then murder her geberth continued you dont want this notch on your grip youve got bell youve got his brotherinlaw the coroner before the prosecutor could protest again rhyme looked up at him and said in a soft voice ill help you what the prosecutor asked you know whos behind all this dont you you know whos killing half the residents of tanners corner henry davett the prosecutor said ive read the filings and depos rhyme asked and hows the case against him not good theres no evidence theres no link between him and bell or anybody else in town he used middlemen and theyre all stonewalling or out of the jurisdiction but rhyme said dont you want to nail him before any more people die of cancer before more children get sick and kill themselves before more babies are born with birth defects of course i want to then you need meyou wont find a criminalist anywhere in the state who can bring davett down i can rhyme glanced at sachs he could see tears in her eyes he knew that the only thought in her mind now was that whether they sent her to jail or not she hadnt killed an innocent man the prosecutor sighed deeply then nodded quickly as if he might change his mind he said deal he looked at the bench your honor in the case of the people versus sachs the state is withdrawing all charges so ordered said the bored judge defendant is free to go next case he didnt even bother to bang down his gavel i didnt know whether youd show up lincoln rhyme said he was in fact surprised wasnt sure i was going to either sachs replied they were in his hospital room at the medical center in avery he said i just got back from visiting thom on the fifth floor thats pretty odd im more mobile than he is how is he hell be fine he should be out in a day or two i told him he was about to see physical therapy from a whole new angle he didnt laugh a pleasant guatemalan woman the temporary caregiver sat in the corner knitting a yellowandred shawl she seemed to be weathering rhymes moods though he believed that this was because she didnt understand english well enough to appreciate his sarcasm and insults you know sachs rhyme said when i heard youd busted garrett out of detention it half occurred to me youd done it to give me a chance to rethink the operation a smile curved her julia roberts lips maybe there was a bit of that so youre here now to talk me out of it she rose from the chair and walked to the window pretty view peaceful isnt it fountain and garden plants dont know what kind lucy could tell you she knows plants the way garrett knows bugs excuse me insectsa bug is only one type of insect no rhyme im not here to talk you out of it im here to be with you now and to be in the recovery room when you wake up change of heart she turned to him when garrett and i were on the run he was telling me about something he read in that book of his the miniature world i have a new respect for dung beetles after reading it rhyme said there was something he showed me a passage it was a list of the characteristics of living creatures one of them was that healthy creatures strive to grow and to adapt to the environment i realized thats something you have to do rhyme have this surgery i cant interfere with it after a moment he said i know its not going to cure me sachs but whats the nature of our business its little victories we find a fiber here a partial latent friction ridge there a few grains of sand that might lead to the killers house thats all im after here a little improvement im not climbing out of this chair i know that but i need a little victory maybe the chance to hold your hand for real she bent down kissed him hard then sat on the bed whats that look sachs you seem a bit coy that passage in garretts book right there was another characteristic of living creatures i wanted to mention which is he asked all living creatures strive to continue the species rhyme grumbled do i sense another plea bargain here a deal of some kind she said maybe we can talk about some things when we get back to new york a nurse appeared in the doorway i need to take you to preop mr rhyme you ready for a ride oh you bet i am he turned back to sachs sure well talk she kissed him again and squeezed his left hand where he could just faintly feel the pressure in his ring finger the two women sat side by side in a thick shaft of sunlight two paper cups of very bad vendingmachine coffee were in front of them perched on an orange table covered with brown burn marks from the days when smoking had been permitted in hospitals amelia sachs glanced at lucy kerr who sat forward hands together subdued whats up sachs asked her you all right the deputy hesitated then finally said oncologys on the next wing over i spent months there before and after the operation she shook her head i never told anybody this but the thanksgiving day after buddy left me i came here just hung out had coffee and tuna sandwiches with the nurses isnt that a kick i couldve gone to see my parents and cousins in raleigh for turkey and dressing or my sister in martinsville and her husband bens parents but i wanted to be where i felt at home which sure wasnt in my house sachs said when my father was dying my mom and i spent three holidays in the hospital thanksgiving christmas and new years pop made a joke he said we had to make our easter reservations early he didnt live that long though your moms still alive oh yeah she gets around better than i do i got pops arthritis only in spades sachs nearly made a joke about that being why she was such a good shot so she wouldnt have to run down the perps but then she thought of jesse corn flashed back to the dot of the bullet on his forehead and she remained silent lucy said hell be all right you know lincoln no i dont know sachs responded ive got a feeling when youve been through as much as i have in hospitals i mean you get a feeling appreciate that sachs said how long do you think itll be lucy asked forever four hours dr weaver was saying in the distance they could just hear the tinny forced dialogue of a soap opera a distant page for a doctor a chime a laugh someone walked past then paused hey ladies lydia lucy said smiling how you doing lydia johansson sachs hadnt recognized her at first because she was wearing a green robe and cap she recalled that the woman was a nurse here you heard lucy asked about jim and steve getting arrested who wouldve thought never in a million years lydia said the whole towns talking then the nurse asked lucy you have an onco appointment no mr rhymes having his operation today on his spine were his cheerleaders well i wish him all the best lydia said to sachs thank you the big girl continued down the corridor waved then pushed through a doorway sweet girl sachs said you imagine that job being an oncology nurse when i was having my surgery she was on the ward every day being just as cheerful as could be more guts than i have but lydia was far from sachs thoughts she looked at the clock it was eleven am the operation would start any minute now he tried to be on good behavior the prep nurse was explaining things to him and lincoln rhyme was nodding but theyd already given him a valium and he wasnt paying attention he wanted to tell the woman to be quiet and just get on with it yet he supposed that you should be extremely civil to the people whore about to slice your neck open really he said when she paused thats interesting not having a clue what shed just told him then an orderly arrived and wheeled him from preop into the operating room itself two nurses made the transfer from the gurney to the operating table one went to the far end of the room and began removing instruments from the autoclave the operating room was more informal than hed thought the clich√©d green tile stainlesssteel equipment instruments tubes but also lots of cardboard boxes and a boom box he was going to ask what kind of music theyd be listening to but then he remembered hed be out cold and wouldnt care about the sound track its pretty funny he muttered drunkenly to a nurse who was standing next to him she turned he could see only her eyes over the face mask whats that she asked theyre operating on the one place where i need anesthetic if i had my appendix out they could cut without gas thats pretty funny mr rhyme he laughed briefly thinking so she knows me he stared at the ceiling in a hazy reflective mood lincoln rhyme divided people into two categories traveling people and arrival people some enjoyed the journey more than the destination he by his nature was an arrival person finding the answers to forensic questions was his goal and he enjoyed getting the solutions more than the process of seeking them yet now lying on his back staring into the chromium hood of the surgical lamp he felt just the opposite he preferred to exist in this state of hope enjoying the buoyant sensation of anticipation the anesthesiologist an indian woman came in and ran a needle into his arm prepared an injection fitted it into the tube connected to the needle she had very skillful hands you ready to take a nap she asked with a faint lilting accent as ill ever be he mumbled when i inject this im going to ask you to count down from one hundred youll be out before you know it whats the record rhyme joked counting down one man he was much bigger than you got to seventynine before he went under ill go for seventyfive youll get this operating suite named after you if you do that she replied deadpan he watched her slip a tube of clear liquid into the iv she turned away to look at a monitor rhyme began counting one hundred ninetynine ninetyeight ninetyseven the other nurse the one whod mentioned him by name crouched down in a low voice she said hi there an odd tone in the voice he glanced at her she continued im lydia johansson remember me before he could say of course he did she added in a dark whisper jim bell asked me to say goodbye no he muttered the anesthesiologist eyes on a monitor said it s okay just relax everythings fine her mouth inches from his ear lydia whispered didnt you wonder how jim and steve farr found out about the cancer patients no stop i gave jim their names so culbeau could make sure they had accidents jim bells my boyfriend weve been having an affair for years hes the one sent me to blackwater landing after mary bethd been kidnapped that morning i went to put flowers down and just hang out in case garrett showed up i was going to talk to him and give jesse and ed schaeffer a chance to get him ed was with us too then they were going to force him to tell us where mary beth was but nobody thought hed kidnap me oh yeah this towns got itself a few hornets stop rhyme cried but his voice came out as a mumble the anesthesiologist said been fifteen seconds maybe youre going to break that record after all are you counting i dont hear you counting ill be right here lydia said stroking rhymes forehead a lot can go wrong during surgery you know kinks in the oxygen tube administering the wrong drugs who knows might kill you might put you in a coma but you sure arent going to be doing any testifying wait rhyme gasped wait ha the anesthesiologist said laughing her eyes still on the monitor twenty seconds i think youre going to win mr rhyme no i dont think you are lydia whispered and slowly stood as rhyme saw the operating room go gray and then black this really was one of the prettiest places in the world amelia sachs thought for a cemetery tanners corner memorial gardens on a crest of a rolling hill overlooked the paquenoke river some miles away it was even nicer here in the graveyard itself than viewed from the road where shed first seen it on the drive from avery squinting against the sun she noticed the glistening strip of blackwater canal joining the river from here even the dark tainted water which had brought so much sorrow to so many looked benign and picturesque she was in a small cluster of people standing over an open grave a crematory urn was being lowered by one of the men from the mortuary amelia sachs was next to lucy kerr garrett hanlon stood by them on the other side of the grave were mason germain and thom with a cane dressed in his immaculate slacks and shirt he wore a bold tie with a wild red pattern which seemed appropriate despite this somber moment blacksuited fred dellray was here too standing by himself off to the side thoughtful as if recalling a passage in one of the philosophy books he enjoyed reading he would have resembled a nation of islam reverend if hed been wearing a white shirt instead of the limegreen one with yellow polka dots on it there was no minister to officiate even though this was biblewaving country and thered probably be a dozen clerics on call for funerals the mortuary director now glanced at the people assembled and asked if anybody wanted to say something to the assembly and as everyone looked around wondering if thered be any volunteers garrett dug into his baggy slacks and produced his battered book the miniature world in a halting voice the boy read there are those who suggest that a divine force doesnt exist but ones cynicism is truly put to the test when we look at the world of insects which have been graced with so many amazing characteristics wings so thin they seem hardly to be made of any living material bodies without a single milligram of excess weight windspeed detectors accurate to a fraction of a mile per hour a stride so efficient that mechanical engineers model robots after it and most important insects astonishing ability to survive in the face of overwhelming opposition by man predators and the elements in moments of despair we can look to the ingenuity and persistence of these miraculous creatures and find solace and a restoration of lost faith garrett looked up closed the book clicked his fingernails nervously he looked at sachs and asked do you like want to say anything but she merely shook her head no one else spoke and after a few minutes everyone around the grave turned away and meandered back up the hill along a winding path before they crested the ridge that led to a small picnic area the cemetery crews had already begun filling in the grave with a backhoe sachs was breathing hard as they walked to the crest of the treecovered hill near the parking lot she recalled lincoln rhymes voice thats not a bad cemetery wouldnt mind being buried in a place like that she paused to wipe the sweat from her face and catch her breath the north carolina heat was still relentless garrett though didnt seem to notice the temperature he ran past her and began pulling grocery bags from the back of lucys bronco this wasnt exactly the time or place for a picnic but sachs supposed chicken salad and watermelon were as good a way as any to remember the dead scotch too of course sachs dug through several shopping bags and finally found the bottle of macallan eighteen years old she pulled the cork stopper out with a faint pop ah my favorite sound lincoln rhyme said he was wheeling up beside her driving carefully along the uneven grass the hill down to the grave was too steep for the storm arrow and hed had to wait up here in the lot hed watched from the hilltop as they buried the ashes of the bones that mary beth had found at blackwater landing the remains of garretts family sachs poured scotch into rhymes glass equipped with a long straw and some into hers everyone else was drinking beer he said moonshine is truly vile sachs avoid it at all costs this is much better sachs looked around wheres the woman from the hospital the caregiver mrs ruiz rhyme muttered hopeless she quit left me in the lurch quit thom said you drove her nuts you might as well have fired her i was a saint the criminalist snapped hows your temperature thom asked him its fine he grumbled hows yours probably a little high but i dont have a blood pressure problem no youve a bullet hole in you the aide persisted you should i said im fine move into the shade a little farther rhyme groused and complained about the unsteady ground but he finally maneuvered himself into the shade a little farther garrett was carefully setting out food and drink and napkins on a bench under the tree howre you doing sachs asked rhyme in a whisper and before you grumble at me too im not talking about the heat he shrugged this a silent grumble by which he meant im fine but he wasnt fine a phrenicnerve stimulator pumped current into his body to help his lungs inhale and exhale he hated the device had weaned himself off it some years ago but there was no question that he needed it now two days ago on the operating table lydia johansson had come very close to stopping his breathing forever in the waiting room at the hospital after lydia had said goodbye to sachs and lucy sachs had noticed that the nurse vanished through the doorway marked neurosurgery sachs had asked didnt you say that she works in oncology she does then whats she doing going in there maybe saying hello to lincoln lucy suggested but sachs didnt think that nurses paid social calls to patients about to be operated on then she thought lydia would know about new cancer diagnoses among residents from tanners corner she then recalled that somebody had given information to bell about cancer patients the three people in blackwater landing that culbeau and his friends had killed who better than a nurse on the onco ward this was farfetched but sachs mentioned it to lucy who pulled out her cell phone and made an emergency call to the phone company whose security department did a downanddirty penregister search of jim bells phone calls there were hundreds to and from lydia shes going to kill him sachs had cried and the two women one with a weapon drawn had burst into the operating room a scene right out of a melodramatic episode of er just as dr weaver was about to make the opening incision lydia had panicked and trying to escape or trying to do what bell had sent her for ripped the oxygen tube from rhymes throat before the two women subdued her from that trauma and because of the anesthetic rhymes lungs had failed dr weaver had revived him but afterward his breathing hadnt been up to par and hed had to go back on the stimulator which was bad enough but worse to rhymes anger and disgust dr weaver refused to perform the operation for at least another six months until his breathing functions were completely normalized hed tried to insist but the surgeon proved to be as mulish as he was sachs sipped more scotch you told roland bell about his cousin rhyme asked she nodded he took it hard said jim was the black sheep but never guessed hed do anything like this hes pretty shaken up by the news she looked northeast look she said out there know what that is trying to follow her eyes rhyme asked whatre you looking at the horizon a cloud an airplane enlighten me sachs the great dismal swamp thats where lake drummond is fascinating he said sarcastically its full of ghosts she added like a tour guide lucy came up and poured some scotch into a paper cup sipped it then made a face its awful tastes like soap she opened a heineken rhyme said it costs eighty dollars a bottle expensive soap then sachs watched garrett as he shoveled corn chips into his mouth then ran into the grass she asked lucy any word from the county on being his foster mom lucy asked then shook her head got rejected the being single part isnt an issue they have a problem with my job cop long hours what do they know rhyme scowled doesnt matter what they know she said what they do is the thing thats important garretts being set up with a family up in hobeth good people i checked them out pretty good sachs didnt doubt that she had but were going on a hike next weekend nearby garrett eased through the grass stalking a specimen when sachs turned back she saw rhyme had been watching her as she gazed at the boy what she asked frowning at his coy expression if you were going to say something to an empty chair sachs what would it be she hesitated for a moment i think ill keep that to myself for the time being rhyme suddenly garrett gave a loud laugh and started running through the grass he was chasing an insect which was oblivious to its pursuer through the dusty air the boy caught up with it and with outstretched arms made a grab for his prey then tumbled to the ground a moment later he was up staring into his cupped hands and walking slowly back to the picnic benches guess what i found he called come show us amelia sachs said i want to see
